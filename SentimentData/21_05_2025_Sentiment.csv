Over the past several weeks, major Ethereum holders known as whales have significantly increased their positions, indicating strong conviction in the asset’s future. These whales, each holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH, have been aggressively accumulating since mid-April, just as Ethereum’s price began a steep climb. This pattern, alongside key technical signals, is raising expectations of a longer-term bullish phase. Whale Accumulation Aligns with Price Breakouts According to analyst Crypto Rover, large Ethereum wallets added over 1.4 million ETH between mid-April and mid-May. Their holdings grew from 15.8 million to more than 17.2 million ETH. This accumulation period closely matches Ethereum’s price rally from around $1,600 to over $3,100.

But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there’s even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE 🔥#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout💹 The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next… pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it’s still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn’t spiked yet, so the setup isn’t sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There’s no way I couldn’t take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv — Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a “twofold rally” from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That’s about 114% higher. He’s confident there’s “no way you won’t take a Dogecoin trade” if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‑and‑shoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that’s capped gains since December’s $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42–$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100–104% jump from today’s price.

Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Emerging as Cycle-Defining Picks",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-500k-ethereum-xrp-and-magacoin-finance-are-emerging-as-cycle-defining-picks/,"Introduction May 2025 is witnessing a sharp rotation of capital as whales and smart money accumulate select tokens. Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this trend, with on-chain data and analyst commentary confirming high-conviction buying. Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is now concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. Institutional confidence is rising as retail investors take profits, and forecasts for May call for an average BTC price of $119,798, with potential highs of $136,239 by month’s end.As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies above $100,000, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking to capture the next wave of upside.

The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and Hashex-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025.Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels.As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Litecoin: Steady Accumulation and Bullish Outlook Litecoin (LTC) is trading near $76.87, with forecasts for May 2025 ranging from $76.87 to $77.58. While not as volatile as some peers, LTC continues to see steady accumulation by long-term holders.As capital rotates toward high-upside opportunities, many are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE as a complementary play for exponential returns. Ethereum: Macro Strength and Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, having rebounded from recent lows and showing strong technical momentum. With Layer 2 growth, DeFi expansion, and ETF speculation, ETH remains a macro leader for the cycle.As Ethereum’s rally matures, smart capital is also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next exponential move.

The Commission’s clarified guidance on compliance mechanisms has sparked renewed confidence among blockchain projects. This regulatory clarity comes on the heels of Asian economic hubs ramping up blockchain adoption to streamline digital identity, finance, and cross-border payments. Within this recalibrated environment, digital finance is shedding its speculative shell and moving toward practical utility. Qubetics , a fast-rising force, is redefining how digital assets interact with real-world economies. As markets reevaluate what defines a “top crypto to buy,” tokens like Qubetics are not merely participating—they are steering the transformation. With its distinctive application in real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics has emerged as a consistent favorite when ranking the top crypto to buy. Qubetics ($TICS) has already gained early traction for directly addressing challenges many established protocols have overlooked. These developments make Qubetics one of the top crypto to buy before the crypto presale concludes. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization at the Right Time While the market fixates on transaction speeds and DeFi interoperability, Qubetics is pioneering a more impactful frontier—Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization. This application enables tokenizing tangible assets like real estate, commodities, or financial instruments onto blockchain ledgers. Qubetics stands apart with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a platform built for global businesses, professionals, and even governments seeking compliant asset digitization. Unlike generalized marketplaces, Qubetics creates a bridge between physical and digital economies. The marketplace is designed to: Enable cross-border trade settlements using tokenized invoices Allow professionals to tokenize service contracts and intellectual property Support small enterprises with compliant debt issuance through digital tokens Facilitate real estate-backed stable asset creation By streamlining tokenization through built-in regulatory protocols and an intuitive IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Qubetics makes complex processes accessible to non-technical entities. This leap positions it as the top crypto to buy for those seeking tokenomics rooted in practical value. Qubetics Token Stats Stage: 35th of the ongoing crypto presale Price: $0.2785 per $TICS Total Tokens Sold: 513M+ Holders: 26,700+ Capital Raised: $17.1M+ Analyst ROI Projections $TICS at $1 post-presale = 258% ROI $TICS at $5 = 1694% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 5284% ROI Without relying on speculation, the growth narrative around Qubetics is underpinned by its ongoing adoption, strong economic model, and increasing relevance in global tokenization policy discussions. Aptos to Host Global Pizza Party Meetup in Palo Alto on May 23 to Celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day Aptos, the high-performance Layer 1 blockchain known for its security and scalability, will co-host a meetup with OnePiece Labs in Palo Alto on May 23, 2025, to celebrate the fifth annual Global Pizza Party by PizzaDAO and mark the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day. This event brings together Web3 developers, enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs, highlighting Aptos’ commitment to fostering blockchain innovation and community. Powered by its Move programming language and modular transaction processing model, Aptos continues to push the limits of throughput, transparency, and user safety on the decentralized frontier. Tron Coin Breakout? Whale Activity Explodes After Golden Cross Tron (TRX) has rallied 11% since the golden cross on, where the SMA50 overtook the SMA100, signaling a bullish shift after January’s bearish death cross. Whale activity surged early May as $1M+ TRX transactions peaked between 07:00–15:00 UTC—prime global market hours—before easing off, hinting at a growing influence from retail traders. Despite reduced whale dominance, TRX continues climbing, hovering around $0.27 with strong support at $0.23. However, momentum indicators suggest overbought conditions, raising the potential for a short-term pullback if price dips below the $0.24–$0.25 range. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters in 2025 The transition from speculative cryptocurrencies to tangible digital assets is accelerating. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is central to this shift. Here’s why: Asset Liquidity: Real estate, fine art, or debt instruments become instantly tradable Regulatory Alignment: Platforms like Qubetics implement compliance-first token design Economic Access: Enables small and mid-size businesses to raise capital without traditional banking Ownership Proof: Digitally notarized contracts increase legal enforceability Programmability: Smart contracts automate dividend payouts and usage rights With $17.1M raised and over 513M $TICS sold, Qubetics is actively proving that tokenized ownership has moved from theory to implementation. This positions it not just as another blockchain startup, but as a foundational layer for the next stage in global finance. Conclusion: Why These Three Are the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 From Qubetics’ powerful asset tokenization infrastructure to Aptos blockchain ecosystem and Tron’s mass-market adoption success, these three projects address different layers of blockchain’s evolution. Their updates, strategic rollouts, and growing traction across sectors reinforce their place as the top crypto to buy in 2025. As blockchain technology enters a new utility-driven era, projects like Qubetics, Aptos, and Tron offer unique propositions tailored to emerging real-world needs. Evaluating long-term value in this sector means identifying those capable of solving meaningful problems—and these three consistently rise to that standard. Those scanning the horizon for the top crypto to buy would be wise to monitor the continuing growth and adoption of these platforms.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , the claim came from Olga Tisen, head of the legal department of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring). Warning for Russians: Crypto Exchanges Are Working With Police Tisen was speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, currently underway at the city’s ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Center. Tisen said that the “anonymity of crypto transfers is a myth.” She claimed that even though Russia has yet to regulate crypto exchanges and brokers, platform operators “disclose all data on the owners of crypto wallets at the request of law enforcement agencies.” The ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Centre, St. Petersburg. (Source: Ekatekat [CC BY-SA 4.0]) In many other countries, regulation requires crypto exchanges to flag suspicious-looking transactions and report these to anti-money laundering agencies. However, in Russia, crypto exchanges have no legal status and are almost completely unregulated. But Tisen suggested that exchanges are pre-empting future efforts to police the sector. As such, she said, they are “openly admitting” to sending customer information “at the request of law enforcement and government agencies.” Tisen added that police do not even need court orders to obtain crypto exchange customer data, “since cryptocurrency transactions are not subject to banking privacy protocols.” The Rosfinmonitoring executive added that “all crypto platforms with offices in Russia” currently “interact with the authorities.” Tisen added that many platforms openly state on their websites that they interact with Russian law enforcement agencies. She added that this practice “complies with international standards.” In addition, Rosfinmonitoring says that it receives data from banks on crypto transactions. The same agency has already asked the banking sector to carefully monitor all crypto-related account activity. The European Union has approved its latest sanctions package against Russia, targeting nearly 200 shadow fleet ships https://t.co/f4mzICAalV — Bloomberg (@business) May 20, 2025 ‘Blockchain Analytics Solution Helping Us Monitor Transactions’ The agency also plans to let commercial banks use its blockchain analytics tool (Transparent Blockchain) to monitor personal bank accounts. Rosfinmonitoring will provide the tool to banks before the end of the year. The agency has already granted several government agencies and overseas anti-money laundering intelligence agencies access to the tool.

Investors are keen to identify which of these digital assets might be on the brink of skyrocketing. This article delves into the specific coins that are poised for substantial growth, offering insights into the potential opportunities ahead. EOS Market Update: Month Surge and Six-Month Gains Amid Week Dip EOS price action over the last month recorded a 22.15% rise, while the six-month change reached 24.77%, indicating a steady upward trend despite notable short-term fluctuations. The recent weekly drop of 11.63% highlights the coin’s characteristic volatility, combining periods of strength with occasional setbacks, as shown in its broader performance history. At present, the coin trades between a support level at $0.41 and a resistance level at $1.01, with a broader range from $0.11 to $1.32 also in view. Indicators such as an RSI near 50 suggest neutrality, while mixed oscillator signals indicate caution. Bulls are present, but recent dips warrant trading ideas focused on short-term consolidation within these key levels. Toncoin: Past Trends and Current Opportunities Over the past month, Toncoin experienced a modest gain of nearly 3%, while the past six months showed a significant decline of around 42%. The price movements illustrate a pattern of volatility, with short-term gains failing to compensate for larger losses. This behavior reflects broader market uncertainties and the reactions of investors to external factors, leading to fluctuating sentiment.

April tariffs triggered global market losses and sharp price increases in US consumer goods. Core inflation eased slightly, but financial analysts and lawmakers warn of long-term economic risks. President Donald Trump claimed the U.S. economy is “roaring,” citing March’s addition of 228,000 jobs. He credited his administration’s economic approach for strengthening the labor market and reviving manufacturing in key industrial states. He emphasized new industrial activity across the Midwest and South, pointing to recent factory openings and domestic hiring. Trump described the data as proof that economic momentum is shifting in America’s favor. Despite the uptick in jobs, official data shows the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Economists link the decline to trade disruptions and weaker consumer activity, highlighting mixed signals for the economy’s overall health.

In a world rapidly reshaped by artificial intelligence, few think as personally about its impact as Manit Parikh. As the Founder of The Binary Holdings , Manit is at the forefront of building digital infrastructure that blends the best of Web2 and Web3 while embedding AI deeply into product design and user experience. Rather than generic chatbots, TBH's vision is for AI companions to learn each user's tastes, routines, and even moods. This ambition echoes a broader tech trend: one analyst predicts that by 2025, our smartphones will function as full-fledged AI assistants, able to perform complex tasks on our behalf and operate like personal assistants in our pockets.Parikh says TBH will deliver that future in emerging markets by blending AI with the company's vast Web3 distribution network. We sat down with Manit to explore his journey, the genesis of Binary Holdings, and how his team uses AI to create hyperpersonalized, behavior-driven platforms that could redefine digital interaction. Q: Can you share a quick background about yourself and what you've been up to lately? Manit: Thank you so much for having me. I'm an economist and lawyer by education—turned investment banker, consultant, and entrepreneur. I started Binary Holdings in August 2020. COVID had just hit, my daughter had just been born, and like many people, I was forced into a digital-first life. That's when I decided to channel all the product-building skills I'd picked up over the years and turn my vision into something tangible. Q: Tell us more about Binary Holdings. What was the starting point, and how has it evolved? Manit: Binary Holdings started with a product called Fando—our OG. It was like TikTok meets Twitter, but designed for sports fans with a loyalty program and marketplace built in. We weren't just building a platform; we were building an economy where users could earn value by engaging. As we grew, Fando became just one part of a larger vision. Today, Binary Holdings is an infrastructure company at the intersection of Web2 and Web3, primarily mobile networks and financial services. We're building verticals that can scale across ecosystems. Q: You've been actively building in AI. Where do you see AI's role in our everyday lives right now? Manit: AI is already embedded in how we live. Think about how we used to use Google—sifting through thousands of results. Now, a single AI response can give you what you need. Whether you're a student, entrepreneur, or creative, we all use AI, from brainstorming to automating personal tasks. Today, maybe AI handles 20% of our digital workload. In five years, it'll be closer to 60–70%. Q: Let's talk about your AI companion. You mentioned it's central to your roadmap. Can you elaborate? Manit: Absolutely. We've created a voice-based AI companion that doesn't feel robotic; it's conversational and context-aware. Unlike static voice AIs, we aim to make it feel like a real assistant. It's voice-based, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent. It adapts based on your tone, mood, and preferences. It can play multiple roles—a therapist, a tutor, a friend, a co-pilot. Take mental health. In the West, you go to therapy. In much of Asia, it's taboo. But what if you could talk to an AI that listens, understands your emotional state, and helps you process your thoughts? We're not trying to replace professionals; instead, we're augmenting the support system. Q: As a builder in the Web3 and AI space, how do you stay ahead of the curve? Manit: I'm not an engineer, but I understand financial and business models. That allows me to integrate AI strategically. We collect massive amounts of behavioral data, not personal data, due to GDPR, but enough to understand patterns. We then use AI to create upstream and downstream' mind maps' of user personas. For example, if you're a fan of LeBron James, we map all related content and products into your digital journey. It's like building an AI around your interests, behavior, and ecosystem. Q: That sounds like serious personalization. Why is hyperpersonalization such a big deal? Manit: Discoverability is the biggest pain point in digital platforms. We can remove that friction by using AI to dynamically change what you see based on your behavior. So instead of you searching, the right product or content finds you. Your screen becomes your mirror. Every time you come back, it's slightly more tuned to you. That's what increases engagement and retention. He chuckles, I genuinely believe we're heading to a point where AI could even know when you're hungry based on patterns, location data, and daily habits. That's where hyperpersonalization is going. Q: What tangible results have you seen from hyperpersonalization so far? Manit: It's incredible that the average time spent on our platforms increased from two or three minutes to almost 10 to 12 minutes daily because of personalization. That's nine additional minutes of engagement. Because people consume more content, they burn through mobile data faster. This means they recharge their plans more frequently, three to four times a month instead of once or twice. This directly translates to increased average revenue per user (ARPU) for our telco and data partners. So now, the partnership makes business sense; it's no longer just a cool tech demo; more so, it's real ROI. Q: What does this mean for users in emerging markets? Manit: Most of our users come from underdeveloped or emerging economies—middle and lower-income groups that make up about 90% of the population. For them, the value they earn through our platforms can feel like a secondary income stream. We take things like going out for dinner or a movie for granted, but for some families, this is a real financial boost. It empowers the already empowered, but more importantly, it uplifts those who live hand-to-mouth. That's meaningful. Q: What are the most untapped opportunities for enterprises with AI right now? Manit: There are three big ones. First, they have their internal data. Many enterprises collect data but don't structure it in sandboxes to study behavior. That's a missed opportunity. Second, AI can help forecast the next five years of their business. It can generate strategic product ideas or analyze competitors, giving product managers a head start and saving the company from investing time and capital in dead ends. Third is true hyper-personalization. Let's take gaming. You buy FIFA, and a million people play the same game. But your PlayStation knows how you play. Why doesn't it adapt the gameplay accordingly? If I'm getting better, the AI should level up, too. This not only enhances user experience but also boosts retention and in-game monetization. Q: AI is powerful but also complex. Given the bureaucratic hurdles enterprises face, how do you see them adopting it? Manit: Great question. Enterprises have their plates full with budget cycles, approvals, and public company disclosures. AI becomes another challenge to stack on top. So when we approach them, we don't ask them to change their entire system. We start a parallel thread about a small integration that proves our value. Then, slowly, they come to us asking what else we can help with. Over 12 to 36 months, our tools become embedded into 95% of their operations, including AI, ML, and automation, all without disrupting their existing ecosystem. Q: With so much happening in AI, what excites you most about the future of AI-native products? Manit: I always say, the AI market isn't a pond—it's the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans combined. What we're seeing now is just scratching the surface. One use case is driving. Say you're on a night drive and tired. The AI companion activates. You choose your mood: 'educational,' ‘business,' or just 'talk.' Maybe you decide to learn a new language during your commute. Since the AI retains your context and adapts, it's far better than static apps. It's a therapist, a study buddy, and a voice coach—all in one. But with that growth will come consolidation. We're in a collaborative economy now, not a monopolistic one. If we don't collaborate, we'll all get pulled back. And as AI becomes mainstream, it'll attract regulation, just like crypto did. Regulation will separate the real players from the opportunistic ones. Those who build compliant, ethical AI will scale. The rest? They'll fade. As the digital world leans ever more into AI, Manit Parikh and Binary Holdings are not just following trends but shaping them. With personalization as their north star and infrastructure as their foundation, their vision offers a glimpse into what the next generation of platforms could look like, including intuitive, adaptive, and deeply human.

LINK price has recorded a high correlation with Bitcoin price YTD, which is almost entering a parabolic bullish phase. The gradual Bitcoin (BTC) price rise in the past few weeks, has significantly influenced the wider altcoin market led by Chainlink (LINK). The highly anticipated crypto summer of 2025 has seen the overall capital inflow to the altcoin market experience a sharp uptick. Moreover, an imminent reversal and fall of Bitcoin dominance in the coming months will trigger a sustained altseason, fueled by FOMO traders. Chainlink Network Growth Outlook The Chainlink network has received significant adoption in the past few months amid the mainstream adoption of digital assets and web3 protocols. Furthermore, the Chainlink network enables DeFi protocols to provide reliable services in an interoperable ecosystem. Earlier this week, the Chainlink network announced a strategic integration with the Solana (SOL) network to enable its DeFi ecosystem to access Chainlink’s CCIP infrastructure. On Tuesday, several DeFi protocols announced a strategic integration with the Chainlink network to access its CCIP infrastructure. Some of the notable integrations include Zeus Network, Liquity Protocol, and Shift RWA. The continued adoption of the Chainlink products by institutional investors has bolstered the LINK token, which is used to reward node operators and data providers. Midterm Targets for LINK Price The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.7 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $604 million, has been attempting to recover from last week’s 10 per decline. In the daily timeframe, LINK price has established a rising trend since April 9, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. Moreover, the LINK price has already broken out and retested a falling wedge pattern established in the first quarter of 2025. In the four-hour timeframe, LINK price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, coupled with a rising divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . As a result, LINK price is well positioned to rally towards the next short term target around $19.8.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 23:52:27

But while these large-caps fight for renewed upside, one emerging name is gaining traction among serious traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Without needing flashy announcements or trend cycles, it’s steadily cementing itself as one of the most talked-about contenders in the 2025 lineup — and buyers are beginning to realize that this project is built to lead, not chase. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Bold Positioning, Relentless Confidence, and Real Market Presence MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising for one clear reason — it refuses to play small. In a sea of short-term meme projects and recycled narratives, this coin is commanding attention through consistent strength, focused branding, and clear long-term potential. Analysts are watching closely as sentiment consolidates around what many now view as a high-conviction opportunity for early entry . It is not just hype — it is becoming a headline project with all the traits of a breakout altcoin designed for this cycle, not the last one. Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity and Airdrops Keep Bulls in Control Cardano is showing solid structure on higher timeframes, fueled by whale buying and new layer integrations. With ADA hovering just below key resistance, analysts are forecasting a breakout toward $1.32 — assuming the recent momentum continues. Speculation around the upcoming Midnight airdrop is also fueling accumulation. If ADA clears the $0.80 barrier, upside movement could accelerate heading into June. Sui (SUI): Technical Breakout in Play With Strong Ecosystem Support SUI remains a trader favorite in the Layer-1 space, offering clean structure and growing DeFi traction. The token is consolidating near recent highs and is flashing early breakout signals, with analyst targets ranging from $6 to $7.70 . Sui’s ability to sustain user activity while attracting new DEX protocols makes it one of the more structurally solid plays heading into the second half of Q2. Polkadot (DOT): Undervalued Performer With Cross-Chain Advantage DOT is quietly climbing back into view, with multi-chain interoperability and renewed builder interest supporting its rise. Currently trending under key resistance, price targets for this quarter range from $1.05 to $1.30 . If market sentiment shifts in favor of legacy Layer-1s, DOT could reprice quickly — especially with increased attention on cross-chain infrastructure and parachain expansion. Final Thoughts Cardano is climbing on whales and incentives. Sui is technically primed and DeFi-proven. Polkadot is setting up as the quiet Layer-1 rotation pick. But while all three fight to reclaim past highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is defining its own lane — and rapidly becoming one of the most confident altcoin bets of the year . In a market overflowing with short-lived speculation, this project is shaping up to be the coin built for staying power — and more investors are beginning to treat it that way.

While established players like Monero (XMR) keep their privacy edge and meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) catch attention with quick price surges, newer projects are focused on creating lasting value. Web3 ai stands apart by offering a clear, structured roadmap for growth, aligning product development with investor opportunities. With upcoming releases for AI tools, mobile integration, and exchange listings, Web3 ai offers something unique. For those on the lookout for high-return crypto investments, this project presents an exciting, timely opportunity. What Could Push Web3 ai to the $1 Mark? Web3 ai is quickly becoming a top contender for the best crypto investment in 2025, and its momentum is impossible to ignore. With more than $4.3 million raised in just a matter of days, it’s clear that investors are already catching on. Currently in presale stage 5 at $0.000365 per token, the presale price will soon rise to $0.005242, meaning early investors could see returns of up to 1,747% before $WAI even hits public exchanges. What’s fueling the buzz? It’s not just the numbers, it’s the impressive roadmap Web3 ai has laid out. The team is rolling out a suite of powerful tools, including an AI trading assistant, ROI prediction engine, staking dashboards, and cross-platform API integrations. Plus, a mobile app is already in the works and is set for release just months after launch. But that’s not all, wallet and social media integrations, developer SDK access, and even plans for centralised exchange listings are on the horizon. As each milestone is hit, the demand for $WAI only grows, driving up the token’s utility and value. With a capped supply and a rapidly climbing presale price, the window of opportunity is shrinking fast. For those who want to maximise returns in 2025, now is the time to act before this presale phase ends. Monero’s Unmatched Privacy: A 2025 Standout Monero (XMR) continues to lead the charge when it comes to privacy in the crypto space. Thanks to its use of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions, Monero ensures total anonymity for users, from who’s sending the funds to who’s receiving them, and even the transaction amounts. This unwavering commitment to privacy has earned Monero a strong following among those who prioritise financial confidentiality. As concerns around surveillance and financial tracking continue to rise, Monero’s privacy-first approach is more relevant than ever. It’s not just about concealing identities; it’s about making it nearly impossible to trace any transactions. This has kept the interest high among users who want complete control over their financial history. With the growing importance of data protection, Monero’s privacy isn’t just an added feature; it’s a core principle driving its adoption. While other projects dabble with partial privacy, Monero delivers full anonymity by default, giving users exactly what they want: total transactional privacy. What’s Next After SHIB’s Gain? Shiba Inu (SHIB) recorded an impressive 14.48% jump this week, marking its best performance since late 2024. This surge came after a period of consolidation where SHIB found solid support at the $0.00001107 level. As buyers regained confidence, momentum picked up, and the token ended the week around $0.00001417. This upward trend indicates a shift in market sentiment and growing interest from investors. However, despite this recent gain, SHIB is still below its previous peak of $0.0000297, leaving plenty of room for potential growth. The next key resistance level to watch is around $0.00001698, which traders are eyeing closely. If SHIB can maintain this momentum, with rising trading volume and continued buyer interest, there’s a real chance the token could build on this positive trend in the coming weeks. All signs point to a recovery, and SHIB’s potential for further gains remains strong. Final Thoughts In a crypto landscape where trends come and go, true progress stands out. Monero (XMR) maintains its dominance in privacy, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows how market sentiment can fuel huge gains. But Web3 ai is carving its path, offering a solid, utility-driven roadmap with clear milestones. With a range of AI tools, a mobile app launch, and potential exchange listings lined up, Web3 ai is building a strong foundation before any major price jumps. As the AI crypto presale phases wind down and development picks up speed, it’s not just about speculation, it’s about tangible progress. For those aiming for top returns, catching this growth at the right time could be key.

This close, recorded just above the red horizontal line at $103,000, has introduced confidence in the continuation of the uptrend, and points to the bulls still in control of Bitcoin’s price action. Bitcoin Weekly Closes Above Range – First Bullish Step Current Bitcoin price action shows that bullish investors and buyers are still controlling the momentum behind the largest cryptocurrency and, in essence, the rest of the crypto market. Notably, Bitcoin initially experienced a brief surge to nearly $107,000 over the weekend before retreating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top This price movement was followed by a dip to around $102,000, with the back-and-forth most likely being influenced by factors such as Moody’s downgrade of U.S. debt and investor reactions to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, in an interesting note, the BTC price managed to close above the $103,000 range during this first move to $107,000, which is very important in terms of technical analysis going forward. This sentiment is echoed by crypto analyst Rekt Capital on social media platform X, who pointed out the next step that might play out for Bitcoin. Post-Breakout Retest Underway, Says Rekt Capital The $104,000 price level had previously acted as a stubborn ceiling throughout much of the recent Bitcoin price consolidation between $102,000 and $104,000 since May 9. However, since breaking above this level, the ensuing price action has seen the Bitcoin price retracing towards this level after another rejection at $107,000. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the dip following the $107,000 rejection isn’t necessarily bearish. Instead, it could be part of a post-breakout retest, a pattern often seen in strong bullish structures. If this retest successfully confirms the former resistance as new support, BTC could set the stage for a breakout into fresh all-time highs. As shown in the 1W Bitcoin price chart above, the red resistance level is very close to Bitcoin’s January 2025 all-time high around $108,780. Furthermore, the chart shows that the recent breakout above the $90,000–$103,000 zone appears to mirror a pattern of Bitcoin’s breakout after a consolidation move, after another bounce from a low. In this case, the bounce occurred at the $75,000 low in early April. If Bitcoin does rebound with enough trading volume around $104,000, this could provide the much-needed momentum for a move above $107,000 and finally above $108,700 again. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,555, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart. The bearish reversal signal suggests that bullish momentum is waning even though an asset’s price is moving higher or sideways. Says Bluntz, “There’s a daily BTC bear div brewing here if it closes red by [today]. It’s unfortunate that it has appeared before fresh all-time highs, but it’s the first one since last year. Be careful with longs in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,546. Turning to gold, the analyst believes that the precious metal is poised to ignite a rally to a new all-time high after completing an ABC corrective wave. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states a bullish asset will continue its uptrend after an ABC correction. The trader shares a chart suggesting that gold will rally to a new record high of $3,600. “Gold gathering steam for the next leg up here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, gold is worth $3,221. As for the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), Bluntz predicts that the altcoin would dip to around $0.00008 before exploding to $0.00018. “Looks like FLOKI is one of the few memes with a clear impulse five-wave rise from the lows on the daily, indicating the low is in. Would be very interested in bidding pullbacks around the 50 fib if given. Have always had a soft spot for this one.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000098.

While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects primed to outperform as capital rotates outward.From established names like XRP and Ethereum to surging contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Aptos, a handful of strategic plays are positioning themselves for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. Here are four breakout candidates that could capture serious momentum in Bitcoin’s shadow. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA’s $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x–40x returns—and some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continuesWhat sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure that’s attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges . In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA’s combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. Solana’s Technical Setup and Whale Accumulation Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $171.54, consolidating within a strong support and resistance range between $158 and $175. Analysts highlight a long-term Cup and Handle pattern forming, with a breakout above $175 potentially opening the door to $183 and beyond. SOL’s fundamentals remain robust, and smart money continues to accumulate, but as capital rotates, many investors are also looking to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper growth while SOL trades sideways. Ethereum’s Bullish Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with ETH above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern.If ETH can break above $2,700, analysts see a move to $2,750–$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. As Ethereum’s rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. Aptos: Quiet Accumulation and Upside Potential Aptos (APT) is consolidating after a recent event-driven rally, with analysts forecasting a price range of $5.13 to $8.81 for May 2025. While APT’s tech-first approach has strong backing, some early investors are rotating out profits in favor of lower-cap exposure.MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefitting from that shift, with many short-term speculators taking gains from APT and placing them into MAGA, where exponential upside still remains. XRP’s Futures Launch and the $100 Question XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15–$30 possible if key catalysts align.While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Solana, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the tone for a powerful 2025, the spotlight is shifting to altcoins with strategic positioning and high-growth potential. Solana and XRP offer credibility and scale, while MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early entry with outsized return potential. Investors rotating now—before listings finalize and media attention catches up—may be best positioned to benefit from the explosive upside that defines every crypto supercycle.

This milestone will unveil the complete lineup of 20 crypto exchanges where BDAG will debut. Originally set for 10 exchanges, the expansion to 20 signals the growing confidence in the project. Buyers now have a chance to lock in BDAG at $0.0020 before listings go live. With over $258 million raised so far, this launch could reshape the Layer-1 market. The first five listings are already public: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. These platforms give an early glimpse of BlockDAG ’s broad market reach. The full list remains under wraps until the GO LIVE day, which adds suspense and urgency. More than just a listing event, this date marks the final chance to buy BDAG at a reduced price before its rates jump. For many, June 13 signals more than just a listing update, it’s a defining moment for 2025’s best performing crypto. BlockDAG GO LIVE Reveal: Strategic Importance of June 13 For anyone watching the crypto presale closely, June 13 holds serious weight. It marks the end of BlockDAG’s frozen pricing period at $0.0020. That fixed price offers early supporters a rare entry before listings push the coin into open market volatility. With the listing price set at $0.05, this entry window represents unmatched value. Returns since Batch 1 now sit at 2,520%, and more than 20.9 billion BDAG coins have been sold. As the current Batch 28 trades at $0.0262, the opportunity to still buy at $0.0020 before June 13 creates a notable advantage for those seeking gains on the best performing crypto of the year. This deadline is also pushing activity higher as more buyers aim to lock in their coins before the GO LIVE reveal reshapes BDAG’s pricing forever. Why This Exchange Launch Sets a New Standard Unlike typical launches, BlockDAG’s GO LIVE reveal showcases real progress, strategic alignment, and global exchange presence. With 20 confirmed exchanges, BDAG is not just appearing in the market, it’s entering with strength. Each listing brings access to broader audiences, liquidity, and exposure that many new projects never achieve this early. BlockDAG is also following through on its delivery roadmap. Miners have started receiving their X Series mining equipment orders, underlining the project’s commitment to real-world results. This kind of follow-through supports BlockDAG’s appeal as a long-term player in the space. Presale excitement continues to grow, thanks to the Buyer Battles and referral rewards program. These efforts keep the community engaged and encourage more users to participate before the deadline. As June 13 draws closer, BlockDAG looks increasingly like the best performing crypto entering the market this year. In Summary Mark June 13 on the calendar. It will be one of the most important moments of the year for anyone eyeing the best performing crypto before launch. BlockDAG’s GO LIVE reveal will confirm 20 exchange listings and finalize the $0.0020 entry price period. With over $258 million raised, over 20.9 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a standout in 2025. Once the listings are live, prices will likely react quickly. Until then, the opportunity to get in at a frozen price still stands. This is one presale that deserves full attention before June 13 resets the market dynamics.

Some are introducing new tools, expanding partnerships, or leveraging cross-chain solutions to grow their networks. These moves aren’t just about marketing hype; each coin here shows signs of actual traction. Those tracking the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 will find this mix particularly engaging. The list features projects tied to AI, multichain access, and infrastructure development, offering a broad view of where value is forming. With Unstaked’s rollout plan, Cosmos expanding Ethereum access, and Sui bringing Bitcoin into DeFi, these assets are carving out strong narratives. Some launch major initiatives, while others aim to rebound after market dips. Every pick on this list presents a setup worth noting right now. 1. Unstaked: AI Utilities That Deliver Real Results Unstaked has been gathering momentum for its hands-on AI approach. The platform allows users to run AI agents that manage tasks like handling community posts and automating responses on Telegram and X. These aren’t inactive features; they’re judged by what they achieve, and rewards are based on their work. This system, named Proof of Intelligence, promotes active use instead of passive holding. Every interaction is stored transparently on-chain. With 60% of tokens offered publicly and no allocations for private rounds or VC parties, it gives broader access to early participants. Priced at $0.009267 in stage 13 and targeting a launch price of $0.1819, it reflects a possible ROI of 2700%. There’s also a $1 million prize pool campaign underway. Anyone purchasing at least $100 in $UNSD and completing social steps can enter to win $50,000, 20 winners in total. So far, the presale has raised $6.3 million, with $2 million collected in just two days. While some mention the platform has live agents, it’s important to clarify that these tools will only activate once the presale wraps up and the platform goes live. With a working model, strong interest, and transparent metrics, Unstaked deserves its place among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 2. Sui: Bitcoin Utility and Expanding Features Sui has been pushing forward technically by linking Bitcoin-backed tokens into its ecosystem. Through a tie-up with Bitlayer, Peg-BTC (YBTC) can now be used within Sui’s DeFi framework, allowing BTC holders to earn through the platform. It also teamed up with 21Shares to support real-world asset applications. On top of that, Sui just crossed 8 million new wallet holders this month, which points to rising traction. With its current price near $1.85, down slightly for the day but up nearly 70% in a month, SUI still looks strong. Analysts believe the asset could move toward $6 if this pace holds. The addition of Axelar enables wider dApp development across chains. Thanks to fresh features and cross-chain potential, Sui earns a place on the list of fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 3. Cosmos (ATOM): Enhancing Access and Developer Reach Cosmos has made several updates that support adoption. It was just added to Bitbank, a top exchange in Japan, with zero trading fees during launch. That could draw new trading volume from Asia. But more importantly, Cosmos rolled out IBC v2, which improves how users and developers interact with Ethereum rollups. It makes multi-chain work smoother and cheaper, key for future growth. ATOM is priced around $4.90, with short-term charts hinting a drop toward $4.50 by May 18. However, projections for later this year point to a bounce to $6.80. With improved cross-chain tools and increased exchange access, Cosmos is set to stay on the watchlists of those looking into the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Development Growth Despite ETF Delay Polkadot has seen mixed sentiment recently after the U.S. SEC delayed its decision on a DOT ETF proposal from 21Shares. This pause caused a slide below $5, and the price currently sits at $4.82, still struggling to break the $5.30 ceiling. Forecasts suggest a short-term dip to $4.45, with potential for a slow rise back to $5.15 later this year. But behind the scenes, development remains active. OpenZeppelin confirmed smart contract compatibility with Polkadot, which opens the door for more dApps on the chain. While prices are soft for now, continued work on developer tools helps Polkadot stay competitive. Its evolving ecosystem keeps it in talks among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025, especially if ETF updates go positive. Final Thoughts! Momentum is forming across these projects. Sui is growing with Bitcoin integration and asset tokenisation, Cosmos is unlocking better Ethereum rollup access, and Polkadot keeps adding dev tools while waiting on ETF clarity. Yet Unstaked remains a standout, combining performance-based AI tools, a strong $6.3 million presale, and an open supply model without outside allocations. Anyone evaluating the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 should keep these four in sight. Sui, Cosmos, and Polkadot all offer strong technical moves, while Unstaked adds an upcoming utility layer tied to real activity. With the launch still ahead, Unstaked also brings a rare entry chance before full rollout. These picks represent some of the sharpest plays in today’s market trends.

Experts warn that this blind spot could have serious consequences for Silicon Valley and the broader digital economy. Allianz Trade, an intelligence firm that tracks global trade risks, published a report on Tuesday based on a survey of 4,500 companies worldwide. It aimed to measure the impact of rising trade tensions and warned that a focus on the United States’ trillion-dollar goods deficit threatens to overlook the fastest-growing part of global trade, the “invisible exports” of financial and digital services. Though tracking these services is challenging, the report cites estimates showing a US digital trade surplus of at least $600 billion, including digital advertising, video streaming, cloud platforms, and online payment services. Digital surplus by firm (USD bn). Source: Allianz Trade Global Survey 2025 The report calls this “hidden trade immense”. It says these invisible exports have greatly outpaced the growth of goods exports over the past two decades, yet they do not show up in standard trade statistics. Allianz Trade warns that if Washington does not “rethink trade policy and narratives” to begin tracking these services more closely, it could undermine one of America’s innovative companies and massive data infrastructure, just as the president is negotiating deals with much of the world. The report stresses that overlooking this trade could leave US firms exposed to foreign retaliation. Furthermore, US digital exports now make up about 3.6% of all trade worldwide and continue to grow quickly. These unseen exchanges add to US trade revenues without filling any container ships. In today’s economy, routers and data centers are as crucial as ports and factories for keeping America in a leading position. Yet, President Trump’s current plan requires countries hit by his reciprocal tariffs to strike a deal by July 8, a deadline he admits may not allow talks with every partner. US trade partners are already exploring tariffs or taxes on digital services Experts agree that if these measures become permanent, they might damage the US tech industry and even split the internet by forcing companies to tailor their services to different regions. Jovan Kurbalija, a former diplomat and head of the DiploFoundation, warned in an April blog that a shift into the digital domain could carry “far-reaching consequences” for Silicon Valley and the global digital economy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed to the Financial Times last month that she is planning countermeasures if talks between the European Union and the United States fail. Those could include a tax on digital advertising revenues aimed at firms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, as well as tariffs on services traded across the entire EU market. Kurbalija said that beyond Europe, Trump’s goods tariffs give other countries both moral and tactical reasons to fast-track digital taxes under the banner of “reclaiming revenue from foreign tech ‘free riders.’” Half of US firms considering more investment in China In an opinion piece , Neal K. Shah, CEO of CareYaya Health Technologies, warned that “tariffs on digital services would directly reduce revenues for American tech companies.” He said a full-blown digital trade war could harm the Internet’s infrastructure and force firms to operate “parallel digital universes with incompatible standards.” Shah said that means higher costs, less market access, and slower growth for startups and innovators. He added that splitting the digital world could end globally scalable platforms, scare away investors, and cut world GDP by up to 5% over the next decade. Trump’s answer to these threats remains more tariffs. He has said that “only America should be allowed to tax American firms,” Reuters reported . In February, he issued a memo ordering research into how to respond to digital service taxes, including new duties. Yet Allianz Trade found that many US firms are not returning operations home. Instead, half of those surveyed are weighing increased investments in China, while only eight percent plan cuts there. Others said they are rerouting supply chains to Southeast Asia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Latin America. Experts like Bertin Martens of the Brussels think tank Bruegel say imposing digital services tariffs is hard in practice. Laws barring measures against platforms with a significant local presence require detailed user data. Some see open-source technology as the clear winner if tariffs force firms to seek alternatives that sidestep trade barriers.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Could Lead 2025’s Political Crypto Boom",https://thecoinrise.com/500-to-7-figures-magacoin-finance-bitcoin-and-xrp-could-lead-2025s-political-crypto-boom/,"Introduction With Bitcoin regaining momentum, XRP drawing institutional flows, and Ethereum breaking out above key resistance, investors are zooming in on a select group of tokens set for major upside in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge—not just for its explosive growth potential, but because Stage 8 is now live and analysts are calling it a high-conviction 40x altcoin candidate. Kaspa (KAS) is also catching attention as its ecosystem expands, but the spotlight is squarely on MAGA, BTC, XRP, and ETH as the market pivots toward political and narrative-driven plays. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 nears completion, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x–40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. With each stage filling rapidly and community growth accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the final major entry before the price curve steepens and Stage 9 begins. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Political Narrative Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and now less than 7% below the $100,000 mark. On-chain data shows demand rebounding, with major wallets accumulating as US-based ETF inflows stabilize. While institutional conviction is still ramping up, analysts see a plausible summer rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As the political narrative heats up in the US and abroad, Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge and a political statement is drawing new capital—while early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from this shift in sentiment. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading around $2.39, with forecasts for late 2025 targeting $2.65–$2.80 if current momentum holds. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while whale accumulation continues to rise. Legal clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Kaspa: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Growth Kaspa (KAS) is trading at $0.097, showing resilience after its recent hard fork and ecosystem expansion. Analysts predict moderate gains this year, with a possible move to $0.15 if broader market conditions remain favorable. Kaspa’s unique blockDAG architecture and active developer community are positioning it as a standout proof-of-work contender, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the more aggressive play. Ethereum: Breaking Out With Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with a target range of $2,750–$2,900 for May and projections as high as $5,925 by year-end. Institutional adoption, Layer 2 advancements, and DeFi growth are all strengthening ETH’s long-term outlook. As Ethereum’s rally matures, smart capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of exponential returns. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly complete, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Gox claims to build Bitcoin treasury",https://cointelegraph.com/news/strive-targets-75000-bitcoin-in-mt-gox-claims?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive is looking to build its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing distressed Bitcoin claims at a discount, starting with claims tied to 75,000 Bitcoin at the bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Strive said in a May 20 regulatory filing that it partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target claims to Bitcoin ( BTC ) that have received definitive legal rulings but are still awaiting distribution. The company said buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities — which is expected to be completed sometime mid this year. Strive hasn’t disclosed any Bitcoin holdings but claims it will face fewer restrictions on purchasing Bitcoin than companies going public through Special Purpose Acquisition Company mergers. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger compared with a SPAC merger. Source: Strive Strive said it would need shareholder approval to pursue Mt. Gox claims. The company said it intends to lodge a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to outline the full terms of the proposed transaction. A proxy statement would then be sent to shareholders to seek their approval. Strive would need to obtain shareholder approval relatively soon, as Mt. Gox is expected to fully repay its creditors by Oct. 31. The Japan-based Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange before it collapsed in 2014 from a security breach that resulted in the theft of approximately 750,000 Bitcoin . Strive’s pivot to become a Bitcoin treasury company reflects a broader industry trend as more firms look to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term strategic asset. Related: Bitcoin ETFs bought 6x more than BTC miners produced last week Twenty One Capital is another newly launched Bitcoin treasury firm that has received backing from the likes of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. The Jack Mallers-led firm plans to launch with 42,000 Bitcoin once it completes a blank-check merger with Cantor Equity Partners. Asset Entities shares rise again on Mt. Gox plans Asset Entities (ASST), a social media marketing company that Strive announced it would merge with on May 7 to create a Bitcoin investment company, has seen its shares close May 20 trading up 18.2% to $7.74, Google Finance data shows. The latest share price bump brings its market cap to $122.1 million, and ASST is now up 1,170% since Strive announced its merger plan. Strive is expected to own 94.2% of the combined entity once the reverse merger is complete, while Asset Entities will hold the remaining 5.8%. The merged companies will be named Strive and Asset Entities, and will still trade under the ASST ticker.

With XRP gaining momentum from increasing institutional adoption and clearer regulatory standing, analysts are forecasting a potential 10x to 20x upside as global payment use cases expand. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, still under the radar but rapidly climbing, offers early entry into what many believe is the next big crypto before the 2025 bull run peaks. Investors who participate in Phase 4 of the Mutuum Finance presale can look forward to reaping 140% returns when the token goes public, with a guaranteed launch price of $0.06. To date, the presale has generated more than $8.9 million and has attracted over 11,000 holders, with Phase 4 being more than 95% sold. Together, these two tokens represent a unique blend of established credibility and untapped growth potential, making them standout choices for those asking what crypto to buy now before the next wave of gains hits. Over $8.9 Million Raised by over 11,000 Adopters The presale of Mutuum Finance continues to rise to greater heights. Now in Phase 4, the token costs $0.025 and will appreciate in value. As the presale progresses to Phase 5, the token price will appreciate to $0.03, earning current investors an immediate 20% gain. With an expected launch cost of $0.06, the profit potential keeps mounting. Crypto experts have already branded MUTM as among the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the year. Supported by over $8.9 million in backing and over 11,000 users, Mutuum Finance is poised to take off. To help create a more social atmosphere, Mutuum Finance has added a leaderboard showing the top 50 token holders in real time. Users with a lot of tokens are rewarded with bonus coins, which brings competition to the platform and motivates users to keep their tokens for a long period. It also promotes better interaction among the main supporters of the project. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is developing a completely collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Its overcollateralized design prioritizes price stability, sidestepping risks associated with algorithmic stablecoins. The application is built on open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, establishing a firm foundation of security and trust, institutional adoption drivers. Smart Tokenomics with a Long-Term Vision One of the most wonderful aspects of working with Mutuum Finance is its Buy-and-Distribute feature, and it does so by purchasing tokens from the public market and redistributing the same among stakers. It benefits the general user interaction and sustains the tokenomics of the project through supply management and rewarding the long-term investors on a consistent basis. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Rewards To further involve its user community, Mutuum Finance gamifies the process with a top 50 token holder leaderboard, who also earn additional MUTM tokens. There is also an ongoing $100,000 giveaway, where ten lucky winners will be awarded $10,000 in tokens each. The company also has a referral scheme for rewarding users for increasing the community organically and through grassroots channels. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big breakout in crypto. With over $8.9 million raised and more than 11,000 early adopters, Mutuum Finance is rapidly approaching a sell-out in Phase 4 of its presale, now over 95% complete. The current price of $0.025 is set to jump to $0.03 in the next phase, offering an instant 20% gain for new buyers. Secure your position now before prices rise again and the presale closes for good, because by the time the crowd catches on, it’ll already be too late.

But while Dogecoin is popular, a new project called Ruvi AI is making waves in the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) space by combining these two. Beyond its innovation, Ruvi AI is an investment opportunity you can’t ignore. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a platform that brings together AI’s problem solving and the blockchain’s security and transparency. It’s for industries like healthcare, finance and logistics where there’s a need for better data analysis and decision making tools. Ruvi AI enhances these processes, optimizes workflows and delivers insights. A big milestone for Ruvi AI is the release of its Beta platform , where businesses and users can test its real world applications. Unlike many projects in the tech world that promise more than they can deliver, Ruvi AI is already showing its capabilities. Also Ruvi AI has announced that it has secured its first exchange listing , so its token will be publicly tradable. This is just the beginning as the team works to get more exchange partnerships to make it accessible to users and investors. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success Ruvi AI presale has been a huge success, Phase 1 sold out in just 2 weeks. During this phase early investors could buy tokens for only $0.01 , the price went up to $0.015 in Phase 2 . Market predictions say Ruvi AI tokens could hit $1 soon after listing. For investors this means an opportunity to buy tokens at a heavily discounted price before they potentially go exponential. Rewarding Commitment with Bonuses For early investors Ruvi AI offers incentives through its VIP rewards system , where token bonuses increase as you go up the more tokens you hold. This rewards structure is designed to maximize returns for those who show commitment.

While XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE.With Stage 8 now live and inflows surging, traders from across the ecosystem—including XRP and Solana holders—are pivoting toward what’s now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Holding Above $105K Bitcoin is holding strong at $105,941, up 2.8% in the last 24 hours and approaching new all-time highs. Institutional inflows are at record levels, with $6.9 billion entering U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past three weeks. Major corporate buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have added thousands of BTC to their treasuries, signaling growing confidence in Bitcoin as a macro asset. As BTC consolidates above $105K, capital is flowing into breakout altcoins—MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the top of that list for traders seeking the next 10,000% run. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE: The #1 Breakout Entry of the Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching fire across presale trackers and trader dashboards. With Stage 8 nearly full, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007, analysts are projecting up to 50x returns as listings approach. Its scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—sets it apart from typical meme coins.As capital rotates from majors, MAGA’s structure, community-first strategy, and strong early-stage momentum are making it the most-watched presale of 2025. For those seeking exponential upside, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Futures Launch and Institutional Surge XRP is trading at $2.36 as of May 20, 2025, with the CME Group’s launch of XRP futures marking a major milestone for institutional adoption. While short-term volatility is possible, analysts see $5–$10 as the next major target, and some project $20+ if ETF approval and global settlement use cases accelerate.As institutional flows grow, many XRP holders are also rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper upside during this cycle. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with three new wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days.Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, with bullish technicals supporting further upside. As Solana’s rally matures, traders are diversifying into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum: Quiet Build-Up and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With Layer 2 upgrades, DeFi growth, and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750–$2,900 in the coming months.As Ethereum’s rally consolidates, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting investors seeking the next explosive move. TRON: Steady Growth Amid Market Rotation TRON (TRX) is holding at $0.124, maintaining steady growth as network activity remains robust. While not as headline-grabbing as some rivals, TRX’s consistent throughput and low fees make it a favorite in payment corridors.As speculative capital rotates, many TRX holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper early-stage upside. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Final Thoughts Bitcoin is steady at the top, XRP is gaining institutional exposure, and Solana and Ethereum are showing technical strength. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is building real pressure just beneath the surface. With Stage 8 nearly full, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year.The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction.

44877826,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=731657,1747789278,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44877826.jpeg,Crypto’s high price: The global kidnapping crisis targeting digital wealth,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cryptos-high-price-the-global-kidnapping-crisis-targeting-digital-wealth/,"Earlier this month, in a leafy suburb of Paris, a young woman and her toddler daughter were violently attacked and nearly abducted. The alleged motive? Her family’s cryptocurrency fortune . In a chilling new reality, digital wealth is no longer just vulnerable to hackers—it’s putting lives on the line in the physical world. Crypto owners are being kidnapped , tortured, and extorted across the globe. From France and India to Latin America and Nigeria, these incidents are rising with alarming frequency as criminals adapt their tactics to pursue a new high-value target: anyone visibly successful in the digital asset space. Crypto is providing criminals with a new type of target Crypto’s allure has always been its promise of autonomy, borderless wealth, and anonymity. However, that autonomy is becoming a liability for individuals who have struck it big. Unlike a bank account that requires bureaucratic steps to access, crypto wallets can be emptied in minutes—under duress. Michael Lyons , an anti-money laundering attorney at Clifford Chance, concurs. He holds, “Crypto transactions are more likely to escape the level of scrutiny applied to traditional banking systems.” In India, a Bengaluru businessman was lured to Lucknow under the pretext of a business deal, only to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of 10 million rupees. In Latin America, kidnapping crews with cartel ties have begun demanding ransom not in cash but in Bitcoin, often using privacy-enhanced coins like Monero to mask their tracks. One Venezuelan crypto trader, who asked not to be named, described being tailed for weeks before armed men intercepted him outside a mall. “They knew what I drove, where I lived, even which exchange I used,” he said. “They held my family until I transferred the funds.” Kidnappers have gone digital The rules of engagement have shifted. Where old-school ransom schemes might involve anonymous wire transfers or suitcases of cash, today’s criminal outfits are leveraging the technologies that gave rise to crypto: decentralization, pseudonymity, and global reach. According to a report by BankInfoSecurity , criminals are increasingly demanding ransom in Monero and other privacy coins because they are harder to trace than Bitcoin. “The privacy coins make the laundering process easier for them, so they obviously prefer it, but they will still accept BTC,” said a cybercrime analyst quoted in the article. In some instances, criminals are no longer waiting for the wealthy to become careless. They’re using facial recognition, blockchain transaction tracking tools, and even SIM swapping attacks to isolate targets. The lines between cybercrime and street-level violence have blurred. The Interpol has also reported increased coordination between cybercrime units and traditional law enforcement as crypto crimes cross national borders. These cases have created a new breed of hybrid criminals employing a mix of digital sophistication and brutal coercion to their nefarious ends. The crypto industry is taking notice Security, once an afterthought in the fast-moving world of crypto, has become a front-and-center concern. Executives and influencers are hiring private security firms, sometimes staffed with former intelligence operatives. High-net-worth individuals are relocating, installing panic buttons, and switching to encrypted communications. Amid a spate of kidnappings and the Coinbase hack, increasingly large crypto holders are hiring private security firms. Some investors have opted for a lower profile. They now conduct meetings virtually, scrub their social media of luxury photos, and use pseudonyms even within crypto communities. This stance is a far cry from the early days of crypto culture—where flexing wealth was part of the brand. Today, discretion is survival. Meanwhile, exchanges and wallet providers are reevaluating their user education practices. Physical security awareness campaigns now supplement tutorials on setting up hardware wallets and using multi-signature authentication. All these initiatives show that while a user’s seed phrase is important, so is their situational awareness. Combating crypto crime requires understanding that air-gapping your wallet is unhelpful if you broadcast your wealth through social media and other means. Law enforcement is playing catch-up While the threats are global, the responses have been fragmented. Law enforcement agencies often lack the technical know-how to investigate crimes involving digital assets. Jurisdictional challenges complicate matters: when a ransom is paid in France and funneled through wallets in Panama, who has authority? Some progress is being made. INTERPOL has launched a Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre to address transnational financial threats, including crypto-related ones. However, international coordination remains a major hurdle. In the U.S., the Department of Justice has stepped up crypto training for its cybercrime units and partnered with blockchain analytics firms to trace illicit transactions. However, experts say the lag between policy formulation and technological evolution is widening. There is also debate about whether crypto platforms should shoulder more responsibility. Some argue exchanges need to implement AI-driven behavior detection systems that could flag suspicious patterns before funds are forcibly withdrawn. Yet privacy advocates caution against sweeping surveillance in the name of safety. They argue that we can’t sacrifice decentralization and privacy entirely to police bad actors. So, we must find ways of achieving that difficult balance. Crypto must address its cultural problem Beyond policy and policing lies a deeper cultural issue: the glamorization of sudden wealth. Crypto communities on YouTube, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) are rife with images of Lamborghini, luxury watches, and high-rise living. This culture of conspicuous consumption has painted targets on the backs of newcomers and veterans alike. Some of the most at-risk individuals are early adopters who experienced 1000x returns overnight. Many are young, inexperienced with wealth, and unaware of the attention they’re attracting. To these investors, the rising number of crypto kidnappings shouldn’t just be another crime wave. Rather, it’s a wake-up call. They must understand that their success stories must come with robust identity protection, not flaunting their assets and always assuming someone’s watching them. What’s the way forward? As the crypto industry matures, so too must the systems around it. That means that investors need to take personal security as seriously as they take portfolio diversification. Platforms and exchanges should include user education on physical safety, not just cyber hygiene. Furthermore, l aw enforcement agencies need cross-border frameworks and technical expertise to respond effectively. But beyond systems and policy, a cultural shift is needed. We must move away from the glamorization of sudden wealth and toward a culture of security-minded, privacy-conscious engagement with digital finance. Cryptocurrency has opened the door to financial freedom for millions. But freedom, in this case, comes with a price—and for too many, that price is proving far too high. It doesn’t have to be this way.

""For example, between September 2023 and January 2024, the Promoting Defendants announced acquisitions of properties in Argentina, Thailand, Antigua, and the Bahamas, purportedly with appraised values totaling more than of $1.4 billion; in fact, the majority of those transactions never closed and the actual combined value of the four properties was no more than $300 million,"" the complaint said. The defendants also ""overstated the Company's sales"" of its rights certificates, suggesting in social media posts and to investors that it had raised far more funds than it actually had, the SEC alleged. While Unicoin claimed it had made $3 billion in sales by June 2024, it actually never sold more than $110 million in its rights certificates, according to the complaint. Moreover, Unicoin advertised its rights certificates, including by promising outsized returns of up to 9 million percent, the SEC alleged, pointing to marketing efforts on taxi cabs, ferries, ""office building elevator screens,"" digital billboards, coasters, television programs, news websites and public wi-fi kiosks. ""Additional examples of the Promoting Defendants’ statements include: (a) social media and website posts that touted potential returns of 9,000,000% based on bitcoin’s 9,000,000% growth in the past 10 years and told investors to 'take advantage of the early days of Unicoin and get them today,' highlighting that 'Bitcoin experienced a tremendous rise in value, transforming early adopters into millionaires, and even billionaires,'"" the filing said.

Unicoin received a Wells notice from the SEC last December, informing the company that the regulator — then under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler — intended to file securities fraud charges. Last month, Konanykhin sent a letter to Unicoin’s shareholders, informing them that the company had rebuffed the SEC’s attempt to settle the charges, rejecting what he described as an “ultimatum” to attend a settlement negotiation meeting by April 18. “We declined to show up,” Konanykhin told CoinDesk in an April interview, adding that the SEC had made certain pre-meeting demands he deemed “unacceptable” and claiming that the SEC’s probe had caused “multi-billion-dollar damages” to the company.

New York City will also be exploring whether certain services and taxes can be paid via crypto, according to Adams, along with using blockchain tech to manage sensitive information such as birth certificates and death records . “Bringing blockchain security capabilities to the city means that birth certificates and death records can remain private but accessible to New Yorkers and their next of kin,” Adams said. “We want to bring jobs of the future to our city today. That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy,” he added. Crypto legislation proposed in New York New York State lawmakers have already introduced several bills to regulate crypto. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill to amend the state’s financial law to allow New York State agencies to accept crypto as payment. However, the legislation is yet to reach the state’s full House or Senate. New York state Senator James Sanders Jr proposed the Blockchain Study Act in February, which would create a crypto task force to investigate the current state of crypto in the State. It has yet to advance past the House.

He was indicted on corruption charges over alleged illegal donations from the Turkish government, but Justice Department officials stepped in and directed local authorities to intervene. The case was dismissed with prejudice on April 2, meaning it can’t be reopened. An increasing number of US states are also working on crypto-related legislation, with at least 18 considering bills to establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Two states, New Hampshire and Arizona, have successfully passed the legislation, according to Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

While the market has faced a few pullbacks, the bigger picture still looks hopeful for XRP fans. Key Resistance Holding XRP Back Recently, XRP tried to break through a tough resistance zone between $2.55 and $2.62, but once again, the price got rejected. This area has been a problem for XRP for a while now, just like it has for many other altcoins in the market. After this rejection, the price pulled back slightly, but it’s still holding above important support levels. The Bigger Trend Stays Bullish Even with these small dips, the overall trend for XRP is still moving up. On the daily chart, XRP continues to form higher highs and higher lows, which is a classic sign of an uptrend. Right now, the price is finding support around $2.30 to $2.34, a zone that was previously a resistance area. As long as XRP stays above this level, the bullish momentum is expected to continue. If the price falls below $2.30, however, the next important support sits between $2.10 and $2.15. Dropping below this zone could lead to a deeper pullback in the short term. Short-Term Price Action: Calm Before the Move XRP is still under the effect of a recent bearish divergence, which caused a small drop followed by sideways price movement. At the moment, it looks like XRP won’t make any big moves right away. Bitcoin, which often leads the crypto market, is still holding strong — and when Bitcoin stays steady, altcoins like XRP usually follow quietly for a while before making their moves. Many market watchers believe that if Bitcoin continues its upward trend, XRP could start recovering in the coming days. Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests One More Rally According to a recent market analysis based on the Elliott Wave theory — a popular tool to predict market cycles — XRP might still be in the middle of its fifth and final wave to the upside. This wave likely started when XRP hit a bottom in July last year. If this pattern continues, XRP could aim for new highs, with long-term price targets between $4.20, $5.00, or even $5.65 before a bigger market correction begins. Crucial Support and Resistance Levels to Watch (long term) For now, XRP remains in a tight range. Key resistance sits just above $3.30, while strong support lies at $1.21. As long as the price stays above $1.21, the bullish outlook stays in place. A drop below this level, however, would weaken the current setup and might force analysts to rethink their predictions. In the short term, XRP has completed a five-wave pattern, and according to Elliott Wave rules, a three-wave pullback could be next. The expected support for this pullback lies between $2.60 and $1.79. As long as XRP holds above $1.79, the bullish trend remains safe.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 01:46:19

Beijing placed fresh restrictions on seven key rare-earth elements and on the permanent magnets made from them. The minerals are crucial for electric cars, wind turbines, humanoid robots, and advanced fighter jets. Under the rules, Chinese exporters must secure a licence from the Ministry of Commerce before each shipment can leave the country. Exporters and trade bodies now say those licences are being approved at a slow pace. Some shipments to Europe have been cleared, but the pace is far behind demand. “The window to avoid significant damage to production in Europe is rapidly closing,” said Wolfgang Niedermark, a member of the executive board of the Federation of German Industries, or BDI. Big US manufacturers are also sounding the alarm. In recent briefings, executives at Tesla, Ford, and Lockheed Martin told investors that China’s new export controls could slow or even halt supply chains. One European executive based in China, who asked not to be named, called the present delays “untenable” for foreign firms. “What I’m witnessing on the ground is that there is really incompetence; they underestimated what the impact would be and what you would need to prepare at the working level,” the executive said. Beijing widened its export controls just after US President Donald Trump announced steep new tariffs on Chinese goods on 2 April. Many analysts saw the rare-earth move as a direct response, highlighting China’s leverage as the world’s dominant supplier of minerals. China’s rare-earth controls may be a strategic response to US tariffs So far, it is not clear whether any shipments bound for the United States have received licences since Washington and Beijing declared a 90-day ceasefire in their tariff war earlier this month. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetic Material, based in Shandong Province, confirmed it had secured export permits and had “resumed” taking orders from certain buyers. Two people familiar with the situation said at least one consignment destined for Volkswagen’s operations in Germany had also been cleared. Volkswagen stated that its supply of parts containing rare earths remained stable and that its suppliers had received “a limited number of these [export] licences.” Inside the industry, companies fear the ministry will be overwhelmed as licence applications pour in. One executive said European importers “are not sure how to prove” that their shipments will not be re-exported to the United States, a step that would break the permit rules. Slow license approvals would affect Western companies Tesla chief Elon Musk told investors last month that Chinese officials had asked for assurances that the rare-earth magnets used in the company’s robot arms would not go into military hardware. “That is an example of a challenge there. I’m confident we’ll overcome these issues,” he said. Permanent magnets made from rare earths are found in combat aircraft such as Lockheed’s F-35. Short-term shortages could disrupt production lines, and experts predict that the new controls will speed up long-term efforts in the West to build alternative supply chains. Evan Scott, chief financial officer at Lockheed, told investors this week that the company had enough rare-earth material for the rest of the year. He added that he expected US authorities to give priority to Lockheed’s needs “given the importance of our programmes.” Cameron Johnson, partner at the Shanghai-based consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions, said he believes some big companies with long histories in China have managed to move rare-earth cargoes even before their licences were formally approved. “There is still material going out,” he said. Cory Combs, associate director at Trivium China, a Beijing consultancy, noted that there is “certainly no evidence” that China has “bluntly cut everyone off.” With the 90-day tariff truce now in place, he expects the commerce ministry to grant more permits, but he warned that uncertainty remains high. “Everyone wants Mofcom to provide clarity,” Mr Combs said. “But China’s strategic leverage relies partly on the ability to pull the export control lever to the extent that the US does not provide a satisfying deal.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|USD|Yuan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 01:48:29

It now requires one more vote and Governor Greg Abbott’s signature to become law. The bill draws inspiration from successful efforts in other states, notably New Hampshire’s model for adding new tokens to its Reserve. Under SB 21, Texas would allow altcoins to be included only if they maintain a market capitalization of at least $500 billion for a continuous period of two years. Texas is rapidly headed to form its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Legislators voted resoundingly to advance the bill. This legislation hopes to see Texas become the third state to own and operate a state-funded Bitcoin Reserve in the United States. The third and final reading would come next, and experts said that was likely to pass easily. SB 21 passes second reading with strong bipartisan support Upon its second reading, the bill, also called Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), received overwhelming bi-partisan support. The vote was 105 to 23. This demonstrates clear partisan agreement. SB 21 would allow Texas to join the handful of states that already hold Bitcoin by authorizing the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to operate a state-owned Bitcoin Reserve. The fund will strategically invest taxpayer funds in Bitcoin to create a diversified financial portfolio for Texas, including digital and regular assets. To preserve the state’s investment, the reserve will be limited to digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion held for at least two years, meaning only stable and established cryptocurrencies will qualify. The reserve’s operation will be funded through appropriations by the Legislature and other state funding sources. The comptroller’s office, which under the law is also guided by the city’s finance department and the Office of Management and Budget, will be the trustee of the currency and will purchase, hold, and sell Bitcoin on behalf of the reserve. Texas joins New Hampshire and Arizona in establishing state Bitcoin Reserve Texas is on its way to being the third state to create an official Bitcoin Reserve after New Hampshire and Arizona. This is just one example of an emerging trend in the US as more states turn to Bitcoin to help fortify their finances. Popularity has been rising for the initiative to hold Bitcoin after President Donald Trump suggested it was a good idea for states to hold Bitcoin; parties such as the South Carolina GOP found this a good time to ask followers to give their opinions. Supporters believe holding Bitcoin can enable states to hedge against inflation and economic instability. The cryptocurrency market has already felt the impact of news of the bill. Amid the state-backed interest in Bitcoin Reserves, the asset price has soared to $106,000, targeting an all-time high. Confidence in Bitcoin and state-led digital asset initiatives is steadily increasing. While primarily a Bitcoin Reserve, SB 21 also includes other digital assets—provided they maintain a market capitalization of $500 billion or more for at least 24 months. Texas set to approve Bitcoin Reserve as global interest surges The bill now heads to the desk of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it. Abbott has previously expressed support for cryptocurrency projects and is widely expected to sign SB 21 into law. Following Trump’s signing of the Bitcoin Reserve into law, interest in similar initiatives has surged to unprecedented levels. States like Utah, Oklahoma, and Kentucky are inching forward with their versions of a bill to join the industry as early movers. A Ukrainian lawmaker has unveiled plans to introduce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill to be the first in the EU. However, the move has garnered Binance’s support, with the exchange poised to become a strategic partner for Ukraine’s Bitcoin ambitions. Additionally, Conor McGregor has plans to launch an Irish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the European country. The former UFC fighter has also scheduled a meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to support a nationwide Bitcoin accumulation strategy. UFC fighter turned Irish political hopeful Conor McGregor has endorsed building a Bitcoin Reserve in his country to give more “power back to the people.” “Crypto in it’s origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money,” McGregor wrote to X on May 9. He wants the Irish people to have a stake in this exciting venture. This suggestion immediately appealed to President Nayib Bukele, who is using aggressive tactics of purchasing Bitcoin for his country and disregarding any institutions that are hesitant in doing so KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|Bitcoin reserve|Texas,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 01:49:40

The ‘Amazon of Japan’ has noted it “will not enter the defense industry right away.” Given Japan’s self-described “defense geek” prime minister Shigeru Ishiba, a Christian, Westernized supporter of the U.S. military machine and Donald Trump, perhaps online shopping giant Rakuten’s recently announced support for actual weapons startups should not be too shocking.

Rakuten’s move towards military involvement While massive corporations backing the governments they are embedded within is (unfortunately) nothing uncommon in war time, the Japanese state and it’s native commercial megaliths are headed more and more toward peacetime involvement in military matters.The currently debated “ Active Cyber Defense ” legislation pushed by Ishiba is just one example, which would see peacetime monitoring of communications from telecom giants like Softbank. This has some residents of the archipelago understandably worried they will be spied on and threatened by the preemptive nature of punishments outlined by the law.Six Ukrainian startups supported by Brave 1 will be showcased at the “Brave1 Powered by Rakuten” booth: • Dwarf Engineering LLC • FarsightVision LLC • Griselda • LifesaverSIM • Skyfall Industries LLC • Swarmer Notably, Skyfall Industries (what a name) makes a drone called “Vampire,” which according to Rakuten, “has earned a high reputation for its efficiency and versatility.” Anyone who has ever attended or seen footage of state-level weapons trade shows can attest to the bizarre and disturbing nature of the events. Military brass, mega-corporations, and politicians gather to toast champagne in celebration of killing machines. This likely has more than a few folks in Japan worried about the future of their beloved Rakuten. And more importantly, the land where they live. Still, Rakuten executive Hideaki Mukai has reportedly said at a press conference that his company “will not enter the defense industry right away.”DSEI Japan 2025 is held from May 21 to May 23 with Rakuten hoping to support the defense startups and “their entry into the Japanese market.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

He also rejected claims that the White House is easing military help for Kyiv. Rubio spoke in a Senate hearing one day after President Donald Trump spent two hours on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a call that ended without a clear step toward ending the war that began when Moscow invaded its neighbour. Several Democratic lawmakers said the president squandered the chance to raise the heat on the Kremlin. They faulted him for not warning Putin that Washington and its European partners would widen sanctions unless the Russian leader agreed to a cease-fire. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking at a Senate hearing. Source: PBS NewsHour During testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio was asked about a bill led by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. The proposal would slap wide-ranging new punishments on Moscow, aiming to choke the money it uses to fight the war. The measure calls for a 500 percent tariff on goods coming from countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, along with other limits on finance and technology. “If in fact it is clear that the Russians are not interested in a peace deal and they want to keep fighting a war, it may very well come to that point,” Rubio said. But he added that Trump thinks “right now if we start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking. There’s value in us being able to talk to them and drive them to get to the table.” Democratic committee member Senator Jeanne Shaheen said Putin offered no “meaningful negotiation that would end this war in Ukraine.” She added, “As President Trump has admitted, Vladimir Putin is taking him for a ride.” Senator Chris Van Hollen went further, telling Rubio, “You’ve teamed up with President Trump to throw the Ukrainian people under the bus, and have been played like a fiddle by Vladimir Putin.” Rubio affirmed that the Trump administration has leverage against Russia Rubio insisted that the administration has the “same leverage today that we had under the previous administration.” He noted that “when Vladimir Putin woke up this morning, he had the same set of sanctions on him that he’s always had since the beginning of this conflict,” and he stressed that American weapons are still moving into Ukraine. “Putin hasn’t got a single concession, he hasn’t got a single sanction lifted,” Rubio said. Even so, the Florida Republican argued the war can end only through a negotiated deal. “What the president’s trying to do is end a war,” he told the panel, saying the United States must keep channels open so both sides will sit down. His remarks did little to calm allies who had hoped for tougher language in Monday’s Trump-Putin talk . The call produced no pledge from Moscow to halt its attacks. Instead, Putin suggested that both parties draft a “memorandum” that would outline future treaty terms, a move critics dismissed as a stalling tactic that allowed Russian troops to keep fighting while talks dragged on. European and Ukrainian leaders also voiced unease after Trump floated the idea of stepping back as mediator and proposing that the Vatican take over the role instead. They warned that every day without a truce brings more civilian deaths and damage across Ukraine.

But the biggest shift is the X1 mobile app. With only a smartphone, anyone can start mining. There are no upfront fees, no complicated setup. That simplicity opens doors to a much broader user base, giving more people access to the crypto with 20,000x ROI potential. It’s smooth, easy, and perfect for beginners. What makes this important is BlockDAG’s focus on real-world usage. The X1 app isn’t just a gimmick, it helps grow the network and rewards users for activity, referrals, and time spent engaging. Even if traditional miners doubt mobile mining, BlockDAG’s hybrid PoW and DAG design ensures that every miner, big or small, helps power a strong, scalable system. Whether you’re using a $1,000 miner or a basic phone, you’re part of a broader mission to grow a decentralized network. A $258M Presale That’s Building More Than Hype BlockDAG’s rise isn’t driven by empty promises. With more than $258 million raised, 28 batches released, and 20.9 billion coins sold, this project is building real value. While the current batch is priced at $0.0262, a limited-time offer brings it back to just $0.0020 until June 13. That’s the same as the batch 1 price, offering late buyers a shot at early-stage ROI. This isn’t just about catching a dip, it’s about seeing an entire system in motion. The mining hardware is ready. The beta testnet is active. The X1 app is already gaining users. Unlike other projects that offer promises, BlockDAG is giving users an ecosystem to engage with before the mainnet even goes live. When you combine all this, tools, adoption, and accessibility, it’s easy to understand why people believe it’s the crypto with 20,000x potential. What also sets BlockDAG apart is its transparency. The team has rolled out multiple video keynotes, giving real updates on features, roadmap progress, and community milestones. That kind of openness gives both retail buyers and institutions confidence that they’re backing more than just a whitepaper; they’re backing results. Making Regular Users Active Earning Nodes BlockDAG’s smart approach to mining isn’t just technical, it’s about how people behave. Many crypto platforms struggle to bring in new users, and even more fail to keep them involved. BlockDAG avoids that by making mining fun and interactive with its X1 app. Users become active nodes by simply participating, earning rewards, making referrals, and competing in real time. A good example is the Buyer Battles contest, which hands out 150 million BDAG daily to the top participants. This adds fun and competition to the mix, turning mining into something people want to do daily. Instead of asking people to “learn” first, BlockDAG lets them earn while they learn. That strategy removes the usual barriers that stop people in low-income areas or those who aren’t tech-savvy. With mining options that include everything from pro-level machines to a free mobile app, BlockDAG is ready to grow fast and far. For people who care about more than just flipping a coin, BlockDAG offers a full system. It brings together technology, economics, and a community setup built around real use. This is mining made simple. And if BlockDAG keeps building this way, it may not only live up to the crypto with 20,000x potential, it could redefine what crypto utility actually means. Final Chance to Get In BlockDAG isn’t chasing crypto trends, it’s setting its own path. With physical miners from the X10 to the X100, and a user-friendly X1 app, it gives every user a way to mine and earn. The crypto presale speaks for itself: $258 million raised, a 2,520% ROI from batch 1, and a rare $0.0020 offer open until June 13. This isn’t just another presale, it’s the beginning of a bigger vision. If you’re searching for a real opportunity with long-term value, BlockDAG isn’t just a name to watch. It’s a chance to join something early, something real, and possibly the crypto with 20,000x potential ready to be realized.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Solana Are Leading the Shift",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-next-big-move-magacoin-finance-ethereum-and-solana-are-leading-the-shift/,"Introduction As May 2025 unfolds, conviction-driven capital is flowing into a new set of crypto leaders . From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Each brings a distinct edge—macro leadership, DeFi infrastructure, early-stage asymmetric potential, and cross-border utility. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the top early-stage play of Q2 2025 , with Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007. Its scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply and Hashex audit have analysts forecasting 35x–50x returns before listings.MAGA’s blend of viral narrative, transparent tokenomics, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital is fueling unmatched momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. The window for early entry is closing fast, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025. Bitcoin Holds Ground as Institutional Confidence Grows Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $95,000, consolidating after a strong recovery from April lows. Analysts are targeting $104,000–$109,000 as key resistance, with the next leg of the supercycle potentially pushing BTC to $150,000 or higher.As Bitcoin anchors the market, it’s enabling capital to cascade into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the opportunity for exponential gains remains open. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,356, retreating from its recent high of $2,728 but still up significantly for May. Technical analysis points to a potential retest of $2,600–$2,700 if ETH holds above $2,250, with long-term targets as high as $4,500 by late 2025.As the cornerstone of Web3 and DeFi, Ethereum’s rising institutional interest and rapid Layer 2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Solana: Ecosystem Growth Drives Major Momentum Solana (SOL) is trading at $162.08, reflecting a modest pullback after recent highs near $183. For May 2025, the expected trading range is $158–$175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 resistance. Solana’s positive trend remains supported by DeFi growth, Web3 participation, and strong investor confidence. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Utility and Cross-Border Reach Stellar Lumens (XLM) is quietly gaining traction as a cross-border payments leader. While not as headline-grabbing as BTC or ETH, XLM’s consistent utility and adoption make it a favorite for those seeking stable, long-term growth.As capital rotates, some XLM holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, early-stage upside. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction—rotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, Solana and XLM offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns.With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

Asked why ETH had rallied over 50% in a week, Hayes dismissed technical triggers and pointed instead to sentiment. “The most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle,” he said. “It’s just human nature.” For Hayes, the Ethereum comeback was long overdue after years of being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens. “ETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running… it was time.” Why Ethereum Could Soar To $10,000 Despite not having added to his position, Hayes said he remained long Ethereum and was unfazed by the current price. “It’s great it’s going up, but okay—let’s talk at $10,000 or $15,000. Let’s talk when it’s meaningful.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Hayes placed Ethereum’s rebound in the broader context of what he calls a global monetary “phase shift”—a transition away from the US Treasury as the world’s reserve asset, toward a bifurcated system where store-of-value flows increasingly shift toward gold and Bitcoin. In this paradigm, Ethereum benefits not just from speculative risk flows, but also from structural changes in how capital moves under increasing financial repression and capital controls. While he reiterated his belief that gold and Bitcoin are the two neutral reserve assets in a politically fractured world, Hayes sees Ethereum as a powerful high-beta trade in the coming wave of liquidity expansion. “They print the money,” he said bluntly. “And the consequence will be gold and Bitcoin going through the roof.” Still, Ethereum’s path won’t be linear. Hayes acknowledged ETH’s underperformance versus Bitcoin so far, but suggested that ETH’s moment is coming—particularly if regulatory clarity improves or if decentralized finance regains traction with sustainable cash flows. He singled out projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that might finally justify valuation through fundamentals. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 – Here’s Why The potential for Ethereum to outperform dramatically remains, Hayes argued, especially as the market continues to digest what he sees as the beginning of the end for the 50-year US Treasury-based global financial system. “If you want to preserve access to capital and spend it how you want, the only things you can own are gold and Bitcoin,” he said. But for the investor with appetite for asymmetry, ETH is “a hard slog” now—yet still in the early stages of what could be a runaway rally. Whether Ethereum reaches the $10,000 mark in 2025 or beyond, Hayes is positioning for that outcome. “Mailstream is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% ETH and then you know a lot of other shitcoins and term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it’s physical gold and gold miners and T bills. That’s it,” Hayes revealed. At press time, ETH traded at $2,477.

What Happened? The SEC claims that Unicoin and its leaders, including CEO and Board Chairman Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former Chief Investment Officer Alex Dominguez, tricked investors with big promises about their crypto project. They sold “rights certificates” that were supposed to give people access to Unicoin tokens in the future — tokens they claimed would be backed by valuable real estate and investments in private companies. But according to the SEC, these promises were mostly made up. The real estate the company bragged about was worth only a small portion of what was advertised, and the company raised nowhere near the $3 billion it claimed — bringing in only about $110 million from over 5,000 investors. Unicoin reportedly went big with their marketing. Ads popped up in airports, taxis across New York City, on TV, and all over social media. The company presented itself as a next-generation crypto investment opportunity, supposedly safe, stable, and profitable. They even told investors their offerings were “SEC-registered,” when in reality, they weren’t. The SEC says Konanykhin personally sold millions of these certificates, targeting investors the company had previously tried to avoid so they wouldn’t lose their legal exemptions. The Charges and What’s Next The SEC has officially charged Unicoin and its executives with breaking federal securities laws, including fraud and making unregistered sales. The legal action demands they pay back the money they gained unfairly, along with extra fines and bans from holding executive positions in public companies. Even Unicoin’s general counsel, Richard Devlin, wasn’t spared. He’s been accused of spreading misleading information through investor documents. Devlin has agreed to settle his charges without admitting or denying the allegations and will pay a $37,500 penalty.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 02:01:11

The premiere episode featured Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX, who provided an in-depth discussion on several recent platform highlights. These included the launch of the “Mars Program Special Edition,” the early partnership with the Trump family’s crypto project, and the powerful growth drivers contributing to HTX’s Q1 performance. According to Justin, this new series underscores HTX’s commitment to transparency and building trust within its user base. By engaging directly with users, HTX intends to facilitate open communication, strengthen the connection between users and leadership, and enhance the platforms’ credibility. HTX representative Molly also participated in the show, directly addressing user questions in real-time. Q: The launch of HTX’s special edition Mars Program has sparked significant buzz within the crypto community. What’s the strategic thinking behind it, and what message does HTX hope to convey to users through this campaign? Justin Sun: A journey to Mars is actually a personal dream of mine. Interestingly,the Chinese names HTX and Mars form a natural alliteration. My lifelong dream has been to venture into space, a goal I’ve been pursuing incrementally. While sending myself or our users to Mars is not currently feasible, it remains a vision I hope to witness in my lifetime. For now, the first step is space travel. Acknowledging its niche appeal, I believe it’s a pursuit worth sharing with the HTX community. If there’s ever an opportunity, I aspire to offer our users the chance to experience space as well. Of course, this is a massive undertaking and not something that will happen overnight. My own space journey has already been delayed over four years. So managing expectations is important. That said, our investment in the space sector is long-term. Our collaboration with companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin is a long-term partnership. Safety is paramount, both in space exploration and in cryptocurrency trading. In the context of spaceflight, our benchmark for safety exceeds that of driving a car. Therefore, I want to emphasize three key aspects of this initiative: its inherent difficulty, its long-term nature, and our unwavering commitment to safety. Our focus on space does not imply any deceleration in our core product development. On the contrary, HTX remains aggressive and ahead of the curve in new asset listings. As a Top 10 exchange, HTX possesses both significant momentum and established credibility. Regarding the speed and quality of token listings, our competitiveness matches, if not surpasses, that of any other exchange in the market. The Mars Program symbolizes our vision for the future, reaching for the stars and beyond. Simultaneously, we remain firmly grounded in our commitment to our community. Our ongoing reward campaigns and $HTX token empowerment initiatives continue to operate at full capacity, delivering tangible value to our users. Q: You partnered with the Trump family’s crypto project, WLFI and you engaged in a discussion with Eric Trump in Dubai. At the same time, HTX was among the first exchanges to list Trump-related tokens, TRUMP and USD1. How do you view the value of this rapid response to trending topics in terms of brand building and user base expansion? And looking ahead, will HTX continue to double down on hot-red tokens? Justin Sun: Absolutely. We were one of the earliest players to recognize the significance of the Trump family’s involvement in crypto. From the beginning, I believed that Donald Trump’s influence would bring a huge wave of positive momentum into space, and now we’re seeing that come to life. The entire industry got a new lease on life after his campaign ramped up. I am honored to serve as an advisor to the Trump family’s crypto team. I’m actively involved in providing insights and helping bridge the gap between crypto and traditional politics and, in a broader sense, possibly even between the two major economies. Our objective is to establish a robust, long-term relationship with the Trump family and onboard individuals from traditional industries into Web3. Our partnership with the Trump family is a long-term commitment. We are dedicated to driving growth across the entire cryptocurrency industry, fostering greater adoption and integration of digital assets. Q: HTX was the only Top 10 exchange to record positive trading volume growth in the first quarter of this year. Could you share more insights into HTX’s current revenue performance and identify the key sectors driving this growth? Justin Sun: I’m confident that as long as HTX stays on the right course, sustainable growth will follow. Our strong brand influence, coupled with our established reputation as a veteran exchange, fosters deep and enduring trust among our user base.. The platform also benefits from significant organic traffic and demonstrates robust growth momentum, further solidifying our position in the industry. What sets us apart is our unwavering focus on doing what’s right, especially in security and risk controls. HTX has maintained an unblemished security record for over twenty months, a significant accomplishment considering the frequency of security breaches within the industry. This exemplary standard remains our top priority. We will soon launch a major win-back campaign for dormant users. If you’ve been away from HTX, there’s never been a better time to come back and rediscover what we offer. The “Real Talk with HTX Executives” program was conceived based on my conviction that security is the paramount concern for cryptocurrency users. A lack of public engagement from exchange leadership can potentially erode user trust. This on-camera series will enable HTX executives to speak directly to our users, share important updates, and listen to their thoughts and concerns firsthand. This commitment to open communication is fundamental to how HTX continuously builds and reinforces user trust. There’s nothing quite like the trust that comes from face-to-face interaction. Direct dialogue between executives and users plays a vital role in fostering mutual confidence and reinforcing user trust in the platform’s products and services. It’s something I consider paramount. In response to inquiries about the future role of exchanges and HTX’s potential redefinition of the “trading platform,” HTX representative @HTX_Molly provided her insights. She explained that HTX is evolving beyond the traditional exchange model, aiming to be a builder driving the industry’s long-term progress rather than a “crypto arcade”. By cultivating DAO culture and prioritizing community engagement, HTX is forging deeper connections among miners, developers, and users. This collaborative approach aims to facilitate the integration of Web3 from its current niche into mainstream adoption through genuine consensus-building. She stressed that “daily incremental progress is not just a slogan.” Writing solid code and providing comprehensive user support are the foundations for reshaping what an exchange can be. For HTX, rankings and short-term recognition are secondary; user trust is the platform’s most valuable asset. As she put it, “We prefer to move forward slower, ensuring that every brick we lay can withstand the test of a bull market.” Addressing a user’s question about “How does $HTX compare to other exchange tokens?”, Molly explained, “$HTX is like HTX’s stock, backed by solid fundamentals rather than speculation. Rigorous asset selection and a flawless security record are its core strengths.” Discussing HTX’s global expansion strategy, Molly conveyed a sense of certainty and emphasized that cultivating authentic, empathetic relationships with users takes precedence over the pursuit of rankings. “The joy our users feel from earning profits is our KPI,” she stated. With Justin Sun’s recent efforts to expand HTX’s reach into the U.S. market, the exchange is making a strategic move to send a global message — that Chinese exchanges offer not only speed, but also conviction and long-term vision.

Recent market indicators paired with bullish sentiment have reignited interest in XRP, with several analysts and community participants aligning around an optimistic outlook for 2026. The combination of improving technicals, upward revisions in price forecasts, and a solid support level near $2.37 is adding strength to the broader narrative. According to Binance’s latest forecast model, XRP is projected to hit $2.495738 in 2026, reinforcing the growing attention toward this established asset. This momentum, coupled with technical alignment on both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, positions XRP favorably in the coming quarters, especially in a market steadily regaining volume. Meanwhile, Qubetics continues to garner attention among early buyers as its QubeQode-powered infrastructure offers meaningful utility beyond speculative narratives. With more than $17.1 million already raised in its ongoing presale and over 513 million $TICS tokens sold, this rising contender is defining what the next generation of blockchain platforms should look like. As XRP builds toward new milestones, Qubetics is making its own mark through structured innovation, measurable ROI potential, and developer-centric functionality tailored for real-world application. XRP Price Prediction 2026: Growing Technical Strength Backs Forecasts The current price of XRP stands at $2.376894 as of May 20, 2025. Market participants appear increasingly confident that XRP will continue to move upward, supported by a strong “Very Bullish” consensus rating from over 56% of 774 voters on Binance’s sentiment tracker. The token has demonstrated steady performance, with predictions for May 2026 setting a potential price level at $2.495738. This aligns with a broader pattern suggesting gradual upward movement through 2030, where the token could reach as high as $3.033586. Several factors support this projection. XRP’s 50-day moving average is currently sloping up, and its 200-day moving average began to tilt positively as of May 15, 2025. This shift confirms a structurally bullish condition across both short-term and long-term indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also reflects a neutral stance, residing between 30 and 70, with no recent divergence, which reinforces a stable continuation of trend rather than imminent reversal. With no major resistance in the short term and supportive fundamentals in place, the mid-range XRP price prediction 2026 appears technically justified. Sentiment and Forecasts: How Users Are Aligning on XRP’s Trajectory The market consensus on XRP continues to build momentum heading into 2026. According to the platform data, the forecast curve suggests moderate but consistent growth. Users who participated in Binance’s predictive tool indicated a strong probability that XRP may trade near or above $2.495738 within the next year. Price expectations for subsequent years extend to $2.620525 in 2027, $2.751551 in 2028, and above $3.03 by 2030. These figures indicate growing long-term confidence in XRP’s capacity to regain ground lost during earlier consolidation phases. On a shorter horizon, XRP is forecasted to gradually rise over the next month, with a target of $2.386444 by June 19, 2025. This reflects a potential gain of approximately 0.4% in 30 days based on current trends. While these increases may appear modest compared to newer, more volatile assets, XRP’s appeal lies in its structural resilience and consistently improving base metrics. For long-term participants aiming to avoid speculative volatility, XRP offers a more measured profile with clearly defined growth projections. That makes XRP price prediction 2026 particularly relevant for those evaluating projects with trackable historic data and tested network performance. Technical Foundations Remain Stable Heading into the Next Cycle From a technical perspective, XRP continues to maintain structural integrity across major timeframes. The alignment of both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signals growing market stability. Importantly, there are no recorded bullish or bearish divergences in the RSI readings for the past 14 candles, which indicates the absence of trend reversal warnings. These conditions support the ongoing forecast of steady upward pressure, aligning with XRP price prediction 2026 across multiple sources. Price target models reinforce the technical readings. Whether viewed through daily forecasts or multi-year projections, the token’s valuation model suggests incremental but meaningful progression. The broader sentiment indicators and predictive analytics all point to XRP potentially solidifying its place among the most structurally sound digital assets over the next 12–18 months. While the asset may not deliver triple-digit returns in short order, its position as a value-retaining asset continues to strengthen, particularly as broader crypto sentiment recovers. Qubetics Is Reinventing Utility Through the QubeQode IDE and Tokenized ROI Design As XRP builds on its technical base, Qubetics is capturing attention for an entirely different reason: real-world functionality tailored for builders, freelancers, and enterprises. At the center of its offering is the QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment designed to make decentralized application development accessible without technical complexity. Through drag-and-drop components, pre-built user authentication modules, and token management tools, QubeQode transforms the blockchain development process into something practical—even for non-engineers. This functionality is especially impactful for freelancers and small businesses looking to deploy secure, blockchain-based apps without incurring the cost of traditional backend development. Form-based configuration allows users to define application logic visually, while the embedded code snippet library speeds up development with tested components. Enterprises seeking to automate workflows, secure user authentication, or tokenize internal systems are now evaluating Qubetics as a functional alternative to expensive Web2 platforms. With its mainnet launch expected in Q2 2025, this initiative is gaining traction as more users discover the depth behind its technology stack. The Qubetics presale has also emerged as one of the most discussed initiatives among those looking for entry into the best crypto presale opportunities of 2025. Each presale stage lasts precisely seven days and ends every Sunday at 12 a.m., followed by a 10% increase in token price. Currently in Stage 35, Qubetics is priced at $0.2785 per $TICS token. Over $17.1 million has already been raised, and more than 513 million tokens have been distributed to a growing base of over 26,700 holders. What makes the Qubetics presale particularly compelling are the ROI projections associated with various post-launch scenarios. If $TICS reaches $1, buyers entering now would lock in a 258.95% return. A $5 valuation after mainnet would equate to 1,694.74% ROI, while a $6 price projects a 2,053.68% return. Should $TICS hit $10 after its utilities roll out, that return jumps to 3,489.47%, and a $15 outcome would deliver an exceptional 5,284.21% ROI. For example, a $5,000 investment in Stage 35 currently buys 17,950 tokens. If $TICS were to reach just $5, the total value of this holding would be $89,750. At $10, that climbs to $179,500, and at $15, the portfolio’s value would reach $269,250. These numbers underline why community participants are recognizing Qubetics as not only a technology project but a serious ROI proposition under the best crypto presale conditions currently available. Conclusion XRP continues to deliver a case for long-term confidence through well-aligned technical indicators and structured forecasts, with the XRP price prediction 2026 providing a compelling reason for its re-evaluation. Its consistent support near the $2.37 mark, combined with bullish market sentiment and upward-trending moving averages, strengthens its position as a viable hold through the next cycle. Meanwhile, Qubetics is defining a new direction for crypto adoption through developer empowerment and a clearly structured presale model. The QubeQode IDE offers immediate use cases for a range of users, while the $TICS token provides tangible ROI pathways for participants entering now. As the countdown to its Q2 mainnet launch continues, more buyers are choosing to join this best crypto presale ahead of the next round of price increases.

Ở bài trước, chúng ta đã khám phá cách MACD giúp bắt kịp đà tăng sớm. Hôm nay, hãy cùng tìm hiểu một công cụ được lòng trader nhất để hoàn thiện kỹ năng bắt trend thị trường: RSI – người bạn đồng hành không thể thiếu trong mọi giao dịch! RSI Là Gì? RSI (Relative Strength Index) – hay còn gọi là Kim Chỉ Nam Tâm Lý Thị Trường – là một công cụ đơn giản nhưng cực kỳ mạnh mẽ. Nó giúp bạn biết liệu thị trường đang quá hưng phấn (quá mua ) hay quá chán nản (quá bán ). Khác với các chỉ báo chạy theo giá, RSI đo lường áp lực mua/bán dựa trên biến động gần đây. Điều này giống như việc bạn có một chiếc radar phát hiện tâm lý đám đông trước khi thị trường lật kèo vậy! Giải Mã RSI Theo Cách Dễ Hiểu Nhất: ● RSI trên 70 = Quá Mua → Thị trường có thể sắp hạ nhiệt ● RSI dưới 30 = Quá Bán → Thị trường có thể sắp bật dậy ● RSI giữa 40–60 = Trạng thái Chill → Chưa có tín hiệu gì hot! Ví dụ đơn giản: RSI (Bảng Màu Tím): Cảnh Báo “Quá Mua” Trong biểu đồ trên, RSI của 14 cây nến gần nhất vượt ngưỡng 70 , báo hiệu trạng thái quá mua cổ điển . Điều này cho thấy đợt tăng giá gần đây của BTC có thể đang mất đà hoặc chuẩn bị bước vào giai đoạn điều chỉnh. Các trader hiện đang quan sát: RSI giảm xuống dưới 70 như dấu hiệu đầu tiên của đảo chiều. Nếu BTC vẫn giữ vững, RSI có thể duy trì trạng thái quá mua – một đặc điểm thường thấy trong xu hướng tăng mạnh (nhưng rủi ro cao cho người mua muộn). RSI càng mạnh mẽ hơn khi kết hợp với các chỉ báo khác. Hãy thử ghép đôi nó với MACD và Đường Trung Bình Động để xác nhận tín hiệu tốt hơn nhé! MACD: Động Lực Tăng Vẫn Còn Nguyên MACD Line (Xanh): 4,142 Signal Line (Cam): 3,536 Histogram: Dương, nhưng các thanh đang dần co lại, cho thấy động lực có thể đang chậm lại. MACD vẫn tích cực với đường xanh nằm thoải mái trên đường cam, nhưng hãy chú ý đến histogram. Nếu các thanh bắt đầu thu hẹp, đó có thể là dấu hiệu rằng động lực tăng đang suy yếu. Đường Trung Bình Động: Liệu BTC Có Quá Mở Rộng? ● 50-Day EMA (Đường Vàng): 92,570 ● 200-Day SMA (Đường Xanh): 91,673 Giá BTC đang giao dịch cao hơn cả hai đường trung bình động chính, xác nhận xu hướng tăng mạnh mẽ. Tuy nhiên, điều này cũng đặt ra vấn đề: Liệu thị trường có đang quá căng? Khi giá kéo xa khỏi các đường này, một đợt điều chỉnh lành mạnh về vùng 50 EMA là điều hoàn toàn có thể xảy ra. Kết Luận Cuối Cùng: Nên Hành Động Ngay Hay Chờ? Xu Hướng Hiện Tại: Mạnh mẽ tăng nhưng có khả năng quá mở rộng. RSI: Trong vùng quá mua, hãy cẩn trọng. MACD: Vẫn tích cực, nhưng cho thấy dấu hiệu ban đầu của việc chậm lại. Chiến Lược: Nếu bạn đã có lợi nhuận, đây là thời điểm tuyệt vời để cân nhắc chốt lời hoặc siết chặt stop-loss. Nếu bạn đang chờ cơ hội vào lệnh, hãy đợi một đợt điều chỉnh về vùng 50 EMA để có điểm vào với tỷ lệ rủi ro/lợi nhuận tốt hơn. Mẹo Pro Sử Dụng RSI Như Một Cao Thủ RSI rất đơn giản, nhưng cách sử dụng nó mới là chìa khóa. Dưới đây là vài bí kíp từ các trader chuyên nghiệp: ● Hiểu Bối Cảnh Thị Trường RSI hoạt động xuất sắc trong thị trường đi ngang (range-bound), nơi giá bật qua lại giữa hỗ trợ và kháng cự. Nhưng trong xu hướng mạnh (như đợt tăng giá), RSI có thể duy trì vùng quá mua/quá bán trong nhiều tuần. Vì vậy, đừng vội bán chỉ vì RSI chạm 70 – hãy nhìn bức tranh lớn hơn.. ● Kết Hợp Với Các Chỉ Báo Khác RSI hoạt động tốt nhất khi có bạn đồng hành. Hãy ghép nó với: ○ MACD để kiểm tra xem động lực có đồng thuận với RSI không. ○ Đường Trung Bình Động (như 50 EMA) để xem giá có bị kéo quá xa khỏi các mức hỗ trợ chính không. ● Quan Sát Phân Kỳ ○ Nếu giá tạo đỉnh mới, nhưng RSI không? Đó là phân kỳ giảm – động lực có thể đang suy yếu. ○ Nếu giá tạo đáy mới, nhưng RSI không? Đó là phân kỳ tăng – một đợt bật lên có thể sắp tới. ○ Phân kỳ không luôn diễn ra ngay lập tức, nhưng đây là một manh mối mà các trader nghiêm túc không bao giờ bỏ qua. ● RSI Là Chỉ Báo Sớm, Không Phải Lệnh Gọi Hành Động Chỉ vì RSI báo hiệu quá mua/quá bán không có nghĩa bạn cần hành động ngay. Hãy coi nó như cảnh báo sớm, không phải lý do để hoảng loạn mua/bán. ● Chơi Với Các Khung Thời Gian Để Tinh Chỉnh Chiến Lược Các chỉ số RSI thay đổi tùy thuộc vào khung thời gian bạn đang xem. ○ Nếu RSI hàng ngày báo hiệu quá mua, nhưng RSI 1 giờ đang hạ nhiệt, điều này thường cho thấy thị trường đang trong đợt điều chỉnh ngắn hạn bên trong xu hướng tăng lớn hơn. ○ Trader thông minh sẽ tận dụng điều này, chờ RSI ngắn hạn reset trước khi nhảy vào xu hướng lớn hơn.

BTC is now consolidating and might aim for another increase toward $110,000 Bitcoin started a fresh upward move from the $105,000 zone. The price is trading above $106,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $106,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $107,200 resistance. Bitcoin Price Moves Higher Toward New ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase from the $103,200 support zone. BTC formed a base and was able to clear the $105,000 resistance zone. The bulls pushed the price above $105,500. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $106,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The bulls even pumped the price above the $107,000 resistance zone. However, the price failed to extend gains. A high was formed at $107,262 and the price is now consolidating gains near the same trend line. There was a minor decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $104,269 swing low to the $107,262 high. Bitcoin is now trading above $106,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $107,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $107,200 level. The next key resistance could be $107,500. A close above the $107,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $108,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $110,000 level and a new all-time high. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $107,000 resistance zone, it could start another correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $106,250 level. The first major support is near the $105,400 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $104,269 swing low to the $107,262 high. The next support is now near the $104,250 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $103,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $102,500, below which BTC might gain bearish momentum. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $105,400, followed by $104,250.

What The Charts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ready-new-aths-what-the-charts-say/,"An analyst has explained what some charts related to Bitcoin could say regarding whether the current run can lead to a new high or not. Bitcoin Momentum May Be Stalling According To These Signs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about some technical analysis (TA) signs that could reveal if it’s time for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says Here are the charts that the analyst has shared: The first graph shows a TA pattern that Bitcoin has potentially been trading inside for the last few months. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel,” which emerges whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. There are different types of Parallel Channels, but in the context of the current topic, the most ordinary version is of interest: the one with the channel parallel to the time-axis. This case naturally corresponds to a completely sideways movement from the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s visible that BTC has recently observed a rise to the upper line of the pattern. During previous retests, the coin ended up finding rejection at this mark. Thus, it’s possible that it may also face resistance here during the current retest. This isn’t the only trend that could make a break to the ATH a tricky one. As is visible from the second graph, the RSI has shown divergence from the Bitcoin price recently. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the speed and magnitude of changes that the asset’s price has witnessed recently. This metric is generally used for judging overpriced and underpriced conditions for the token. BTC’s RSI formed a peak in the overbought region earlier in the month, but while the price has gone up since then, the indicator has only managed to form a smaller peak. This type of divergence between the asset and the RSI is often considered to be a bearish signal. Lastly, there is also a bearish development in the MACD, displayed in the third chart. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is another TA indicator that’s used for gauging momentum. It involves two lines: the MACD line calculated by taking the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the price and the signal line determined as the 9-day EMA of the MACD line. Recently, the MACD line for Bitcoin has dipped under the signal line, which is usually considered as a bearish crossover. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $103,000 Relatively Cool Per This Indicator, Quant Says Based on all these patterns, Martinez has noted that momentum is stalling for BTC. It now remains to be seen how the asset would develop in the coming days and if a reversal to the downside would happen.

While BTC commands institutional dominance, many traders believe the real upside lies in smaller-cap assets that benefit from its momentum. That’s why tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP , and Cardano (ADA) are dominating current watchlists. With fresh inflows, expanding narratives, and key technical setups, these three may be best positioned to push toward the elusive 1,000x tier before the year ends. Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) round out the group with steady performance and ecosystem strength—but the spotlight is clearly shifting toward early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Bitcoin’s Surge: The Market Catalyst Bitcoin’s latest rally is driven by global economic uncertainty, institutional adoption, and regulatory clarity. Moody’s US credit downgrade and major banks enabling Bitcoin purchases have strengthened its narrative as a macro hedge, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, it often triggers a “trickle-down” effect: capital first flows into BTC, then rotates into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Exponential Potential or Hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout among early-stage altcoins. With over $8 million raised and a presale price under $0.001, analysts project potential returns ranging from 35x to as high as 18,500% (185x), with some even suggesting a $1 target by year-end 2025—though this would require a meteoric rise. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics (100 billion cap, 45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and viral meme appeal are fueling rapid community growth and investor interest. Conservative analyst targets: 35x–50x returns Aggressive projections: Up to 185x, with $1 as a “stretch” target Key drivers: Early entry, scarcity, community momentum XRP Prepares for Institutional Access XRP continues to trade above $2.30 , supported by speculation around CME Futures and potential ETF developments. With global settlement infrastructure already in place, and regulatory clarity opening the doors to institutions, XRP is being revalued by investors aiming for long-term growth. Price targets as high as $10–$15 are being floated as adoption expands. Cardano Shows Quiet Strength With Rebuilding Momentum Cardano (ADA) remains one of the most resilient Layer-1s, and recent upticks in smart contract deployment and active wallet usage are catching attention. While its pace is slower than peers, ADA is regaining confidence as a stable growth play—and some are looking at it as an undervalued opportunity heading into summer. Ethereum Anchors Portfolios With ETF Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is holding near $2,700 , bolstered by anticipation of spot ETF approval and strong Layer-2 expansion. While not as high-risk as other altcoins, ETH continues to provide solid upside potential for portfolios seeking stability in a rapidly evolving market. Cosmos (ATOM) Builds Developer Engagement Cosmos (ATOM) is seeing renewed developer activity and ecosystem interest. With cross-chain infrastructure gaining traction, ATOM may be one of the more underrated projects quietly building momentum behind the scenes. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s strength is creating the conditions for the next round of high-return altcoin plays. While XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum offer layered value, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that currently holds the greatest potential for exponential returns . As early entry narrows and capital flows accelerate, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive opportunity of 2025.

The reason and point of understanding is written below: The decision to take profit from XRP and shift to ETH is a matter of capital appreciation (Increase in USD value) rather than believing in a crash… — Doctor Profit (@DrProfitCrypto) May 20, 2025 Doctor Profit also made it clear that this move doesn’t mean he’s lost faith in XRP. He still sees it as a good long-term option and plans to buy back in when market conditions improve. “XRP is still one of my favorite long-term projects. I’ll look to re-enter when the time is right,” he added. What Made Him Choose Ethereum? Ethereum has seen steady price growth over the past few weeks. Many market experts believe ETH could be preparing for another price jump, especially with important updates and events lined up. Doctor Profit’s move is a good example of how traders often book profits from one coin and invest those gains into another, based on current market opportunities. With Ethereum performing well compared to many other cryptocurrencies lately, it makes sense for traders to consider it for fresh entries. XRP Price Analysis XRP is maintaining a bullish market structure since its April lows, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows. The token is currently back testing a key support range, historically a bullish move in uptrend scenarios. If XRP can hold above its April low of $1.64 and break above the key resistance at $2.59, it could trigger a big rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 03:01:32

The trio misled investors while selling “rights certificates” linked to an unissued Unicoin token. The complaint , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, May 20, names chief executive and board chairman Alex Konanykhin, former president Silvina Moschini, and former chief investment officer Alex Dominguez. According to the SEC, the defendants inflated asset values and wrongly implied federal approval to boost sales. “We allege that Unicoin and its executives exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises that its tokens, when issued, would be backed by real-world assets including an international portfolio of valuable real estate holdings,” said Mark Cave, associate director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “But as we allege, the real estate assets were worth a mere fraction of what the company claimed, and the majority of the company’s sales of rights certificates were illusory,” he added. The agency says Unicoin placed ads in airports, thousands of New York City taxis, on television, and on social media, portraying the certificates as a safe “next-generation” digital investment. More than 5,000 people bought in, believing each certificate would later convert one-for-one into Unicoin tokens. Unicoin CEO sold 37.9 million of his own certificates Investigators highlight three key misstatements. First, executives said the future tokens were “asset-backed” by billions of dollars in property and stakes in pre-IPO firms, even though company assets were only a fraction of that figure. Second, they boasted of selling more than $3 billion in certificates, while actual proceeds never exceeded $110 million. Third, they described the certificates and tokens as “SEC-registered” or “U.S. registered,” though no registration had been filed. The complaint also accuses Konanykhin and the company of running unregistered offerings. Regulators say the chief executive sold more than 37.9 million of his own rights certificates, often at a discount. Unicoin, Konanykhin, Moschini, and Dominguez are charged with violating antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC asked the court for “permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties ” and orders barring the trio from serving as officers or directors of public companies. The action also seeks civil fines against the company itself. The suit further names general counsel Richard Devlin, alleging he repeated similar false claims in private placement memoranda. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Devlin has agreed to a settlement that imposes a permanent injunction and a $37,500 civil penalty.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Bitcoin May Lead the Charge First",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-xrp-going-to-10-magacoin-finance-solana-and-bitcoin-may-lead-the-charge-first/,"Introduction With XRP showing strong technical structure and fresh investor interest, the question on every trader’s mind is whether a move to $10 is truly on the table. While XRP continues to gain strength, a handful of other tokens are already accelerating ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm, Solana (SOL) is maintaining bullish pressure—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning into one of the most talked-about early-stage altcoins of 2025. Alongside them, Polkadot (DOT) is starting to reenter investor conversations, rounding out a lineup of assets that could lead this cycle before XRP fully ignites. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as a Front-Runner MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most aggressively positioned altcoins on the market. Now entering the final stretch of Stage 8 , the project has raised over $8 million and is gaining attention for its unique mix of political narrative, capped supply, and high-engagement community. With a verified HashEx audit and a target listing price of $0.007 , analysts are treating it as a legitimate high-upside contender for this year’s altcoin breakout list. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from others in the meme and political token space is its structure. Investors from Bitcoin, Solana, and even XRP communities are now reallocating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for one reason: it still offers real asymmetric entry in a market where most plays are already priced in. XRP’s $10 Ambition: Hype or Reality? XRP is once again at the center of bullish speculation, with analysts and investors debating whether the token can reach the coveted $10 mark. As of May 2025, XRP is trading around $2.33–$2.60, buoyed by regulatory clarity after Ripple’s settlement with the SEC and renewed institutional interest. But is $10 a realistic target in the near or medium term—and what role do MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Bitcoin play in this evolving narrative? Bitcoin Anchors the Market, Fuels Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) : Bitcoin remains the benchmark, stabilizing above $100,000 and projected to reach $200,000–$250,000 by year-end as institutional demand outpaces new supply. Its continued dominance is setting a bullish tone for the entire crypto sector. Solana Maintains Its Position as the Cycle’s Layer-1 Leader Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $158–$175, with bullish forecasts targeting $240–$280 later in 2025 as its ecosystem grows and institutional adoption rises. SOL’s consistent performance is prompting some investors to rotate profits into emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside Polkadot Reenters the Spotlight on Ecosystem Revival Polkadot (DOT) is seeing a slow but steady return to relevance, with ecosystem upgrades and parachain innovations reviving investor interest. While still early in its rebound, DOT could become a solid rotation play as attention spreads beyond the biggest names. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP may be heading toward $10, but the path there may be paved by faster-moving tokens first. MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana , and Bitcoin are leading the charge, attracting early capital and building strong positioning in Q2 2025. With MAGACOIN FINANCE nearing Stage 8 completion, this could be one of the most time-sensitive opportunities in the market today.

Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH’s total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble’s size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups – Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum’s ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset’s market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum’s impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset’s future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH’s 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ​​In another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle’s upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum’s daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her “Talk Tuah” podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother’s house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam. “After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’” Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who “interrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.” “They cleared me, I was good to go,” Welch said. Welch went viral for her response about an oral sex technique in a vox pop interview posted to YouTube in June. The HAWK memecoin, based on her viral catchphrase, launched in early December and almost immediately lost 90% of its value and blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps’ alleged insider wallets and snipers bought up and dumped massive quantities of the token at launch. Haliey Welch speaking on her Talk Tuah podcast about the HAWK memecoin. Source: YouTube Welch said on her podcast that the Securities and Exchange Commission also asked for her phone, and she sent it off “for two or three days” before she was cleared. Welch’s lawyer James Sallah told TMZ in March that the SEC “closed the investigation without making any findings against, or seeking any monetary sanctions from, Haliey.” “I trusted the wrong people” Welch admitted knowing very little about crypto before the HAWK memecoin and said she “trusted the wrong people” for the launch. She claimed a company, which she said she couldn’t name for legal reasons, was in full control of her X account, which posted videos of her promoting the memecoin. Welch said she was sent lines to record on video, which were then posted on her X account by someone she trusted but could also not legally name. She added that on the day of HAWK’s launch, she “kind of knew something was up” and was pulled into a room where a team of people told her to talk on a livestream with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, better known as Coffeezilla. “Coffeezilla got on there and they're like ‘Mute it, mute it,’” Welch said. “Nobody warned me about this guy at all, like nobody at all, they didn't tell me he was like a crypto wizard, that's exactly what he is — he ate me the fuck up.” Related: Justin Sun to attend Trump's dinner with memecoin backers Welch said she was only paid a marketing fee and “did not make a dime from the coin itself,” which she said had been totally spent on legal and public relations fees. A now-deleted post where Welch shared the HAWK token’s tokenomics before it launched. Source: X Despite being cleared of any legal wrongdoing, Welch took some accountability, admitting that she let many of her fans down who invested in the coin: “It makes me feel really bad that they trusted me, and I led them to something that I did not have enough knowledge about. I did not have enough knowledge about crypto to be getting involved with it. And I knew that, but I got talked into it, and I trusted the wrong people.” A group of HAWK buyers sued the alleged creators of the token in December, claiming Alex Schultz, the token’s backing Tuah the Moon Foundation, the token launchpad overHere Limited, and its founder Clinton So promoted and sold HAWK as an unregistered security.

But this statement didn’t sit well with pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan, who has been actively tracking the lawsuit. Bill quickly responded, saying, “FFS the case is not closed, or did you miss the news last week about an unsuccessful motion for an indicative ruling and an Appeal and Cross-appeal in abeyance but not over.” Another user replied to Bill, saying that the case had hit a procedural snag because both Ripple and the SEC submitted a dismissal request using the wrong form. According to them, this technical error led the judge to reject it. FFS the case is not closed, or did you miss the news last week about an unsuccessful motion for an indicative ruling and an Appeal and Cross-appeal in abeyance but not over — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 19, 2025 However, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel stepped in, clarifying that the situation was far more serious than just a simple paperwork issue. “That is not an accurate description at all. It’s a far bigger issue than that,” he commented. Bill Morgan, expressing his frustration, remarked, “The XRP community don’t want to listen. They want to hear ‘case closed, XRP to the moon.’” For the unversed, here’s what actually happened: Judge Analisa Torres denied both parties’ motions for an indicative ruling. In simple terms, the judge stated that if the court’s jurisdiction were restored, she would deny the motion as it was filed under the wrong procedural rule. This means Ripple and the SEC will likely have to refile the motion correctly, and possibly plead their case once again. While XRP supporters are eagerly awaiting good news, it’s clear from the legal experts’ comments that the lawsuit is still ongoing — and there are a few more legal hurdles to clear before any final outcome.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 04:04:50

The suit, brought to federal court on May 13, claims the company violated Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by capturing users’ facial data without proper notice or consent. Consumer Fraud and Data Breach Charges According to the submission , users were asked to upload a government ID and a selfie as part of the sign-up procedure. These images were then sent to third-party facial recognition tools that analyzed facial features like geometry and faceprints. However, the suit claims this was done without the consent of users, which the violates BIPA. “At no point during the verification process are Coinbase users asked to consent to the collection of their biometric information, notified that their biometric data will be collected by an unrelated third party, nor provided with any information about the process,” the lawsuit states. The complaint also accuses Coinbase of transmitting this data to several third-party vendors, including Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris, without getting permission from the parties. Further, the document reveals that over 10,000 individuals filed arbitration demands, but Coinbase’s refusal to pay the required fees led to their cases being dismissed. As a result, the plaintiffs have charged the exchange with three claims of violating state biometric privacy laws and one for consumer fraud under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. They are seeking damages of $5,000 for every reckless or intentional violation, and $1,000 for each negligent one. The group has also lodged an order to stop the alleged data practices and wants Coinbase to cover its court costs. A Privacy Time Bomb This is not Coinbase’s first involvement in such legal troubles. In May 2023, similar action was taken over the company’s handling of facial recognition during onboarding. Meanwhile, the exchange is also dealing with the fallout from a recent data breach in which customer support agents were allegedly bribed to leak sensitive customer information. That incident caused at least six separate class-action lawsuits between May 15 and May 16, with Coinbase being accused of negligence, poor cybersecurity measures, and a slow response. Nanak Nihal Khalsa co-founder of Holonym, a privacy-focused identity company, said the problem is bigger than just the platform. “The Coinbase breach proves what we’ve known all along, KYC without zero knowledge is a privacy time bomb. You can’t collect and warehouse millions of user identities without eventually becoming both a target and a liability.” Khalsa added that users should not have to give up privacy just to access crypto services. According to the specialist, the future of identity is not in storing data but in using zero-knowledge tools that let people prove who they are without giving away personal details.

However, Blackstone’s investment, reported in a May 20 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, only totaled around $1.08 million — a fraction of the asset manager’s $1.2 trillion portfolio. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) as of March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, Google Finance data shows. The filing shows Blackstone also bought 4,300 shares in crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) for a total cost of $6,300 and spent $181,166 scooping up 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). Despite its claim as an “alternative asset manager,” Blackstone has largely stayed away from crypto. In September 2019, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman said he liked the concept of blockchain but thought its use for money was “pretty odd.” “[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” he said at the time. He admitted he didn’t have much interest in crypto, citing difficulties understanding the technology. Related: Bitcoin is signaling a golden cross — What does it mean for BTC price?

Latest Delay Explained,https://coinpedia.org/news/when-will-sec-approve-an-xrp-etf-latest-delay-explained/,"The post When Will SEC Approve an XRP ETF? Latest Delay Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Once again, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has hit the pause button on an XRP ETF proposal , this time from 21Shares. While it may sound disappointing, this delay is more routine than alarming. In fact, it would be way towards the approval of the XRP ETF. Despite such a massive news of delay XRP coin saw a slight a 2% drop in price in the last 24 hours. It’s Not a No—It’s Just “Not Yet The proposal from 21Shares to launch a spot XRP ETF is now delayed. But this is not a surprise. The SEC follows a long process before making decisions, and delays like this are very common. They usually take several months—up to 240 days—to review, gather public feedback, and study market data.So far, the SEC hasn’t approved any altcoin ETF—not even for Solana. It’s still testing the waters, just like it did with Bitcoin and Ethereum before giving them the green light. XRP Isn’t Alone in the Waiting Room This delay doesn’t just affect 21Shares. Other XRP ETF proposals from Franklin Templeton and Bitwise have also been pushed back earlier this year. But here’s the good news, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were also delayed many times before they were approved. It’s just how the process works. In fact, crypto analyst James Seyffart believes the SEC might take action by late June or sometime in the last quarter of this year. So, the wait may not be too long. Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Positive Signs Are Already Here Even though there’s no ETF yet, XRP is moving forward in other ways. Regulated XRP futures have already gone live this week, showing that institutions are getting more comfortable with the token. That’s a big step toward wider acceptance. And according to Polymarket predictions, there’s an 83% chance that an XRP ETF will be approved by the end of 2024. That shows strong confidence in XRP’s future. XRP Saw temporary Dip, But Long-Term Hope After the news of the delay, XRP’s price fell by about 2%, now trading around $2.35.

The latest data from TradingView shows Tuesday's candle ended (UTC) at $106,830, the highest-ever daily closing price. The bullish move came as investors poured money into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid chaotic price action in bond markets that suggested heightened concerns about the fiscal health of major economies, including the U.S. Analysts told CoinDesk last week that the worsening fiscal debt situation could bode well for BTC and other assets such as gold. The Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index , which measures the percentage difference between the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and the price on Binance (USDT trading pair), remained positive, indicating a persistent buying pressure from the U.S.-based investors. With the uptrend in progress, the next key level to watch is $110,000. Data from Deribit's BTC options market, tracked by Amberdata, shows dealers or market makers hold a large net "" negative gamma"" exposure at the $110,000 level.

The bill seeks to create the “Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” which would allow the state to invest in Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy. With the Senate already on board, the proposal now awaits the governor’s final approval. The 8th largest economy in the world will now be allowed to buy Bitcoin. This is indeed a bullish start! BREAKING: Texas has just passed the Texas Strategic #Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act, allowing the state to invest in $BTC . The bill now awaits Governor's approval to become law. pic.twitter.com/ybIAAjOEgE — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) May 20, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: SEC Charges America’s First Crypto Company in $100 Million Crypto Scam , Laying the Groundwork While SB 21 doesn’t specify how much Bitcoin the state will purchase, it sets up the legal foundation to begin. According to the Texas Blockchain Council, the bill is scheduled for a vote in the House and, if passed, will mark a historic move toward Bitcoin adoption at the state level. Texas is following in President Trump’s footsteps by calling for a national Bitcoin reserve . However, other states like New Hampshire and Arizona have already passed similar measures, beating Texas in the race to lead U.S. crypto integration. What’s Next? Lee Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council told Axios that while SB 21 sets up the reserve, separate legislation is being prepared to decide how much Bitcoin the state will actually allocate to the fund. That decision, however, remains pending. If signed into law, Texas could soon become a major player in government-backed Bitcoin investments, further cementing the state’s pro-crypto stance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Sharing insights from several key industry figures and government sources, Crypto Sensei outlined how Australia is leveraging distributed ledger technology to modernize its financial infrastructure. COUNTRIES ARE READY FOR #XRP ADOPTION! (BREAKING XRP NEWS) pic.twitter.com/953xKBv8Lq — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) May 18, 2025 Ripple’s recent joint report with the Digital Economy Council of Australia (DECA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) explores the policy framework needed to support real-world asset tokenization . Crypto Sensei noted that the report identifies a “$12 billion annual gain” in productivity for existing markets and highlights the opportunity to create liquidity in traditionally illiquid assets. These developments are expected to transform asset accessibility, including in the housing sector, by enabling fractional ownership through tokenization. He also drew attention to the comparative lag in the U.S., contrasting it with the progress. Ripple’s Expanding Network in Australia Ripple has been active in the region for years. Crypto Sensei shared a clip where Eric Van Miltenburg, Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Business, confirmed the expansion of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors into Australia and other parts of the globe. Ripple’s reach also extends into local fintech ecosystems. Hai Ha Money Transfer, an Australian remittance firm, has partnered with Ripple for three years. Its CEO, Diane Nguyen, explained how Ripple’s technology improves liquidity and speeds up international transfers.

The project also includes Fireblocks and R3. Crypto Hulk added context by referencing Dilip Rao, a key figure in the development of the XRP Ledger, who later worked with the Reserve Bank of Australia. Hulk also pointed out early signs of Ripple’s Australian engagement dating back to 2015. Government and Regulatory Support Political backing is another factor in Australia’s crypto momentum. While the U.S. regulatory landscape is improving , other countries are in a better position. Andrew Charlton, recently appointed Assistant Minister for the Digital Economy, affirmed that “cryptocurrency is no longer just an emerging technology,” and that the government aims to balance innovation with consumer protection. Monica Long, President of Ripple, also highlighted Australia’s significance as one of the company’s key corridors, alongside Singapore and Europe. She confirmed the company’s plans to meet this demand with RLUSD, its stablecoin, and Australia’s pro-crypto advancements, positioning it as a leading force in the global shift toward digital assets.

Here Are 2 Altcoins Going Viral,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/finding-the-next-crypto-to-explode-500-like-ripple-xrp-here-are-2-altcoins-going-viral/,"Ripple (XRP) has long been a crypto poster child for dramatic price surges. It is known to have exploded by over 500% in the past, fetching those who stuck with it gargantuan profits. But with its legal issue rearing its ugly head, XRP doesn’t look like replicating those meteoric rallies anytime soon. Instead, investors are looking towards Remittix (RTX) and Sui crypto tokens for such types of returns. Do these trailblazing tokens have what it takes to deliver? Let’s find out. Remittix holders prepare for a rocket price surge Remittix is a cross-border payments solution that bridges crypto and fiat seamlessly. Users send crypto, and recipients get instant bank transfers, with no blockchain complexity involved. With a flat-fee structure and support for 30+ fiat currencies, Remittix is poaching users from traditional giants like Wise and Western Union. The numbers speak volumes: over $15.2M raised in presale, more than half a billion tokens sold, and a 500% price increase since launch. These are metrics of a high-potential crypto token that is heading to the top. Crypto analysts expect Remittix to appreciate by at least 1,000% before its presale concludes, which makes its entry price of $0.0781 extremely attractive to investors. Even more, the coin’s presale is nearly concluded, which means that an exchange listing is imminent. When this happens, analysts expect the RTX price to surge to the moon. SUI crypto price booms 75% as institutional interest rises SUI is a Layer-1 blockchain platform that focuses on offering secure, scalable, and powerful decentralized applications. This means that it operates in an extremely competitive crypto niche, but that hasn’t stifled SUI. Over the last month, SUI price appreciated by 75%, hitting $4 for the first time since January. Sui derivatives volume. Source: CoinGlass In addition to that, institutional interest in SUI is rising. The coin recently saw weekly inflows to the tune of $9.3 million, eclipsing the likes of Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Should this continue, SUI could retest $4 and even hit a new high above $5. Can XRP price rediscover past meteoric forms? In late 2024, XRP surged by over 400% within weeks, sending shockwaves throughout the crypto world. Fast forward to May 2025, and XRP is once again in the spotlight. But this time, XRP isn’t making the news for spurious rallies; people are commenting about its never-ending SEC case and its struggles. After a US judge threw out a motion to finally resolve its case with the SEC, XRP has steadily declined. The coin has fallen from above $2.6 to around $2.3. While this drop is minimal, several signals suggest a bearish XRP run could be in the works. Source: TradingView In essence, XRP is displaying a classic head-and-shoulders pattern, which is basically a higher peak flanked by two lower peaks. It has bearish tendencies, and analysts suggest XRP could drop to $2 or lower should the status quo remain. Conclusion It would be difficult for XRP to embark on another 500% rally. Sui crypto might rally remarkably given its current momentum, but the resulting returns are likely to be minimal. Remittix, on the other hand, is set to rocket to the stars and fetch as much as a 10x profit for early investors. That’s because it packs immense potential to disrupt the global remittances market. This makes it the optimal choice for crypto investors who want to maximize their profits in 2025.

44887842,https://coinpaper.com/9204/strive-buys-discounted-btc-while-germany-sells-billions-too-early,1747805400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Strive Buys Discounted BTC While Germany Sells Billions Too Early,https://coinpaper.com/9204/strive-buys-discounted-btc-while-germany-sells-billions-too-early,"Bitcoin asset management strategies are diverging sharply between governments and institutions. In 2024, the German government liquidated nearly 50,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $57,900, missing out on more than $2 billion in gains as BTC surged past $106,000. Meanwhile, US-based investment firm Strive is taking the opposite approach and accumulating Bitcoin by purchasing distressed Mt. Gox claims at a discount. Strive Targets Mt. Gox Claims to Expand Bitcoin Holdings Ahead of Asset Entities Merger Vivek Ramaswamy’s Bitcoin strategy is entering a bold new phase. Strive, the investment firm co-founded by the former Republican presidential candidate, has disclosed a plan to acquire distressed Bitcoin claims from the long-defunct Mt. Gox exchange, an aggressive play designed to accelerate its transformation into a full-fledged Bitcoin treasury company. In a May 20 regulatory filing , Strive revealed it has partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target legally validated but undelivered claims tied to over 75,000 BTC—currently worth more than $8 billion at market prices. These claims are part of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate, which has yet to fully repay creditors more than a decade after the infamous 2014 collapse. The move, according to Strive, is aimed at acquiring Bitcoin at a significant discount compared to current spot prices. Since Mt. Gox claimants are often willing to accept less than full value in order to gain liquidity, Strive sees the opportunity as both financially compelling and strategic. By accumulating BTC through discounted claims, Strive aims to increase its Bitcoin -per-share ratio, thereby enhancing shareholder value, especially ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities (ASST), a publicly traded social media marketing company. Unlike a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) structure, which imposes additional regulatory and operational constraints, Strive argues the reverse merger offers greater flexibility in executing Bitcoin purchases and treasury management strategies. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger (Source: Strive ) The firm said it will soon file a proxy statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) outlining the full terms of the proposed Mt. Gox transaction. Shareholder approval will be required before Strive can proceed, and time is of the essence as Mt. Gox’s trustee is expected to begin full creditor repayments by Oct. 31, 2025. If Strive successfully acquires the claims before the repayment window closes, it could secure a substantial BTC cache at steep discounts, an outcome that would immediately elevate its standing among corporate Bitcoin holders. Mt. Gox: A Brief Background Once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after a massive security breach led to the loss of approximately 750,000 BTC, worth just hundreds of millions at the time, but tens of billions today. Since then, trustees have recovered and secured more than 140,000 BTC, with various entities and individuals holding legal claims. The repayment process has been slow and complicated by legal wrangling, evolving crypto regulations, and logistical hurdles. Strive is now capitalizing on this complexity, hoping to become a middleman between Mt. Gox and the open market by acquiring the right to those BTC allocations from existing claimants. Strive’s pivot toward Bitcoin mirrors a growing trend among companies looking to embed BTC into their balance sheets as a strategic reserve asset, a movement gaining significant momentum in 2025. A key example is Twenty One Capital, the Jack Mallers-backed Bitcoin treasury startup, which is preparing to launch with 42,000 BTC and has received strategic backing from Tether, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm is also merging via a blank-check deal with Cantor Equity Partners. Asset Entities Stock Surges on Merger News The market has responded positively to Strive’s plans. Shares of Asset Entities (ASST) surged 18.2% on May 20, closing at $7.74, according to Google Finance. The surge puts its current market capitalization at $122.1 million, representing a staggering 1,170% gain since the merger was first announced on May 7. Asset Entities share price (Source: Google Finance ) Following the reverse merger, Strive is expected to control 94.2% of the combined company, with Asset Entities shareholders retaining the remaining 5.8%. The merged firm will continue trading under the ASST ticker, but will operate under the unified brand name: Strive and Asset Entities. With strong market interest, favorable legal timing, and a clear path to gaining discounted BTC exposure, Strive is positioning itself to become a major corporate holder of Bitcoin, potentially rivaling firms like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Tether in scale and ambition. For Strive, the combination of a Bitcoin accumulation strategy and a reverse public market entry could establish a new model for digital asset treasury management. The firm is betting that Bitcoin’s long-term value appreciation will outweigh the risks involved in acquiring legacy claims. Should shareholder approval be granted and the Mt. Gox repayment schedule remain on track, the next six months could be transformative—not just for Strive, but for the emerging corporate Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. With regulatory oversight intensifying and macroeconomic volatility shaking confidence in fiat currencies, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly attractive hedge, and Strive is among the latest to make a bold, strategic bet. German Government Missed Out on Over $2 Billion in Bitcoin Gains After 2024 Sell-Off Meanwhile, Germany’s federal authorities may have inadvertently cost taxpayers billions of dollars by selling off a massive trove of Bitcoin far too early, according to a new analysis by blockchain intelligence platform Arkham. The decision to liquidate tens of thousands of BTC in mid-2024 has now become a cautionary tale in the world of government-managed digital assets, with missed profits exceeding $2.35 billion. In a post on X, Arkham revealed that a wallet labeled “German Government (BKA)” sold 49,858 BTC, worth around $2.89 billion at the time, between June and July of 2024. The average sale price of approximately $57,900 now looks deeply discounted in hindsight, as Bitcoin currently trades above $106,000, per CoinMarketCap. “If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24 billion,” Arkham stated. Seized Bitcoin Sold in Haste The funds were originally believed to have been confiscated by German law enforcement from Movie2k, a major piracy platform that was shut down in 2013. The site’s operators reportedly laundered tens of millions of euros through digital assets, including the nearly 50,000 BTC eventually transferred into a government-controlled wallet. The first signs of an impending sell-off emerged on June 19, 2024, when the wallet made a transfer of 6,500 BTC, valued at over $425 million, triggering speculation among analysts and market watchers about a coordinated liquidation strategy. However, that speculation quickly turned into confusion and concern as on-chain activity revealed that the German government was dispersing the BTC across multiple exchanges, rather than working with over-the-counter (OTC) desks or institutional brokers. The move sparked volatility in the Bitcoin markets and drew criticism for its lack of tactical finesse. Timeline of events (Source: CoinMarketCap) While the government’s intention may have been to maximize liquidity or preempt regulatory or market risks, the aftermath of the sale paints a stark picture. Arkham estimates that the early exit cost Germany over $2.35 billion in potential profit, given Bitcoin’s explosive 80% rally since the sell-off. Bitcoin’s price dipped sharply throughout June and early July 2024, a period that coincided with the BKA wallet’s most active selling. Analysts believe it was not the sheer amount of BTC sold, but rather the public knowledge of the sale that intensified bearish sentiment across the market. Bitcoin Price Recovers After Wallet Drains Interestingly, Bitcoin staged a recovery almost immediately after the German government wallet was depleted. On July 14, 2024, BTC rose back above the psychologically important $60,000 level, marking the end of a multi-week period of price suppression and investor caution. Amid the turmoil, Tron founder Justin Sun publicly offered to purchase the government’s Bitcoin stack, valued at over $2.3 billion at the time, directly from the state, in order to “minimize market impact.” Sun’s proposal echoed a broader conversation within crypto circles about transparency, responsibility, and the systemic risk posed by large, sudden liquidations of digital assets by public institutions. Lessons for Global Regulators The German experience is now likely to serve as a reference point for other countries managing seized or tax-recovered crypto assets. Several governments, including the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, have begun exploring digital asset auctions or structured sales to reduce adverse market effects. As more jurisdictions deal with seized digital assets, analysts suggest governments should collaborate more closely with crypto-native custodians, financial advisors, and institutional trading desks to optimize their strategy—and reduce public losses. The missed windfall comes at a time when Bitcoin has increasingly been embraced by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate treasuries as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical instability. In 2025 alone, inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $20 billion, and sovereign wealth funds are rumored to be testing crypto allocations. Germany, one of the EU’s most economically powerful nations, had the rare opportunity to become a top sovereign Bitcoin holder. Instead, its decision to sell may go down as one of the most financially shortsighted in the history of public crypto asset management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 05:30:00

Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade’s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it’s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric’s value goes down, it’s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn’t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. “Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) – but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),” notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week.

Meanwhile, Bancor launched a separate lawsuit against Uniswap, accusing the DeFi giant of patent infringement for using its constant product AMM technology without permission. This was a system Bancor claims it pioneered in 2016. Adding to the turmoil, bankrupt crypto lender Genesis sued parent company DCG and CEO Barry Silbert for allegedly siphoning more than $1 billion through fraudulent loans and misleading transactions. The Genesis lawsuit seeks to recover more than $3.3 billion. Unicoin Hit With SEC Lawsuit The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency platform Unicoin and three of its top executives, accusing them of misleading investors and raising $100 million through deceptive and unsubstantiated claims. The charges were announced on May 20 and filed in Manhattan federal court. Press release (Source: SEC ) The lawsuit names Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former investment chief Alex Dominguez as defendants. According to the SEC, the three made false and misleading statements about so-called “rights certificates” that investors purchased, believing they granted access to future Unicoin tokens and equity in the company. Unicoin executives The SEC alleges that these certificates were aggressively marketed as being backed by real-world assets, including a diversified international portfolio of valuable real estate. However, the regulator pointed out that the real estate assets were worth only a fraction of what was advertised, and most of the investment claims made to the public were either inflated or entirely fictitious. Associate Director of Enforcement Mark Cave stated that the executives exploited thousands of investors by promoting false opportunities that had little to no foundation in reality. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Unicoin and the people involved, along with disgorgement of what the SEC described as “ill-gotten gains.” This case is now part of the regulator’s scrutiny of crypto-related fundraising practices that skirt securities laws. Bancor Sues Uniswap for Patent Infringement Other crypto projects are also facing legal trouble. Bancor, a pioneer in decentralized finance and creator of one of the earliest automated market maker (AMM) protocols, filed a lawsuit against Uniswap, alleging patent infringement related to the core technology that powers modern decentralized exchanges. The lawsuit was announced on May 20 and was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. It accuses Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation of using Bancor’s patented invention without authorization and profiting from it. Bancor press release According to Bancor, the disputed technology revolves around the concept of a “constant product automated market maker”—which is a mathematical model that governs how assets are added to or withdrawn from liquidity pools. Bancor claims to have developed this method in 2016 and secured patents for it in early 2017. This innovation later became a foundational component of many DeFi platforms, and enabled token swaps without relying on traditional order books. Bancor alleges that Uniswap, which launched its protocol in November of 2018, utilized this same invention without permission and since became one of the most dominant players in the DeFi space as a result. Mark Richardson, project lead at Bancor, stated that the decision to take legal action stems from Uniswap’s continued use of Bancor’s technology without a license, and that such unchecked behavior could undermine future innovation in the sector. Top DEXs by 24 hour volume (Source: DefiLlama ) Despite being the originator of the AMM concept, Bancor has not matched Uniswap’s success in terms of trading activity. According to data from DeFi analytics platform DefiLlama , Uniswap ranks second among all decentralized exchanges with close to $3.7 billion in 24-hour trading volume on May 20. Bancor, by contrast, was ranked 142nd, with a comparatively modest daily volume of $378,579. Uniswap has processed an impressive $2.8 trillion in total trading volume since its inception. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for what Bancor describes as the unlicensed use of its patented system and wants to hold the Uniswap Foundation accountable for encouraging the continued infringement. Genesis Sues DCG and Barry Silbert for Fraud To add to the legal onslaughts in the crypto industry, Genesis filed two lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of orchestrating a massive scheme involving fraud, reckless mismanagement, and the siphoning of more than $1 billion in value from the now-bankrupt firm. The allegations were brought forth by Genesis through its Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), and claim that DCG and its affiliates drained funds via self-serving loans, concealed transactions, and manipulative accounting practices, ultimately misleading creditors and pushing Genesis further toward insolvency. A key component of the lawsuit was unsealed on May 19 in Delaware’s Court of Chancery. It describes how DCG allegedly treated Genesis like a corporate ATM by extracting over a million digital coins—valued at $2.1 billion—while providing a false impression of Genesis’s financial strength. The complaint also shared more details about how Silbert and other insiders, including former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG CFO Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy, and investment banking partner Ducera Partners, conducted sham transactions at the end of multiple financial quarters in 2022. These moves were allegedly designed to mislead Genesis lenders into believing DCG was injecting liquidity into the lender, while in reality, the support was largely an illusion. Among the most damaging claims is that Genesis was forced to accept illiquid shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as collateral—shares that were not only locked for six months due to SEC restrictions but were also explicitly prohibited from resale by DCG even after the lockup period ended. Genesis creditors are still owed an estimated $2.2 billion in crypto assets, including over 19,000 Bitcoin and almost 70,000 Ethereum. In a second lawsuit that was filed in US Bankruptcy Court, Genesis accused DCG and affiliates of withdrawing more than $1.2 billion in digital and fiat assets during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy filing. These withdrawals allegedly took place during periods of extreme market stress, including the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX, at a time when Genesis was already insolvent . According to internal documents, insiders managed to recover nearly all their funds, while retail and institutional investors were left to shoulder the losses. DCG dismissed the lawsuits as baseless and opportunistic, and claims that the complaints recycle outdated accusations and ignore efforts that were made to resolve matters through negotiations. Nevertheless, Genesis is now seeking to recover over $3.3 billion through these legal actions.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|UNI,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 05:31:20

In his first major congressional appearance, Atkins faced tough questions about the agency’s handling of crypto fraud cases, particularly its pause in proceedings against Justin Sun and the growing political noise around meme coins tied to Donald Trump . The hearing spotlighted concerns about regulatory inconsistency, lack of transparency, and possible political misuse. Lawmakers Raise Eyebrows Over Justin Sun and Meme Coins During the May 20 House Appropriations Committee hearing , Rep. Glenn Ivey questioned why the SEC appeared to slow-roll its fraud case against Sun, who recently disclosed he’s a top holder of a Trump-themed meme coin. This came after Tron’s $30 million token purchase from a Trump-inspired crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. While Atkins confirmed the case remains active, he avoided offering specific details, fueling speculation about external influence or internal hesitation. New Chair Signals Shift in SEC’s Crypto Strategy This sudden shift is quite fishy for senators, even though Atkins’ presence has been seen as a positive shift from Biden-Gensler’s restrictive move. In his testimony, he stressed the need for structured guidelines around issuance, custody, and trading of digital assets. His emphasis on policy-making rather than litigation hints at a softer stance going forward. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: SEC Charges America’s First Crypto Company in $100 Million Crypto Scam , Crypto Task Force and Upcoming Policy Moves The SEC’s Crypto Task Force , now led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to release its first report in the coming months.

This expansion includes new partnerships with Zand Bank and Mamo in the UAE, marking a notable milestone in Ripple’s international growth. BIG NEWS: Ripple now helps businesses in 6 countries move money across borders in minutes using $XRP ! Now in Dubai, U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Australia, and Switzerland — with Zand Bank & Mamo just added in the UAE. — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) May 19, 2025 Ripple’s strategy to enhance cross-border payments has gained momentum in recent months, with several key developments supporting this trend. In April, Ripple integrated RLUSD, its stablecoin, into its Ripple Payments platform . This integration aims to improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border treasury operations for select customers, with plans to expand RLUSD’s use over time. One of the most impactful partnerships announced in April was the purchase of Hidden Road for $1.25 billion . This partnership positions XRP as a key player in mainstream financial transactions and enhances Ripple’s credibility among major financial institutions worldwide. It also makes Ripple the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. More Positive News for XRP In the UAE, Ripple’s recent licensing by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March paved the way for its official operations in the region. Following this, Ripple signed Zand Bank and Mamo as its first licensed blockchain payment clients in the UAE. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Both institutions will utilize Ripple Payments to enable fast, cost-effective cross-border transfers leveraging blockchain technology. The DFSA license addresses inefficiencies in legacy payment systems and supports the UAE’s growing fintech ecosystem. The company continues to onboard financial institutions across continents, including major banks in Brazil, Australia, and the United States, further reinforcing XRP’s role as a bridge currency in cross-border payments. XRP’s popularity is also growing, and the eagerness of both retail and institutional investors to engage with the asset shows its broad appeal. Excitement for XRP’s Future Recent developments demonstrate the accelerating adoption of XRP for cross-border payments across multiple countries. Santander, one of Ripple’s key partners, released a video outlining the importance of digital payments and how the crypto market could grow significantly by 2030 , and XRP is perfectly positioned to dominate this growing market. The combination of stablecoin integration, strategic partnerships with global giants, and regulatory clarity in key markets such as the UAE collectively affirm that countries are increasingly ready for XRP adoption in their financial infrastructure.

According to a May 20 complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Unicoin and its leadership, CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Maria Silvina Moschini, and former chief investment officer Alex Dominguez, made false claims while promoting “rights certificates” tied to a future token, Unicoin. The company marketed these certificates as asset-backed instruments, supposedly tied to a multi-billion-dollar real estate and pre-IPO equity portfolio. In reality, the SEC claims, the assets backing Unicoin were worth only a fraction of what was advertised. Of the real estate deals highlighted in Unicoin’s promotional materials, spanning Argentina, Thailand, and the Caribbean, many never closed, and their combined value was estimated at no more than $300 million. The SEC also disputes Unicoin’s claims that it raised over $3 billion from investors. The agency alleges that actual sales amounted to roughly $110 million, gathered from more than 5,000 investors worldwide. Additionally, Unicoin reportedly touted its offerings as SEC-compliant or “U.S. registered,” even though the certificates were never officially registered and failed to meet exemption requirements under federal securities law . You might also like: Crypto languished in ‘SEC limbo’ for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments Unicoin is also accused of distributing tokens via airdrops without verifying investor accreditation, which the SEC says constitutes another violation. CEO Konanykhin allegedly sold nearly 38 million certificates to investors who had previously been excluded to preserve the company’s legal standing. Unicoin’s general counsel, Richard Devlin, was also charged for his role in the scheme but has already settled with the SEC. Without admitting wrongdoing, he agreed to pay a $37,500 fine and accepted a permanent injunction. The SEC is seeking civil penalties, disgorgement of funds, and executive bans against the remaining defendants. In response, Konanykhin has denied the charges and vowed to challenge them in court, claiming the SEC’s actions damaged the company and blocked critical fundraising opportunities. Despite a massive shift toward more crypto- friendly policies under the Trump administration, the SEC continues to pursue enforcement in cases it views as involving clear fraud.

Traders are now locked onto Congress, where budget negotiations are stalling and blue state Republicans are throwing up roadblocks. The House’s massive federal budget bill hit a hard pause Tuesday when several GOP lawmakers refused to support it without a bigger write-off for state and local taxes, known as SALT. That demand is now threatening to derail the entire timeline for passage. Even with President Donald Trump getting directly involved in the talks, the standoff continues. The Republican leadership had initially aimed to pass the bill before Memorial Day weekend, but that goal is fading fast. And even if lawmakers in both chambers somehow reach a deal, the final version is expected to add more government debt, piling onto America’s already eye-watering $36 trillion deficit. SALT fight stalls Trump’s ‘beautiful bill’ The SALT issue has become a battle line. Republicans from states with high local taxes want the bill to allow a larger deduction, or they won’t vote for it. Their threat is serious enough that it’s delayed everything. Trump has been actively pushing behind closed doors, but his efforts haven’t yet unlocked the gridlock. The delay is making investors nervous, and they’re watching every move from Washington like hawks. The bigger concern is what comes after a deal… the consequences. If this bill goes through, analysts say it’s going to flood the bond market with more Treasury debt, which will likely drive interest rates up and hurt investor demand. Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a Tuesday note that Trump’s bill “is likely to see various amendments before it is passed in the two chambers of Congress and signed into law, but it nonetheless is expected to add trillions of dollars to the country’s [$36 trillion] deficit over the next decade.” She warned that this could push the supply of Treasury debt even higher, which means more strain on the bond market. At the same time, Stephen Juneau, a US economist at Bank of America , warned of a possible “bond-buyer-strike.” In his note, also released Tuesday, Juneau wrote, “Adding more supply to the market at a time when demand is softening could result in a spike in borrowing rates, a decline in the dollar, and a drop in equities. This could overwhelm any growth effects from the bill itself.” Wall Street slides as traders brace for budget chaos And the markets are already reacting. On Tuesday night, the S&P 500 closed down, breaking a six-day winning streak. The Nasdaq dropped too, logging its first red day in three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 100 points, snapping a three-day climb. By early Wednesday, futures tied to all three major indexes were also sliding. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures both dropped 0.3%, while the Dow gave up 120 points, or 0.28%. Investors had been hopeful just a few weeks ago. After Trump unveiled steep import tariffs back on April 2, markets dipped briefly, then staged a fast rebound. That rally had lifted all three indexes above their April levels, with the S&P 500 clawing back into the green for the year. The 30-year Treasury yield is now hovering just below 5%, a level not seen in years. Rising yields mean falling bond prices, and that spells trouble for a market already unsure about what comes next. Add the Moody’s credit downgrade from last week to the mix, and the pressure is stacking up fast. Meanwhile, the budget bill , originally billed as Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill,” may still pass, but not without wrecking confidence along the way. And until Congress figures out how to deal with SALT, debt, and the deficit without wrecking demand in the bond market, Wall Street has no choice but to sit and wait—with one eye on the headlines and the other on portfolios. There’s no major economic data scheduled for Wednesday, so for now, all eyes stay glued to Congress and the growing federal deficit.

At the time of writing, PI Coin ( PI ) is trading at $0.7796, up 6% over the last 24 hours. Still, it remains down 38% over the past week and more than 70% below its all-time high of $2.99, which was recorded in February. Trading volume also has risen slightly, with over $221 million in the past day, a 0.8% increase that suggests renewed market interest. Looking at the daily chart, technical indicators show mixed signals. The relative strength index is near 51, which points to a neutral trend. Meanwhile, momentum and moving average convergence divergence indicators show the persistence of some selling pressure. Pi Network price analysis. Credit: crypto.news While the 20- and 30-day moving averages have flipped to buy, indicating that some buying strength is returning, short-term moving averages, like the 10-day EMA and SMA, are still flashing sell signals. Support seems to be forming around $0.77, but the token will need to break above $0.84 to confirm a stronger recovery. You might also like: Pi Network price crashes amid insider sales, rug pull claims Although PI is showing early signs of recovery, it still faces significant challenges that could restrict any sustained price growth. Many users have been unable to access their coins since the mainnet’s February launch because of persistent Know Your Customer delays. This has caused frustration, especially among early miners who expected to freely use or trade their tokens. Concerns have also been raised regarding the coin’s absence from prominent exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Although PI is traded on sites such as Gate.io, Bitget, and OKX, the lack of a Tier 1 listing has kept liquidity low and held back wider adoption. Some community members believe the team’s limited transparency might be one reason for the lack of listings. There are also questions about the $100 million Pi Network Ventures fund, which was supposed to support new projects in the ecosystem, but has yet to show any progress. Despite having a large user base, possibly as many as 60 million, PI still has little practical application. Beyond speculation, there isn’t much demand for the token because there aren’t many widely used decentralized apps or decentralized finance services on the network. Events like PiFest have helped build hype, but without working products or real usage, price gains don’t tend to last. PI may target the $1 mark once more if it can maintain support above $0.77 and overcome resistance at $0.84. But if it doesn’t take off, prices might return to the $0.70 range. The price might find it difficult to increase much more unless important problems like token accessibility, exchange listings, and ecosystem growth are addressed.

Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Kaspa (KAS) have continued to show momentum, but another name is starting to rise. BlockDAG is now gaining attention with a strong mix of early access pricing, technical features, and growing support. Unlike projects that rely on hype, BlockDAG is grounded in real-world delivery and strategic development. Priced at just $0.0020 in its current presale, it offers a clear path to a confirmed launch price of $0.05, setting the stage for major returns. In this article, we look at how SOL, DOGE, and KAS are faring in today’s shifting landscape and why BlockDAG could soon be counted among the top crypto projects of 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Gem That Has Raised Over $258M! BlockDAG (BDAG) has become one of the most talked-about top crypto projects this year. Its $0.0020 presale entry stands out until June 13, which is much less than the $0.0262 original price of batch 28. With a confirmed launch value set at $0.05, those buying BDAG now are set for a projected ROI of 2,400%, making it a standout in today’s crowded space. To date, more than 20.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold and $258 million raised. This shows strong market interest. What gives BlockDAG an edge is its EVM-compatible Layer 1 setup, allowing it to run Ethereum dApps without added complexity. It’s a ready-to-use network from day one. The project has passed a full CertiK audit and has begun shipping its 17,000+ mining units, showing that it’s already active and functioning. Five exchange listings are already confirmed, and 15 more are planned to be revealed during the June 13 GO LIVE event, bringing the total to 20 platforms set to support BDAG. If you are watching for top crypto projects with real traction and early pricing, BlockDAG is one to keep in view. The $0.0020 level might not last much longer as it moves toward a wider market release. 2. Solana (SOL): Staying Strong with DeFi Growth Solana continues to demonstrate resilience. Trading near $173, SOL recovered after a decline sparked by FTX’s move to release $5 billion in assets, including $236 million worth of unstaked SOL. This update led to added sell pressure but hasn’t shaken Solana’s core strengths. Solana’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) jumped from $7.5 billion to $9.6 billion in May. Such growth reinforces its standing among the top crypto projects, especially for those focused on decentralized finance and practical use cases. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Standing Out in a Shifting Market Space Dogecoin, priced at approximately $0.2271, is showing it has staying power beyond its meme roots. The network recorded a 528% rise in active addresses after the SEC acknowledged a spot Dogecoin ETF filing by 21Shares. Futures open interest also rose by 70%, reaching $1.65 billion. Analysts suggest DOGE may push past $0.24 and aim for $0.40 if momentum persists. While its origins remain lighthearted, growing adoption and trading activity make DOGE a notable mention among top crypto projects. 4. Kaspa (KAS): Price Patterns Drive Positive Momentum Kaspa (KAS) gained 30% in the past week, currently trading at about $0.1189. A bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart and solid support at the $0.101 Fibonacci level are helping to boost confidence. Short-term expectations now target $0.1554. With strong community support, scalable architecture, and an engaged development team, Kaspa is earning its place among the top crypto projects gaining attention. Future Outlook: Emerging Strength Across the Board Solana’s DeFi expansion signals solid growth, Dogecoin is gaining traction through ETF developments, and Kaspa is showing strength with technical gains. Each has qualities that justify its place among top crypto projects today. BlockDAG, however, is the outlier rising fast. At $0.0020 and set for a $0.05 launch, it features EVM compatibility, a completed CertiK audit, and 20 exchange listings on the way. With over 20.8 billion coins already sold and 17,000 miners running, its foundation is already active. For those watching early-stage projects with solid structure and future promise, BlockDAG could be one of the top crypto projects to watch in 2025. It is gaining ground before broader market recognition arrives.

Institutional inflows remain steady, and long-term projections toward $250,000 are now more widely accepted than ever. But while Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, savvy investors are noticing a much faster-moving trend under the surface—one that’s shifting momentum toward smaller, faster, and more narrative-driven altcoins. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Quietly but rapidly, it has begun outpacing some of the biggest names in the space—including Solana , XRP , and HBAR —by wide margins. This isn’t just early hype. It’s a signal. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Why Everyone’s Talking About MAGACOIN FINANCE Right Now The speed at which MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the radar has taken many by surprise. Originally launched as a politically inspired altcoin, it’s since gained serious market traction thanks to strong fundamentals, bold branding, and capped supply mechanics that reward early positioning. What’s making traders pay close attention is the clear divergence in performance. While larger caps are still consolidating, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown consistent growth in both volume and community strength. Early metrics suggest it’s outperforming some competitors by as much as 10 to 1 —and that gap could widen once listings begin. A transparent roadmap, and rising organic attention, this project is no longer flying under the radar. Many believe it may become one of 2025’s defining early-stage altcoin stories. Solana Holds Support, But Lacks Immediate Breakout Solana (SOL) remains one of the most technically robust Layer-1s, but recent weeks have seen it trade in a tight range. Developers continue to build, but traders seeking rapid upside are beginning to rotate into faster-moving opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE while SOL consolidates. XRP Eyes Expansion but Faces Resistance XRP is stable above $2.30 and remains in accumulation mode ahead of the CME Futures launch. While long-term fundamentals are strong, short-term growth has slowed, giving investors time to seek higher-velocity opportunities elsewhere. HBAR Builds Slowly on Utility Strength HBAR continues to add enterprise-grade partnerships and long-term value through real-world integrations. However, its price performance has yet to reflect these developments, leading more aggressive investors to allocate toward higher-momentum plays. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Bitcoin’s rally is undeniable—but for those seeking real movement, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. With stronger growth than Solana , XRP , and HBAR combined, it’s emerging as one of the most compelling early-stage opportunities of 2025. For traders focused on speed, scarcity, and outsized return potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the move others are too late to catch.

Speaking before the House Budget Committee, Atkins was questioned about memecoin projects linked to President Donald Trump and his possible ties to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun. Democratic Representative Glenn Ivey drew attention to some events that took place before Trump’s inauguration in January. Ivey brought up the $30 million token purchase by Tron, a company owned by Justin Sun, from decentralized finance firm World Liberty Financial, which said it was inspired by Trump. The SEC later suspended the fraud case against Justin Sun and his companies. This development led to various speculations in the public. On the other hand, a memecoin connected to Trump is currently trading on the market and Trump is preparing to hold a special gala for the first 220 memecoin investors this week. “This situation doesn’t smell good to me, frankly. I hope the SEC looks into this connection,” Ivey said. Atkins, on the other hand, stated that the case against Sun is still “active” and reminded that the SEC does not classify memecoins as securities. Related News: Analyst Warns: “Bitcoin's Record High Has No Meaning, Focus on This Level Instead” Atkins, who was appointed by Trump, said that the institution had entered a “new era” after his predecessor Gary Gensler took a “hostile” stance against the crypto industry. During Gensler’s term, the SEC filed numerous lawsuits against the industry, but some of them were later dropped. In his written statement, Atkins described his plan for crypto regulation as “rulemaking through a notice and comment process.” “My primary goal during my presidency will be to develop a sound regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that operates with clear rules,” he said. “This framework will continue to deter malicious actors who engage in illegal activities while regulating issuance, custody and trading processes.” Republican Representative Chuck Edwards asked whether the SEC’s newly established crypto task force needed additional funding. The task force, established earlier this year by former interim chairman Mark Uyeda and led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, aims to clarify how securities laws apply to crypto by holding roundtables with industry representatives. “I don’t have a definitive opinion,” Atkins said. “The task force is comprised of existing staff and led by Commissioner Peirce, so there is no additional budget request,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

According to a May 21 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, trading volume has spiked as Ethereum ( ETH ) nears this resistance zone. This increase in activity has coincided with a spike in short-term profit-taking. When a market is said to be “overheating,” it typically means that prices have risen too quickly due to speculation rather than long-term conviction. In this instance, ETH’s quick 55% recovery over the last month after a 45% decline in Q1 raises the possibility that the rally may be about to pause or reverse. The overheated market suggests a potential short-term pullback, creating room for fresh accumulation once conditions stabilize. Technical data supports this view. The relative strength index, at 69, is hovering just below the overbought zone, a level that often precedes short-term corrections. Meanwhile, momentum is still positive and all of the major moving averages, from the 10-day to the 200-day, are pointing upward. This suggests that there is still strong underlying support even when the current price action has stalled. Ethereum price analysis. Credit: crypto.news If Ethereum is unable to break $2,700, it may retreat to the $2,300–$2,350 range, where support is starting to form. If there is a more significant correction, prices may approach $2,100. However, the rally may continue if ETH makes a strong breakout above $2,700 on high volume, particularly if there are positive developments to back up the breakout.

Behind the scenes, large players appear to be positioning for what could come next. On-chain data shows that since late April, large holders, wallets with more than 10,000 ETH, have accumulated more than 450,000 ETH. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds have seen $108 million in net inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . Now, a significant catalyst is approaching. By June 1st, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make a decision regarding the inclusion of staking in ETH ETFs. By allowing institutions to earn yield from these regulated products, it could stir a new wave of demand. Along with the demand for ETFs, London-based asset manager Abraxas Capital purchased 350,703 ETH, worth about $837 million, between May 7 and May 20. With favorable on-chain trends and increasing institutional appetite, Ethereum’s long-term narrative seems intact despite short-term pressures.

The altcoin dropped to $2,400 before staging another recovery and returning to $2,600. New data now point to the possibility of a short-term pullback before a potential breakout materializes. Cooling Period Before Breakout Ethereum’s market is showing signs of overheating as it nears the $2.5K resistance level. There has been a surge in trading volume, which indicates intensified activity. In fact, according to CryptoQuant’s latest report , the sharp uptick is attributed to profit-taking and the presence of resting supply at this key psychological level. As Ethereum enters an overheated state, analysts anticipate a short-term correction that could allow the market to cool before potential upside resumes. “Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term.” While short-term market signals suggest a cooling phase, long-term holders continue to accumulate the altcoin. Long-Term Conviction Ethereum’s presence on centralized exchanges has fallen to its lowest point in over a decade, driven by growing accumulation from institutional investors and large holders. As of May 19, Santiment reported that only 4.9% of the total ETH supply is held on trading venues, which represents a historic low. Over the past five years, 15.3 million ETH have been pulled from these platforms. Meanwhile, CryptoRank.io revealed that more than 1 million ETH exited exchanges in the last month alone. This trend suggests that users are leaning toward holding ETH long-term rather than trading it. On-chain data confirms this behavior as it shows whales – wallets with over 10,000 ETH – have accumulated 450,000 coins since late April. By May 10, they collectively held 40.75 million ETH, the highest level since March. Ethereum-linked investment products also saw a much-needed respite over the past week, recording inflows of $205 million during the period, amidst a renewed investor confidence following the Pectra upgrade. This brought its year-to-date total to $575 million.

Designed to use the BEP-20 protocol on Binance Smart Chain, $KOPS provides high-speed, cost-effective transactions, support for Ethereum interoperability, and access to a versatile ecosystem that spans two chains. $KOPS is aiming for a decentralized framework with more than 8,000 members in its private Telegram group and a target to reach 10,000+. As the TRUMP Coin remains a catalyst for change in the crypto and financial fields, the KOPS project is strategically preparing for an ICO. With attention growing in the crypto community, the team plans to enter the blockchain market, promoting decentralization, utility, and active investor participation. Gaining early attention in cryptocurrency communities, the project intends to launch in the blockchain space with an emphasis on decentralization, utility, and investor participation. $KOPS Emerges from a Tale of Rebellion and Identity Interest in $KOPS is increasing owing not only to its market position but also to its narrative grounded in resistance and survival. The project is inspired by a fictional tale where a young pig, shamed and ridiculed after his father’s failed rebellion, disappears into exile. Left only with his father’s sunglasses—an inherited symbol of quiet defiance- he returns years later, no longer the subject of jokes but a masked fighter in the king’s arena. After defeating the tyrant’s strongest warriors, he removed his mask and revealed his identity. The pig that was once mocked now stood proud, crowned the King of Pigs. He led the suppressed people together and established a place where laughter did not depend on making fun of others. To gently symbolize the leadership he now held, he continued to keep his father’s sunglasses. The Technology Powering $KOPS and Its Advantages When the TRUMP was launched during January, we all know that it is a politically influential token. But the case of KOPS is different. The KOPS team has a real purpose to achieve and has built it on the most robust Binance Smart Chain. This way it ensures decentralization, community benefits like zero-trading fee, and maximum security. How KOPS Is Building a Community-Led Future in Crypto The development of the token’s community is accompanied by a robust commitment to collaborative governance, introducing a fresh model in blockchain administration. Currently, KOPS has more than 8,000 users in a private Telegram group, where they work together and talk about the future of the token. This close community anticipates growing, with a shared goal of uniting 10,000 people to advance innovation in the world of cryptocurrencies. As the pool of $KOPS holders enlarges, the group’s potential impact becomes more significant. The token is founded on principles of collective decision-making, so holders of $KOPS can influence the token’s future. This is not just about financial value, but about reshaping the way crypto communities operate in the future. The Premium Update The KOPS team is entering the market with a bang, and it’s time for you to grab the golden opportunity. The ICO event is going to happen, and it’s time for investors and traders to keep their wallets funded. To know more about the Pigdom, follow on.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin Pepe is turning heads as the first meme ICO on Bitcoin, raking in $1 million in 24 hours ahead of a May 31 listing set to shake up crypto’s most serious chain. There’s something brewing on Bitcoin that has the crypto crowd leaning in. Bitcoin Pepe has hauled in $1 million in just 24 hours, with its presale exploding ahead of a high-stakes May 31 listing. Bitcoin is holding strong above $100k in Q2 2025, pushing its market cap past $2.1 trillion, now surpassing giants like Google. Amid that macro strength, Bitcoin Pepe is exploding in popularity as it is doing the unthinkable: making Bitcoin fun again. It’s the world’s first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, and it’s gone full viral. It’s a bold attempt to breathe new life into the BTC chain with utility, virality, and a serious nod to earning potential. This $10.5m raise at only $0.0359 is proof that the market sees real potential in the chain’s first meme-layer revolution. Here’s why. ‘Solana on Bitcoin’ goes live on May 31 Bitcoin’s already in the endgame; Wall Street’s all in, the suits are treating it like digital gold, and the fun’s been sucked out of the room. But Bitcoin Pepe is flipping the lights back on for everyone else. This is the first-ever meme ICO on Bitcoin, but the bigger story is what comes next: a foundation for a fully expressive, fast-moving crypto economy on the world’s most secure chain. At the heart of this push is PEP-20, a new token standard that lets anyone issue assets directly on Bitcoin, and that could be anything from NFTs to memecoins to other DeFi activities. It’s the same unlock ERC-20 gave Ethereum, and it could set off a similar explosion of user-generated assets, memes, and communities rooted in Bitcoin’s native layer. The Bitcoin memecoin supercycle is officially on. BPEP forecast: The real degen trade after BTC’s ATH? Bitcoin Pepe has eyes on a monster debut, and the charts could light up once it lists. Early chatter suggests that listings may occur on major platforms, including Bybit, OKX, and possibly others. That means access, exposure, and serious trading volume. As that May 31 launch creeps closer, don’t be surprised if BPEP starts pulling liquidity and attention away from the usual suspects. Bitcoin’s setting the tone, but this is the afterparty people actually want to be at. The fusion of BTC’s trust with Solana-style speed is the formula for retail frenzy, especially now that BTC itself is climbing and the broader market’s turning risk-on. Memecoin mania is already rebooting. Projects like Moo Deng and Goatseus Maximus are making a triple-digit comeback, showing just how fast this sector can flip bullish. Solana gave us a 1,000x run. Bitcoin Pepe might just outdo that because BPEP has something SOL never did: Bitcoin’s name, its trust, and its untapped potential. The slam’s coming Bitcoin has grown up, institutions treat it like digital gold, and it’s the reserve asset of the internet, but Bitcoin Pepe is what could pull retail back into the game. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme ICO on Bitcoin. This alone puts it in the history books, but what happens next could write an entirely new chapter for meme culture on crypto’s most boomer chain. With Tier-1 listings locked in and over $10.5m raised, Bitcoin Pepe’s got the ball and is sprinting toward the rim. Just as Bitcoin makes headlines with trillion-dollar comparisons, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the next leg of the trade, the slam after BTC’s alley-oop. Listings drop May 31. That’s less than 11 on the countdown.

The SEC said on May 20 that it needed to extend its decision on Bitwise’s application by 45 days to “consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” The agency needed to either decide or punt its decision by May 22. The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP ( XRP ) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana ( SOL ) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X that both delays were expected as the SEC “typically takes the full time to respond to a 19b-4 filing.” “Almost all of these filings have final due dates in October,” and an early decision would be “out of the norm,” Seyffart added. “No matter how Crypto-friendly this SEC is. There’s no conspiracy here,” he said. Source: James Seyffart Seyffart said delays on other spot crypto ETF bids are also expected, and the SEC is likely to delay deciding on Litecoin ( LTC ) ETFs too. However, he added , ""Litecoin is one that has a higher likelihood vs others of getting approved first.” “A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in [the] next few days. If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets, I wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at the absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q,” Seyffart added. SEC dealing with flood of ETF filings Several other crypto ETF applications are approaching SEC deadlines in June. The SEC is supposed to decide on Grayscale’s Polkadot ( DOT ) tracking ETF by June 11 and 21Shares’ Polkadot ETF on June 24, according to an SEC filing.

The industry saw Gensler’s time at the SEC as an era marked by an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto , with 100 crypto-related regulatory actions during his tenure from 2021 until his resignation on Jan. 20. With Genlser’s departure, the SEC is perceived as far more crypto-friendly, with several firms facing legal action from the regulator having had their cases dismissed, including crypto exchange Gemini on Feb. 26 and crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW on March 4 .

The flagship crypto has broken out of a two-week consolidation between $102,000 and $105,000 to reach fresh highs. Over the past six weeks, Bitcoin has rallied roughly 40%, and held above $100,000 for more than 11 days. Moreover, only four trading sessions in history have recorded a daily close above the current level, and last week’s close at $106,500 marked a new record. Source: Coingecko Moody’s Debt Downgrade Sparks Flight to Crypto Bitcoin’s surge has been propelled by a confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Moody’s downgrade of US debt rattled confidence in traditional financial systems, while cooling trade war tensions between the US and China fostered risk-on sentiment. Meanwhile, persistent inflation has eroded fiat purchasing power, and the Federal Reserve’s cautious pace of rate cuts kept real yields elevated, dynamics that have boosted demand for Bitcoin as a hedge. Analysts Eye ETF Flows as Momentum Driver Spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn substantial capital amid this backdrop. On May 20, they recorded a net inflow of $329m , marking a fifth straight day of positive flows. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw $64.9m in net inflows for a third consecutive day.

He added “this fresh regulatory openness, combined with rising institutional participation, continues to position crypto for long-term growth despite short-term range-bound price action.” Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at YouHodler, noted a clear accumulation trend. He said: “While the risk of a downside correction cannot be ruled out, particularly if negative sentiment returns to the equity markets, the likelihood of such a scenario remains relatively low in the short to medium term.” CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler said that if the 30-day moving average of the ratio between holders’ profits and losses on coins that have moved climbs above 200, it signals an overheated market. He noted the current reading is 99, so there’s no sign of excessive euphoria yet. With Bitcoin now flirting with its previous peak, market watchers say the next few trading days will be critical. If bulls sustain above $107,000 and clear $108,786, a test of fresh highs appears increasingly likely.

The passage, which appears on page 1606 of Volume 66 of the journal, suggests that purchasers of XRP may have, in effect, acquired a portion of Ripple’s anticipated future cash flows generated through licensing its transaction settlement technology. SMQKE’s post emphasized the significance of the excerpt, quoting directly: “At the end of the day, XRP purchasers have bought, effectively, a slice of the future cashflows that Ripple would make from the licensing of its transaction settlement system.” The statement is part of a broader discussion about the relationship between Ripple’s business model and the distribution of XRP tokens. XRP HOLDERS OWN A SLICE OF RIPPLE’S FUTURE CASHFLOWS Read closely. “At the end of the day, XRP purchasers have bought, effectively, a SLICE OF THE FUTURE CASHFLOWS that Ripple would make from the licensing of its transaction settlement system.” Of course it’s… pic.twitter.com/kADEC1GbRT — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 19, 2025 Passage Raises Questions About Security Classification According to the excerpt, Ripple funds its activities through XRP distributions in exchange for investment capital and labor. The line suggesting XRP purchasers effectively acquire future cash flows implies a structure similar to that of a security. The passage compares tracking stocks and asset securitizations, stating that such instruments serve effectively the same economic function. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, the same excerpt also acknowledges the complexity of categorizing XRP. It notes that Ripple has structured its business in a way that gives it room to argue against the classification of XRP as a security. Specifically, the text mentions that Ripple can claim there are no direct contractual rights between the company and XRP holders and that XRP is used as more than a speculative asset. Community Reactions Address Legal and Temporal Context SMQKE’s tweet has been met with skepticism and analysis by other users. One user, Aurelia Isley, remarked , “That would make XRP a security so I doubt this is real we just dealt with a four-year lawsuit about this topic.” Another user, KYCAT, responded , “That’s interesting, however, XRP has already been classified as not a security. What is the date of the article? I suspect it’s pre-court ruling.” The court ruling likely pertains to the 2023 decision in the SEC v. Ripple Labs case, in which the Judge determined that XRP was not a security. However, some institutional sales were found to be investment contracts. This outcome led to partial regulatory clarity around XRP, implicating how crypto assets are categorized under U.S. securities laws. The excerpt highlighted by SMQKE is evidence of documented legal commentary suggesting a deeper economic linkage between XRP ownership and Ripple’s licensing revenue. The implications of such a view could reignite debates over the nature of crypto assets and their classification under securities law, particularly in light of recent and ongoing litigation in the digital asset space.

Speaking at the New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams said it has the potential to attract investment, create jobs, and cement New York’s position as a global centre for blockchain innovation. “We want to use the technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today,” Adams said during his speech, adding that the council would help position New York as the “crypto capital of the globe.” The advisory body will be composed of industry experts tasked with identifying use cases that serve the public interest. While full details of the council are still pending, Adams confirmed that a chairperson would be appointed and that key policy recommendations are expected in the coming weeks. Adams revealed that New York City is exploring blockchain use in administrative functions, including managing sensitive records like birth and death certificates. “Bringing blockchain security capabilities to the city means that birth certificates and death records can remain private but accessible,” he noted. Further, he added that the city is evaluating whether select services and taxes can be paid in cryptocurrency, as part of a broader initiative to modernise financial infrastructure.

Gox at Discount appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Strive, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking to scoop up 75,000 Bitcoin tied to Mt. Gox, the bankrupt exchange that famously collapsed in 2014. These Bitcoins are part of claims that have already received legal clearance but haven’t yet been distributed. By acquiring them, Strive hopes to buy Bitcoin at a discount and boost its crypto holdings fast. The Plan Behind the Purchase In a May 20 filing , Strive revealed its partnership with 117 Castell Advisory Group to pursue the claims. The company says this move will help it grow its Bitcoin-per-share ratio ahead of its reverse merger with Asset Entities, a deal expected to wrap up by mid-2025. Interestingly, Strive hasn’t disclosed any Bitcoin holdings yet but claims it has more flexibility than typical public companies when it comes to buying BTC. What’s Next? Shareholder Green Light Before making a move, Strive will need shareholder approval. The firm is preparing a filing for the SEC and will send out a proxy statement to outline the deal and get the go-ahead. In the meantime, Mt. Gox is expected to repay its creditors by October 31, meaning Strive has to act fast. Mt. Gox was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange before a 2014 hack wiped out 750,000 BTC. Creditors have waited over a decade for repayment, and now companies like Strive are stepping in to grab discounted claims. A Trend Among Bitcoin Treasury Firms Strive isn’t alone. New firms like Twenty One Capital, backed by Tether and SoftBank, are also diving into the Bitcoin treasury game, planning to launch with tens of thousands of BTC. Moreover, Strive’s merger partner , Asset Entities (ASST), has seen its stock skyrocket, jumping 18.2% on May 20 and up 1,170% since the merger news broke. Once the deal closes, Strive will control 94.2% of the merged company, which will continue trading under the ASST ticker. Strive Joins the Bitcoin Rush Overall, the move shows that Strive’s motive to buy more Bitcoin follows the lead of big players like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. Just this week, Strategy grabbed 7,390 BTC worth nearly $765 million, bringing its stash to over 576,000 BTC. Metaplanet also added 1,004 BTC, now holding 7,800 in total.

Currently the bulls hold strong as the XMR price maintains its ascending channel pattern. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to continue holding above the $360 mark after brief consolidation below the $340 mark.

Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR up today? Monero price gained increased buying demand below the $340 dip. This resulted in a strong push toward $360 level, strengthening the buying domination. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero. Monero price history; Source: Coinmarketcap Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215.

Through a series of annotated charts, Egrag outlines the historical significance of the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 33-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) as primary indicators for identifying both bull market tops and the beginning of major declines. #XRP – The Secrets Are Revealed ($5.7, $9.5, $27 & $37): It all comes down to the relationship between the 21 EMA and the 33 SMA. When I’ll Sell a Big Portion of #XRP : If the 21 EMA experiences a bearish cross with the 33 SMA on the weekly chart, that’s my signal: the… pic.twitter.com/lUT0Gr42nC — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 19, 2025 Bearish Crosses: Historical Signals of Market Downturns Egrag’s analysis focuses on relative positions and crossovers of these moving averages. According to his post, whenever the 21 EMA crosses below the 33 SMA on the weekly chart—a formation he refers to as a “bearish cross”—it has historically coincided with the start of prolonged downtrends in XRP’s market cycle. He identifies two key instances in the past where this occurred: first in May 2018 and again in November 2021. In both cases, XRP suffered significant losses following the cross, with approximately 87% and 72% declines, respectively. Egrag calculates the average of those two drawdowns to forecast what a future bearish cross might imply. Applying the average decline of 79.5%, he estimates the potential downside if such a signal emerges again. He warns that despite possible short-term optimism from market participants, the bearish cross should be taken seriously as a major trend reversal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Crosses: Launchpads for Significant Price Surges Conversely, Egrag emphasizes the positive implications of the opposite signal—a bullish cross—when the 21 EMA moves above the 33 SMA. His historical review identifies four major instances where such bullish crosses preceded significant price surges. In each of those events, XRP underwent substantial upward movement, including a 1600% surge, which he uses as a reference for his current outlook. Based on the present chart structure and the recent performance of XRP around the EMA/SMA levels, Egrag speculates that a similar rally could be on the horizon. He projects a potential rise toward $27, citing the 1600% historical move as precedent. His charts illustrate extended targets, including speculative price levels as high as $37, representing a 6500% increase from current levels. Mid-tier projections include $5.712 and $9.575, aligning with past market reactions and Fibonacci-based resistance zones. Critical Support and Timeline Marker Identified The analysis also includes a clearly defined threshold at $1.6394, shown in red across all visuals, potentially acting as a support level or invalidation point depending on price action in the coming weeks. The timing of this analysis is further underscored by a vertical marker on the chart pointing to September 29, 2025, which appears to be highlighted as a pivotal future date. However, no explicit rationale is given in the tweet for its significance. In conclusion, Egrag Crypto acknowledges that markets are unpredictable but maintains that these technical signals remain highly relevant. His message to XRP holders is one of vigilance, encouraging them to stay alert to moving average dynamics rather than sentiment-driven speculation.

The company’s stock has surged over 4,800% over the past year because of the company’s pivot to Bitcoin investment strategy. Originally a budget hotel operator, Metaplanet turned to Bitcoin-first treasury strategy in 2024 and has since seen a significant rise in its stock prices. As of today, the company holds 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million after its latest purchase of 1004 BTC two days ago . Apparently Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan. Do they really think betting against Bitcoin is a winning strategy? pic.twitter.com/SAKsOMO4MX — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) May 21, 2025 A Setup for Global Short Squeeze? Despite a meteoric rise in Metaplanet’s stock, many investors have questioned the sustainability of Metaplanet’s valuation, leading to a sharp increase in short interest by hedge fund managers in the Japanese market. Short sellers, betting the stock will fall, are now under pressure as the company’s shares hit upper daily price limits and trading halts were triggered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for two consecutive days. With the TSE temporarily restricting access, short sellers have turned to OTC trading in international markets to cover their positions. However, these exchanges offer significantly lower liquidity, forcing traders to compete for a limited supply of shares, often at prices above their original short-sale levels. This dynamic has led to mounting speculation of a global short squeeze in the making, sentiments echoed by Bitcoin bull and Tesmanian founder Vincent Yu in a post on X . He added: “This could be a really huge Metaplanet short squeeze. Short sellers are now needed to buy back in the lowest liquidity market $MTPLF & DN3 which will push up the price higher and faster, that cause more halted in Japan.” “Really Bad Timing to be Short”: Blockstream CEO Hashcash inventor Blockstream CEO Adam Back also posted on X replying to Metaplanet’s CEO saying that in his opinion the stock is still relatively cheap based on historic mNAV ranges, and on months to cover metric. “Shorting it seems like a really bad idea to me! This is the second 3350:TYO circuit-breaker limit-up day in a row, really bad timing to be short.” In related news, Bitcoin soared past $107,700 earlier this morning during Asia trading hours, just 1% shy from its all-time high of $108,786.

The asset manager has added Bitcoin ETFs and crypto ATM shares. BlackRock’s IBIT leads U.S. Bitcoin ETFs in inflows. Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, has made its first move into crypto markets, purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a May 20 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. The investment was added to the firm’s $2.63 billion Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), marking the asset manager’s initial exposure to Bitcoin via regulated financial products. Blackstone Adds ProShares Bitcoin ETF and Crypto ATM Shares to Portfolio The filing also reveals that Blackstone purchased 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), totaling $181,166, and a smaller position in Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM), a crypto ATM operator, with 4,300 shares worth just $6,300. Though modest in size—especially relative to Blackstone’s $1.2 trillion in assets under management—the move represents a notable shift for a firm that has historically kept crypto at arm’s length. In 2019, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman expressed skepticism about crypto, stating, “I was raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” and admitted difficulty understanding the technology behind it. Blackstone’s entry into Bitcoin ETFs comes as demand for institutional access to digital assets grows. $1 TRILLION BLACKSTONE JUST REVEALED BUYING #BITCOIN ETF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THIS IS WILD!!! pic.twitter.com/PvlIddtndp — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) May 20, 2025 IBIT, launched by BlackRock in January 2024, has quickly become the leader among U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. As of mid-May, the fund has recorded over $46.1 billion in net inflows and has not seen a single outflow since April 9, according to Farside Investors. In contrast, the Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the first U.S. public pension funds to gain Bitcoin exposure, reported on May 15 that it had fully liquidated its 6 million IBIT shares during Q1. IBIT continues to outpace competitors like Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK’s Bitcoin ETF, which have seen $11.8 billion and $2.8 billion in net inflows, respectively. DigiAsia Stock Doubles on $100M Bitcoin Purchase Plan Shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy. The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve. DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. In addition to deploying profits into Bitcoin, DigiAsia is actively exploring a capital raise of up to $100 million to kickstart its holdings. Notably, public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin.

But there’s one thing that 94% of traders chasing the best crypto to buy now overlook. This hidden driver fuels adoption, builds loyalty, and powers long-term success. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , an AI-powered meme coin on Ethereum, showcases how this metric can elevate a cryptocurrency to top status and possibly lead the next bull run. The Power of Community in Cryptocurrency Success Cryptocurrencies with active communities—marked by robust social media interactions, meme contests, and user participation—achieve higher market cap growth than less engaged projects. Community engagement isn’t just hype; it’s a cornerstone of blockchain adoption. It drives trust, encourages innovation, and attracts partnerships, making it a vital indicator for investors seeking the best crypto to buy now . Dawgz AI harnesses this metric with its “Dawgz Army,” a growing community fueled by 15% of its 8.89 billion token supply dedicated to community rewards. By incentivizing meme creation and social interaction, $DAGZ builds a loyal base, positioning it as a crypto to watch in 2025. This community-driven approach could make it one of the best cryptocurrencies for long-term gains. Dawgz AI: Blending AI Innovation with Meme Culture Unlike traditional meme coins, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) combines AI-powered trading algorithms with meme-driven community hype, creating a unique value proposition. Its presale, raising over $3.61 million out of the $4.91 target, reflects strong market interest. The project’s blackbox AI system, developed by seasoned Wall Street analysts, analyzes market trends in real-time to optimize yields, offering potential for consistent returns. This blend of fun and utility sets $DAGZ apart from other assets. The community rewards program, allocating 15% of tokens, encourages users to create and share memes, fostering engagement. Additionally, 20% of the token supply is reserved for staking rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. By supporting payments in ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, and SOL, the presale allows a broad community to join the Dawgz Army. This strategy could drive $DAGZ to prominence in the cryptocurrency space. Why Community Engagement Defines the Best Crypto in 2025 In 2025, community engagement is more critical than ever. A vibrant community expands a project’s reach, secures exchange listings, and builds trust among investors. Dawgz AI’s roadmap, outlined on its website, emphasizes community building across four phases: Puppyhood: Launching the presale and sparking meme-driven hype on social media. Growing the Pack: Strengthening the Dawgz Army through contests and partnerships. Big Dog Stage: Expanding globally with enhanced AI features. Alpha Dog Status: Aiming for mainstream adoption and sustainable growth. This focus on community engagement positions $DAGZ as a crypto to buy for long-term success. Its smart contract, audited by SolidProof on June 4, 2024, ensures security, boosting community confidence. With 24% of tokens allocated to marketing, $DAGZ is set to expand its reach, making it a project to keep an eye on as it prepares for the launch. AI and Blockchain: The Future of Cryptocurrency The integration of AI and blockchain is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Dawgz AI’s AI algorithms are at the heart of its ecosystem, offering potential for high yields through real-time market analysis. This advanced technology, paired with meme culture, makes $DAGZ a standout in the market. The project’s 10% liquidity pool allocation ensures smooth trading on exchanges post-presale, enhancing its appeal. By fostering a community-driven ecosystem, $DAGZ aligns with the growing demand for cryptocurrencies that offer both fun and utility. Its presale price of $0.00438 (set to rise to $0.00474 soon) offers investors an accessible entry point before the price moons. Why Traders Should Prioritize Community in 2025 Community engagement is the backbone of cryptocurrency success. Projects with active, loyal communities are more likely to secure exchange listings, attract investors, and sustain long-term growth. Dawgz AI’s focus on meme culture and AI innovation creates a unique ecosystem that resonates with both retail and institutional investors. Its presale success, raising over $3.61 million and surging, underscores the strength of its community. Stage 8: Checked off the list. ✅Another win on the board. This isn’t luck, it’s strategy, support and solid execution. On to Stage 9 with even more fire. 🔥Don't say we didn't warn you, we know where we’re going and stage 9 is just the next step. ⤴️ pic.twitter.com/aENcREe7U0 — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) May 20, 2025 By leveraging blockchain security (via its SolidProof-audited smart contract) and AI-driven utility, $DAGZ offers a compelling case for investors looking for the best crypto to buy. The project’s roadmap, with its emphasis on community building and global outreach, positions it for explosive potential in the next bull run.

SXT ( SXT ), the native token of decentralized data platform Space and Time, rose as high as 37% to an intraday high of $0.146 on May 21 morning Asian time. The rally followed Microsoft’s announcement that it would begin integrating real-time blockchain data feeds into Microsoft Fabric through a partnership with Space and Time Labs, a crypto startup previously backed by a Microsoft venture arm. According to the May 20 announcement , the collaboration will allow Microsoft Fabric users to access verifiable data from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Sui blockchains via Azure OneLake, a cloud data storage solution often described as a “OneDrive for data.” For the uninitiated, Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics platform that unifies several tools across Microsoft’s data suite, including Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI. As part of this integration, enterprise users of Fabric will now be able to incorporate tamper-proof blockchain data directly into their analytics, smart contracts, dashboards, and even AI models. The verifiability of this data is made possible by Space and Time’s proprietary “Proof of SQL” technology, which uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to validate SQL database queries securely and efficiently. You might also like: Pi Network hints at trend reversal after pullback, but major obstacles could keep price below $1 Commenting on the development, Nate Holiday, CEO of Space and Time Labs, said: “We’re thrilled to expand our collaboration with Microsoft to provide verifiable blockchain data to enterprises, institutions, and developers building on Fabric. This integration enables a wealth of new data-driven use cases across financial services, Web3 apps, and AI.” This announcement comes around a week after Space and Time launched its public, permissionless mainnet. The platform operates on a decentralized network of database validators and enables sub-second query speeds through its ZK-powered SQL coprocessor. Space and Time was developed by MakeInfinite Labs and is backed by Microsoft ’s venture arm, M12. M12 led the company’s strategic funding round back in 2022 and joined their $20 million Series A round later. So far, Space and Time has raised a total of $50 million. SXT price analysis On the 4-hour chart, SXT has managed to hold strong above the $0.12 support level and is now approaching the key $0.15 psychological resistance. SXT price, Aroon and RSI chart — May 21 | Source: crypto.news The Aroon Up indicator is sitting high at 92.86%, while the Aroon Down is low at 21.43%, a sign that the uptrend is still going strong. The Chaikin Money Flow is at 0.14, showing steady buying pressure is still in play. On top of that, the Relative Strength Index has cooled off to around 62 after briefly hitting overbought territory, which leaves some room for more upward movement. Hence, the next likely target for SXT is its all-time high of $0.1621, and if the bullish momentum continues, it could break into price discovery beyond that level.

Dogecoin, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are drawing sharp attention as top cryptocurrencies for savvy investors. Dogecoin’s bullish patterns signal a potential 300% surge, while Cardano’s steady climb rides on whale accumulation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in presale phase 4 at $0.025, has raised $9,000,000 with over 500 million tokens sold to 11,000 holders. Phase 4 is 92% filled, and phase 5 looms with a 20% price jump to $0.03. These coins offer unique opportunities for those seeking the next big crypto. Let’s explore why they’re the best cryptos to buy now. Dogecoin’s Bullish Surge Dogecoin is igniting optimism among traders eyeing the best crypto to invest in. Currently trading at $0.24, it’s forming a falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal hinting at a breakout. Analysts note this setup mirrors a past rally that tripled its price. A diamond bottom reversal pattern further fuels confidence, suggesting a shift from selling to buying pressure. Dogecoin’s 53% monthly gain underscores its momentum, outpacing many peers. Whale activity is surging, with 100 million tokens snapped up recently, boosting crypto prices. While volatile, Dogecoin’s technical strength makes it a top crypto to buy. Yet, its speculative nature pales against more structured projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Cardano’s Steady Ascent Cardano is climbing steadily, cementing its place among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. Priced at $0.784, it’s up 52% from April’s low. Founder Charles Hoskinson predicts a crypto market “heartburn” for two months before a bull run resumes. Whales are accumulating, holding 12.93 billion tokens, driven by upcoming airdrops for DUSK and NIGHT tokens. Cardano’s weekly chart shows a megaphone pattern, suggesting a dip to $0.4 before soaring to $2 by Q4. Cardano’s Midnight project, a zero-knowledge sidechain, adds utility. Cardano’s stability is compelling, but its slower growth contrasts with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s explosive presale momentum. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding attention as a top crypto in DeFi. Its presale phase 4, priced at $0.025, is 92% filled, signaling fierce demand. Investors are rushing to secure tokens before phase 5’s price hike to $0.03, a 20% gain for current buyers. The project’s tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at its $0.06 listing price. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, yielding a 9,900% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $9,000,000, with 500 million tokens sold to 11,000 holders. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with updates soon on socials. This urgency underscores why it’s the best crypto to buy now. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its lending platform. Users can lend assets to liquidity pools, earning interest based on pool utilization. Borrowers access funds by locking collateral, like $7,000 in ETH for a $5,000 USDT loan, ensuring stability. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates constant buy pressure, bolstering long-term value. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. This innovative approach makes it a standout in crypto investing, surpassing Dogecoin’s speculative allure and Cardano’s gradual climb. Why Mutuum Finance Shines Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s mtTokens are a game-changer. Depositing ETH yields mtETH, which accrues interest over time, offering passive income. These tokens are transferable across DeFi platforms, enhancing utility. A planned overcollateralized stablecoin will further strengthen the ecosystem. Unlike Dogecoin’s reliance on market sentiment or Cardano’s slower innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers practical financial tools. Its presale success and structured tokenomics position it as the next crypto to explode. Investors eyeing what crypto to buy for long-term gains find MUTM’s model irresistible.

Prominent market commentator Fred Krueger detailed his prediction in a 10-part thread on X posted on May 20, painting a hyperbullish picture for BTC powered by monetary instability, institutional Bitcoin adoption, and a full-scale flight from traditional markets. A Doomsday Scenario for Traditional Markets Krueger is basing his thesis on a catastrophic breakdown in U.S. financial stability, beginning with a failed $200 billion Treasury auction in late July 2025. According to his projection, weak demand for U.S. debt will potentially force the Federal Reserve into emergency interventions, sparking a crisis of confidence in the dollar. Within weeks, BRICS nations, led by economic heavyweights China and Russia, will announce a gold-backed global payment system, speeding up the decline of USD dominance and pushing BTC to $180,000. By August, the investor claims the situation will escalate dramatically, with a major U.S. pension fund possibly halting redemptions, which will force the Fed to impose yield cap control that should cap Treasury rates at 6.5% while the dollar goes into freefall. Meanwhile, countries such as Nigeria, Turkey, and Venezuela will ostensibly start shifting foreign reserves into Bitcoin, pushing its price to $265,000, with gold potentially rallying to the $6,700 level. The most explosive phase in the $600,000 timeline will arrive in September, when Krueger predicts several U.S. tech titans, including Apple, Tesla, and Google, will reveal huge BTC holdings, with the iPhone maker allegedly accumulating as much as 200,000 BTC since April. At this juncture, he postulates that the cryptocurrency’s price will have reached $460,000. Additionally, the expert speculates that the IMF will make a historic move, announcing a new global reserve basket with Bitcoin making up half of it, gold covering 30%, and the remaining 20% taken up by other assets. By early October, Krueger claims the U.S. government will be forced to convene an emergency “New Bretton Woods” summit, where it will restructure the dollar to be partially backed by BTC and gold. It is in this macro-maelstrom that he sees the king cryptocurrency hitting $600,000, gold reaching $10,400, and the S&P 500 losing half its value. Strong Fundamentals While Krueger’s roadmap reads like financial fiction, Bitcoin has shown some of the resilience and bullish momentum he’s basing his prediction on. At the time of writing, the asset was trading at $107,000, up a slight 1% in 24 hours, which has put it just 1.3% away from rediscovering its all-time high. On a monthly basis, BTC is up 23.1%, and year-over-year, it has surged 51.6%. Much of this strength comes from steady institutional demand and constrained supply. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have recorded eight days of positive flows out of the last ten, with total inflows topping $3.3 billion since the beginning of May, according to Farside Investors. This comes as heavyweights like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet announced additional BTC purchases, totaling nearly $850 million.

What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user. But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience. Did you know? According to a recent survey , 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step. Common crypto transfer mistakes A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes. Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes: Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet. Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt ( USDT ) over Ethereum instead of Tron ? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network. Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely. Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify. Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network. Failed crypto transaction explained Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes. A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees . If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days. Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum , where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning. Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures. Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed. If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first: Confirm the recipient’s address is correct. Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum , BNB Smart Chain (BSC) , Polygon , etc.). Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana). Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending . Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent. If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee . What to check before sending crypto Prevention is your best friend. Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending. Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform. Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help. Crypto transfer speed and networks Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time. Chains like Solana , Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem. That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin ( BTC )? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana ? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress. How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions. The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges. Other problems arise from the “ sunrise issue ,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers. Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse. How to avoid failed crypto transactions Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing. Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask ) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds. Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees. How to verify a crypto transfer Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed. Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details. Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move. Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind. As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed. The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it. Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",crypto transfers,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-21 07:35:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Utility tokens are evolving from hype to substance, as MBG by MultiBank Group leads a new wave of regulation-first, infrastructure-backed crypto tied to real-world finance. Table of Contents A new approach: Beginning with infrastructure A landmark $3 billion tokenization agreement in the UAE Focus on regulation and legal clarity Real-world assets and the future of digital finance Utility tokens presented a straightforward concept: digital assets that projects could utilize to access services, pay fees, or earn incentives. However, in practice, many tokens have struggled to demonstrate genuine utility. Some debuted before a functioning product was ready. Others functioned under unclear legal conditions, preventing consumers from understanding the potential uses and locations of the tokens. The disparity between token supply and platform readiness has raised questions about whether most utility tokens serve a useful purpose or are primarily fundraising tools. A new approach: Beginning with infrastructure One movement in the space includes connecting tokens to functional, regulated financial institutions. MultiBank Group , a financial firm located in Dubai, has embraced this approach with its upcoming coin, MBG. Instead of launching first and then constructing, the business planned ahead of time to establish its infrastructure. The goal is to incorporate token-based functionality into current platforms that already serve retail, institutional, and digital asset customers throughout the world. These include transaction management, awards, and tier-based access, all inside existing systems. A landmark $3 billion tokenization agreement in the UAE In a significant step toward connecting traditional banking with web3, MultiBank Group has struck a $3 billion real-world asset (RWA) tokenization deal with MAG, the UAE’s top real estate developer, and Mavryk, a blockchain technology startup. The agreement focuses on digitizing real estate assets, which involves transforming their ownership or value into blockchain-based tokens that may be monitored, exchanged, or retained digitally. This is one of the world’s greatest real estate tokenization endeavors to date. This is a growing interest in utilizing blockchain to represent assets that exist outside of the crypto realm, resulting in increased transparency, possible liquidity, and automation of complicated ownership systems. You might also like: Bridging traditional finance and blockchain: The strategic positioning of MBG Focus on regulation and legal clarity Regulation, or the lack thereof, has been an obstacle to many digital asset ventures. 17 financial licenses, including those from Australia (ASIC), the UAE (VARA), and India (FIU), regulate the MultiBank ecosystem. This implies that any new digital components, including tokenized assets, will operate inside predefined legal frameworks. Clear regulatory footing protects consumers and opens the door to partnership with larger institutions that have hitherto shunned blockchain owing to compliance issues. As part of its token strategy, MultiBank intends to progressively limit the number of MBG tokens via buyback-and-burn techniques backed by company activities. This technique differs from inflationary token models, in which supply rises with time. A deflationary system can impact long-term token behavior, although the outcomes vary based on use and market conditions. Real-world assets and the future of digital finance The rising emphasis on real-world asset tokenization indicates a change in how digital finance may evolve. Rather than operating independently of traditional markets, blockchain-based solutions are beginning to integrate with established industries such as real estate and banking. For both observers and players, these trends point to a future in which digital assets are no longer merely speculative tools but integral parts of broader financial systems.

The disclosure came via a May 19 post on X, where Sun announced that he had secured an invite to an exclusive dinner with the former U.S. president, scheduled to be held at the president’s golf club near Washington, D.C. Sun to Attend Trump Dinner as Top Memecoin Holder According to Sun, his wallet, which holds around $19 million worth of the TRUMP token at a trading price of $13.20, earned him a top spot among the 220 holders eligible for the May 22 dinner. More notably, being the leading wallet on the leaderboard also grants Sun access to a private reception and VIP tour reserved for the top 25 token holders. He stated that he plans to “talk crypto” and “discuss the future” of the industry at the event. The crypto community had long speculated that Sun was behind the wallet, especially after his previous $75 million investment into Trump-backed crypto ventures through World Liberty Financial — a platform reportedly supported by Trump’s sons. This included a $30 million token purchase shortly after the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Sun also serves as an adviser to the firm, further tightening his link to the Trump crypto ecosystem. Concerns Over Influence and Regulation Sun’s involvement has raised red flags among lawmakers, particularly those wary of political influence being bought through crypto investments. The timing of his announcement — just hours after the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins — has intensified concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the move, calling it a sign of “corruption” that the GENIUS Act fails to address. During a May 20 congressional hearing, Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins about the timing of Sun’s stayed legal case and his ties to Trump’s ventures. Although Atkins assumed office after the SEC agreed to pause its lawsuit against Sun — which involves allegations of unregistered securities offerings and market manipulation — Ivey pointed to the troubling proximity between Sun’s crypto activities and regulatory decisions. As of May 20, other confirmed attendees of the dinner include notable figures from the crypto world, such as Vincent Liu of Kronos Research and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick.

But just as price began to surge, something unexpected happened, Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke quietly moved 262 million of ETH to the Kraken exchange. This move surprised many and raised the big question: Is he planning to sell? As his past actions suggest that a major sell-off might be on the way. $262 Million in ETH—Gone in a Flash? According to on-chain tracker Arkham, Wilcke transferred more than 105,000 ETH (about $262 million) to Kraken. What’s even more surprising is that this wallet had been mostly inactive for months. And the timing? It happened right after ETH broke past the $2,600 mark. ARKHAM ALERT: ETHEREUM COFOUNDER JEFFREY WILCKE JUST SENT $262M OF ETH TO KRAKEN pic.twitter.com/tgUpS0mCBJ — Arkham (@arkham) May 20, 2025 Following the transfer, Wilcke’s ETH holdings dropped to under 300 coins. The last time he made such a large move was in November 2024, just before Ethereum hit a 12-month high, after which the price corrected. So naturally, this triggered fears that another major dump might be on the way. Is He Selling? Or Just Moving Funds? At first glance, the transaction looked like a sign that Wilcke might sell. But shortly after the deposit, eight new wallets withdrew the same amount of ETH from Kraken. This led some analysts to believe he may have simply redistributed his funds rather than offloading them. Interestingly, Wilcke even reposted news of the transaction, but didn’t offer any explanation. His silence has kept people guessing, but the activity doesn’t clearly point to a dump So while the recent transfer looked dramatic, it may not have been a bearish move after all. Impact On ETH Price Despite the massive transfer, Ethereum’s price held up well. As of now, ETH is trading around $2607, reflecting a rise of 2.24%, with the market cap hitting $314 billion. Despite the major move, one positive signal is that Ethereum’s supply on exchanges has dropped to just 4.9%, the lowest in 10 years. That suggests fewer people are preparing to sell, which is often seen as a positive signal for long-term holders. Meanwhile, there are also some concerns about a possible bug in the EIP-7702 upgrade, which might slow Ethereum’s recent momentum.",News|Uncategorized,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 07:45:00

In a recent post , Buterin commented on an X user’s skeptical take on an announcement from Succinct Lab’s co-founder Uma Roy about her team’s recent demo of a full “zkVM” proof system for the ecosystem’s execution layer. Although Buterin does congratulate the Succinct team on their progress, he proceeds to point out four areas that the project — as well as the wider network — needs to tackle in order to make real-time proving a reliable feature for users on the Layer1 . “So, truly amazing work by @pumatheuma and team, but definitely still a few steps to the final destination,” said Buterin. Buterin underlined how the Succinct Labs’ demo for real-time Ethereum ( ETH ) proving mechanism was tested out on average-case timings, not worst case tests. He emphasized the need for worst case timings in order to make the mechanism safe for wider L1 use. Moreover, he stated in his post that the Ethereum team aims to raise the Layer1 gas limit by 10 to 100 times its current rate. According to data from YCharts, Ethereum’s current average gas limit is at 35.99 million, a slight increase from yesterday’s average gas limit which stood at 35.98 million. “We wanna 10-100x the L1 gas limit,” said Buterin. Ethereum’s gas limit has reached 35.99 million in the past 24 hours, May 21, 2025 | Source: YCharts You might also like: Binance founder proposes lowering BSC gas fees by three to 10 times Buterin also said Succinct’s proving mechanism still lacks formal verification, which is necessary to assure users that it is seamless and relatively bug-free. Not only that, the real-time proving system still needs around 100 kilowatts of power to churn out proofs at the demonstrated speed. Buterin argued that to make it available for broader participation, the energy cost needed to generate proofs should be around as low as 10 kW. This way, the energy rate is home-use friendly and would enable small teams or individuals to run their own real-time proofs. What is Ethereum’s current gas limit? Compared to a year ago, on May 21, 2024, the ecosystem’s gas limit has increased by nearly 20%. The number increased by nearly 6 million from 30 million one year ago. If Ethereum does manage to raise its gas limit by 10 to 100 times, its gas limit could reach as high as 360 million to 3600 million. Ethereum’s gas limit represents the maximum gas units needed to process a transaction or smart contract on the network. It acts as a cap, preventing transactions from using excessive resources that could lead to high fees or generating congestion on the network. Even if real-time proving mechanisms become available on-chain, each one requires a considerable amount of gas. Therefore, in order to make it viable at scale, it would require a higher gas limit compared to what the network’s current block gas limit would allow. Last February, the Ethereum network raised its gas limit for the first time since 2021. The gas limit reached 32 million gas units, surpassing 30 million for the first time in nearly five years. At the time, around 51.1% of validators approved the gas limit adjustment without a hard fork.

Cú tăng giá gần đây mang đậm dấu ấn của thị trường spot , với những pha bứt phá mạnh mẽ sau những giai đoạn ngắn gọn và rõ ràng để nghỉ xả hơi. Điều này cho thấy việc tích lũy diễn ra lành mạnh và nhu cầu tiềm ẩn rất vững chắc, thay vì bị thúc đẩy bởi các yếu tố đầu cơ thái quá. Dữ liệu Khối lượng Delta tích lũy (CVD) trên các sàn lớn vẫn giữ mức dương, khẳng định rằng những người mua thực sự — chứ không phải dân đánh đòn bẩy — đang chiếm ưu thế trong cuộc đua này. Trong khi đó, thị trường phái sinh đang ở trạng thái phản ứng , với các biến động về khối lượng mở (OI) cho thấy giai đoạn chuyển đổi, nơi các cú ép bán và thanh lý hàng loạt giúp làm sạch lớp bọt bẩn trên thị trường. Kết quả là nền tảng hiện tại trở nên sạch sẽ hơn, với đà tăng được hỗ trợ bởi dòng vốn thực chất thay vì những cơn sốt nhất thời. Với giá Bitcoin vừa điều chỉnh nhẹ sau khi đạt mức cao kỷ lục, mức chênh lệch giá (premium) thị trường giao ngay vẫn khá cao, hành động giá đi ngang hiện tại có thể chỉ đơn giản là một khoảng thời gian lấy sức trước khi bùng nổ. Mặc dù các đợt điều chỉnh nhỏ vẫn có khả năng xảy ra, xu hướng lớn vẫn đang nghiêng về phía tích cực. Mặc dù Bitcoin đang bay cao, nhưng các dấu hiệu cảnh báo tiếp tục xuất hiện trên nền kinh tế Mỹ, khi lạm phát giảm dần nhưng những rủi ro cấu trúc sâu hơn bắt đầu lộ rõ. Chỉ số giá tiêu dùng (Consumer Price Index – CPI) chỉ tăng 0.2% so với tháng trước và tăng 2.3% so với năm ngoái—mức tăng thấp nhất kể từ đầu 2021. Giá thực phẩm giảm đã giúp làm dịu bớt áp lực từ chi phí nhà ở, nhưng triển vọng vẫn còn mờ mịt do bất ổn quanh thuế quan và chính sách thương mại. Dù Mỹ và Trung Quốc đã đạt được thỏa thuận ngừng bắn tạm thời, các mức thuế nhập khẩu lớn vẫn đang tồn tại, và nhiều khả năng sẽ có thêm thuế mới vào tháng 7 tới. Những căng thẳng thương mại chưa được giải quyết này tạo ra thách thức lớn cho cả doanh nghiệp và giới hoạch định chính sách. Đồng thời, áp lực tài chính đang đè nặng lên các hộ gia đình. Số liệu từ Fed New York cho thấy tỷ lệ nợ tín dụng và vay sinh viên quá hạn trên 90 ngày đang tăng lên, vẽ nên bức tranh u ám về tình hình tài chính cá nhân. Khi tác động của thuế quan bắt đầu cắn, cùng với rủi ro lạm phát tiếp tục treo lơ lửng, sự kết hợp giữa tăng trưởng chậm và giá cả leo thang—hay còn gọi là lạm phát đình trệ (stagflation) —có thể khiến Cục Dự trữ Liên bang (Fed) rơi vào thế khó. Hiện tại, với chi phí dịch vụ lõi và nhà ở vẫn còn ở mức cao, Fed nhiều khả năng sẽ tiếp tục thận trọng. Tuy nhiên, khi áp lực kinh tế ngày càng gia tăng, những tháng tới sẽ đòi hỏi sự linh hoạt và cảnh giác cao độ. Dù thị trường có lúc chập chờn và quy định pháp lý vẫn là câu chuyện dài kỳ, việc chấp nhận Bitcoin trong giới doanh nghiệp và tổ chức vẫn đang phát triển mạnh mẽ. Quỹ đầu tư Mubadala của Abu Dhabi đã tăng cường nắm giữ cổ phần trong quỹ ETF Bitcoin spot của BlackRock (IBIT) trong quý 1/2025, thể hiện niềm tin dài hạn mặc cho giá trị thị trường của IBIT tạm thời sụt giảm. Kể từ khi ra mắt vào tháng 1/2024, IBIT đã dẫn đầu thị trường ETF spot tại Mỹ, thu hút hơn $45.5 tỷ dòng tiền chảy vào và quản lý tổng cộng $65.4 tỷ tài sản. Tại Mỹ Latinh, công ty fintech Méliuz của Brazil đã trở thành công ty đại chúng đầu tiên trong khu vực áp dụng chiến lược dự trữ Bitcoin. Sau khi mua 274.52 BTC trị giá $28.4 triệu , tổng số Bitcoin họ sở hữu giờ đã vượt 320 BTC . Động thái này nhận được sự ủng hộ mạnh mẽ từ cổ đông và khiến giá cổ phiếu công ty tăng vọt 116% , minh chứng cho sự ủng hộ của nhà đầu tư đối với chiến lược tài chính dựa trên crypto. Tuy nhiên, khung pháp lý vẫn là một trận chiến cam go. Một thẩm phán Mỹ vừa bác bỏ đề nghị chung giữa SEC (Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Giao dịch) và Ripple nhằm giảm nhẹ hình phạt và dỡ bỏ các hạn chế, viện dẫn lỗi thủ tục do vụ án đang trong quá trình kháng cáo. Quyết định này tạm thời chặn đứng một thỏa thuận tiềm năng trong vụ kiện mang tính bước ngoặt, có thể định hình tương lai của quy định crypto tại Mỹ. Tất cả những sự kiện này phản ánh cả động lực lẫn thách thức mà crypto đang đối mặt trong hành trình tiến vào hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu.

Theta Capital Management has pulled in over $175 million for a new fund-of-funds designed to help institutional investors get exposure to early-stage blockchain startups by backing some of the industry’s top crypto venture firms. The new fund, dubbed Theta Blockchain Ventures IV, will invest in venture capital firms that specialize in crypto, Bloomberg has learned , referring to Ruud Smets, the company’s managing partner and chief investment officer. Founded in 2001, the Netherlands-based firm began focusing on cryptocurrencies in 2018 and now manages around $1.2 billion in assets. Theta has previously backed firms like Coinfund, Polychain Capital, and Castle Island Ventures. It’s still unclear though how Theta plans to allocate the newly raised capital.

According to a May 14 report by PitchBook, VC deal value in Q1 rose to $6 billion, more than double the $2.6 billion seen a year ago. However, the number of deals fell to 405 from 670 over the same period. PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le said the $1.4 billion Bybit theft , which he described as the first and only “10-digit hack in history,” served as a stark reminder of the operational risks still present in the industry. He suggested the incident could drive greater institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tools, improved custody systems, and middleware that simplifies key management. Le also said startups working on these areas might find a more favorable funding environment, even amid a broader reset in valuations. Despite Bitcoin hitting a record high of $100,000 in Q4 2024, venture capital activity in crypto startups remained flat , with VC deal size down nearly 90% since 2018.

He noted that NYC had sufficient experts to help New Yorkers navigate solutions through blockchain technology. Speaking at the first ever crypto summit hosted at the mayor’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, Adams asserted that NYC was “open for ‘crypto’ business” and the proposed digital assets council would be composed of industry individuals, with a chair to be confirmed in the coming weeks. Mayor Adams vows to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” We're taking the next step in becoming the Crypto Capitol of the WORLD, hosting our city's first-ever Crypto and Digital Assets Summit! Join us LIVE as we get started: https://t.co/iwO6ThkaSB — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) May 20, 2025 Mayor Adams said at the crypto conference on Tuesday that he wanted to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and will make policy recommendations in the coming weeks. He also pointed out that in addition to business interests, the city will explore putting birth and death records onto a blockchain to help New Yorkers’ next of kin easily access these types of documents. Adams told the inaugural NYC crypto summit on May 20 that the plan to establish the city’s crypto advisory council was not about chasing memes and trends. He added that the world is currently in the age of tokenization—which includes, blockchain, and other fintech innovations—and NYC was going to continue to move forward with it. “We want to use technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today … That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy.” ~ Eric Adams, the Mayor of New York City The self-proclaimed “tech mayor” also revealed his history as a computer programmer, highlighting that he was one of the original architects of OLTPS, the precursor to COMPStat. He disclosed that he came into the tech world with a real mindset that technology could improve the lives of people, and the establishment of the crypto advisory council was part of “the evolution of that improvement.” NYC Mayor asks crypto companies to set up shop in the Empire State Mayor Adams made a pitch to crypto companies returning to the U.S. or expanding their presence in the country to set up shop in New York City. He said at a previous press briefing at Gracie Mansion that the city of New York should be looking forward to building crypto empires. Adams, who is running for reelection, reiterated his commitment to making NYC a crypto hub, telling reporters that he would work with tech and crypto companies—both big and small—to create a friendly environment to attract and help them succeed. He added that his goal remained the same as it was on day one as mayor, helping President Trump make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Adams also claimed that New York would attract world-class talent, provide opportunities for underbanked communities, and make the government more user-friendly. He pointed out that his office was focused on the long-term value of these technologies for the city and its people. In the past, Adams was critical of Bitlicense, claiming that it stifled regulation, and he advocated scrapping it shortly after taking office as mayor in 2022. He, however, seemed to strike a more conciliatory tone towards NYDFS, saying that it was good to know that the city would have safe regulations in place for those who were investing and that there would not be any abuses.

44893222,https://thecoinrise.com/bnbs-staking-dominance-could-be-under-threat-unilabs-introduces-new-defi-asset-manager/,1747813859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/44893222.jpeg,BNB’s Staking Dominance Could Be Under Threat: Unilabs Introduces New DeFi Asset Manager,https://thecoinrise.com/bnbs-staking-dominance-could-be-under-threat-unilabs-introduces-new-defi-asset-manager/,"Unilabs is emerging as one of the most disruptive names in crypto, with its AI-powered DeFi asset manager gaining rapid attention during its live presale. As investors seek alternatives to traditional staking options like BNB, Unilabs presents a compelling opportunity to benefit from automated fund management and passive income. The platform’s AI-backed structure, staking utility, and strong referral rewards have sparked speculation that it could challenge the staking dominance of Binance Coin. Unilabs: The First AI Asset Manager Revolutionizing Crypto Portfolios As the first decentralized AI asset manager, Unilabs holds responsibility for assets worth more than $30 million in AUM. The purpose of Unilabs is to help investors set aside emotional influences by using real-time machine learning, creating four distinct funds: There are the AI Fund, the BTC Fund, the RWA Fund, and the Mining Fund. The multifaceted funds fuse DeFi with traditional models to let users access Bitcoin along with tokenized yield opportunities, while leaving portfolio management to the Unilabs AI. Instead of speculating manually, Unilabs users gain intelligent, rebalanced exposure to crypto’s fastest-growing sectors. With tokenized yield, dynamic risk profiles, and on-chain NAV tracking, Unilabs creates a bridge between traditional asset management logic and DeFi’s speed, offering an increasingly popular alternative to BNB staking products. In fact, many early adopters are reallocating funds from Binance Coin to protocols like Unilabs for their AI-powered alpha generation. The Current Opportunity: 21.5% Gains at Presale Price The Unilabs presale is live, and the window to buy in before the next price tier closes is narrowing quickly. With over 155 million UNI tokens sold, demand is clearly surging. Currently priced at $0.0051, the next presale tier will move the token price to $0.0062, giving new buyers an opportunity to lock in a 21.5% immediate ROI, a gain that’s purely based on entering early. This isn’t just a speculative play; it’s a calculated move for investors looking to front-run the next valuation bump in a project backed by AI and $30M AUM. The UNIL token itself is more than just a trading chip. It’s a multi-utility asset designed for long-term engagement. Holders benefit from staking rewards, which fuel liquidity across the platform’s diversified funds. Finally, governance rights give every UNI holder a say in how the platform’s strategies evolve, ensuring the community drives decision-making. Unlike BNB, which focuses heavily on validator-based staking, Unilabs enables users to have a direct say in fund performance through transparent AI metrics. Binance Coin Dominance Meets Real AI Competition Just this week, BNB Chain recorded a surge in user and network activity, with daily transactions climbing past 8 million and active wallet addresses exceeding 2 million. Binance’s native token, BNB, price also spiked to $648, a three-month high, fueled by rising on-chain activity and a key development. The proposed ETF has ignited bullish speculation about Binance coin’s future as an institutional-grade crypto asset, further lifting sentiment across the Binance ecosystem. Source : CoinMarketCap However, BNB’s staking and DeFi dominance may no longer be unchallenged. As capital floods into Layer-1s and DeFi-native platforms, investors increasingly seek platforms that offer more than just staking rewards. They want active asset management, real diversification, and access to early-stage alpha capabilities that Unilabs delivers through enterprise-grade AI and structured investment products. Unilabs is quickly emerging as a serious contender other than Binance coin in the next evolution of decentralized finance. While BNB Chain continues to lead in raw transaction volume and validator uptime, its staking system and DeFi structure may soon appear static compared to Unilabs’ dynamic asset management ecosystem. Conclusion Unilabs isn’t a concept; it’s a live, growing protocol with $30M in managed assets and a presale that’s gathering serious momentum. Early participants in protocols like Lido and Yearn Finance saw outsized returns by entering before public listings. Unilabs may be next. Binance coin remains a dominant force, but dominance can erode. As more users demand smart asset management, diversified staking, and performance-linked rewards, platforms like Unilabs could rewrite the rules. The UNIL token offers exposure to a fully automated financial machine with real-time AI execution and a referral-powered ecosystem. With staking, diversified fund access, and real-time performance tracking, Unilabs gives retail investors the tools previously reserved for hedge funds.

The British multinational bank said sovereign entities increased their indirect exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency in the first quarter by buying shares in Strategy (MSTR), noting that the trend bolsters its half-million BTC price projection. Increasing Allocations To MSTR Is Bullish For Bitcoin Roughly 12 government entities increased their exposure to MSTR in Q1, holding 31,000 Bitcoin worth of Strategy shares, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. Although investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were greenlighted in the U.S. in 2024, government entities’ increased Strategy holdings reflect “widening structural demand” for Bitcoin and Strategy’s continued use as a Bitcoin proxy, Kendrick explained. “We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,” he added. Government entities upped their MSTR holdings during the first quarter, with Norway’s Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea’s pension and investment bodies each adding the equivalent of 700 BTC. Meanwhile, United States state retirement funds across California, New York, North Carolina, and Kentucky added a combined 1,000 BTC equivalent. Sweden and Liechtenstein made minor increases, while France and Saudi Arabia took first-time positions, albeit tiny, indicating growing sovereign interest in indirect BTC exposure, according to Kendrick. “The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,” the banker opined. The latest first quarter 13F filings — reports that institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file each quarter — indicate that sovereigns’ exposure to Bitcoin via spot exchange-traded funds “was disappointing at first glance,” while increasing MSTR holdings were “very encouraging,” Standard Chartered said. The most notable ETF move came from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which sold off its entire 3,400 BTC-equivalent stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Kendrick argued that these 13F filings are the best way to test “our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures,” pushing the price of the asset to the $500,000 milestone. “When institutions buy Bitcoin, prices tend to rise,” he summarized.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 07:52:20

According to a May 20 filing , Blackstone bought just around $1.08 million worth of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), despite boasting approximately $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of IBIT at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, as per Google Finance data. This is the first time the asset manager has disclosed investing in anything crypto-related. Despite IBIT’s outstanding performance, it appears that Blackstone is not yet ready to commit substantial capital to investing in the apex crypto. It’s worth mentioning that Blackstone has largely steered clear of crypto. Back in September 2019, Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said he liked the blockchain technology but thought its use for money was “pretty odd.” “[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” he noted at the time. Schwarzman further admitted he wasn’t much of a fan of Bitcoin, citing difficulties understanding the technology. BlackRock On Track To Overtake Satoshi’s Bitcoin Stash BlackRock’s IBIT has drawn in a net inflow of over $46 billion since it went live on Wall Street in January 2024, signaling institutions’ persistent confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a recent post on X that BlackRock is now the second-biggest Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only the mysterious BTC inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Balchunas believes the asset manager is poised to surpass Satoshi’s holdings by next summer. The pundit reckons that if the Bitcoin price climbs to $150,000 in the coming months, it could spark a “feeding frenzy” among financial advisors, which would help BlackRock attain this milestone even more quickly.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Blackrock,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 07:55:58

In a post on X, he pointed to XRP and RLUSD as mechanisms that could reshape how value moves across borders. Aljarrah pointed out that banks currently hold capital in Nostro/Vostro accounts, but XRP eliminates this requirement, which many now see as a fundamental inefficiency in the traditional banking system. He then added that RLUSD can tokenize collateralized debt, and these tokenized treasuries could significantly transform sovereign debt markets. Banks hold capital in Nostro/Vostro accounts — XRP eliminates that friction. Governments collateralize debt with treasuries — RLUSD tokenizes it. Now imagine this entire system operating 24/7 across borders. pic.twitter.com/BRqHvEzaNB — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) May 19, 2025 The Role of XRP in Streamlining Cross-Border Settlements The traditional international banking system relies on Nostro and Vostro accounts, where correspondent banks hold foreign currency balances to facilitate cross-border transactions. This system often results in idle capital and slow settlement times. XRP functions as a bridge asset that enables real-time settlement between currencies. It allows institutions to avoid pre-funding accounts in foreign currencies, thus reducing capital lockup and operational delays. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system, which utilizes XRP, is already employed worldwide to simplify and accelerate cross-border transfers. The core advantage is XRP’s ability to settle transactions in seconds, offering near-instant finality. This addresses a long-standing issue in the global financial system, where delays in settlement can lead to counterparty risks and liquidity inefficiencies. Tokenizing Treasuries with RLUSD Governments traditionally issue treasuries to finance debt, and these instruments are widely used as collateral in financial markets. However, access to them, particularly across borders and outside regular trading hours, remains constrained by legacy systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Aljarrah suggests that RLUSD could tokenize U.S. dollar-denominated assets, such as treasuries, onto blockchain infrastructure. Ripple is making strides in the tokenization market, as real-world asset tokenization could bring significant growth to the crypto space. By tokenizing treasuries, RLUSD could become more than just a stable digital representation of the U.S. dollar, but serve as a programmable, on-chain instrument backed by sovereign-grade assets. This could open new pathways for collateralization and liquidity management in decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional markets. The Future of Global Finance XRP and RLUSD illustrate Ripple’s vision for a borderless, always-on financial system. XRP removes the inefficiencies of pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies, while RLUSD introduces tokenized, liquid collateral that can be moved and settled around the clock. Some analysts believe tokenization is just the start , and with these assets, Ripple could play a major role in global finance in the coming years.

44893910,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67873,1747814896,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP ETF Sees Fresh Delay. Here’s What the SEC Says,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-sees-fresh-delay-heres-what-the-sec-says/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again postponed its decisions on spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals tied to cryptocurrencies, including XRP and Dogecoin. Among those impacted are filings submitted by Grayscale, 21Shares , and a separate application for the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. According to documents recently published on the SEC’s official site, the agency has formally initiated proceedings to assess the proposed products further. As part of this process, the commission is inviting feedback from the public to aid its evaluation of the legal and regulatory implications surrounding these ETF proposals. Bitwise Ethereum ETF Staking Amendment Also Faces Delay Also, the SEC has deferred its ruling on an amendment tied to the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. The amendment seeks to include staking options, potentially enabling investors to earn additional returns through network participation. This feature is a step toward increasing investor exposure to yield-generating opportunities in the Ethereum ecosystem. The agency is delaying its decision and seeking public input, indicating the issue needs more review. Public Consultation Opens as Regulator Seeks Broader Perspective The SEC’s call for public input reflects its ongoing effort to navigate the evolving crypto investment landscape. While no formal conclusions have been reached, the regulator emphasized that the proposals raise complex questions deserving of in-depth public discourse. Stakeholders have 21 days to submit comments and up to 35 days for rebuttal comments after publication in the Federal Register. Delays Consistent with SEC’s Pattern on Crypto ETFs For market watchers, the latest round of deferrals comes as no surprise. Over the past several months, the SEC has repeatedly extended review timelines for various crypto-linked ETFs. Notably, in March, the agency delayed rulings on applications from Grayscale, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary. At that time, the decision on Grayscale’s XRP Trust ETF was moved to May 21. That deadline has been pushed back further as the commission continues to examine whether the ETF proposals meet regulatory requirements under Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act. These measures aim to shield investors from fraud and ensure fair market practices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Experts Predict Extended Review Period Through October Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart noted that these delays align with the SEC’s standard approach to ETF filings, especially those involving spot crypto assets. He stressed that the regulator generally utilizes the entire 240-day review window before making a final decision. Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Seyffart expects spot-based crypto ETFs to be approved by Q4 2025, ruling out June-July approvals. He highlighted that October remains the most likely timeframe for a final ruling on the XRP ETF proposals. Industry Leaders Remain Optimistic Despite Regulatory Hurdles The ETF and crypto industries remain upbeat despite delays. Nate Geraci believes the SEC will approve proposed ETFs, including altcoin-related ones. Geraci’s remarks reflect a broader sentiment in the crypto industry that regulatory clarity is on the horizon, even if the path involves extended deliberation. While the SEC’s latest actions add another chapter to its cautious stance on crypto-linked financial products, they also reinforce the agency’s commitment to thorough due diligence and public engagement. As the comment and rebuttal periods unfold, the market will be watching closely for signs of regulatory evolution that could shape the next wave of crypto investment opportunities.

From banning USDT to nabbing illegal crypto mining in the country, they are making sure that crypto is safe from scams. The country’s anti-money laundering agency, Rosfinmonitoring, has made it clear to the Russian citizens that crypto transactions in the country are no longer as private as people think. Despite crypto exchanges having no legal recognition in the country, they’re already handing over customer data to law enforcement, with no need for a court order. Crypto Anonymity Is a “Myth,” Says Official Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, Olga Tisen, Rosfinmonitoring’s legal head, said that Russian crypto exchanges are actively sharing wallet owner data with authorities upon request. She emphasized that the idea of crypto transactions being anonymous is outdated, especially as these platforms aim to align with future regulations. No Court Order? No Problem KEYANB Alert: Russian AML agency confirms crypto exchanges share ALL transaction data without court orders. ""Anonymity of crypto transfers is a myth."" Their surveillance tool reaches 12,000+ officials. Privacy illusion finally shattered. https://t.co/fo5OKeIVHn pic.twitter.com/2F8zVDPk4a — Keyanb (@keyanb_) May 21, 2025 Tisen says crypto data in Russia isn’t protected like bank information, so the police can get their hands on it pretty easily, no court order needed. Some exchanges even mention on their websites that they’re working with law enforcement, which might sound surprising, but it actually lines up with global anti-money laundering standards. Even though crypto still operates in a bit of a legal gray area in Russia, these platforms seem to be playing it safe and following stricter rules ahead of time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia to Launch Exclusive Crypto Exchange for Ultra-Wealthy Investors , Meanwhile, the Russian government is gearing up to keep an even closer eye on things. Rosfinmonitoring, the country’s financial watchdog, plans to give banks access to a blockchain tracking tool called Transparent Blockchain before the year ends. It’s already being used by police and even agencies outside Russia to track crypto transactions. Moreover, the Central Bank is using it too, to keep tabs on how often Russians are checking out big international crypto exchanges online. The Bigger Picture Over 12,000 regulators and officers across Russia and neighboring countries have access to this blockchain tracking tool. The agency is also pushing for stricter rules around illegal crypto mining, with strong backing from the Central Bank. While Russia may not have fully regulated the crypto space, it’s already watching closely, and user privacy is quickly becoming a thing of the past. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Hagerty says stablecoin issuers will likely purchase massive amounts of US Treasuries as reserve funds to ensure the digital assets remain pegged to the dollar. Says Hagerty, “Stablecoin issuers will be the largest holders of US Treasuries in the world.” Hagerty introduced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which aims to establish federal regulations around the use of stablecoins. The bill is currently being debated by Congress. Asked what will back stablecoins, Hagerty says, “It’s not going to be equities. It’s going to be high quality short-term assets, either short-term US Treasuries or cash. I think the majority of it will be US Treasuries.” On Monday, Hagerty celebrated the bill moving closer to becoming law. “Tonight, the Senate moved forward on the GENIUS Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America’s payment system into the 21st century. The GENIUS Act skyrockets the United States with a digital payment framework with the fastest rails possible. It will ensure US dollar dominance. Customers will be protected, the demand for US Treasuries will balloon to the tune of more than $1 trillion, and innovation in the digital asset space will thrive in the United States going forward. I look forward to making history with my colleagues this week.” The potential legislation would require stablecoin issuers to maintain backing for their assets on a 1:1 ratio. The bill also states that stablecoin issuer reserves can be made up of US currency; funds held as demand deposits or insured shares at an insured depository institution; and Treasury bills, notes or bonds.

As you know, Ripple and Coinbase are now locked in a multi-billion dollar bidding war to acquire Circle – the powerhouse behind USDC. The reported price tag is as high as $11 billion. This one could shake the foundation of the stablecoin market. If Ripple wins, it wouldn’t just gain control of a major dollar-backed asset but could instantly become one of the most dominant forces in the entire ecosystem. And not everyone’s okay with that. Critics are already throwing up antitrust red flags and warning of potential chaos if the deal goes through. Why does this acquisition matter so much? Here’s the buzz. A Disaster Is Brewing Gabriel Shapiro, founder of MetaLeX Labs, did not hold back when weighing in on the possible Ripple-Circle deal. “Making Ripple the largest asset issuer on every blockchain would obviously be disastrous and anticompetitive,” he warned, raising serious antitrust alarms. Shapiro believes that if the acquisition goes through, it won’t sail past regulators. “If a definitive agreement is signed, we will be at the DoJ’s and FTC’s doorstep, citing Ripple’s history of campaigns against Bitcoin and Ethereum…” He also pointed to Ripple’s past behavior, calling out how the firm previously used its influence to hurt competitors – like when Chris Larsen teamed up with Greenpeace in 2022 to target Bitcoin mining. According to Shapiro, Circle needs to consider the Revlon doctrine , which requires companies to act in shareholders’ best interests – including weighing antitrust risk. Oof, a well-researched lash out! Rejected Offers, XRP Leverage & a Heated Bidding War Reports suggest Ripple had initially offered around $4-$5 billion to acquire Circle earlier this year – but was turned down. Now, it’s apparently back at the table with deeper pockets, possibly combining cash and XRP reserves for a much higher bid. “Ripple is setting on holdings at about $94 billion based on estimated around $40 billion in XRP at the current price at $2.37,” said Paul Barron in a now-deleted post. But legal roadblocks still exist – Ripple can’t easily liquidate those tokens without a judge’s nod. On the other side, Coinbase holds a healthy balance sheet: around $8.5 billion in cash and nearly $2.8 billion in crypto investments. Yet despite its financial strength, it hasn’t made a move – raising questions. Circle’s Fate: Ripple, Coinbase… or a Surprise Player? While Ripple appears aggressive, Coinbase may still have the edge – especially with U.S. regulators likely to scrutinize Ripple’s bid harder. “If Coinbase wanted to buy them, Circle would sell in a heartbeat,” one banker reportedly said. And let’s not rule out a dark horse. Firms like Japan’s SBI Holdings, one of the biggest XRP holders, could jump in with support. Ripple’s acquisition push could shift stablecoin dynamics overnight. But if Shapiro’s warnings play out, this could turn into a defining moment for crypto’s future. Hopefully, a good one.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 09:17:03

During a May 21 episode of her “Talk Tuah” podcast, Welch opened up about the federal probe for the first time, revealing that the FBI had shown up at her grandmother’s house after the token’s disastrous debut. “The feds came to granny’s house,” she said, recalling how her grandmother called her in a panic, saying, “The FBI is here after you, what have you done?” Welch said she immediately cooperated, turning over her phone and meeting with agents, who questioned her about her role behind HAWK. She described it as a full-blown “interrogation,” adding that she was eventually “cleared” and told she was “good to go.” She also revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission got involved, requesting access to her phone for a few days. Welch complied and later learned that the SEC had closed the case without pursuing any charges or sanctions. Her lawyer, James Sallah, confirmed that outcome, stating that regulators found no wrongdoing and placed no restrictions on her future involvement with crypto. Welch had “no clue” about crypto On the podcast, Welch admitted that she had “no clue” about cryptocurrencies when she agreed to the project and said she “trusted the wrong people.” “I did not have enough knowledge about crypto to be getting involved with it. And I knew that, but I got talked into it, and I trusted the wrong people,” Welch said. She alleged that a company, whose name she withheld for legal reasons, was fully in control of her X account and posted promotional content on her behalf. Welch insisted she was only paid a flat marketing fee and “did not make a dime from the coin itself,” saying any earnings went toward legal and PR expenses. Despite her claims of limited involvement, blockchain sleuths and angry investors were unconvinced. The HAWK meme coin launched in early December and briefly hit a $500 million market cap before crashing over 90% within minutes. Analytics firm Bubblemaps flagged the token as highly centralized, revealing that insider wallets, allegedly linked to Welch’s team, controlled 96% of the supply and dumped large amounts during the launch window. A flurry of lawsuits As criticism mounted, Welch vanished from social media shortly after a tense interview appearance on December 5 with YouTuber Voidzilla. Her vague sign-off during the interview, “Anyhoo, I’m going to go to bed and see you guys tomorrow”, became infamous as she remained silent for nearly two weeks. She finally resurfaced on December 20, releasing a statement claiming she was fully cooperating with a federal lawsuit filed by Burwick Law on behalf of 12 US residents who allegedly lost a combined $151,000. Welch said she took the matter “extremely seriously” and wanted to help “uncover the truth” and “hold the responsible parties accountable.” While Welch avoided personal legal consequences, alleged HAWK token’s backers, including OverHere Limited, Clinton So, and Alex “Doc Hollywood” Schultz, faced a federal lawsuit accusing them of launching an unregistered security and misleading investors. OverHere later tried to shift blame onto Doc Hollywood, who has since locked his X account and disappeared from public view. Welch’s team has maintained that she did not personally profit from the token and cut ties with the LLC behind it. According to reports, she was never named as a defendant in the lawsuit. By early 2025, Welch confirmed that both the FBI and SEC had cleared her. Despite the fiasco, she has resumed public appearances and continues to host her “Talk Tuah” podcast, though with noticeably more caution around crypto-related ventures.

Over the past few weeks, markets have witnessed volatility across asset classes, gold has continued to rise, and uncertainty, in general, is at its highest point in years. Traditionally, bonds, especially treasuries, have been the primary go-to safe havens in turbulent times. However, the fixed income markets as we know them haven’t always been easy to access, nor have they been the absolute safe haven of previous years, given the current market uncertainties. High entry thresholds, lack of liquidity and opaque structures have kept many everyday investors on the sidelines. However, this is starting to change. Amidst the chaos, tokenised fixed yield and fixed income assets are bucking the trend to offer investors clarity at a time of confusion, at least those that are aware of the nascent asset class. Why Tokenise Fixed Income Assets? Tokenised bonds are digital representations of traditional bonds, issued and managed on blockchain infrastructure. These bonds retain all traditional bond characteristics, such as principal, interest rate and maturity date, while leveraging blockchain technology to ensure security, transparency and efficiency for investors. For instance, there are tokens in the market that invest in short-term US Treasury Bills which, although not offering a fixed yield, have notably been less affected by the current market turmoil. In fact, the total market cap of tokenised US Treasuries as at 1 April 2025 was $5.12 billion – as at 06 May 2025, the figure now sits at $6.59 billion, representing a 29% increase despite the tariff saga. These tokens can attract investors who may typically struggle to access US Treasuries directly due to geographical restrictions. With low minimum tickets to invest in the primary market, retail and institutional investors alike can often access, and even trade on secondary markets, these assets. Meanwhile, small- to mid-sized governments and businesses are issuing tokenised securities that are accessible to all types of investors, offering coupons with returns ranging from 8% to 15% with typically sub-five-year maturities. Tokenised assets are recorded on a blockchain – a secure ledger housed across multiple computer networks – which allows investors to verify ownership, payment history and asset performance in real time. This level of transparency reduces information asymmetry, which is often a key driver of fear and volatility for investors in murky markets. Additionally, the disintermediation ensures that investors seeking to re-allocate their capital can do so through instant settlement or trading on liquid secondary markets, which can be critical during times of market flux. Blockchain technology also ensures immutable records of ownership which reduces counterparty risk, especially during periods of stress when traditional intermediaries may become unreliable. Smart contracts also facilitate automatic interest payments and redemptions, lowering the risk of delayed or failed settlements for investors. Tokenisation not only disintermediates technologically unnecessary counterparties but also allows investors to have more control. As the industry grows and assets are cross-listed across platforms, investors will be able to withdraw their bonds, send them to other exchanges for arbitrage, self-custody them, and even trade them peer-to-peer within whitelisted ecosystems. Challenging Legacy Markets and Financial Institutions We are clearly in a time of significant change for markets, geopolitics, and more. Looking at the broader picture, blockchain technology and, by extension, tokenisation is the first genuine opportunities we have had in generations to rethink finance and do things differently. Many regulators worldwide have adopted a progressive stance towards tokenisation. Some of the most forward-thinking approaches are emerging from small- to mid-sized economies, such as El Salvador and Kazakhstan, where pushback from layers of technologically obsolete intermediaries is less influential. These economies are enabling innovative governments and companies to issue fixed-yield assets that offer investors an alternative to the norm which, under current circumstances, is fuelled by policy uncertainty and market volatility.

Pi Network coin was trading at $0.80 on Wednesday, down by 52% from the highest point this month. This article explores whether Pi is a ghost chain and the impact on price. Pi Network aimed to change the crypto industry Pi Network is a crypto project started seven years ago to solve a key problem that Bitcoin has: its cost of mining. Bitcoin mining has continued rising over the years and is now dominated by large publicly-traded companies like Mara and Riot Platforms that run huge mining farms. Pi Network became popular by creating a platform that enables anyone with a smartphone to mine the coin. Users just need to download an app and then start mining coins by just tapping a button. Pi also hoped to solve the challenge where Bitcoin lacked smart contract features, making it almost impossible for developers to build dApps on top of it. It provided developers tools to build applications in industries like e-commerce, gaming, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Pi’s goal was that its coin would be used in the physical and digital worlds, giving it utility. Also, as with other chains, Pi Network hoped that these transaction costs would be used to burn the token, reducing those in circulation and boosting its price. The presence of an ecosystem was so important that it was a precondition for the mainnet launch to happen. It had to have at least 100 mainnet-ready applications. Pi Network price chart | Source: TradingView Is Pi a ghost chain? Therefore, the question is whether Pi Network is a ghost chain or not. A ghost chain is a blockchain project that has no developers and apps in its ecosystem. It also refers to those chains with ecosystems that people don’t use. A closer look at the Pi Network ecosystem shows that there are applications in its marketplace. Maps of Pi is a search engine that shows the locations of businesses accepting the Pi Coin. Fruity Pi is a game that has become fairly popular in the ecosystem. Other apps in the network are WorkforcePool (an Upwork of Pi), MyFestMap, Pet for Pi, and ChatGPT for Pi. The challenge for Pi Network is that there are signs that developers are not building in its technology stack. Also, no mainnet-ready application has gone mainstream in the past few months. This explains why the developers launched Pi Network Ventures last week. This initiative will see the company deploying $100 million to fund startups leveraging the Pi Network ecosystem. An ecosystem fund is a good initiative that other blockchains have launched similar initiatives. Solana has a $300 million ecosystem fund, while Ethereum launched a $1.03 billion fund. Kava, Skale, Harmony, Kadena, and Velas are other chains with similar funds. The challenge for Pi Network is that the process of identifying projects to fund will take time. After that, the process of building applications will be a lengthy one. As other chains like Harmony, Kadena, and Velas have showed, it is not guaranteed that projects that receive funding will succeed. Kadena’s KDA token is now valued at $183 million, while Velas, which launched a $100 million fund is worth $11 million. Centralization problem In addition to being a ghost chain, Pi Network also faces the accusation that it is a highly centralized network. This accusation stems from the fact that it is overseen by two entities: Pi Core Team and Pi Foundation. For a project with a fully diluted valuation of over $70 billion, token holders should know more about these entities. Also, there should be a clear audit by a top auditor. Nothing is known about the Pi Core Team and the foundation, if it exists. Besides, Pi Foundation today controls over 90 billion. As such, holding Pi is giving this foundation the benefit of the doubt that it will do the right thing and not dump the tokens. There is also a risk that these addresses may be hacked, leading to substantial losses to token holders. The fact that it is a ghost chain and that it is highly centralized explains why many mainstream exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are yet to list it. It also explains why Pi Coin price has crashed. Read more: Pi Network price prediction: Will Pi Coin recover from this plunge?

Like Crypto.com, a Cyprus-based entity played a role in the strategy, with Kraken relying on MiFID II-regulated entity Payward Europe Digital Solutions to offer its derivatives.

The Ohio-based financial services firm said it struck a strategic partnership with 117 Castell Advisory Group to buy distressed bitcoin claims, specifically those with confirmed legal judgments and pending distributions. Among the targeted claims are holdings from the infamous Mt. Gox bankruptcy in 2014, which total around 75,000 BTC, currently valued around $8 billion. While payouts from the decade-old collapse of the Japanese exchange are still trickling out , they represent one of the largest pools of locked-up bitcoin in history. Strive’s plan: gain BTC exposure at a discount, with the goal of beating BTC’s price performance in the long run, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The announcement comes amid broader plans for the company's asset management unit to merge with Nasdaq-listed Asset Entities (ASST) , a move that would make the combined company publicly traded. The firm would leave its operations under the Strive name. The combined company also has plans to raise up to $1 billion through equity and debt offerings to accumulate bitcoin.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully completed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a cumulative total of $9 million from over 11,000 token purchasers. The structured presale model has currently set the token price at $0.03 in phase 5, accelerating progress toward a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM, a 16.67% rise. With a 200% gain already achieved since its initial launch, MUTM is set to officially launch at $0.06, offering current buyers a guaranteed 100% return on investment (2x ROI). As one of the best crypto coins to invest in during this cycle, post-launch projections suggest MUTM could moon 9000% by Q3, putting it in contention as the next big cryptocurrency to dominate the 2025 bull run. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Mutuum Finance brings a new innovation to mtToken features, the ability to earn yield from assets outside the normal procedure of locking them. Users are not locking up holdings, they can freely use their assets and earn passively as well, which is a valuable change to DeFi users who appreciate revenue and usability. In addition, borrowers are able to easily access USDT using the platform’s collateralized loan provision, conformed to given ratio patterns. For example, $7,000 of ETH collateral can be used to unlock $5,000 stablecoins, the process being carried out via open source smart contracts. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $9 million from more than 11,000 investors, and Phase 5 is live now at $0.03, but not for long. With a confirmed 2x ROI at launch, $0.06, and momentum building rapidly, buyers in this phase stand to lock in an instant 16.67% gain when Phase 6 activates at $0.035. Already up 200% since presale launch, MUTM is projected to skyrocket up to 9000% by Q3, making it one of the most explosive opportunities this cycle. This is your final chance to buy before the next price hike, secure your position now or risk missing out on one of the top DeFi launches of 2025.

Strive’s filing includes approximately 75,000 BTC tied to Mt.

Strive is not alone in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Startups like Tether and SoftBank-backed Twenty One Capital have also built up Bitcoin treasuries, buying tens of thousands of BTC.

In an official press release , the web browser announced that the new on-chain naming service would become available for more than 85 million active monthly users. The firm aims to make the domains accessible on the Brave Wallet for cryptocurrency payments and within the main browser’s newest version 1.81, which will be available in Nightly builds and scheduled for release on August 5, 2025. This makes Brave ( BAT ) the first web browser to deploy its own blockchain-based top-level domains or TLDs. Users will be able to mint their named domains as non-fungible tokens on the Polygon ( POL ) network, granting them ownership without renewal fees. The new domains offer users a seamless way to own their digital identity and simplify sending crypto by acting as a replacement to lengthy cryptocurrency wallet addresses, changing them into readable human names. According to the announcement, the domains can be resolved across various networks, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Base ( BASE ), and Sonic ( S ) to name a few.

Sam Altman’s World matches up with dating app giant Match Group Holding a unique .brave domain also allows users to host decentralized websites on the InterPlanetary File System, which can be directly accessed through the browser without incurring any hosting fees. CTO and co-founder Brian Bondy, calls the browser’s first foray into on-chain TLDs as “more than a domain,” as it offers users their very own personalized identity layer that is native to the wider ecosystem. “Our mission is to put privacy, ownership, and control back in the hands of users,” said Bondy. At the moment, the web browser firm and Unstoppable Domains are exploring the possibility of gaining an ICANN general top-level domain registration for 2026. A ICANN gTLD registration would allow for .brave domains to function in both traditional Web2 and decentralized Web3 environments. As previously reported by crypto.news, the firm’s wallet recently added support for Cardano ( ADA ) after its recently announced partnership with Input | Output. The partnership aims to bring Cardano native assets to wallet users, allowing them to send, receive and swap ADA.

In a press release shared with crypto.news, Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu said the investment “aligns perfectly with our mission to advance digital property rights and the open metaverse,” adding that Astar’s focus on onchain entertainment IP, especially in Japan and Asia , offers a unique chance to speed up web3 adoption. The investment size hasn’t been disclosed. The partnership will include integrations such as Anime ID, a digital identity layer powered by Animoca’s Moca Network and partner San FranTokyo. Additionally, Astar is also planning to launch entertainment-focused campaigns like Anime Art Fest on Soneium, per the press release.

Siu earlier said the IPO won’t depend on market conditions, adding that “going public is a way to tell the world that ‘hey there’s a business that is in crypto that isn’t doing the typical crypto stuff.'” Siu also pointed to the shift in regulatory stance under the Trump administration as a key reason for moving forward but didn’t provide a clear timeframe for the public listing, saying it was a unique moment and that it would be a wasted opportunity not to try.

However, according to the following six charts, the bitcoin market now appears sturdier than in December-January, suggesting a higher probability of a continued move higher. Financial conditions: (DXY, 10y, 30y yields vs BTC) Financial conditions refer to various economic variables, including interest rates, inflation, credit availability, and market liquidity. These are influenced by the benchmark government bond yield, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, the dollar exchange rate and other factors. Tighter financial conditions disincentivize risk-taking in financial markets and the economy, while easier conditions have the opposite effect. As of writing, financial conditions, represented by the 10-year yield and the dollar index, appear much easier than in January, favoring a sustained move higher in BTC. At press time, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against major currencies, stood at 99.60, down 9% from highs above 109.00 in January. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note stood at 4.52%, down 30 basis points from the high of 4.8% in January. The 30-year yield has risen above 5%, revisiting levels seen in January, but is largely seen as positive for bitcoin and gold. More dry powder The combined market capitalization of the top two USD-pegged stablecoins, USDT and USDC, has reached a record high of $151 billion. That's nearly 9% higher than the average $139 billion in December-January, according to data source TradingView. In other words, a greater amount of dry powder is now available for potential investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bold directional bets BTC's run higher from early April lows near $75,000 is characterized by institutions predominantly taking bullish directional bets rather than arbitrage bets. That's evident by the booming inflows into the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the still subdued open interest in the CME BTC futures. According to data source Velo, the notional open interest in the CME bitcoin futures has jumped to $17 billion, the highest since Feb. 20. Still, it remains well below the December high of $22.79 billion. On the contrary, the cumulative inflows into the 11 spot ETFs now stand at a record $42.7 billion versus $39.8 billion in January, according to data source Farside Investors. No signs of speculative fervor Historically, interim and major bitcoin tops, including the December-January one, have been characterized by speculative fervour in the broader market, leading to a sharp rise in market valuations for non-serious tokens such as DOGE and SHIB. There are no such signs now, with the combined market cap of DOGE and SHIB well below their January highs. No signs of overheating The bitcoin perpetual futures market shows demand for bullish leveraged bets, understandably so, considering BTC is trading near record highs. However, the overall positioning remains light, with no signs of excess leverage build-up or bullish overheating, as evidenced by funding rates hovering well below highs seen in December. The chart shows funding rates, which refer to the cost of holding perpetual futures bets. The positive figure indicates a bias for longs and willingness among the bulls to pay shorts to keep their positions open. It's a sign of bullish market sentiment. Implied volatility suggests calm The bitcoin market appears much calmer this time, with Deribit's DVOL index, measuring the 30-day expected or implied volatility, significantly lower than levels observed in December-January and March 2024 price tops. The low IV suggests traders are not pricing in the extreme price swings or uncertainty that typically exists in an overheated market, indicating a more measured and potentially more sustainable uptrend.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Stablecoins|ETFs|Bonds|DOGE|SHIB|Volatility|market analysis|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-21 09:38:16

According to Financial Times calculations based on company guidance during the current full-year earnings season, firms like Toyota, Sony, and Mizuho could face a loss of 4 trillion yen ($27.6 billion). The nearly $28B total was calculated by adding up tariff impact figures provided by Japan’s top 100 largest groups by market capitalization, car companies, and others that cited a large impact in their earnings presentations or calls. Most of the estimates given by Japanese groups assume no measures to offset the charges, such as a product price rise. Corporate Japan warns of huge blow from U.S. tariffs *TOYOTA: -180B YEN IMPACT ON PROFIT IN APRIL-MAY FROM US TARIFFS Yeah good luck to you if you work at a Toyota factory in the United States. I tried my best to warn you. — Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) May 8, 2025 Japan’s economy could be steered further off course following figures released on Friday that showed Japanese GDP turned negative in the January-to-March period from the previous quarter, even before the U.S tariffs had begun to show in the export numbers. Japan’s automotive industry, its biggest export sector, was hit the most by the U.S. trade levies. The country exported 1.5 million vehicles to the U.S. in 2023, worth more than $40 billion, and car manufacturers also ship many vehicles and parts into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, which have been hit by tariffs as well. Chief executive at Honda, Toshihiro Mibe, said that the impact of tariff policies is huge, with the car company predicting 650B yen ($4.5 billion) of extra costs and has slashed its investment plans to 2030 by 3 trillion yen ($20B) to 7 trillion yen. Toyota had the hardest blow, estimating an impact of $1.2 billion in April and May. Tadashi Imai, president at Nippon Steel, which declined to estimate the tariff impact, acknowledged that the levies were expected to have a tremendous impact on the domestic and overseas steel industries, including indirect effects. Other Japanese firms said they could take countermeasures to offset the blow by raising prices or shifting more production to the U.S. U.S. expects trade negotiations with Japan The U.S. issued 25% tariffs on imports from Japanese car companies, as well as steel and aluminum producers, while other sectors have 24% levies on their goods as part of President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Japan is yet to secure a deal with the U.S., with chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa planning a third round of talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent by the end of the month. Bessent mentioned on Sunday that tariff rates will go back to reciprocal levels if countries do not make trade deals with the U.S. during the 90-day pause. “President Trump has put them on notice that if you do not negotiate in good faith, you will ratchet back up to your April 2 level.” Scott Bessent, U.S. Treasury Secretary. The President also mentioned on Friday that the U.S. will set tariff rates for its trading partners within the next few weeks. Trump acknowledged that his administration cannot negotiate trade deals with all countries at once due to limited capacity. According to government data, Japan’s export growth slowed for a second straight month as the country reels under Trump’s tariffs. Exports to the U.S. also fell for the first time since December last year, plummeting 1.8% from a year ago. Japan’s exports to the U.S. inched up 3.1% in March. According to official figures, the country’s trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed to 780.6 billion yen ($5.4 billion) in April, compared to 846.9 billion yen in March. Customs data also showed that Japan’s exports of transport equipment, including motor vehicles and parts, to the U.S. fell 4.1% by value from a year earlier.

Memecoins. They evolved from community experiments into extraction systems that exploit fundamental human greed. ”Life-changing wealth from one well-timed trade.” Behind this operates sophisticated machinery. Professional launches with hundreds of thousands of marketing dollars targeting the most susceptible demographics. Artificial time pressures override rational thinking and stimulate impulsive buying. Asymmetrical liquidity pools are designed for controlled price movement. Then, when sufficient retail capital enters, early participants exit. You might also like: The future of RWA tokenization: A call for standardized verification | Opinion Memecoin markets mathematically require more losers than winners. Without external value creation, profits must come from other participants’ losses. Of 1.7 million memes on Pump.fun, only 41 maintained a $1M market cap—a 99.998% failure rate by design. The information advantage A LIBRA’s scandal demonstrates this perfectly. Launched with initial, albeit later retracted, endorsement from Argentine President Javier Milei, LIBRA eventually collapsed and approximately 44,000 individuals lost $251M collectively, on-chain data from Nansen Research indicated. Research also showed that Jupiter Exchange knew about the project two weeks before the public launch. Portnoy reported being offered $30M to promote it. Every successful launch follows a consistent pattern: Inner circle : Developers and initial investors with complete launch information Connected players : Key opinion leaders who receive early information while often telling followers to “stay locked in” Technical participants : Users with specialized tools like sniper bots and bundler connections General public : Retail investors who typically gain access last, often buying near local price peaks The RWA alternative RWAs operate on fundamentally different principles. Their returns derive from asset productivity, not information advantages: Tokenized real estate generates rental income regardless of token trading. Infrastructure assets produce revenue through operations. IP creates royalty streams independent of market fluctuations. The critical difference is that memecoins derive value solely from what future buyers will pay; RWAs derive value from what the underlying assets produce. This enables a positive-sum model. If assets perform well, all participants potentially benefit. RWAs’ most transformative aspect is democratizing access to productive assets previously limited to institutions and the wealthy. Blockchain solves key limitations: Fractional ownership reduces minimums from millions to hundreds. Global access eliminates geographic restrictions. Programmable compliance streamlines regulatory requirements. Continuous markets improve liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. The access revolution Information-advantage systems face structural limitations. Market cycles deplete willing participants as losers rarely return. Meanwhile, extraction infrastructure grows more sophisticated as the participant base shrinks. RWAs face different challenges: regulatory compliance, reliable oracles, custody solutions, and market development. But they connect to assets producing value independent of blockchain itself. Both systems will coexist. As BlackRock’s Fink noted, tokenizing real-world assets isn’t about eliminating speculation but improving how productive assets operate and who can access them. The infrastructure for RWAs has reached the necessary technical threshold for trillion-dollar markets. What remains critical is distribution—connecting these assets with investors.

Ethereum and Ripple also held firm above key technical support levels, helping to sustain a cautiously optimistic tone in broader crypto markets. Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and continues to serve as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. However, its increasing maturity, declining volatility, and rising institutional participation have reduced its appeal for investors targeting outsized, asymmetric returns. In contrast, early-stage tokens like Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among risk-tolerant investors looking for higher upside potential. With sentiment improving across the broader crypto market, these speculative assets are well-positioned to benefit from renewed inflows as traders seek exposure to high-volatility plays. Analysts sees BTC hitting new highs Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, noted several key technical zones traders are watching, including the 21-day moving average (currently at $101,640), the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and the 2025 yearly open. Alan pointed out the potential for a Golden Cross forming between the 50-day and 200-day MAs, with confluence from a longer-term trendline. “If the $105,000 level continues to hold, a move toward the all-time high looks increasingly feasible,” Alan said. Keith Alan @KAProductions · Follow The 50-Day MA is on a trajectory to Golden Cross with the 200-Day MA in a tight range that has confluence with the Trend Line AND the 2025 YO.

In his latest analysis, he flagged $91,800 and $100,700 as key downside levels of interest but emphasized that momentum was favoring the bulls. “It’s always a good morning with Bitcoin at $108,000 and close to a new ATH,” he wrote on X, forecasting that new record highs are arriving “faster than he expected.” Van de Poppe sees $120,000 as the next major milestone, with longer-term targets reaching as high as $200,000. Bitcoin Pepe to list soon A renewed rally in Bitcoin, historically a trigger for wider market momentum, is once again lifting sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. As capital rotates back into digital assets, speculative tokens — particularly meme coins — are regaining investor attention. Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a notable beneficiary of this trend, positioned at the convergence of meme-driven virality and blockchain infrastructure innovation. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network, it combines the network’s established security with the scalability typically associated with Solana-like architecture. The project has announced a series of strategic partnerships to broaden its Layer 2 ecosystem. These include Super Meme for secure meme coin launches using the PEP-20 standard, Catamoto for BASE chain fair launches, and Plena Finance, which may integrate BPEP into its mobile-first DeFi platform. Additionally, a collaboration with the GETE Network could extend Bitcoin Pepe’s presence into cross-chain Web3 gaming. These integrations aim to enhance the project’s technical foundation and provide potential real-world utility for its token, distinguishing Bitcoin Pepe from purely speculative meme assets. Investor interest appears strong. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has raised over $10 million so far, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0359. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, with an exchange listing expected soon after — an event that could act as a near-term catalyst for price action.

As of the afternoon on May 21 (Asia time), Pyth ( PYTH ) was trading around $0.124, down about 3% in the past 24 hours. That’s its lowest point since April 11. The token’s market cap currently sits just above $22.7 billion. The latest slide follows a scheduled token unlock on May 20, which released approximately 2.13 billion PYTH into circulation, valued at $275.11 million. The unlock, part of Pyth’s annual vesting cycle, represented 58.7% of the circulating supply at the time and was distributed to early investors, contributors, and ecosystem participants. Following the event, Pyth’s circulating supply has surged to nearly 5.75 billion tokens, around 57.5% of its maximum supply, which is capped at 10 billion. With this unlock, approximately 36% of the total supply is now in active circulation. The final two unlocks are scheduled for May 2026 and May 2027. You might also like: Pyth Network dips below mid-band and RSI trends lower as $313M token unlock looms Large unlocks like this often unsettle investors, as they inject a significant volume of new tokens into the market without a matching rise in demand. That imbalance can lead to downward price pressure. Even if not all recipients offload immediately, many tend to sell early, anticipating further declines. At the same time, unlocks are often part of a project’s long-term roadmap to distribute ownership more broadly and reward early contributors. They usually mark key milestones in the development cycle. Since Pyth’s unlock schedule was publicly disclosed well in advance, some of the impact may have already been factored in, potentially reducing the risk of a sharp, panic-driven selloff. PYTH eyes drop to $0.10 support level Although PYTH price has recovered slightly since the unlock event, there is a risk that the PYTH price will continue downward in the next few weeks as a death cross pattern nears on the 4-hour/USDT chart. A death cross forms when the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages cross each other while pointing downwards. PYTH price, 50-day and 200-day EMA chart — May 21 | Source: crypto.news In Pyth Network ’s case, the spread between the two moving averages has narrowed in the past few months. Its 200-day MA was at $0.1552, while the 50-day was at $0.1589. A death cross often leads to a substantial decline over time. For example, the last time that PYTH price formed this pattern was in December last year, and the coin dropped by over 76%. PYTH Supertrend and RSI chart — May 21 | Source: crypto.news On top of that, the Supertrend indicator has also flashed a red signal, adding to the bearish outlook. If the death cross is validated, PYTH could continue falling in the near term, with $0.10 being the next key level to watch as both a psychological support and its lowest point from April. That said, PYTH’s Relative Strength Index is currently sitting at 30, which is right near the oversold zone. This might trigger a short-term relief rally as buyers look to buy the dip, but any recovery could be temporary unless the broader trend shifts.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cole is a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and has previously shared content criticizing Ripple and Garlinghouse. His recent repost of a post mocking Garlinghouse has increased scrutiny of the Senator’s impartiality. What further raises questions is the fact that Lummis has received financial support from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z), a known backer of various crypto and blockchain projects. Lummis has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin and is considered one of Congress’s most prominent Bitcoin-aligned lawmakers. These affiliations could explain the Senator’s reluctance to engage with Ripple, a company often positioned in opposition to Bitcoin maximalism. While no formal accusations of misconduct have been made, observers in the crypto community are questioning whether the Senator’s personal and familial connections are influencing her professional decisions. A popular attorney called Bitcoin maximalists immature as they jumped on the situation, attempting to paint it as a victory for BTC, failing to see the harm their actions can do to the crypto market. What’s Next for the Crypto Industry Garlinghouse and others at Ripple have consistently advocated for regulatory clarity, industry support in Washington, and an inclusive approach to crypto regulation. The inability to secure a meeting with Senator Lummis, who has positioned herself as a leader on digital asset policy, has raised concerns about favoritism in the crypto space. For Ripple, exclusion from key policy conversations may affect its ability to contribute to the regulatory landscape, but Garlinghouse remains undeterred.

Easing trade tensions creates improved market conditions, which fuel institutional digital asset adoption. As the May 31 listing nears, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) witnesses increasing inflows, gaining traction as the best crypto to buy this altseason. The first and biggest blockchain network, Bitcoin, has achieved a new milestone: its market cap has reached $2.12 trillion for the first time. BTC is now more valuable than major global corporations like Google, valued at $2.022 trillion, and Meta, valued at $1.6 trillion. Image courtesy: CoinMarketCap From the April low of $74,420, the Bitcoin price has surged 43.67% to a 4-month high of $107,137. Bitcoin's historic achievement comes after significant diplomatic developments on the global stage. US President Donald Trump has announced major trade deals, one being with the UK and another ongoing with China. Positive developments in global trade deals have eased tensions in the financial market, improving investors' overall risk appetite. This achievement has made Bitcoin rise in rankings in global assets and has also given a boost to crypto adoption.

Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, has predicted that the Bitcoin price could reach $200k by the end of 2025, while the long-term outlook for 2028 is suggested at $500k. Bitcoin price holds $105K; 10 DMA becomes key support zone Bitcoin's price has reclaimed the $105,000 level after dipping to a low of $102,000 on Monday. With this bounce, $105k and the 10-DMA have now become critical support. This zone, previously a resistance point in early 2025, has been successfully back-tested. According to the chart analysis, BTC's recent close above $105K, combined with a strong candle body and downside wick, signals growing demand from lower levels. Image Courtesy: TradingView If the Bitcoin price can break past $108K with conviction, analysts believe a new all-time high (ATH) may follow in May. $BTC GOLDEN CROSS INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/u7HTp7F06w — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) May 19, 2025 According to the analyst MisterCrypto, BTC is forming a golden cross in the daily timeframe with a price target of $160, according to the measured target method. The golden cross forms when the 50-day SMA crosses over the 200-day SMA and is seen as a signal for upcoming price surges. While Bitcoin leads the charge, micro-caps are the ones that create wealth for investors. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is one of the best cryptos to buy now, which aligns with the long-term trend of crypto adoption and more awareness of decentralization and accessibility in equal measure. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Biggest play on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe is one of the emerging projects that could directly benefit from Bitcoin’s rising dominance in global finance. This platform is built to grow by Bitcoin’s increasing market capitalization as it enables a meme launchpad on BTC’s $2 trillion liquidity. Major networks like SOL and ETH have had meme manias in recent years, but have you wondered why there haven’t been any memes on the Bitcoin network? Previous attempts have faced technical difficulties, preventing success, but BPEP has pulled it off with the PEP-20 standard, which will allow the launch of memes on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has always been a valuable asset. Now, Bitcoin Pepe is making it a leader in meme and retail trading. This layer-2 meme platform could revolutionize the sector by combining Bitcoin’s security with the speed and scalability of Solana. Some devs are calling it “Solana on Bitcoin.” Additionally, Bitcoin Pepe is establishing major ties with influential crypto projects like Super Meme, Plena Finance, and GETE Network, spanning DeFi, AI, and gaming. This move will significantly enhance BPEP’s utility across multiple sectors. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it laterSeen they've got some major partnerships lined up too.Heard the tier 1's are after this one... I'd stack now while you can. https://t.co/T3kuv2iX4G — Zenia (@Zenia_sol) May 14, 2025 Investor confidence in the project has increased exponentially as the staking pools, totaling over 200 million tokens, are now completely sold out due to high demand. Moreover, the ongoing token presale has raised $10.7m in a short period of time. There is only a brief period of time remaining to buy BPEP tokens at an undervalued price of $0.0359 as the presale is racing towards its May 31st Tier 1 exchange listings. Cardano jumps 20% monthly—can it sustain the rally? ADA rose 20% in the last 30 days because of the positive advancements combined with market optimism about network upgrades. Development activity continues to grow on the ADA network thanks to its regular upgrades. Scalability plans alongside strong interoperability functions enable Cardano to develop its position in the market over time. The price movement of ADA faces huge challenges because market conditions and community enthusiasm for new developments tend to drive price changes. The potential increase of ADA might face difficulties because of diminishing investor attention and technical challenges that could disrupt its market position. Best crypto to buy for the biggest bull cycle Bitcoin price holding above $105K is a powerful signal for the broader market. As BTC eyes a breakout above $110K, altcoins are preparing for liftoff. Cardano’s strong rebound reflects ongoing buyer interest, while Bitcoin Pepe offers one of the most lucrative opportunities of the year. With a public presale offering access at just $0.0359, BPEP stands out as a top-tier pick for investors seeking long-term growth. FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now? Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is currently the top cryptocurrency to consider buying. As the first meme coin launching directly on the Bitcoin network, it introduces the PEP-20 token standard, enabling users to create and trade tokens natively on Bitcoin's Layer 2. With its presale concluding on May 31, BPEP is poised for significant growth upon listing on major centralized exchanges. When is Bitcoin Pepe launching? Bitcoin Pepe will list on centralized exchanges on May 31, after wrapping up its 30-stage presale. Is Caradno a good investment? Cardano (ADA) is considered a promising long-term investment in 2025. Its expanding DeFi ecosystem, which recently surpassed $700 million in total value locked, and growing adoption of smart contracts have enhanced its utility and market appeal. Analysts forecast ADA's price to range between $0.66 and $2.36 by the end of 2025, with some projections reaching up to $2.05, reflecting potential for significant growth. Will Bitcoin reach $250k? As of May 21, 2025, Bitcoin is trading around $107,844 . While a rise to $250,000 would require significant market momentum, the current trends and expert analyses suggest it's within the realm of possibility.

This time around it is providing instant payment remittance services in Malaysia. This further highlights Stellar’s ongoing expansion into real-world utility and cross-border financial infrastructure. Successively, XLM is now a coin to watch closely. Let us analyze its current technical setup and derive Stellar (XLM) price analysis. Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis: Stellar (XLM) is currently changing hands at $0.2882, although up 1.76% in the past 24 hours, it still remains down 7.65% over the past week. Despite the recent plunge, the rebound from the 200-day moving average is a bullish sign. Historically, this MA acts as a strong dynamic support, and price bouncing from this zone often signals the end of short-term bearish trends. Looking at the 4-hour XLM price chart, the altcoin is pushing above the 9-D SMA, another early indication of bullish momentum. That’s not all, the RSI at 51.34, breaking above the midline, suggests growing buying pressure after a bearish phase. Moving toward its forecast, XLM is currently ranging between a key support at $0.20 and a resistance at $0.35. Considering the aforementioned developments, if the altcoin runs out of steam, it could tumble down to $0.26. However, if the breakout gains traction, the $0.30 mark could be on the horizon, before a leg-up to $0.35. That being said, it could average out at $0.28. Also, check out our Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term price targets! FAQs 1. Is Stellar (XLM) a good buy now? Considering the technicals and developments, XLM looks promising for short-term gains. A confirmed breakout above $0.30 would strengthen the bullish scenario. 2. What would invalidate the bullish setup? A break below $0.26 and declining RSI back under 50 could invalidate the short-term bullish structure. 3. How much is 1 Stellar coin? The price of 1 Stellar (XLM) coin at the time of press is $0.2882, with an intraday gain of 1.76%.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XLM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 09:57:13

Analysts and traders are calling for the first phase of an altcoin-driven breakout — and leading the charge are three heavily watched tokens: XRP, Official Trump Coin, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. Each represents a different force in the 2025 cycle — but all three are converging as catalysts in what could be the boldest altseason move yet.

Official Trump Coin: Volatility, Politics, and Viral Attention Official Trump Coin has carved out its own lane — a volatile political crypto asset that continues to ride attention around Donald Trump’s campaign and real-world utility events. With gala dinners, NFT integrations, and a media-heavy ecosystem, the token has captured headlines and market activity — especially among meme coin traders and politically aligned investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Political Powerhouse with Meme Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is the newest and most aggressively watched meme-political cryptocurrency of 2025. It combines bold branding, strong community presence, and an early-stage growth window that traders are rushing to capture. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its identity — a crypto asset built around the American populist energy reshaping financial narratives. It isn’t trying to mimic other political coins. It’s crafting its own message — and buyers are responding in droves. The project has quickly evolved from a niche curiosity into a front-runner for meme coin capital rotation, drawing in retail buyers, high-risk speculators, and early investors who recognize what happens when culture, branding, and timing align perfectly. Its target listing is set, attention is rising, and many now see MAGACOIN FINANCE as the coin most likely to dominate the second half of the year.

These functions let users explore new tokens , tap into passive income opportunities, and make crypto payments across 130+ blockchains . The Crypto for Everyone Movement In the past year, Bitget Wallet’s overall user base went up by 300% thanks to the platform’s expansions in emerging regions like Africa (+959%), the Middle East (+350%), and Europe (+367%), where people rely on crypto to handle inflation , economic instability , and a lack of traditional banking infrastructure. The wallet was also among the first to allow in-app shopping with crypto cards , QR codes, and direct token purchases, supporting payments across over 300 major brands, including Amazon, Google Play, Shopee, and more.

Filed in the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, the complaint accuses the firm of issuing deceptive “rights certificates” tied to Unicoin tokens and falsely marketing them as being backed by real-world assets. Executives Accused of Misleading Investors According to the SEC, Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former Chief Investment Officer Alex Dominguez are at the center of the alleged scheme. The agency claims they falsely promoted investment certificates by asserting they were backed by valuable international real estate—when in reality, the properties were worth only a fraction of what was promised. Unicoin also allegedly overstated its fundraising efforts , claiming to have raised $3 billion through certificate sales. The SEC asserts the actual amount raised was closer to $110 million. Furthermore, Konanykhin is said to have personally sold nearly 38 million rights certificates to investors who were not legally eligible to participate. In addition to the three executives, Unicoin’s general counsel Richard Devlin was named for misleading investors through a private placement memorandum. Although Devlin has not admitted wrongdoing, he agreed to a $37,500 fine and accepted a permanent injunction. “Unicoin and its executives exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises,” said Mark Cave, associate director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Their claims of real estate-backed tokens were simply not true.” Company Denies Allegations, Vows Legal Fight Unicoin and its leadership deny the charges. In a statement to Decrypt last month, Konanykhin dismissed the SEC’s claims, insisting the lawsuit is politically motivated and not reflective of current agency leadership. “It’s grotesque that the most compliant crypto company in the U.S. remains the only one being persecuted by the SEC,” he said, calling the case a remnant of the previous Gensler-led administration. The timing of the lawsuit is also raising eyebrows, as the SEC under President Trump has recently backed off other major crypto enforcement actions, including cases against Coinbase, Ripple, and Kraken. The SEC is seeking permanent bans for the three top executives, alongside disgorgement and civil penalties. The case could become a high-profile test of the agency’s evolving stance on crypto regulation under the new administration.

Not If You’re the Guy Who Lost $66M,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-meme-coin-to-buy-not-if-youre-the-guy-who-lost-66m,"The crypto market is a rollercoaster of hype and heartbreak, with meme coins leading the charge in both profits and pitfalls. A good example is the wild swings of the $TRUMP memecoin, where traders who won a dinner with the US president reaped millions, while one investor, possibly Justin Sun, is nursing a staggering $66 million loss. This tale of feast and famine underscores the high-stakes gamble of chasing the best meme coin to buy. Amid this chaos, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , an Ethereum-based token blending AI-driven trading with meme culture, emerges as a potential contender for investors seeking innovation over speculation. The $TRUMP Memecoin Frenzy: A Tale of Wins and Losses The $TRUMP memecoin, launched days before Donald Trump’s second inauguration in January 2025, skyrocketed to a $14 billion valuation before plummeting to its current $2.6 billion level, per CoinMarketCap. A contest announced on April 23, 2025, fueled its meteoric rise, offering a gala dinner with Trump to the top 25 holders of $TRUMP in publicly visible wallets. The token’s price surged from $9.26 to $15.33 during the contest window, tempting traders to pile in. However, the aftermath revealed a stark divide. Of the 25 “VIP” winners, 16 emptied their wallets post-contest, with some cashing out millions. For instance, the “Woo” account reportedly turned a $2.6 million profit by buying 1 million $TRUMP tokens at $10.8 million and selling at $13.3 million. Others, like “NACH,” pocketed smaller but still significant gains of around $52,000. However, not all were so lucky. The “SUN” account, speculated to be linked to crypto mogul Justin Sun, bought 800,000 tokens at a peak price of $61.13, only to see the token crash to $12.96 by May 2025—a potential $66 million loss. The $TRUMP contest also raised eyebrows. Of the 25 VIPs, 22 only began accumulating tokens after the contest was announced, suggesting speculative plays rather than long-term belief in the coin’s value. With 56 of 195 additional winners also emptying their wallets, the memecoin’s lack of intrinsic utility—beyond speculative trading and a dinner with Trump—became glaringly apparent. As Trump’s administration pushes for looser crypto regulations, the market remains a speculative playground, making it critical to evaluate which meme coin offers real potential in 2025. Why Meme Coins Are Still a Hot Topic in 2025 Meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have long captivated the crypto community with their viral appeal and potential for explosive returns. In 2025, the meme coin market continues to thrive, driven by social media hype and community engagement. However, the $TRUMP saga shows that not all meme coins are created equal. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have built loyal followings and some utility, like Dogecoin’s use in tipping, many newer tokens rely solely on hype, leaving investors vulnerable to crashes. Investors hunting for the best meme coin to buy must look beyond short-term pumps and evaluate projects with tangible value or innovative technology. This is where Dawgz AI stands in the gap, offering a blend of meme-tastic fun and AI-driven trading that could set it apart in the crowded 2025 market. Dawgz AI: A Meme Coin with a Technological Edge Unlike other meme coins that thrive on political hype and celeb endorsements, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) aims to deliver value through artificial intelligence and community engagement. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, $DAGZ is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 8.888 billion DAGZ tokens. Its presale, which has raised $3.61 million of $4.19 million, offers tokens at $0.00438, with the next price increase to $0.00474 looming. Its smart contracts have also been audited by SolidProof to address security concerns in the crypto sphere. But what makes Dawgz AI stand out is its integration of AI-powered trading algorithms to optimize returns. Developed by a team of Wall Street veterans and algorithmic trading experts, these algorithms analyze market trends in real-time, aiming to deliver consistent yields with minimal effort from investors. This focus on advanced technology differentiates $DAGZ from traditional meme coins, which often lack utility.

This downturn coincides with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to postpone its ruling on 21Shares’ proposed spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), as outlined in a filing on May 20. A week ago, XRP’s market capitalization stood at $153.56 billion. As of press time, the figure has fallen to $137.45 billion, a decline of $16.11 billion. The token is currently trading at $2.34, reflecting a price drop of nearly 10% over the same period. XRP market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap SEC delays spot ETF approval In announcing the delay, the SEC stated it would extend the review period to assess whether the proposed 21Shares Core XRP Trust complies with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. This provision mandates that ETF products implement adequate safeguards against fraud and market manipulation. The proposed ETF aims to track the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and rely on Coinbase Custody to securely store its underlying assets. Following the delay, stakeholders have 21 days to submit comments and 35 days for rebuttals. On the other hand, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart described the development as “expected,” noting that the SEC typically utilizes the 240-day review window under the 19b-4 filing process. He stated that approvals for spot crypto ETFs are unlikely before late June or early July and are more realistically expected in early Q4 2025. Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Next SEC ETF decision For instance, as reported by Finbold, the SEC is expected to decide on Franklin Templeton’s application for a spot XRP ETF by June 17, 2025. Franklin Templeton, one of the largest asset managers pursuing such a product, aims to offer investors exposure to XRP via traditional brokerage accounts, an approval that could potentially drive the asset’s price higher. Indeed, odds of spot XRP ETF approval have surged on prediction markets such as Polymarket , where confidence in a 2025 unveiling of the product has risen to 83% . XRP spot ETF approval odds.

According to the announcement, XRP futures were launched on CME on May 19, joining crypto products that include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and futures. Related News: The Long-Awaited Big XRP Announcement Has Arrived! ""The Date is May 19!"" According to the data, CME XRP futures contracts recorded trading volumes of over $19 million on their first day and at least $10 million on their second day. XRP futures have surpassed Solana’s $12.3 million first day of trading. According to the statement made by CME, the launched XRP futures offer investors the opportunity to trade both micro contracts containing 2,500 XRP and larger contracts containing 50 thousand XRP. CME XRP futures are settled in cash and are based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is used as the daily reference rate for the XRP price in the US dollar and is calculated daily at 16:00 London time. Market participants view the launch of regulated XRP futures contracts as a potential step towards approval of a spot XRP ETF in the United States. At this point, ETF Store President Nate Geraci also stated in his post that it is only a matter of time for the spot XRP ETF to be approved after futures XRP transactions, implying that he is certain that the XRP ETF will be approved. Despite a strong outflow from futures contracts, the spot price of XRP has remained relatively stable, trading around $2.35. *This is not investment advice.

Vanar Chain is a next-gen Layer 1 blockchain that tackles Web3’s deepest pain point: data permanence. Most chains store pointers to external files. Vanar stores the files themselves at scale using a breakthrough called Neutron, a compression-powered storage layer that tucks megabytes of data into kilobytes and commits the result straight into the blockchain. Built with EVM compatibility, AI- agent support, and real-world asset (RWA) infrastructure, Vanar is positioning itself as the intelligent backbone for apps that can’t afford to go dark when a cloud provider stutters. Neutron: Data Meets Chain, For Real Neutron flips the traditional “hash plus hosted file” model and replaces it with a fully self-contained, on-chain data system. Here’s why that’s a big deal: AI-powered dual-layer compression - Neutron shrinks files up to 500:1 using both physical and semantic passes. Neutron Seeds - These self-describing assets are retrievable by smart contracts either in full or field-by-field. No external hosts - No S3, no IPFS, no broken thumbnails, no outages from AWS or other clouds. True ownership - Both data and logic live on-chain, making files provable, permanent, and composable. This isn’t just a new way to store - it’s a new way to prove and own digital assets. A Chain With a Story 2017–2022: The team behind Vanar began as Terra Virtua, a digital collectibles platform that learned the hard way how brittle off-chain links can be. Late 2023: The rebrand from TVK to VANRY marked the beginning of Vanar Chain and its focus on AI-native, fully on-chain data. Today: With 80 engineers across Dubai, London, and Lisbon, Vanar has logged over 11.9M transactions, 1.56M unique addresses, and 100+ ecosystem partners - serious traction backing a serious vision. Why Vanar Matters Web3 has talked about truly on-chain assets for years - Vanar is finally making them possible. With Neutron, a DAO can anchor its meeting minutes to the chain, an AI agent can cite and prove its data source, and a lending protocol can execute a loan agreement backed by the actual document it references. This is on-chain memory, not just validation - a critical step for AI, finance, and real-world asset use cases that need transparency and finality. And with validators like Google Cloud and NVIDIA in the mix, Vanar’s infrastructure is already enterprise-grade. What’s Next? Q3 2025: Launch of the public Neutron Toolkit and developer portal Q4 2025: Expansion of the Neutron grant program Through 2026: Validator growth, more exchange integrations, and performance optimization to scale for AI-heavy, data-hungry apps Vanar’s goal? To become the default home for apps that can’t trust the cloud to keep their assets live. Fun Fact Neutron’s first public demo was more art show than dev update - it played live on 360° screens at Dubai’s Theatre of Digital Art during TOKEN2049, turning file compression into a full visual spectacle. Vanar Chain isn’t chasing faster blocktimes or TPS records. It’s solving the actual problem: how to make Web3 work when the internet breaks. For dApps, agents, and protocols that need their data to actually live on-chain, Vanar is the bet that might just pay off.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-21 10:09:44

Introduced by Blockstream CEO Adam Back , this powerful formula shows how long it would take for a company to earn its market valuation in Bitcoin terms—based on its current BTC accumulation rate. As the crypto sector matures, ‘Days to Cover’ is emerging as a key tool to distinguish real Bitcoin builders from hype-driven branders . What Is the ‘Days to Cover’ Metric? The ‘Days to Cover’ metric is calculated using the formula: Days to Cover = ln(mNAV) / ln(1 + Daily BTC Yield) Here’s what it means: mNAV (Market Net Asset Value) is the ratio of a company’s market cap to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. For example, an mNAV of 4.26 means the market values the company at 4.26x its BTC holdings. The formula estimates how many days it would take for a company’s daily BTC yield to “cover” its current valuation. In simple terms, this metric shows how long it would take for a company to earn its market cap in Bitcoin—based on its current stacking pace. ‘Days to Cover’ Breakdown for Top Public BTC Companies MicroStrategist , a leading BTC analysis platform , applied this metric to the top BTC-holding public companies. Here’s what they found: Company mNAV Daily BTC Yield Days to Cover MetaPlanet 5.08 1.49% 110 days MicroStrategy (MSTR) 2.1 0.12% 626 days The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) 9.4 1.48% 152 days Semler Scientific 1.5 0.33% 114 days Companies like MetaPlanet and ALTBG are stacking Bitcoin aggressively—yielding over 1.4% daily . Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, despite its massive holdings of 576,230 BTC , accumulates at a more conservative pace but remains the most institutionally trusted BTC stock. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Bitcoin Heading to $600,000 by October 2025? , Why ‘Days to Cover’ Is Crucial for Bitcoin Investors Real-Time Signal : This metric updates dynamically with a company’s BTC growth. Fundamental Filter : It helps spot genuine Bitcoin-focused companies over hype-driven ones. Investment Indicator : A low ‘Days to Cover’ can hint at undervalued BTC stocks . In March, The Blockchain Group had one of the lowest ‘Days to Cover’ scores—and its stock has since surged over 834% . Final Thoughts As the crypto market evolves, new metrics like ‘Days to Cover’ are becoming essential for investors seeking fundamentally strong BTC plays .Whether you’re a long-term Bitcoin believer or a data-driven trader, this metric offers a unique window into which companies are truly stacking sats —not just talking about it. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Interestingly, the Bitcoin dominance experienced a small pullback, which suggests a shift in the investor’s attention away from the star token towards the other altcoins. Meanwhile, the popular ones are failing to rise above their respective resistance as Ethereum remains stuck below $2600 and the prices of Litecoin & Quant continue to accumulate below $100. Now the question arises whether an ETH price breakout is required to lift the LTC & QNT price above $100 or a major price action is fast approaching. Litecoin (LTC) Price Feared for Another Drop The Litecoin price had broken above the prolonged consolidated range in the first few weeks, but the momentum faded as the token reached the end of Q1. Although the bulls are working hard to validate a V-shaped recovery, the bears are successfully dragging the levels below $100 and have kept the price restricted within the range. The current chart pattern could appear bullish, but in the wider timeframe, the LTC price appears to be primed for a major pullback. The LTC price has remained stuck within a rising parallel channel for over a few years, after triggering a rebound from the 2022 bear market. The token has been trying to breach above the average band of the channel for over a couple of weeks, but the bearish start for the week flashes bearish signals. The 50/200-day MA is failing to initiate a Golden cross while the DMI is heading towards a bearish crossover. Therefore, the Litecoin price is feared to drop back close to $75 if the token fails to trigger a rebound. Quant (QNT) Price in a Decisive Phase Quant has maintained a horizontal consolidation after surging by over 60%. The consolidation has been flashing the weakness of the bulls, which may point towards an extended pullback. The QNT price is trading within a decisive phase, and hence, a breakout could elevate the price beyond current highs. While the volume remains within a restrictive range, it would be interesting to watch whether the price will rise to $111 or drop close to $80. As seen in the above chart, the Quant price is about to experience a rise in volatility as the Bollinger bands are about to contract. On the other hand, the Chaikin Money Flow is heading towards the average range, hinting towards a drop in the money flow. This suggests the token is likely to accumulate for some more time, followed by which a major price action could follow, depending on the volume induced. Considering the current price action, breaching above $100 seems to be quite difficult for the prices of Litecoin and Quant. However, with a rise in the buying volume, the market sentiments could change, which could clear the barriers to rise above the 3-digit figure.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|QNT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 11:27:20

In an X post published on May 20, Aave ( AAVE ) said it now holds 20% of the total value locked across decentralized finance. The sector as a whole has seen a sharp recovery, supported by a strong rally in Ethereum ( ETH ), which is up nearly 60% over the past month. Another post from on-chain analytics platform Sealaunch revealed that Aave’s DeFi TVL has doubled from $56 billion to $115 billion between Jan. 24 and May 21. Aave now holds 20% of all DeFi TVL. pic.twitter.com/I8FQChIlgv — Aave (@aave) May 20, 2025 The token’s price has followed that momentum. AAVE is trading around $260 at press time, marking an 80% gain in the past 30 days and an 11% rise over the past week. Still, it remains about 60% below its record high of $661 from May 2021. Although $627 million was traded in the last day, that represents a 25% decrease from the previous day, indicating some cooling following the most recent spike. Aave’s recent surge is supported by a number of important events. Most notably, Aave integrated with a non-EVM chain for the first time ever when it deployed its V3 protocol on Aptos on May 19. This milestone improves Aave’s cross-chain lending capabilities and widens its network reach.

On the regulatory front, the U.S. Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act is seen as a win for large DeFi companies like Aave, which may increase institutional adoption. Looking at the technical picture, AAVE is still on a solid upward trajectory. The price is trading well above all of the major moving averages, with the 200-day EMA hovering around $200 and the 10-day EMA and SMA at about $237, indicating widespread bullish momentum. Aave price analysis. Credit: crypto.news At 74.6, the relative strength index indicates an overbought situation. Momentum indicators, like the MACD, are still in the “Buy” territory. AAVE is riding the upper band in the Bollinger Bands, which is usually a continuation sign during a strong rally. Recent sessions have seen an increase in volume, which supports the move. As long as AAVE remains above the 20-day simple moving average at $214, the bullish trend might continue. A break above $271, the upper Bollinger Band, could open the door for further gains toward the $300 mark, even though overbought conditions suggest a short-term pullback is also possible.

The project has entered phase 5 of its presale after selling out phase 4 faster than expected. MUTM is set to officially launch at $0.06, with a 200% gain already achieved since its initial launch. The next phase prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035. The tokens are available at $0.03, listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9 million raised and attracted more than 11,000 investors. As investors continue searching for the next big crypto, all eyes are on whether MUTM can transition from a low-priced gem to a double-digit token by 2026. Its powerful tech stack, Ethereum-based foundation, and surging popularity across social platforms all signal explosive upside. For those wondering what crypto to buy now for maximum growth potential, MUTM stands out as a serious coin among top coins preparing to lead the next wave. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9 million raised and attracted more that 11,000 investors. As Phase 5 is in , the token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Mutuum Finance isn’t just innovating, it’s building trust. The platform’s smart contracts are open-source and undergoing rigorous third-party audits. In addition to the native token, a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin is being developed, which circumvents the vulnerabilities of algorithmic stablecoins that have toppled other DeFi initiatives. The project is set to build a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network as one of the main features in the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are fundamentals of the ecosystem. Fostering Growth with $100K Giveaway and Gamified Community Tools To turbocharge adoption, Mutuum Finance is actively incentivizing its early adopters. Already underway is a $100,000 giveaway, where ten participants will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Running in tandem is a gamified leaderboard, displaying and rewarding the top 50 token holders, to encourage greater investment and continued participation. This is supported through a referral program, a new level of grassroots expansion in this rapidly growing community. Over $9 million raised from 11,000+ investors, a 200% gain since launch, and Phase 5 tokens available now at $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving it’s not just another presale; it’s a movement. As the next price jump to $0.035 looms, current buyers can lock in a 16.67% instant upside and a 2x ROI at launch ($0.06). With its hybrid lending model, Ethereum-based infrastructure, and growing community driven by a $100K giveaway and gamified rewards, MUTM is well-positioned to hit double-digit territory by 2026. This is your window to enter before Phase 5 sells out and price climbs again. Don’t be the one watching from the sidelines when the next DeFi rocket takes off.

Atkins, testifying in one of his first public hearings since taking office, reaffirmed his commitment to prioritizing digital asset oversight, while Adams announced the formation of a Digital Advisory Council to attract investment and make New York the world’s leading crypto hub. New York City Aims to Become Global Crypto Capital with New Digital Advisory Council New York City Mayor Eric Adams is pushing forward with his long-standing digital asset agenda, announcing on Monday the formation of a new Digital Advisory Council aimed at establishing the city as the “crypto capital of the globe.” Speaking at the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams emphasized the importance of integrating blockchain technology into civic life, not as a passing trend, but as a foundational shift for New York’s digital future. While specific details remain under wraps, Adams said the council would be composed of local experts and fintech leaders, with a council chair and formal policy recommendations expected in the coming weeks. Mayor Adams made it clear that this initiative is about more than branding. He envisions blockchain technology playing a direct role in city governance and public services. One of the proposals under consideration is enabling New Yorkers to pay for certain municipal services and taxes using cryptocurrencies, a move that would align the city with broader state-level legislative efforts already underway. Adams also floated the idea of using blockchain to safeguard sensitive documentation, such as birth and death certificates, in a secure yet accessible format. This latest push follows a May 12 announcement that financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale would assist in the city’s broader blockchain adoption efforts. These firms bring fintech, tokenization, and asset management experience to the table, suggesting the advisory council may focus on more than just payments and records. It may also evaluate tokenized infrastructure, digital identity, and blockchain-based capital formation strategies. The mayor’s commitment to crypto and Web3 initiatives isn’t new. Since taking office in January 2022, Adams has consistently promoted the city’s adoption of digital assets—famously opting to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin as a gesture of support. State-Level Momentum but Limited Progress While Adams takes the initiative on the city level, several New York State legislators have also attempted to advance digital asset policy statewide. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill allowing state agencies to accept crypto payments. Earlier, in February, State Senator James Sanders Jr. proposed the Blockchain Study Act, aimed at forming a task force to assess the state’s blockchain landscape. However, both bills remain in legislative limbo and have yet to advance through either the state Senate or Assembly. These developments come amid a broader trend of US states positioning themselves for the crypto economy. At least 18 states are considering proposals to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, and New Hampshire and Arizona have already passed related legislation, according to data from Bitcoin Reserve Monitor. States pushing for Bitcoin reserves (Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor ) Mayor Adams' commitment to crypto faced scrutiny after he was indicted on corruption charges tied to alleged illegal campaign contributions from the Turkish government. However, in a surprising turn of events, the US Justice Department directed local authorities to drop the charges, and the case was formally dismissed with prejudice on April 2. Despite the controversy, Adams has used the clearing of his name as a springboard to reassert his policy platform, which he says is centered on economic inclusion, technological equity, and digital transformation. Crypto Summit Marks Turning Point The New York City Crypto Summit, where Adams made his announcement, marks the city’s most formal step toward integrating the crypto industry into its public and economic systems. The summit included representatives from fintech startups, blockchain developers, venture capital firms, and policymakers, signaling a concerted effort to position the city competitively against other global crypto hubs like Dubai, Singapore, and London. With new collaborations, a policy council in motion, and continued legislative efforts at the state level, New York City is setting the stage to reclaim its tech dominance. The crypto industry, long skeptical of New York’s historically strict regulations, may find renewed optimism in Adams’ approach, which blends regulatory realism with a pro-innovation stance. The next steps include finalizing the Digital Advisory Council’s structure and releasing policy recommendations—expected before the end of Q2 2025. In parallel, pilot programs for blockchain-based document security and crypto tax payment systems are reportedly under internal review. Whether these plans will translate into meaningful infrastructure, and actual adoption, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: New York is back in the conversation, and this time, it’s speaking the language of tokenization. New SEC Chair Paul Atkins Pledges Crypto Reform as GENIUS Act Gains Momentum In related news, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins appeared before lawmakers on May 20 in a highly anticipated congressional oversight hearing, making his position clear: the future of digital asset regulation will be one of his top priorities. Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee, Atkins addressed a slew of questions ranging from regulatory funding transparency to interagency collaboration. While measured in tone, his remarks confirmed that the SEC is preparing to pivot away from the enforcement-heavy stance of past leadership and toward a more structured, collaborative framework for regulating cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Paul Atkins at a May 20 SEC oversight hearing (Source: House Appropriations Committee ) A New Tone at the Top Atkins’ appointment in April, under the nomination of President Donald Trump, was widely seen as a turning point for US digital asset regulation. A former SEC commissioner himself, Atkins brings both institutional credibility and industry-friendly leanings to the role. His early actions have signaled an effort to realign the SEC’s approach to crypto with market realities and innovation imperatives. This hearing marked his first major public appearance since assuming the role and came just a day after the US Senate moved forward on a vote to consider the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act)—a landmark piece of legislation that could redefine stablecoin oversight. Lawmakers pressed Atkins on the status of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, helmed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, and sought specifics on its budget, timeline, and objectives. Representative Chuck Edwards (R-NC) asked directly how much funding had been allocated to the task force, a question Atkins declined to answer directly, saying only that the findings were “still under development.” Though vague on numbers, Atkins confirmed the task force’s first formal report is expected within the coming months. This report, he hinted, will lay the groundwork for clearer guidance on token classification, disclosures, custody frameworks, and potentially even DeFi-specific protocols. Upcoming June Roundtable Signals DeFi Focus The SEC is also organizing a series of roundtable discussions with commissioners and private sector leaders, the next of which is scheduled for June 9 and will focus specifically on decentralized finance (DeFi). These forums are expected to influence the Commission’s internal rulemaking discussions and could set the stage for tailored regulation that distinguishes DeFi from centralized crypto platforms. Sources close to the SEC suggest that these roundtables are part of a broader strategy to rehabilitate the agency’s relationship with the digital asset sector, which has long criticized the SEC for pursuing regulation through enforcement rather than engagement. Atkins' remarks coincided with major movement in the US Senate on the GENIUS Act, which aims to create a national framework for stablecoin issuance, reserve audits, and regulatory jurisdiction. Under the act, stablecoin oversight would be clarified and shared between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), with the Federal Reserve overseeing reserve asset integrity. The bill is part of a wave of crypto-related legislation currently under discussion in Congress, including proposals for tax deferrals on digital asset transactions, definitions for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and digital identity protection using blockchain technology. Atkins signaled alignment with the GENIUS Act's objectives, suggesting the SEC would welcome legislative clarity that delineates its role in overseeing specific digital asset classes, particularly stablecoins and security tokens. From SEC Limbo to Regulatory Momentum Atkins’ prior statements have been critical of the regulatory vacuum that the crypto market has found itself in under past administrations. Now, with increasing alignment between legislative efforts and SEC reform, the prospect of a more stable and transparent regulatory framework for US crypto markets is closer than ever. Industry groups including the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, and Crypto Council for Innovation have cautiously welcomed Atkins' leadership, noting his willingness to engage constructively with both innovators and lawmakers.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 11:30:00

Coins like XRP and Cardano have dazzled investors with massive rallies and impressive utility stories. It’s easy to get caught up chasing the echoes of these established titans. But history shows us that the truly life-changing gains, the elusive 1000x returns, rarely come from the well-known giants already in the spotlight. Instead, they hide in the shadows, in projects so new that only a few insiders have their eyes on them. If you want to build real wealth in crypto, the smart move is to look beyond yesterday’s winners. The real fortune often lies in pre-exchange tokens, those hidden gems in their infancy. This is where the savvy “smart money” is parking bets, scooping up tokens before the market catches on. And today, we’re pulling back the curtain on one such opportunity. XRP (XRP): Riding High on Waves of Adoption and Anticipation XRP remains one of the crypto market’s heavy hitters .

Its continued strength is backed by adoption in cross-border payments and a community eager for regulatory clarity. Market forecasts suggest XRP could nearly double, potentially reaching $5.00 within the next four weeks. This optimism stems from ongoing developments and a resurgence of interest in digital payment rails. While XRP’s rise is impressive, its story is well-known and widely priced in by now. Cardano (ADA): The Deliberate Ascent of a Research-Driven Powerhouse Cardano has carved a niche as a research-first blockchain platform focused on security, scalability, and sustainability. At $0.7719 and ranking 9th in market cap , Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem methodically. Analysts project a climb toward $0.9950 over the coming month, fueled by upcoming protocol upgrades and growing DeFi activity on its network. Cardano’s steady, science-backed approach makes it a dependable player, but this slow and steady pace means explosive gains are rarer. The “Off-Radar” Multiplier: Why Pre-Exchange Gems Hold Explosive Potential Here’s the crucial insight: once tokens hit major exchanges, the early explosive growth phases are usually behind them. The crowd has caught on, valuations rise, and the easy gains diminish. The real 1000x plays live in the shadows : projects still in presale or the earliest community stages, where risk is high but rewards are unmatched. These are the tokens still flying under the radar, awaiting discovery by sharp-eyed investors who know where to look. Unveiling the Enigma: Introducing OpenFundNet (OFNT)—The Community’s Best-Kept Secret Meet OpenFundNet (OFNT) , a pre-exchange token quietly building momentum as the next big player in decentralized crowdfunding. While few are talking about it yet, OFNT’s mission is clear: fix the trust, fee, and accessibility problems plaguing traditional crowdfunding by leveraging Web3 technology. Currently in presale or early stages, OFNT offers an unprecedented opportunity to get in before the public stampede. This stealth positioning means early supporters could reap outsized rewards as the platform and token gain visibility. The Anatomy of a Giant Slayer: What Gives OFNT its 1000x DNA? OFNT’s blueprint for massive growth rests on innovative features that solve real-world issues: Validator-Driven Trust: Unlike traditional platforms riddled with opaque vetting, OFNT uses a validator system to score and approve projects. This transparency builds genuine trust and quality control, attracting serious backers. Zero Platform Fees: OFNT’s zero-fe e model means creators receive more funding and backers’ contributions go further. This no-extraction approach is a game-changer in an industry notorious for high fees. Dual Rewards & Emission Engine: The tokenomics reward both backers and validators daily with token emissions. This creates an engaged, sustainable ecosystem fueling continuous growth and participation. The Ground-Floor Window: OFNT’s Presale—Your Entry Before the Public Stampede Here’s where it gets exciting. OFNT has allocated 10% of its total token supply specifically for the presale phase. This limited window is a rare ground-floor chance to secure tokens at favorable terms before they hit major exchanges. Participation is streamlined; early buyers can join using widely accepted cryptocurrencies like USDT. This accessibility ensures that the early community can grow quickly, setting the stage for explosive network effects. Beyond Price Pumps: OFNT’s Vision for a Self-Sustaining Crowdfunding Universe OFNT is more than just a speculative token. Its vision is to build a decentralized, community-governed crowdfunding platform that is self-sustaining and scalable. Governance tokens empower holders to vote on critical platform decisions, ensuring the project evolves with its community’s needs. Combined with deflationary mechanisms like scheduled emission halvings , OFNT’ s design supports long-term token scarcity and value appreciation. This isn’t a flash in the pan; it’s a foundation for lasting impact. The Final Whisper: Position Yourself in OFNT Before the Market Shouts Its Name XRP and Cardano have proven their value, but the real game-changers for exponential gains are hidden pre-exchange tokens like OFNT. This opportunity offers early adopters a shot at massive returns by backing a project built on trust, innovation, and community power. If you’re ready to move beyond the obvious and claim your spot in the future of decentralized crowdfunding , now is the time to research OpenFundNet . Join their growing community channels and get in before the market wakes up to this sleeping giant. The whispers are growing louder; don’t miss your chance before the crowd rushes in.

Hopkinson Makes Shocking Revelation,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-founder-619-million/,"Cardano, and specifically its founder Charles Hoskinson, has come under fire recently after allegations of fraud surfaced online. The rumors quickly spread as the integrity of the blockchain and its founder were called into question. As a result, Hopkinson has delivered a response, with a shocking revelation on how he plans to interact with the public and the community going forward. Alleged $619 Million Going Missing On May 7, 2025, an X user who goes by the name Masato Alexander made a shocking claim: 318 million ADA worth $619 million had been illegally moved and the finger was being pointed at Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. Apparently, this had happened with the Allegra Hard Fork which took place back in 2021 as core functions of the blockchain were changed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top Alexander claimed that Hoskinson had deployed code during what was thought to be routine upgrade with an extra payload. Allegedly, this allowed Hoskinson to erase the original ICO UTxOs which held a total of 318 million ADA and moved the funds to Cardano reserves that were controlled by private keys tied to Hoskinson. The transaction was done through an MIR transaction, which stands for Move Instantaneous Reward transactions. Essentially, Alexander claims that this allowed funds to be moved from reserves and then used for treasury and staking rewards purposes. These claims quickly drew the attention of the Cardano community, with Hoskinson himself responding under the post to denounce the rumors. He initially explained that the ADA vouchers of the users whose ADA were allegedly moved had become unspendable after the hard fork. Thus, they had been moved into a “custodial account controlled by the TGE that then continued redemption for 3 more years to distribute the genesis funds to the original buyers.” Furthermore, Hoskinson threatened legal action if Alexander did not stop making these claims. Cardano Founder Addresses Rumors Again After the initial interaction, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has once again come out to address the rumors of the missing $619 million. He first addressed the fact that people were quick to condemn him after the rumors surfaced without giving him the benefit of the doubt. This extended to friends who he says did not show up for him during this time. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP Price Will Stabilize At $1,000 And Become ‘Very Expensive’ As for the rumors themselves, the founder explained that there will be a full audit and a report which will be published for the public to see. He further went on to reveal that the events of the past few weeks will change how he engages with the community from now. While Hoskinson does plan to continue to attend events and take pictures with people, he plans to hand over his X account to a media company. Additionally, he plans to change the format of how he holds his X Spaces and Ask Me Anything (AMAs). “Infinite accessibility just enables it to happen again and again,” the founder explained.

Reportedly, the burn rate surged by 6800% in a single day. That’s not all, a massive 111.8 billion SHIB outflow from exchanges has led to the burning questions on every SHIB enthusiast’s mind: “Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) reach 1 cent ?” or “Will Shiba Inu go up?” or “Is Shiba Inu a good investment?” Furthermore, we’ve crafted a comprehensive Shiba Inu price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030 to address these pressing queries.

At the center of this intensifying drama is the recent cancellation of a scheduled meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and a U.S. senator —a move many in the crypto space view as a deliberate attempt to stifle Ripple’s growing influence. This incident, amplified by viral commentary from crypto analyst The Real Remi Relief on X, has been interpreted as a coordinated attempt by Bitcoin Maxis to block what’s coming for Ripple and XRP. As Ripple charts a new course with game-changing acquisitions and stablecoin initiatives, the tension between camps has reached a boiling point, revealing a high-stakes battle for control over the future of digital finance. Political Snub Fuels Tensions Between Ripple and Bitcoin Maxis According to reports from TimesTabloid , Brad Garlinghouse had been slated to meet with U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis to discuss Ripple’s regulatory roadmap and its role in the evolving crypto landscape. However, the meeting was canceled at the last minute, without any attempt to reschedule. The decision triggered outrage within the XRP community , with many interpreting the move as politically motivated. According to The Real Remi Relief, the incident was more than just a scheduling conflict—it was a coordinated effort by Bitcoin maximalists to suppress Ripple’s growing political capital. “The BTC Maxis are trying to stop what’s coming for Ripple & XRP,” he posted on X, asserting that the senator’s actions were influenced by forces who feel threatened by Ripple’s accelerating momentum. The BTC Maxis are trying to stop what’s coming for Ripple & XRP… This is what’s happening behind closed doors… 1) Ripple is buying Circle USDC 2) USAGov will be using RLUSD & USDC 3) BTC maxis are trying to stall/stop the genius act because once that happens XRP will be… pic.twitter.com/Fn05PRNxAk — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 19, 2025 Ripple’s Attempted Acquisition of Circle Adding fuel to the fire, Ripple has been making aggressive moves behind the scenes to bolster its stablecoin position. Timestabloid recently reported that Ripple had made a multi-billion-dollar acquisition offer to Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Initial reports indicated an offer in the $4 billion to $5 billion range, which Circle rejected, deeming it far below its valuation, especially ahead of its anticipated IPO. Undeterred, Ripple reportedly increased its bid to a staggering $20 billion, highlighting the company’s ambition to not only lead in cross-border payments but also dominate the stablecoin market. This level of investment shows Ripple’s intent to become a central pillar in the future of global digital finance—an outcome that Bitcoin Maxis are reportedly desperate to stop. Potential Adoption of Stablecoins Even as negotiations with Circle continued, Ripple had already laid the groundwork for its stablecoin, RLUSD , which launched in December 2024. Backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash reserves, RLUSD is a fully-regulated, USD-pegged stablecoin designed for real-world utility and interoperability. The token operates natively on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, and it’s engineered for enterprise-grade liquidity, on-chain payments, and tokenization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s strategy is clear: establish a regulatory-compliant, technologically robust stablecoin that can rival USDC and pave the way for adoption by government and financial institutions. With talk of the U.S. government exploring RLUSD and USDC for official digital payment channels, Ripple appears to be positioning itself at the heart of a new digital financial order. A Threat to the Crypto Status Quo For Bitcoin maximalists, these moves represent more than just business competition—they threaten the very foundations of their belief system. Maxis advocate for Bitcoin as the only legitimate digital asset, and they often deride other projects as centralized or inferior. Ripple, with its deep institutional ties and regulatory outreach, has long been a target of such criticism. But now, with real political traction and a potentially dominant position in stablecoins, Ripple poses an existential threat to Bitcoin’s supremacy. The canceled Senate meeting has thus become a flashpoint in this ideological war. To XRP supporters, it represents an act of obstruction by those threatened by Ripple’s progress. To others, it’s a sign that the corridors of power are not yet ready to embrace the transformative shift Ripple is advocating. Either way, the friction is undeniable. The Inevitable Shift: XRP’s Path to the Top Despite the resistance, momentum appears to be on Ripple’s side. With RLUSD live , major acquisition bids in play, and whispers of U.S. government alignment, XRP’s ascent seems not only possible but increasingly probable. As The Real Remi Relief put it, “Nobody can stop what’s coming.” Whether Ripple ultimately overtakes Ethereum or even challenges Bitcoin remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the crypto landscape is evolving fast, and Ripple is at the helm of that transformation. If XRP does rise to the top, it will be because of strategic foresight, regulatory persistence, and its ability to build in the face of opposition, not despite the obstacles, but because of them.

The leading cryptocurrency just broke out of a strong bullish pattern, and traders are now eyeing the $116,000 mark as the next big target. With strong momentum building and multi-month charts showing no bearish signals, many believe a new all-time high could be right around the corner. But amid the excitement, some experts are sounding the alarm on what could come next. Could Bitcoin Crash to $2,000? While Bitcoin’s short-term outlook looks bullish, one analyst has warned of a massive correction once the rally peaks. Some even call it a “mathematical certainty” that Bitcoin could tumble to as low as $2,000–$3,000 in the future. The long-term provisional target remains at $140,000. According to technical wave counts, Bitcoin could break its all-time high soon, fueling further gains. However, it’s crucial for traders to follow the correct wave structure, as many misinterpret ongoing movements. Post $140K, while some might expect an immediate peak, analysts suggest there’s still more room for growth before Bitcoin enters a major correction phase. Ultimately, though, Bitcoin is expected to undergo a supercycle correction back down to $3,000–$2,000 once the top is in — a cycle seen repeatedly in its history. Macro Risks and Market Warnings Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. Dollar Index is weakening and could slide further, which often helps risk assets like Bitcoin. However, broader economic issues — like the recent U.S. credit downgrade and rising bond yields — might create new challenges for crypto markets. There’s also speculation that the Federal Reserve may step in with emergency liquidity measures if financial markets get shaky again, adding more volatility to Bitcoin’s path. Markets To Be Less Volatile This Time? Bitcoin still moves closely with risky assets like stocks, so it will take time before it truly moves on its own. This cycle, the leverage in Bitcoin is low compared to the 2021 peak, which could mean less wild price swings. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe says Bitcoin is heading to new all-time highs faster than expected. He sees $120K, $150K, and even $200K as imminent as more and more people are frustrated with the dollar’s ongoing devaluation.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 11:35:18
44902609,https://invezz.com/?p=2727233,1747827475,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,From neobanks to deobanks: the future of transparent and universal digital banking,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/21/from-neobanks-to-deobanks-the-future-of-transparent-and-universal-digital-banking/,"Five years ago, as the world retreated indoors during a global pandemic, neobanks emerged as digital alternatives to traditional banks. They offered easy-to-use apps and lower fees, impressing many with their modern interface and fast onboarding. Yet, they rely on the same legacy systems as traditional banks and still follow strict rules that exclude many and depend on outdated frameworks. These limitations leave more than 1.4 billion adults outside the banking system. Today, another transformation is taking place in the form of decentralized on-chain banks, or deobanks. A prime example of this model is WeFi . WeFi introduced the term “deobank” and has positioned itself to fill the gap left by neobanks. The goal is to show how digital finance can work for everyone. In practice, deobanks simplify compliance by gradually integrating AI-driven KYC and employ blockchain tech to offer non-custodial accounts that let users own their funds and spend them directly from their personal wallets. The global market for decentralized finance is projected to reach $351.75 billion by 2031 , and ‘payment and transactions’ are set to be the second biggest consumer segment in this industry. Deobanks have significant scope to become a catalyst for this growth and transform fintech services at a global scale. A new decentralized model of digital finance Traditional banks and neobanks face the same challenges that keep them tied to old methods. They often rely on physical infrastructure and centralized control. In contrast, deobanks operate entirely on blockchain networks. This setup eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides real-time transparency. Every transaction is recorded on-chain, and users can track how their funds are managed. This feature builds trust and reduces the risk of unexpected account freezes. If any regulatory issues arise, only suspicious transactions are flagged, leaving funds under the full control of the user. Deobanks also take a strong stand on environmental concerns. Neobanks tend to rely on physical cards, which contribute to a significant amount of plastic waste. Research shows that payment cards alone use over 130,000 tons of plastic . This waste takes centuries to decompose and leaves a lasting impact on climate change. Deobanks like WeFi promote a truly digital-first future in which payments happen via mobile devices using QR codes, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. These modern methods support sustainability and match today’s consumer habits. Serving the unbanked Macroeconomic challenges of the past decades show how fragile the traditional banking system is. The 2008 crisis, which led to the collapse of many financial institutions, exposed the fragility of legacy banks. More recently, Silicon Valley Bank’s sudden downfall left many customers unable to access their funds. This is even more prominent in developing and underdeveloped regions. In regions like South America and Africa, rapidly increasing inflation has caused many traditional banks to limit financial services to the wider population. Strict regulations and outdated processes leave these banks ill-equipped to meet modern demands. Neobanks have trimmed fees and sped up services, yet they still rely on custodial accounts that deny users true control of their money. Deobanks are built to serve the unbanked and underbanked. They are designed for people who fail to meet strict account opening criteria or who have lost trust in conventional banks. The decentralized nature of deobanks means that there is no central authority to dictate how funds are managed. Instead, users maintain control and benefit from a transparent system. This model directly addresses the needs of millions who remain on the outskirts of the financial system. Most importantly, Deobanks leverage a non-custodial approach that truly establishes universal accessibility. For instance, WeFi allows users to transact using stablecoins and access services via a Telegram bot. This way, users can conduct near-instant transactions at a fractional cost, regardless of their location or demographics. Deobanks are the next chapter of global financial evolution After the concerning failures of traditional banks, the lack of impact from neobanks, and the increasing growth of blockchain integration, the need for on-chain banking in global finance is growing. Deobanks offer a practical, scalable solution that meets the demands of a modern, interconnected world. Looking ahead, investors and users should prepare for a significant shift in global finance. Deobanks have the power to disrupt established players and create new opportunities in cross-border transactions, wealth management, and everyday payments. Developers also have much to gain. The decentralized on-chain banking framework offers a creative, unrestricted ground for developing innovative financial applications. On-chain data and smart contract integration open new avenues for automated yield strategies, lending protocols, and specialized payment systems. The transparent nature of Deobanks will encourage further innovation and drive efficiency in the digital finance space. This new model is expected to accelerate financial inclusion, especially in emerging markets where traditional banking fails to meet demand.

As a result, the crypto market cap registered an increase of nearly 1% and moved to $3.37 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from its sluggish start to the week, recouping its losses on Tuesday and crossing $107,000 during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $107,301. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) registered a marginal increase to maintain its position above $2,500. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is on the verge of reclaiming $2,600. Despite the positive market sentiment, Ripple (XRP) has registered a marginal decline, while Solana (SOL) is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $171. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered notable increases. Dow Drops As Wall Street Momentum Stalls The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27%, and the S&P 500 dropped 0.39%, ending a six-day upward trend. The Nasdaq Composite also dropped 0.38% as mega caps and chipmakers retreated, with Nvidia, AMD, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft registering notable losses. The pullback comes after a five-week rebound that saw the S&P 500 rise over 20% from its April low. The rebound was driven by optimism around tariff de-escalation and reduced US-China trade tensions. Bill Northey, US Bank Wealth Management, stated, “We’ve had the swoon related to tariffs, the furious rally, and now we’re awaiting clarification. It’s optimism without clarity.” Bond markets have added to the recent uncertainty, with the 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.48%, while the 30-year Treasury yield crossed 5% for the second day running. The jump comes after Moody’s decision to downgrade US Debt, citing rising deficits and interest expenses. Bancor Sues Uniswap For Patent Infringement Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin, the entities behind the Bancor Protocol and the BNT token, have filed a lawsuit against Uniswap. The platforms filed the lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The entities have accused Uniswap of infringing patents around smart contracts used in decentralized trading. Bancor alleged that Uniswap used its patented technology that underpins the constant product automated market maker (CPAMM), the core mechanism powering the Uniswap protocol. Bancor stated in a press release, “When an organization continuously uses our invention without our authorization and does so as a means of competing with us, we must take action.” Bancor has claimed Uniswap used its technology for over eight years without permission. Bancor patented its decentralized trading technology in 2017. The same technology was used to power its AMM-powered DEX protocol. The Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin claim they own all rights to their invention. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) came within touching distance of its all-time high before declining to its current levels as the flagship cryptocurrency finally broke past key resistance levels around $105,000 and $106,000. BTC started the week in the red, dropping to a low of $102,145 before settling at $105,573. Despite selling pressure, BTC rose over 1% on Tuesday before climbing to an intraday high of $108,010 during the ongoing session. The increase brought BTC within 1% of its all-time high after it broke out of a two-week-long consolidation phase, which saw the price hover between $100,000 and $105,000. BTC’s jump above $105,000 has been fueled by several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Investors have lost confidence in traditional financial systems, while cooling trade war tensions and tariff concerns have fueled a risk-on sentiment, pushing investors towards risk assets. Persistent inflation has eroded purchasing power, while the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance has kept real yields on the higher side. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also registered steady inflows, indicating a resurgence in institutional interest. Analysts believe BTC bulls are eying the $110,000 level after forming a strong base around $106,000 thanks to solid buyer interest at lower levels. If BTC maintains its position above $105,000-$106,000, the price could surge to a new all-time high. Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at YouHodler, stated, “While the risk of a downside correction cannot be ruled out, particularly if negative sentiment returns to the equity markets, the likelihood of such a scenario remains relatively low in the short to medium term.” Let’s look at BTC’s price action over the past few sessions. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.72% to $104,617, but lost momentum on Sunday and settled at $103,802. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,123. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 0.53% and settling at $103,568. Source: TradingView BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday but rebounded to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action remained bearish on Thursday and Friday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. The price recovered on Sunday as markets rebounded, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. BTC started the week on a bearish note, plunging to a low of $102,145 before rebounding to settle at $105,573, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as the price rose 1.21% to $106,855. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If buyers regain control, BTC could cross $109,000 and set a new all-time high. On the other hand, sellers will look to drive the price below $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) bounced back to reclaim $2,500 and briefly crossed $2,600 despite experiencing considerable volatility at the start of the week. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency faced significant selling pressure at the beginning of the week as it fell to a low of $2,349 on Monday before recovering to reclaim $2,500. Despite recent volatility, SOL has registered a hugely positive month, with its price up over 50%. SOL has held on to its recent gains and maintained its position above the $2,500 level. Market watchers are also bullish on Ethereum. Arthur Hayes believes that a move to $10,000 or even $15,000 is a realistic prediction for ETH as global liquidity shifts and capital controls take hold. Hayes dismissed technical triggers behind ETH’s rally and highlighted positive sentiment around the asset, stating, “The most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle. It’s just human nature.” Hayes believes an ETH comeback was long overdue it spent years overshadowed by SOL and other Layer2 tokens. “ETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running… it was time.” ETH ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 3% and settling at $2,514. It faced volatility on Monday, rising to an intraday high of $2,623 and falling to an intraday low of $2,408 before settling at $2,496, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%.

The price flashed a bearish flip after breaking below $170 on Monday when it fell to a low of $159 before reclaiming $160. Despite the selling pressure, the price has remained above $165. SOL remains confined within the $160-$180 range as bulls look to build momentum and push the price higher. SOL ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 3% to $173.

The legislative council on Wednesday passed the bill on its third reading, which directs the token issuers to get licensing from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Stablecoin is a digital asset that is pegged to conventional currencies like the dollar or to commodities such as gold. What the bill entails An issuer of a stablecoin that pegs its value to Hong Kong dollars inside or outside Hong Kong will need to obtain a license from the HKMA. The relevant persons issuing the stablecoins need to satisfy requirements in “reserve asset management and redemption, including proper segregation of client assets, maintaining a robust stabilisation mechanism, and processing stablecoin holders’ requests for redemption at par value with reasonable conditions”, the government said in its release. The issuers also need to make sure they comply with standards for anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, risk management, disclosure and auditing, fitness, and property. The government said the ordinance is expected to come into effect this year. This is to provide sufficient time for the industry to understand the requirements needed under the licensing regime. HKMA added that there will be additional consultations on the detailed regulatory framework. The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Eddie Yue, said, “The Ordinance has established a risk-based, pragmatic, and flexible regulatory regime. We believe that a robust and fit-for-purpose regulatory environment would provide favourable conditions to support the healthy, responsible, and sustainable development of Hong Kong’s stablecoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem.” The latest addition to Hong Kong’s crypto regulations Hong Kong had enacted a crypto licensing regime in 2023 to protect retail investors. Hong Kong was the first Asian country to accept crypto products as a mainstream investment asset. It had also started Asia’s first spot crypto exchange-traded funds in 2024. The country had also launched a sandbox in 2024 to allow stablecoin trials in a limited and risk-controlled environment. US’s GENIUS Act The US Government is also planning a bill that is designed to regulate stablecoins. The bill is dubbed the GENIUS Act. The US Senate advanced the bill earlier this week on a bipartisan vote. The bill was advanced with a 66-32 vote on Monday. The bill would require stablecoins to be backed fully by US dollars or highly liquid assets. It also mandates annual audits with issuers with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion. The bill was voted on by the Senate after a couple of amendments were forced by the Democrats. This includes changes to consumer protection safeguards and limits on tech companies issuing stablecoins. It also includes ethical standards for special government employee,s which would apply to Elon Musk and David Sacks.

The VanEck Purposebuilt Fund will launch on 10 June. According to the press release, the fund will utilize Avalanche-native real-world asset ( RWA ) products – including tokenized money market funds – to deploy the capital. The novel fund will provide the capital and support for liquid tokens, venture-backed projects, and scalable businesses that are building on the world’s 18 th -largest chain and launching tokens with long-term utility and value in mind. The projects will hail from across industries, including finance, payments, gaming , and AI . They’ll receive the investment either close to or after a Token Generation Event. Therefore, the company says that “the Purposebuilt Fund reflects VanEck’s conviction in the ‘GDP onchain’ thesis.” This means that blockchain “will eventually be core to global economic and financial systems and that the projects that align with this vision will be the most durable.” Excited to announce this! We have met a ton of great founders in the ⁦⁦ @avax ⁩ in the past year. We want to be there to support them through a dedicated pool of capital. No memecoins, no vaporware…real GDP on chain. DM’s open! https://t.co/rxWcYoN2gu — Pranav (@vaneckpk) May 21, 2025 Additionally, Pranav Kanade, Portfolio Manager of VanEck Digital Asset Alpha Fund (DAAF), argues that real businesses, not additional infrastructure, will bring about the next wave of value for the crypto sector. Moreover, VanEck has noted “a growing concentration of serious builders” using the Avalanche network for real-world applications, generating economic activity onchain. These teams build in payments, FinTech, DeFi, RWAs, AI, and gaming. They’re also providing enterprise-grade products already adopted by Web2 platforms and traditional institutions. Meanwhile, the VanEck Purposebuilt Fund seeks capital appreciation through investments in digital assets with market capitalizations above $100 million. It may invest in RWAs, digital asset projects, and Avalanche ecosystem-related companies. It may also employ staking, yield-farming, and investments across centralized and decentralized platforms, the announcement says.

VanEck Sees ‘Shift From Speculative Hype To Real Utility’ The team behind the DAAF will also manage the new VanEck Purposebuilt Fund. The team says that DAAF is “one of the strongest-performing directional liquid token funds in the market.” It has over $100 million in assets under management. The team argues that one of the issues the crypto market faces is the difficulty for legitimate blockchain-powered businesses to “stand out in an environment dominated by short-term speculation. This distorts incentives, undermines token credibility, and slows real adoption.” The new fund aims to solve this, VanEck claims. Just announced, @vaneck_us is launching Purposebuilt, a dedicated fund to back real-world applications on Avalanche. This is a major signal of institutional conviction in Avalanche and the broader move to bring GDP on-chain. Full breakdown pic.twitter.com/fd5QouFGRL — Avalanche (@avax) May 21, 2025 Furthermore, John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, described Purposebuilt as a pivotal moment for the ecosystem. It reinforces Avalanche as “the home for serious founders who are scaling real businesses and driving meaningful onchain adoption.” Per Nahas, there is “a shift away from speculative hype toward real utility and sustainable token economies.” Therefore, Purposebuilt’s goal is to “bring the kind of long-term capital and strategic conviction that builders need to lead that shift.” At the time of writing, AVAX trades at $22.65. It is up 2.8% in a day and 10% in a month. The price has decreased by 12% in a week and 44% in a year. The coin hit its all-time high of $144.96 in November 2021, falling 84% since. Meanwhile, the company notes that the VanEck Purposebuilt Fund and the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund are not registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds or ETFs. The announcement states that, as of 30 April 2025, VanEck managed $116.6 billion in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts. In March and April this year, it filed for Avalanche and BNB ETFs, respectively. In May, VanEck joined hands with Securitize , a company specializing in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, to launch a US treasuries-backed tokenized fund on Avalanche, Ethereum, and Solana.

In a new interview on the Bankless YouTube channel, Hayes says the crypto portfolio of his family office is dominated by the two largest crypto assets by market cap. “Maelstrom [Fund] is about like 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum. And then a lot of other shitcoins, term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it’s physical gold and gold miners. And treasury bills. That’s it.” Over the coming weeks, the BitMEX co-founder says Bitcoin ( BTC ) could appreciate by up to 138% from the current level before 2026. “I think we’re going to go on a run to like in the $150,000 to $200,000 range between now and sort of like maybe sometime in the summer. We will get some nasty correction and then I think we go to $250,000 on Bitcoin by the end of the year.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,070 at time of writing. On his price targets for Ethereum ( ETH ), Hayes says, “Ethereum… I think if we can get to $5,000 by the end of the year, I will probably be good. That will sort of reinvigorate people and maybe you know ETH gets to $10,000 or $20,000 by the end of the run. But I think that there’s a hard slog between here and $5,000 for ETH.” Ethereum is trading at $2,513 at time of writing. The BitMEX co-founder further says altcoins will also experience a bullish run. “There will be an alt season. It might not be the alts that you own. It might not be the overvalued venture capital high-FDV [fully diluted valuation] low-float piece of shitcoin with no clients coin that you own. But there will be new narratives, there always will be.

While overall market cap saw a slight 0.6% dip to $3.48 trillion, most of the top 100 coins have continued climbing – powered by growing institutional interest and a wave of favorable regulatory momentum. Total crypto trading volume remains strong at $123 billion, highlighting the market’s resilience and renewed investor confidence. TLDR: The crypto market continues the rally, despite the decrease in market cap; Bitcoin is in the green today, up 1.25% in 24 hours; Analysts highlight the strength of the market recovery; ‘Setting the Stage for New ATH’; Significant ETF inflows and regulatory developments fuel the rally; The rally seems sustainable, though short-term corrections and consolidations are possible. Why Is Crypto Up Today – May 21, 2025: Crypto Winners & Losers Compared to yesterday, when all the top 10 coins per market cap were green, one turned red today. Tron (TRX) fell 0.7% to the price of $0.2711. Founder Justin Sun tweeted out his support for US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, saying he’ll be attending the latter’s Gala Dinner. Cardano (ADA) is the day’s best performer. It’s up 3%, now trading at $0.7539. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated 0.8%, now changing hands at $2,553. Its daily high is $2,635. Furthermore, after briefly hitting the day’s high of $107,831, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back to the $106,500 level. Over the past day, it increased by 1.4%, trading at $106,533. Notably, this is its yesterday’s high, which it finally managed to hold. Also, the majority of the top 100 coins saw their prices increase. The highest gainer in this category is Stacks (STX) , having increased by 7.1% to $0.9106. Story (IP) fell the most among the red coins. It’s down 3.7% to $4.49 Overall, the crypto market rally continues to be fueled by the increase in institutional adoption, surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows, regulatory shifts, and ongoing macroeconomic relief following the easing of trade tensions. In turn, this has fueled risk-on sentiment. Furthermore, the regulation is currently favorable for crypto. All eyes are at the moment primarily on the US. The country’s Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act , which would regulate stablecoins at the federal level. The Senate advanced the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 bipartisan vote on Monday, marking a big step toward establishing federal regulation for stablecoins and digital currency oversight. #GENIUSAct #Stablecoins https://t.co/JmoPuWjKdf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins faced questions from lawmakers on 20 May. They focused on the regulator’s handling of the fraud case involving Tron founder Justin Sun and a Donald Trump-linked meme coin. It remains to be seen if this will have a more pronounced impact on the market. Chairman Paul Atkins will testify before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government today at 10 a.m. ET. A livestream will be available: https://t.co/QDPSVDHlCR — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 20, 2025 ‘Setting the Stage for New ATH’ According to the latest Glassnode report, BTC has hit a local high of $107,000, moving close to its all-time high of $109,000. This has led to a significant increase in capital inflows. It has pushed the Realized Cap above $900 billion, “for the first time, a historic milestone.” Only four trading days in history have recorded a higher daily closing price. The last weekly close of $106,500 was the highest ever. The coin is trading some 40% higher over the last six weeks, “highlighting how strong the market recovery has been,” the analysts say. Source: Glassnode Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler , has commented that BTC may have entered a consolidation phase, marked by accumulation. The current price action could be “setting the stage for another leg higher that could lead to a new all-time high.” He commented that the $90,000–$110,000 range is a key consolidation zone, as BTC has spent significant time within this range since November. “This suggests a high concentration of trading activity and order volume, which could reinforce the area as a strong support level. If this dynamic continues, Bitcoin will likely remain anchored in this range, even following the renewal of all-time highs, as it serves as a psychologically and technically important price corridor.” Lienkha noted the existing risk of a downside correction but added that the chances are “relatively low in the short to medium term.” While it’s too early to declare the beginning of a full-scale altseason, the executive says, Ethereum has seen notable outperformance. This is the result of internal factors, including the Pectra upgrade and the expansion of stablecoins on the network, supported by a favorable macroeconomic environment. Levels & Events to Watch Next After two days of unsuccessful attempts, BTC finally managed to break through the $106,000 level, rising above $106,500. More importantly, at the time of writing, it is holding that level. This shows how today’s brief high can become tomorrow’s price in the market’s push-and-pullback game. The coin couldn’t sustain the day’s high of $107,800. However, if it manages to surpass $107,000 and stay there, the next level to keep an eye on will be $108,786, after which it will likely be testing fresh all-time highs. Per Glassnode, the $2,400–$2,900 range is a crucial zone for Ethereum. This is both a resistance zone and a potential breakout level, “essential for maintaining upward momentum.” Source: Glassnode Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has recorded a slight increase since this time yesterday, from 68 to 69, going deeper into the greed territory. As previously noted, this signals investor optimism, confidence, and willingness to take risks as a result of higher prices and trading volumes. That said, it can also lead to overconfidence and overvaluation, which typically precede a correction. Notably, the market continues to be fueled by significant investor interest and exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows. On May 20, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $329.02 million . This is its fifth consecutive day of inflows. The cumulative total net inflow reached $42.77 billion. Also, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $64.89m in net inflows, for a third day of positive flows, resulting in the cumulative inflow of $2.59 billion. Additionally, major alternative asset manager Blackstone invested in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) , thus entering the crypto space via an ETF. According to the 20 May filing, as of 31 March, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares, 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) , and 4,300 shares of the ATM operator Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) . According to a recent portfolio filing, Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund disclosed holding 23,094 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of March 31. This marks the first time Blackstone has publicly reported a bitcoin-related position. https://t.co/EVhkd04vnw — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 20, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? While crypto has maintained its bull run, stocks went the other way under pressure from rising Treasury yields, ending six consecutive sessions of gains. The S&P 500 is down 0.39%, the Nasdaq-100 fell 0.37%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a decrease of 0.27%. With the rising concerns over inflation and interest rate hikes, investors seek refuge elsewhere. The stocks are pushed down by Trump’s efforts to pass a tax-cut bill that could add $3 trillion-$5 trillion to the government’s debt of $36.2 trillion. Is this rally sustainable? The rally seems strong. It is encouraged by strong fundamentals, primarily institutional demand, significant regulatory developments, and macroeconomic tailwinds. That said, there may be a potential regulatory shift ahead, as well as growing greed that could signal short-term corrections. Alternatively, the market could be seeing a consolidation period.

Now, there's buzz about a new player named XYZVerse. Some predict it could create billionaires in the next meme coin boom expected in 2025. What is driving this excitement around XYZVerse, and could it really outshine Dogecoin's legacy? Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Dogecoin: How a Shiba Inu Meme Became a $50 Billion Crypto Phenomenon Dogecoin began in 2013 as a light-hearted cryptocurrency. With a Shiba Inu meme as its logo, it was a fun alternative to serious coins like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum limit and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. What started as a joke quickly gained followers. In 2021, its value soared, reaching a market cap over $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, and a booming crypto market. What makes Dogecoin special today? Its technology is simple. It's based on code similar to Bitcoin's, but transactions are faster and fees are lower. A strong community is one of its biggest assets. People enjoy its fun and friendly vibe. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as attractive due to its growth potential and active supporters. Others caution that its value depends heavily on hype and social media trends. Compared to coins like Ethereum with advanced technology and real-world uses, Dogecoin is seen by some as risky. Whether it will keep rising or fade away is uncertain, but its journey shows how digital coins can evolve. Conclusion While DOGE, PEPE, and MOG have soared, XYZVerse—the first all-sport memecoin—aims for 20,000% growth, potentially redefining success in the 2025 meme supercycle.

One trader thinks that SHIB’s weekly price action for the past four years or so anticipates an explosive move that could push it to uncharted territory. $SHIB remains one of the most unreal charts I have ever seen. No signs of a breakout, but when this breaks out, you'll want a piece of it. pic.twitter.com/keyjpoxnp9 — Joey Keasberry (@birdseye88) May 18, 2025 Crypto trader Joey Keasberry emphasized that Shiba Inu’s price chart shows “unreal” characteristics as it has been consolidating for nearly four years. Although there are “no signs of a breakout yet,” he emphasized that a bullish breakout could result in the kind of move that traders should not miss. Based on Joey’s chart, it would take a move above the $0.000050 to confirm a bullish breakout of this consolidation. Hence, this is a key level to watch to draft a Shiba Inu price prediction . Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Ecosystem Growth Supports a Favorable Outlook for the Token Shiba Inu is one of the best meme coins out there in terms of community strength. Its social media accounts are followed by millions and the project has attracted a significant number of developers who have created an entire ecosystem by using its layer-one blockchain. Thus far, they have launched a decentralized exchange called Shibaswap , non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain-based games, and even a layer-two called Shibarium. Ecosystem growth has not been an issue for Shiba Inu. Yet, crypto investors have recently been more attracted to exotic new tokens like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Brett (BRETT). Shiba Inu will likely emerge as a late winner in this latest bullish cycle alongside other well-established tokens with robust communities like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki (FLOKI). The daily chart shows that the price broke above a key resistance at $0.00001530 in the past few days but quickly retreated back into the ascending triangle as the selling pressure was strong after it crossed the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). There are multiple key supports to watch including the 21-day and 50-day EMA, the triangle’s lower trend line, and the uptrend’s second-best higher high at $0.00001420. With so many support levels standing in the way of SHIB, the token’s outlook remains favorable despite this failed break. As meme coins’ outlook continues to improve, the hottest crypto presales in the market like SUBBD (SUBBD) will attract further attention from investors. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises Nearly $500,000 to Launch its Decentralized Content Distribution Platform Content creators have struggled for years with unfair bans and unfavorable payment structures that have taken a significant chunk of their earnings. SUBBD (SUBBD) brings a tectonic shift to the industry by introducing a decentralized content distribution platform that offers a fairer arrangement and a less restrictive environment for influencers. With the help of blockchain technology, the platform enables the creation of AI-generated content that can generate passive income for content creators as well and, through the $SUBBD token, it gives influencers a say in the ecosystem’s roadmap and growth. SUBBD has already been embraced by more than 2,000 creators with a combined following of over 250 million fans. This will propel the demand for the $SUBBD token and will result in high returns for early buyers. To buy $SUBBD at its discounted presale price of $0.05545, head to the SUBBD website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

This enhanced version brings a refined structure and superior user experience, featuring multi-asset collateral, a smart dynamic Loan-to-Value (LTV) model, instant fund access, flexible repayment options, and zero fees. To mark this significant launch, HTX has rolled out two exclusive promotions: “Borrow & Earn” #7, where users can share a massive 5,000,000,000 $HTX prize pool, and the “Millions in Rewards Plus Margin Power-up” event, which provides BTC loan interest rates as low as 0.09% and an extra 10% discount on USDT loans. Unlock Multiple Benefits with HTX Loan Products To celebrate the grand launch of Crypto Loans 2.0 and commemorate the 15th anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, HTX is simultaneously launching “ Borrow & Earn” #7 and an exclusive limited-time margin promotion, delivering substantial rewards to our valued users. “Borrow & Earn” #7 runs from May 19 at 02:00 (UTC) to June 2 at 15:59 (UTC), featuring a total prize pool of 5,000,000,000 $HTX. Users simply need to borrow USDT using the Crypto Loans Flexible product during the event to earn a share of the $HTX prize pool, based on the interest paid — the more interest paid, the greater the rewards. Rewards will be credited to winners’ Spot accounts within 7 working days after the event ends. Concurrently, HTX has launched an exclusive margin promotion, “ Millions in Rewards Plus Margin Power-up ”, active from May 20 at 10:00 (UTC) to June 2 at 10:00 (UTC). For a single USDT loan of $1,000,000 or more, users can enjoy an extra 10% interest rate discount! This brings the annual interest rate down to as low as 3.9% (or 0.01% daily). There is no limit on borrowing frequency and each qualifying loan benefits from this generous discount. Don’t miss the Pizza Day 15th Anniversary Bonus! During the event, the top 10 users by cumulative loan volume will share 264,000,000 $HTX (worth $500). Register via the provided link to participate. Leverage these ultra-low interest rates to maximize potential returns and aim for substantial gains. Optimized Borrowing Experience with Multi-Asset Collateral Loan efficiency and asset liquidity have always been two major user-focused concerns. As a key highlight of this upgrade, HTX’s “Crypto Loans 2.0” introduces a multi-asset collateral mechanism, supporting over 20 mainstream cryptocurrencies as collateral assets, including USDT, BTC, ETH, TRX, DOGE, XRP, SOL, and AVAX. This significantly boosts users’ asset utilization efficiency. To further enhance the borrowing experience, HTX has expanded its loanable assets to include SOL, TON, and USDC, with USDC also available as a collateral option. Unlike the traditional single-asset collateral model, the multi-asset collateral mechanism allows users to unlock liquidity from their holdings while effectively reducing the risk of forced liquidation due to single-asset volatility. Another standout feature of this upgrade is HTX’s limited-time offer: an ultra-low 0.09% annual interest rate for BTC Flexible Loans, with borrowing limits up to 100 BTC. This remarkable rate represents a 555-fold reduction from the previous annual rate of over 5.0%, making it an exceptional deal. For example, borrowing BTC equivalent to approximately 1,000,000 USDT would incur a mere 2.37 USDT in daily interest — a truly remarkable saving. Crypto Loans 2.0 also offers the following advantages: ● Smart Dynamic LTV Mechanism : Interest rates adjust in real time based on market conditions, ensuring industry-leading competitiveness. Annualized interest rates for Flexible Loans include 3.9% for USDT, 2.4% for ETH, and as low as 0.09% for BTC. ● Flexible Term Options : Supports flexible configuration for both flexible and fixed terms (7/30/45/90 days). ● Instant Fund Access & Flexible Repayment : Borrowed funds are delivered instantly, interest accrues every hour, and users enjoy the freedom to repay at any time, ensuring optimal fund efficiency. ● Institutional-Grade Risk Control: Supports overcollateralized loans with leverage capped under 1X and tiered liquidation to safeguard accounts. Users retain all remaining collateral assets. ● Personalized 1-on-1 VIP Service: Delivers customized loan limits, flexible currency selections, and special discounted interest rates for SVIP users. Crypto Loans 2.0 is now live! Users can access it via the HTX website by clicking “Loans” > “Crypto Loans”, or through the HTX App by tapping “More” > “Crypto Loans”. Here’s how to get started: HTX’s Crypto Loans 2.0 leads the industry with its ability to boost capital efficiency, lower liquidation risk, provide flexible investment options, and allow multi-asset collateral.

Over 174 million Brazilians can use crypto for everyday transactions across Pix’s vast network. The integration strengthens crypto adoption in Brazil, the world’s sixth-largest crypto market. Binance has integrated its payment service, Binance Pay, with Brazil’s Pix system, enabling real-time crypto-to-fiat payments for millions of users across Latin America’s largest economy. The new feature allows Binance users in Brazil to instantly convert digital assets into Brazilian reais and make payments to any Pix-compatible bank account or merchant, the exchange said in a May 20 press release . With support for over 100 cryptocurrencies, the integration brings digital currencies closer to daily use by embedding them into a payment network already trusted by over 174 million Brazilians. Brazil’s Pix Used by 76.4% of Population Pix, launched by Brazil’s Central Bank in 2020, has quickly overtaken traditional payment methods. According to official figures, it is now used by 76.4% of the population, surpassing both cash and debit cards in popularity. The platform processes roughly 6 billion transactions monthly. “This is a significant milestone for crypto adoption in Brazil,” said Guilherme Nazar, Binance’s regional vice president for Latin America. “For the first time, Binance Pay is fully integrated into a national payment system. It allows users to spend crypto in the same seamless way they use Pix daily — quickly, safely, and without complications.” Richard Teng, Binance’s CEO, called the move a “revolutionary step” that blends Brazil’s fast, government-developed Pix system with the global scale of Binance. “This synergy empowers users with real-time transactions and drives financial inclusion to new heights,” Teng said. Big news, Brazil! #Binance now supports Pix for payments and transfers in Reais! Pix is used by 174M+ Brazilians — and now it’s powering seamless crypto transactions on Binance across 100+ tokens.

A recent survey by Instituto Locomotiva for Binance further revealed that 42% of Brazilian investors already hold crypto, a figure on par with more traditional assets like stocks and investment funds. In April, Brazil made history by launching the world’s first exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the spot price of XRP , Ripple’s native cryptocurrency. Named Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fundo de Índice (FI), the ETF is managed by Brazilian asset manager Hashdex and administered by Genial Investments Securities Brokerage SA, with Genial Bank SA serving as custodian. Bhutan Taps Binance to Launch National Crypto Tourism Payment In another development, Bhutan has partnered with Binance Pay and DK Bank to allow tourists to pay for nearly all travel-related expenses using cryptocurrency. Tourists can now use digital assets to pay for flights, hotels, tours, visa fees, and even roadside purchases. The system, powered by Binance’s app, supports over 100 cryptocurrencies and enables real-time transactions via QR codes. Payments are instantly settled in local currency by DK Bank, eliminating the need for traditional banking systems, currency exchanges, or international cards—making travel more seamless and affordable for foreign visitors. More than 100 Bhutanese merchants, including rural artisans and small vendors, have joined the system, allowing even remote businesses to accept crypto payments through a simple smartphone.

According to CNBC, investors pushed yields higher across the board after a credit rating downgrade from Moody’s rattled confidence and added pressure to an already fragile bond market. The 30-year Treasury yield climbed almost 6 basis points, reaching 5.023%. The 10-year yield was up more than 5 basis points at 4.533%. Even the 2-year moved, ticking nearly 3 basis points higher to 3.996%. Traders weren’t just reacting to numbers—they were responding to the total lack of progress in D.C. and the possibility that this new bill, if passed, could blow up the country’s finances. One basis point equals 0.01%, and rising yields mean falling bond prices. Moody’s downgrade rattles bonds while Trump’s tax bill stalls Last Friday, Moody’s cut the US credit rating to the second-highest tier, matching what other rating agencies already had. But it wasn’t just the downgrade that caused the sell-off. It was the reasoning behind it. Moody’s pointed directly at the expanding federal deficit and the rising cost of servicing government debt. The impact was immediate. The 30-year Treasury shot above 5% on Monday, the second major spike in just a month. Now, all eyes are on Trump’s latest tax plan. Many Republicans are refusing to back it unless it includes bigger deductions for state and local taxes. The disagreement has stalled progress and raised fresh questions about whether the bill can actually pass. If it does, investors fear the cost will push the deficit even higher. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note, “When it comes to the near term, all eyes are now on the tax bill that the Trump administration is seeking to pass through Congress, as the final agreement will go a long way to determining how big the US deficit becomes in the years ahead.” Adding to the drama, Ray Dalio, billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, warned Monday that Moody’s downgrade may underplay the real threat. In a post on X, Dalio wrote: “You should know that credit ratings understate credit risks because they only rate the risk of the government not paying its debt.” Ray went on to say: “They don’t include the greater risk that the countries in debt will print money to pay their debts thus causing holders of the bonds to suffer losses from the decreased value of the money they’re getting.” Stock futures drop as yields test key levels again Markets didn’t take the news well. Dow Jones futures dropped 337 points, or 0.8%, while futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 each slid by 0.6%. Traders clearly weren’t thrilled by another jump in Treasury yields, especially after such a shaky few days. By Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield was trading well above 4.53%, and the 30-year moved firmly past the 5% line again. Those levels had already been broken earlier in the week, right after Moody’s announced its downgrade late Friday. Even with all this, Republican lawmakers in Washington are still trying to finalize the bill. The plan is supposed to lower taxes, but the internal bickering over deductions continues to slow everything down. Traders are worried that if the measure passes without cuts elsewhere, it will deepen the deficit—exactly what bond markets don’t want to hear. The drop in stock futures came after an ugly trading session on Tuesday. The S&P 500 ended a six-day winning streak. The Nasdaq Composite fell for the first time in three days. The Dow lost over 100 points, cutting short its own three-day rise. Despite the pullback, all three major indexes remain above their April 2 levels—when Trump imposed his new import tax policy. That rollout had triggered the rally, lifting the S&P 500 to positive territory for the year. Before that, the index had dipped into bear market territory, falling nearly 20% from its highs. That bounce, however, doesn’t seem as secure as it did just days ago. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The addition of Van Klaarbergen, a qualified lawyer with nearly two decades of experience in financial services and digital assets, marks a strategic move as the company continues to expand its regulatory-compliant product offerings. Van Klaarbergen joins Quantoz from Binance, where he served as Head of Legal for the EU and UK. During his tenure, he dealt with some of the most complex legal challenges in the digital asset, blockchain, and Web3 sectors. Prior to joining Binance, Van Klaarbergen held positions at the banking platform IBANXS and at NautaDutilh, one of the Netherlands’ leading law firms, where he advised extensively on financial regulation and corporate governance. He brings deep expertise in anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, and fraud. His arrival follows Quantoz’s November 2024 launch of MiCAR-compliant stablecoins — EURQ and USDQ — pegged to the euro and US dollar, respectively. These stablecoins are aimed at enabling secure and regulated transfers in secondary markets and across cryptocurrency exchanges. Van Klaarbergen’s regulatory experience is expected to strengthen Quantoz’s legal and compliance framework as it navigates an increasingly regulated digital finance landscape. Commenting on the appointment, Arnoud Star Busmann, CEO of Quantoz Payments, said: “It is great to have someone of Arjen’s calibre and experience join Quantoz as our General Counsel. Having worked at the world’s largest digital asset exchange, he has been at the forefront of the ever-changing legal and regulatory landscape. This will put us in a very strong position to grow and expand our markets as we continue to see our regulatory compliant stablecoins become widely adopted. Arjen’s decision to come and join our team is further testimony to the market leadership position that Quantoz is carving out.” The post Quantoz appoints ex-Binance legal head Arjen Van Klaarbergen as general counsel appeared first on Invezz",Blockchain technology|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-05-21 11:58:57

Despite improved operating cash flow, the Company's balance sheet remains structurally fragile, with a shareholders' deficit of approximately $4.6 million due to liabilities exceeding assets. Operational focus is shifting from rapid fleet expansion to maximizing unit economics by optimizing the existing BTM network, with second-year kiosks reportedly generating around 50% more revenue. Valuation remains highly attractive relative to peers, with forward P/S around 0.1x, EV/EBITDA around 2.7x, and forward P/E of about 5x. Bitcoin Depot (BTM), the world's largest operator of Bitcoin ATMs also called Bitcoin Teller Machines or BTMs, has been showing sustainable operational improvements and financial stability. Bitcoin Depot's business model is pretty straightforward, it is basically like an on-ramp and off-ramp physical infrastructure for cash-to-Bitcoin and Bitcoin-to-cash conversions. The company also runs a mobile application, BDCheckout, which enables users to load cash for purchasing at participating retail stores. Bitcoin Depot Q1 results were announced last week, and they were a continuation of the improvements seen in previous quarters. I think the reshuffling of the executive bench earlier this year - a new CFO and a new Chief Legal Officer (bringing experience in legal and compliance strategy to support the company's expansion efforts) - and a stronger push into international markets beyond the U.S. are beginning to yield operational results. Q1 top line came in at $164.2 million, up 19% YoY. The margin also expanded, with adjusted gross margin climbing by 7.7 percentage points to 20.2% from 12.5% in Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA more than tripled to $20.3 million, while the company swung to a net income of $12.2 million from a $4.2 million net, the same period last year. Operational cash flow also flipped meaningfully positive at $16.3 million, compared to just $1.3 million last year. This performance couldn't have been announced at a better time than during a market wide recovery and Bitcoin's rally month - in the crypto community they say ""Bitcoin loves May"" because May has been a historically good month for Bitcoin and crypto. Bitcoin is up 24% on the monthly and BTM is up 112%. Most of the gains BTM has printed (over 70% in a week) have been since earnings were released last week (over 30% upside since earnings). Data by YCharts BTM exhibits some sympathy play with Bitcoin's price movement, meaning when Bitcoin is up, BTM also typically records gains and vice versa. Though, BTM's correlation coefficient with Bitcoin is way more modest compared to that of Bitcoin mining stocks like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) or Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), or that of highly leveraged Bitcoin plays like Strategy ( MSTR ). Bitcoin Depot's transaction volume has historically been and remains decoupled from Bitcoin prices. This could explain why while most Bitcoin miners that have reported Q1 earnings this month faced compressed margins and increased operational cost, Bitcoin Depot's Q1 was surprisingly strong and margin-accretive despite the tariff volatility that rocked the market in Q1. Bitcoin Depot I, however, think this uncorrelation in the financials with Bitcoin price will likely change in the long term if Bitcoin Depot's BTC treasury increases to a material figure, as unrealized gains or losses will be recorded directly on the income statement based on the newly adopted FASB fair value rule. Thus, BTC price will begin to impact headline earnings, even if the core BTM business remains operationally distinct. As of Q1 end, Bitcoin Depot held 94.4 BTC in treasury, amounting to ~$10 million as of today's BTC spot price, of which 83 BTC were acquired in Q1. The company has said resources for BTC purchases for treasury will remain opportunistic. What is Driving Bitcoin Depot's Operational Momentum Bitcoin Depot is shifting focus toward optimizing its existing fleet of BTMs rather than rapidly expanding for expansion's sake. Bitcoin Depot deployed fewer new BTMs in Q1 2025 compared to some prior quarters. 250 new BTMs were deployed in Q1, and this is a sharp drop compared to 2024 where an ample amount of capital was allocated to BTM purchases. By Q2 last year, one of the key announcements was the deployment of 8,000 new BTMs. ...kiosks in year two versus year one, typically see at least 50% growth in terms of revenue versus year one. - CEO Brandon Mintz, during Q1 earnings call Q&A It seems less cash will be going out to buy new BTMs in the interim, as management emphasized that kiosks in their second year of deployment typically generate 50% more revenue than in their first year. And I think the reason for this could be anywhere from new Kiosks becoming indexed over time in Google Maps and third-party locator apps, which increases traffic organically, or it could be location-specific adoption or familiarization dynamics, where over time, more people notice the machine, try it, and then return as repeat users, thereby boosting transaction volume. So Bitcoin Depot's focus will be on maximizing unit economics and throughput of the current fleet (I see OpEx not going down much soon because heavy marketing might be needed to achieve this) rather than expanding the footprint aggressively. And this strategy is even more viable for the company now that operating cash flow has improved greatly to $16.3 million in Q1, and this gives the company potential more internal liquidity to reinvest selectively and strengthen the balance sheet. Data by YCharts Examining Bitcoin Depot's financials, I'd say the only concerns for investors will be the negative equity currently on the balance sheet . MRQ data shows $89.7 million in total assets (of which cash and cash equivalent make up around $35 million) and $94.3 million in total liabilities, resulting in a shareholders' deficit of ~$4.6 million. Q1 interest expense (Bitcoin Depot) Though Bitcoin Depot covered its Q1 interest expense and can comfortably meet its interest obligations from earnings, as EBIT in Q1 was $10.52 million and interest expense for the quarter was $3.07 million, putting the interest coverage ratio at 3.4x. I believe, the over 3x interest coverage ratio shouldn't be an outright comfort signal for investors, considering the negative equity which still reflects a structurally fragile balance sheet. An interest coverage ratio at 3.4x is still solid on its own, but it doesn't fully offset the broader balance sheet risks. How Do We Value BTM Bitcoin Depot currently enjoys way lower valuation multiples compared to other Bitcoin stocks because BTM has long been beaten down among Bitcoin stocks. Seems the market has underappreciated the infrastructural role of the company in the broader crypto economy compared to how the market rewards Bitcoin miners or Bitcoin leverage bets. Seeking Alpha But I'm not taking the low multiples at face value and would strongly consider the multiples from the angle of BTM's fully diluted share count of 124.7 million, which includes over 60 million potentially dilutive securities of public and private placement warrants, earn out shares, and RSUs. If exercised or vested, could nearly double the current outstanding share count of ~64 million. Outstanding share data (Bitcoin Depot) But irrespective of how you adjust the valuation, BTM's P/S ratio will be around 0.18x and forward P/S will be around 0.2x. EV/EBITDA will be around 4.5x, and forward P/E will be around 13x. BTM's multiples are still extremely attractive compared to virtually all other publicly traded Bitcoin companies. Data by YCharts Rating and Takeaway On BTM's current momentum, a Q1 pre-earnings review would have been a better time to recommend a Buy. The stock is already up over 30% since earnings, and I think the initial boost the earnings have given will likely stall a bit here, and upside could be limited in the near term. If BTM reports continued sales, margin, and operating cash flow strength in Q2 (they are guiding for sales growth of mid-single-digits in Q2) and deleveraging progress makes equity become positive on the balance sheet, this will restore more confidence in investors and make BTM ready for a more sustained upside. Considering the upside already seen on the weekly (since earnings), a Hold is the more prudent call here, as we watch how balance sheet repair and operating leverage unfold in Q2.",MARA|RIOT|MSTR|BTMWW|BTM,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-21 12:00:00

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whale-alert-in-dogecoin-millions-of-dollars-of-sale-what-does-it-mean-here-are-the-details/,"While Dogecoin (DOGE) has been consolidating just below the $0.26 level in recent days, the sales made by whales are drawing attention. Dogecoin Continues to Maintain Bullish Structure: Whales Sold $40 Million Worth of DOGE, Is a New Bounce Imminent? According to on-chain data, 170 million DOGE, or roughly $40 million worth of tokens, have changed hands in the past few days. This development may indicate that the market is preparing the ground for a possible upward breakout. Technical Outlook: A Healthy Correction? Dogecoin is still maintaining a strong bullish structure despite experiencing an 18% pullback since its local peak on May 11. The price action has formed a structure similar to a classic “bull flag” formation following the rally that began in early April. Analysts predict that the current consolidation is a healthy correction and that DOGE could bounce to the $0.35 to $0.45 range in the next 7 days. These targets imply a potential gain of 52% to 114% from the current price level. Technical Analysis Highlights DOGE formed an upward channel, showing an uptrend between $0.222 and $0.228. The critical support level is positioned in the $0.218–$0.219 range. Selling pressure was observed in the $0.233–$0.234 area, which stands out as a key resistance area. The rapid pullback from the daily top suggests that short-term consolidation may continue, but the overall structure is still supported by higher lows. In recent hours, DOGE fell from $0.233 to $0.227, a 2.57% correction. There were several attempts to find support in the $0.227–$0.228 range, which suggests that traders are watching these levels closely. The Role of Whales Although large-scale selling by whales usually causes short-term volatility in the market, such movements can also be interpreted as a harbinger of the next rally. The fact that technical structures are giving positive signals and the general market sentiment remains strong supports the expectation of a potential bounce for Dogecoin. The next week could be critical for Dogecoin traders as whether the price can break the $0.26 resistance will determine the direction of the next major move. *This is not investment advice.

VanEck said Tuesday it will launch the PurposeBuilt Fund in June to invest in tokenized businesses building on Avalanche ( AVAX ) and focused on long-term value and utility. In a press release shared with crypto.news, the New York-headquartered asset manager said the fund will back liquid tokens and venture-backed crypto projects in sectors such as gaming , payments, AI , and financial services — primarily around or after a token generation event. The fund will also deploy idle capital on-chain through Avalanche-native real-world asset products, such as tokenized money market funds. Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager of the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund, said the fund won’t chase hype or short-term trends, as the next wave of value in “crypto will come from real businesses, not more infrastructure.” Read more: VanEck launches ‘NODE’ ETF targeting blockchain stocks and crypto-linked assets “Avalanche has become a magnet for thoughtful builders, and with the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund, we’re bringing capital and conviction to the founders creating lasting value, not chasing momentum.” Pranav Kanade The new vehicle will be managed by the team behind the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund, which has over $100 million in assets under management and launched in 2022. The announcement comes amid growing institutional interest in Avalanche, with Grayscale recently filing to convert its Avalanche Trust, launched in August 2024, into a spot exchange-traded fund. In late March, the firm submitted a 19b-4 filing to Nasdaq to list the fund and offer regulated exposure to AVAX, though it still requires SEC approval.

This surge can be largely attributed to the successful launch of the Pectra upgrade , which significantly boosted investor confidence. Coincidentally, this upgrade also coincided with a positive geopolitical development, which was on May 8th, the US and UK announced a trade deal , marking a historic first. The mere certainty of this agreement sent optimism wave to all altcoins and top coins. Even Arthur Hayes, in a recent interview , agrees that more than technical factors, the sentimental factors led the rise in ETH crypto. He believes that still ETH price presents a unique investment opportunity. Hayes even sets an ambitious target of $5,000 for Ethereum, suggesting that by the end of the year, a price of $10,000 could be within reach. Regardless of the challenges ahead, Ethereum appears poised to play a significantly important role in the crypto landscape of 2025. Its continuous developments and institutional preference could establish it as the leading platform among its competitors, marking a significant turning point for the entire crypto ecosystem. Keep reading to know more. Arthur Hayes Predicts Ethereum Price Run To $10,000 In a recent macro-focused interview on the Bankless podcast, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX and current CIO of Maelstrom, shared his optimistic Ethereum price Forecast. He suggested that if ETH price surpasses $5,000, it could have potential projection to $10,000 or even $15,000 by the end of the year. This ETH price prediction came during a final discussion in the interview when he asked where Hayes sees ETH price this year. In the video, when talked about the second top crypto next to BTC recent run in May, Hayes attributed the ETH price performance to market sentiment rather than any significant technical factors. He noted that the Ethereum price resurgence was long overdue, especially after being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens in recent years. However, he cautioned that Ethereum crypto’s journey may not be straightforward. While acknowledging ETH crypto’s underperformance compared to Bitcoin thus far, he strongly believes that the Ethereum price moment is approaching. This is especially due to regulatory clarity seems higher chance of improving or if decentralized finance (DeFi) regains momentum with sustainable cash flows. He highlighted projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that could finally validate their valuations based on fundamentals. As the interview wrapped up, the host inquired about Hayes’ personal holdings. He revealed that his crypto portfolio consists of approximately 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum, along with a variety of other altcoins and tokens. On the non-crypto side, he mentioned holding physical gold, gold mining stocks, and T-bills.

On the daily price chart, the Ethereum price is currently fluctuating between key resistance and support levels, with mixed signals from technical indicators. After a notable bull run in May, momentum appears to be waning, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated from the overbought territory, now sitting at 68.70. At present, ETH price is priced at $2,528, accompanied by an intraday trading volume of $23.47 billion. The future movement of the Ethereum price hinges on its ability to break through the $2,800 resistance level. Moreover, on-chain data also adds to the optimism, as highlighted in CryptoQuant’s weekly crypto report . The relative price of ETH compared to Bitcoin may have reached a bottom, potentially signaling the onset of an “Alt season.” The ETH/BTC price ratio has surged by 38% over the past week, following a dip to its lowest point since January 2020. Historically, this ratio has indicated a relative bottom for Ethereum, often leading to broader outperformance among altcoins. Source: cryptoquant Additionaly, Ethereum crypto has entered an extreme undervaluation zone relative to Bitcoin, as indicated by the ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric, marking the first occurrence of this since 2019. Source: cryptoquant In the past, similar conditions in 2017, 2018, and 2019 were followed by significant periods of Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting a strong potential for mean reversion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

At the inaugural NYC Crypto Summit held at Gracie Mansion, Adams unveiled the Crypto Digital Assets Advisory Council. Addressing the gathering full of crypto enthusiasts and investors, he took the stage and affirmed his dream to make New York the “Crypto Capital of the World.” Adams’ Crypto Council to Transform NYC with Blockchain Adams, who made headlines in 2022 by accepting his first three paychecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum, stressed that this isn’t about chasing fads. “We want to use the technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today,” he declared. NYC CTO Matthew Fraser did not hold back. He stresses on leveraging blockchain to secure crucial records like birth and death certificates, promising improved efficiency and security for public services. The council that includes crypto experts, will meet regularly to formulate policy, with details on its chair and recommendations expected soon. Industry Titans Join New York’s Vision The summit attracted industry tycoons, including family offices, technology startups, and fintech companies. Richard Hecker of Traction and Scale highlighted the presence of unicorn startups, while Andrew Durgee, co-CEO of Republic, announced his firm’s commitment to New York despite regulatory challenges.

In his latest tweet, he claims “The End is Here”, pointing to a failed U.S. bond auction and warning of coming hyperinflation. But while the message may sound scary, he also shares hope, and for him, that hope is Bitcoin . FED Bond Auction – No One Attended At the center of his warning is a bond auction that reportedly saw very little participation. Kiyosaki explained that the U.S. government recently held an auction to sell its bonds, but no one showed up to buy. Usually, investors or countries buy these bonds to help fund government operations. But this time, according to Kiyosaki, the U.S. Federal Reserve itself quietly stepped in to buy $50 billion worth of bonds, using money it simply created. THE END is HERE: WHAT if you threw a party and no one showed up? That is what happened yesterday. The Fed held an auction for US Bonds and no one showed up. So the Fed quietly bought $50 billion of its own fake money with fake money. The party is over. Hyperinflation is… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 21, 2025 He calls this “fake money buying fake assets,” and says it’s a sign that the financial system is in big trouble. Hyperinflation Could Be Next He didn’t hold back from predicting what comes next. “Hyperinflation is here,” he said. When governments keep printing money to cover their spending, it weakens the value of that money. Kiyosaki believes this will lead to hyperinflation, where prices go up very fast and people’s savings lose value quickly. He warns that “millions, young and old” could lose everything if they’re not prepared. The dollar, he says, is on the edge of collapse. Gold, Silver… and Bitcoin to the Rescue? Despite the bad news, Kiyosaki still sees a way to protect your future. He predicts that as the dollar weakens, people will turn to hard assets, things with real value. He believes gold will reach $25,000, silver will hit $70, and Bitcoin could soar to between $500,000 and $1 million. That’s a huge jump, but in his view, it’s not just possible, it’s likely. Why Bitcoin Stands Out Kiyosaki has long supported Bitcoin. He believes it’s a safe way to protect your money because no government controls it, and there’s only a limited amount of it. Recently, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 this year. Right now, Bitcoin is close to its highest-ever price, trading around $106,651, with a total market value of $2.11 trillion.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 12:06:56

At the heart of XRP’s liquidity and market valuation are key trading platforms that handle the bulk of XRP-U.S. dollar transactions. Recent data shared by leading XRP-focused influencer SMQKE reveals a detailed snapshot of these platforms’ performance as of September 30, 2024, based on cumulative trading volume and market share. This ranking highlights the top five XRP trading platforms, offering a deeper understanding of the market’s structural dynamics and the exchanges powering the XRP economy. XRP Trading Platforms Ranked by Volume 1. Coinbase 2. Crypto. com 3. Kraken 4. LMAX Digital 5. Bitstamp pic.twitter.com/2OxdVUhvyT — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 21, 2025 Coinbase: Dominating XRP Liquidity At the top of the list is Coinbase , the largest contributor to XRP-U.S. dollar trading volume among all the platforms surveyed. As of the end of Q3 2024, Coinbase recorded a staggering 1,390,594,237 XRP in trading volume, commanding a dominant 49.1% market share. This substantial figure underscores Coinbase’s unparalleled influence in shaping XRP price discovery and liquidity in the U.S. market. Coinbase’s status as a publicly traded company and its commitment to regulatory compliance have positioned it as a trustworthy and preferred platform for both retail and institutional investors. Its inclusion in the XRP index further reflects its reliability and significance in the broader crypto trading ecosystem. Despite regulatory headwinds in the past, especially relating to XRP’s legal standing in the United States, Coinbase has remained a key player in facilitating XRP trades, with its advanced trading tools, liquidity pools, and extensive user base ensuring consistent volume inflows. Crypto.com: Securing the Second Spot Following Coinbase is Crypto.com, which registered 708,146,379 XRP in trading volume, amounting to a 25.05% market share. Crypto.com’s aggressive global expansion strategy, user incentives, and crypto-friendly mobile platform have significantly boosted its XRP transaction volumes. Its innovative approach to retail user engagement, including cashback offers, staking rewards, and low-fee trading options, has made it a competitive venue for XRP traders globally. Crypto.com has also been proactive in listing XRP trading pairs and promoting liquidity through diverse fiat and crypto pairings. The platform’s ability to cater to a wide spectrum of users—from casual investors to high-frequency traders, has made it a formidable player in XRP market activity. Kraken: A Resilient Market Participant Ranked third, Kraken posted a total XRP trading volume of 268,454,941, capturing 9.5% of the market. Known for its deep liquidity, strong security protocols, and consistent regulatory alignment, Kraken remains a critical part of XRP’s trading infrastructure. Kraken’s emphasis on security and compliance, especially with U.S. and European regulatory standards, has earned it a loyal user base. The exchange has also been instrumental in supporting XRP during periods of legal uncertainty, continuing to list the asset and provide access to global markets when other platforms chose to delist or suspend XRP pairs. Kraken’s position in the index reflects its resilience and continued trust among XRP traders. LMAX Digital: Institutional Depth LMAX Digital claims the fourth position with a trading volume of 203,020,459 XRP and a 7.18% market share. As an institution-focused exchange, LMAX Digital’s inclusion in the top five highlights the growing interest of professional investors in XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike retail-heavy platforms, LMAX Digital is designed to serve hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, and asset managers seeking transparent, regulated execution environments. The platform offers low-latency trading, robust infrastructure, and deep liquidity, all of which appeal to institutional XRP investors who prioritize efficiency and scale. LMAX’s steady rise in XRP volume indicates the strengthening role of institutional capital in XRP markets. Bitstamp: Legacy Platform with Strong Foundations Rounding out the top five is Bitstamp , which facilitated 190,473,389 XRP in trades, equating to 6.74% of the market share. Bitstamp is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and has long maintained a reputation for regulatory compliance, stability, and user trust. Bitstamp’s continued presence among the leading XRP exchanges reflects its enduring appeal to conservative investors and institutions. The platform has consistently offered XRP trading pairs even during turbulent regulatory times, reinforcing its commitment to asset accessibility. Its partnership with Ripple in earlier years has also helped it remain closely aligned with XRP-related developments. Market Overview Altogether, these top five exchanges account for a combined XRP trading volume of 2,760,689,405 and control an overwhelming 97.66% share of the U.S. dollar-XRP trading market. The data, sourced from SMQKE’s public status and corroborated by market records, paints a clear picture of XRP’s trading ecosystem, where a few well-established platforms play an outsized role in determining price action, market sentiment, and liquidity availability. These rankings not only reflect current trading dynamics but also provide insights into the strategic positioning of exchanges within the evolving digital asset landscape. As XRP continues to regain momentum post-regulatory clarification and sees increasing use cases in cross-border payments, tokenization, and DeFi, the role of these trading platforms will become even more critical. Investors, analysts, and institutions would do well to monitor shifts in exchange rankings as they can often signal broader trends in the crypto market.

This significant development has boosted investor confidence, driving XRP prices beyond the critical $2.40 resistance level and laying the groundwork for a potential surge across the XRP ecosystem. Amid this wave of renewed optimism, XpFinance , an innovative decentralized lending and borrowing platform specifically built for the XRP Ledger, has quickly become a focal point. Within just days of announcing its highly anticipated token presale, XpFinance has impressively filled 20% of its 100,000 XRP softcap, highlighting strong investor interest and momentum. Join XpFinance Presale With Ripple’s strategic move towards acquiring USDC expected to unlock considerable liquidity and enhance mainstream adoption, investors are rushing to position themselves in promising XRP Ledger projects like XpFinance . Analysts are already indicating that this may signal the start of an extensive decentralized finance boom within the XRP ecosystem, drawing significant attention from both retail and institutional investors. Investors looking to capitalize on XRP’s bullish trajectory are presented with a timely and compelling opportunity through XpFinance’s presale , offering early participants substantial potential upside ahead of its anticipated decentralized exchange listing. The DeFi Dapp XRP Investors Have Been Waiting For Despite XRP’s remarkable speed, low transaction fees, and efficiency, it has long lacked a truly decentralized lending and borrowing platform comparable to those available on Ethereum or Cardano. Centralized options have repeatedly disappointed investors with opaque practices, custody risks, and regulatory uncertainties. XpFinance solves these pain points by offering XRP users a fully decentralized, non-custodial solution, allowing seamless, secure lending and borrowing without intermediaries. By empowering users to maintain full control of their XRP assets, XpFinance provides investors the ideal platform to safely grow their XRP holdings while participating actively in the burgeoning DeFi economy. Why XRP Whales Are Flocking To XpFinance As XRP reaches its highest valuation in months, seasoned XRP whales are strategically moving their profits into XpFinance’s presale to leverage its remarkable early investment advantages, robust platform utility, and substantial growth potential: Presale participants benefit from a fixed presale rate of 1 XRP = 200 XPF. Following the presale, tokens will list on XP Market, XRPL’s prominent decentralized exchange, at 1 XRP = 140 XPF, instantly granting early investors a guaranteed 30% profit margin at the listing event. Unlike centralized alternatives, XpFinance ensures full decentralization, transparency, and asset custody directly within users’ wallets, removing third-party risks entirely. XPF token holders earn sustainable staking rewards paid in XRP from platform transaction fees, creating an attractive source of ongoing passive income. Holding XPF tokens substantially reduces platform borrowing fees and provides holders the opportunity to actively participate in governance, shaping the protocol’s future direction. Limited Presale Allocation, Less Than 30 Days To Go XpFinance ’s total token supply is capped at just 200 million XPF, with 60 million (30%) specifically allocated to presale investors. Given the rapid uptake within hours, analysts predict the entire presale allocation could sell out rapidly, especially as XRP’s price momentum continues. Investors who delay might find themselves paying substantially higher prices on exchanges after listing. Secure your allocation now to avoid missing out. How To Join The XpFinance Presale Joining the presale and securing your XPF tokens is simple: Buy XRP: Acquire XRP from trusted exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Bybit). Transfer to XRP Wallet: Move your XRP to a non-custodial XRPL-compatible wallet such as Xaman, XUMM, or Ledger. Contribute to Presale: Visit the official presale portal at xp.finance/presale , copy the presale deposit address, and send your XRP. Set Up Trustline: Add the XPF trustline to your wallet to automatically receive your tokens upon completion of the presale. The XRP DeFi Boom Begins Here With over 20,000 XRP already locked into the presale within hours, excitement and FOMO among investors are growing quickly. XpFinance is uniquely positioned to become the centerpiece of XRPL’s DeFi ecosystem, potentially triggering a wave of decentralized finance adoption that could lift the XRP ecosystem to unprecedented heights.

The government has already rolled out aid for auto and chip firms after Washington announced 25% duties on Korean goods. Acting Finance Minister Kim Beom-seok said on Wednesday that the new package will “prepare in advance for item-specific tariffs, such as pharmaceutical products and semiconductors, and strengthen support for ‘U-turn’ investments.” Officials added that extra measures for biopharmaceutical businesses will follow once the United States clarifies the details of the tariffs on the pharma sector. Pressure from the White House has grown since early May, when President Trump signed an executive order to speed up approval of drug-manufacturing plants at home. That step fits a broader push to boost domestic production, after probes into foreign pharmaceutical imports were launched. Pharmaceuticals are a strategic but small slice of South Korea’s trade. Shipments were $9.59 billion in 2024, only 1.4% of total exports, yet 16% of those medicines went to the United States, the sector’s largest market. Industry leaders in South Korea are weighing a response Seo Jung-jin, chairman of Celltrion, said last week the firm would delay a decision on U.S. contract-manufacturing plans by six months. “It is still unclear whether entering the U.S. is the right answer,” he noted, pointing to high costs in a country where Celltrion earns nearly 30% of its revenue. Regulators are also on the move. U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors landed at Samsung Biologics’ plant in Incheon on May 19 for a routine visit that ends on May 27. Samsung Biologics said the trip is not linked to the surprise checks conducted by the Trump administration at some overseas factories. Investors reacted swiftly. Samsung Biologics shares climbed more than 7% on Wednesday, lifting the benchmark KOSPI index by 1.1% in early trade. Celltrion gained 0.5%. Samsung Biologics shares. Source: Google Finance Seoul signaled that more support measures could follow. Authorities have already assembled 28.6 trillion won ($20.6 billion) worth of measures to prevent liquidity problems, widen export markets, and fund companies that want to bring operations back home. Additional steps will be added if necessary to shore up sectors such as automobiles, the finance ministry said. Seoul is trying to negotiate a tariff deal by the July 8 deadline Most of the U.S. tariffs are set to begin on July 8, after a 90-day grace period. Following two rounds of ministerial talks, Korean and U.S. officials are holding technical sessions this week as Seoul tries to craft a deal and win exemptions by early July. Trade and Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said Friday that Seoul would try to negotiate a tariff deal by the deadline. However, he warned that domestic politics could result in a slip. After months of political unrest, South Korea is holding a snap presidential election on June 3. A separate caution came Wednesday from Minister for Trade Cheong In-kyo, who told lawmakers that exports to the United States and China will likely fall in May under the weight of the tariffs. In the first 20 days of May, Korean exports dropped 2.4% year on year, with U.S.-bound shipments down 14.6%. The slide, driven by autos, parts, and steel, follows an unexpected rise in April when strong semiconductor demand briefly lifted overall sales. With less than 7 weeks until the tariffs take effect, South Korea is racing to shield its export-led economy from a fresh shock while it searches for a political compromise in Washington.

In these months, the network has made some huge progress, including breaking into the top 20 crypto post-launch. Trending across social media platforms and boasting over 60 million users. Moving forward, Pi price appeared to be more secure with an increase in real-world adoption along with more exchange listings. However, the PI price has remained highly volatile, while heavy token unlocks have made it too risky to deal with. Now that the bearish flags have been fluttering over the Pi price rally, will the bulls prevent excessive price drain? After the rebound from the support below $0.7, the PI price appeared to have triggered a fine reversal. Meanwhile, a close observation suggests diverse price action. The token experienced two major spikes followed by liquidations, with a clear bearish setup leading to a decline of over 52%. In the long term, the outlook remains bearish with a target near $0.3, representing about an 80% potential downfall. In a wider perspective, the PI price has remained under massive bearish influence, which portrays the Gaussian Channel. The price is trading much below the resistance of the channel. which is currently bearish. Besides, the CMF has triggered a bearish divergence while in an attempt to trigger a recovery. Moreover, the volume has dropped significantly, signalling a drop in trading activity. With this, the PI price seems to be preparing for another pullback, which may drag the price down by another 10% to 15%. Will the PI price remain stuck within a bearish trend? The PI price may undergo minor price variations in the short term, which could keep the token consolidated above the crucial support in the long term. Besides, the upcoming unlocks are expected to increase the volatility, which could, in turn, have a positive impact on the rally. However, to do so, the PI price is required to breach above $1 and sustain for a long time without undergoing a correction.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 13:07:50

With levies on US-bound goods set to deepen later this year, analysts warn that unless Tokyo persuades Washington to roll back duties, the headwinds could intensify. Shipments from Japan to the US fell for the first time in four months According to Ministry of Finance figures, total exports climbed just 2% in April compared with a year earlier, matching market expectations but decelerating from March’s 4% gain. In contrast, shipments to the US, Japan’s largest export market, fell 1.8% year-on-year, marking the first contraction in four months. Declining demand for cars, steel and ships largely drove that downturn. Automotive exports to the US contracted by 4.8% in value, struck by a stronger yen and lower volumes of premium models. “Up until March, automakers appeared to front-load US deliveries ahead of the tariff increase. Now that the duties are effective, the trend has reversed.” Yutaro Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Securities. While exports to the broader Asian region rose 6%, shipments to China slipped 0.6% amid softer orders for vehicles and electronic components. At the same time, imports fell 2.2% in April, less severe than the 4.5% drop analysts had forecast, resulting in a trade deficit of ¥115.8 billion ($803 million), rather than the anticipated surplus of ¥227.1 billion ($1.6 billion). Ironically, Japan’s goods trade surplus with the United States widened 14.3% year-on-year to ¥780.6 billion ($5.4 billion), the fourth consecutive monthly increase, as American purchases of Japanese products eased. That growing bilateral surplus may attract further scrutiny from Washington, which has long admonished Tokyo for currency and trade practices it believes give Japan’s exporters an edge. Against this backdrop, Japan’s chief trade negotiator , Ryosei Akazawa, is slated to hold a third round of discussions in Washington later this week. Yet few observers expect a breakthrough on auto tariffs, which are set to rise to 24% in July unless a deal is struck. Trump’s administration has already imposed 10% tariffs on a wide range of imports, including Japanese steel and aluminum, and 25% duties on cars, rattling an economy heavily reliant on auto exports to North America. “Tariffs will exert both direct and indirect downward pressure on exports,” said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. He added that even if bilateral talks yield some tariff relief, Japan cannot escape the spillover effects of a weakening global economy. Companies in Japan may hold capital spending until the situation improves The administration’s trade measures may also cause Japanese firms to postpone capital spending, exacerbating the pain for an economy that recorded a contraction in the January–March quarter. “With manufacturers so deeply integrated into worldwide supply chains, abrupt policy shifts risk a ‘whiplash’ effect that could reverberate through the entire economy.” Stefan Angrick of Moody’s Analytics. Currency policy is another flashpoint. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato is expected to meet his US counterpart, Treasury official Scott Bessent, on the sidelines of a G7 finance ministers’ meeting in Canada this week, where dollar-yen policy is likely to feature prominently. Trump has accused Japan of deliberately keeping the yen weak to bolster its exports, and a sustained yen appreciation in recent months has already dented the competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers. The deteriorating outlook has also complicated the Bank of Japan’s plans for monetary tightening. On May 1, the BOJ sharply downgraded its growth and inflation forecasts, citing escalating US tariffs among the key risks to its belief that a moderate recovery was underway. Capital Economics economist Abhijit Surya now expects net exports to subtract from second-quarter GDP growth and has pushed back his forecast for the BOJ’s next rate hike from July to October. With an unstable tariff landscape and domestic growth teetering, Japanese policymakers face difficult choices. Already, businesses are feeling the heat with companies saying the US tariff will erode profitability by tens of billions of dollars.

This unexpected price surge comes at a time when most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), are trading sideways with minimal volatility. The $TRUMP token has climbed nearly 9% within 24 hours, signalling renewed interest and liquidity among investors eager to capitalise on the political and media frenzy surrounding the token. Adding to the momentum, trading volume for the memecoin has jumped 120% to reach $1.45 billion, highlighting a dramatic increase in short-term demand and speculative activity. The gala dinner at Trump’s Virginia golf club The highly anticipated exclusive gala dinner set to take place at Trump’s Virginia golf club on March 22 is seen as the main catalyst for the TRUMP price surge. Notably, only the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP token will gain access to this private event, with the top 25 holders granted entry to a special VIP reception. Interestingly, one of those elite guests is Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, who confirmed this week that he is the top holder of the TRUMP token. H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 @justinsuntron · Follow Honored to support @POTUS and grateful for the invitation from @GetTrumpMemes to attend President Trump’s Gala Dinner as his TOP fan!As the top holder of $TRUMP , I’m excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry. 🇺🇸 9:30 am · 20 May 2025 832 Reply Copy link Read 174 replies Sun currently holds $18.6 million worth of the memecoin and expressed excitement about discussing the future of the crypto industry with Trump and other key figures. Sun had also revealed that Tron DAO had previously invested $75 million into World Liberty Financial, a Trump-affiliated crypto platform that redirects 75% of its revenue to Trump-owned entities. Altogether, Sun’s total investment in Trump’s crypto ecosystem now exceeds $93 million, raising eyebrows among watchdog groups and political analysts alike. Questions around the Gala dinner As TRUMP memecoin makes waves, the US SEC has acknowledged that meme coins like TRUMP are generally considered collectables, not securities, which currently shields the token from enforcement actions. Nonetheless, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins faced intense questioning in Congress regarding the legality and ethics of the gala dinner and the wider implications of foreign investors gaining intimate access to a former US president. The highly anticipated dinner event has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and nonprofit watchdogs, who allege that it paves the way for foreign influence and unregulated political fundraising. Accountable.US, a government watchdog, described the situation as “corruption unfolding in real time,” pointing to the opaque mechanisms that allow massive investments to translate directly into personal access. Despite the controversy, the $TRUMP token has continued to surge, with its price climbing to $14.31 and its market cap approaching $2.9 billion. The token now ranks among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, outperforming many established assets in recent days. However, concerns remain about the centralisation of supply, as nearly 80% of the TRUMP token is reportedly controlled by the Trump Organisation and its affiliates. This high concentration of ownership, combined with Sun’s substantial stake, raises potential risks of price manipulation and insider influence. At the same time, the meme coin’s lack of underlying utility or technical innovation continues to draw scepticism from traditional investors. Even so, the blend of political spectacle, celebrity appeal, and digital finance has created a unique narrative that seems to defy conventional market behaviour.

Bonk ( BONK ) was trading at $0.00002053 on Wednesday, down 20% from its monthly high. Data from Nansen and Santiment shows that both smart money investors and whales have trimmed their Bonk holdings, a potential signal that they expect a reversal in price. Bonk holders with between 1 million and 10 million coins have offloaded 500 million tokens since December.

The token then dropped to a low of $0.00001815, which coincided with an ascending trendline connecting the lowest swings since April 7. Bonk has since formed a bearish pennant pattern, made up of a sharp downward move followed by a symmetrical triangle. The two trendlines of this pattern are nearing a confluence, which could lead to a bearish breakdown. The initial target for this move is $0.00001815, the lowest swing this month.

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor. The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K “This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance. “It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence. That’s what institutions have been waiting for,” Grachev told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on May 20, adding: “Stablecoins aren’t a crypto experiment anymore. They’re a better form of money. Faster, simpler, and more transparent than fiat. It’s only a matter of time before they become the default.” Source: Cointelegraph Senate bill seen as path to unified digital system The GENIUS Act may be the “first step” toward establishing a “unified digital financial system which is borderless, programmable and efficient,” Grachev said, adding: “When the US moves on stablecoin policy, the world watches.” Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, a co-sponsor of the bill, also pointed to Memorial Day as a “fair target ” for its potential passage. Grachev said regulatory clarity alone will not drive institutional adoption. Products offering stable and predictable yield will also be necessary.

Vugar Usi Zade, the chief operating officer at Bitget exchange, told Cointelegraph that “the bill doesn’t fully address offshore stablecoin issuers like Tether, which continue to play an outsized role in global liquidity.” He added that US-based issuers will now face “steeper costs,” likely accelerating consolidation across the market and favoring well-resourced players that can meet the new thresholds. Still, Zade acknowledged that the legislation could bring greater “stability” to regulated offerings, depending on how it is ultimately worded and enforced.

However, after some changes were made to the GENIUS law, it is expected to be voted on again in the Senate and the law is expected to pass. At this point, while it is thought that the progress and passage of the GENIUS law will have a positive impact on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said that the groundbreaking stablecoin legislation could pave the way for a crypto bull market that will last for many years. Last week, the 16 Democratic senators who had voted to reject the bill reversed their decision. The GENIUS bill, which is moving forward with the approval process, was voted 66-32 with bipartisan support. The crypto industry hailed the vote as a historic victory that could help “secure the dominance of the US dollar,” while Bitwise CEO said it paved the way for a bull season that will continue for years to come. “Politicians in Washington did the right thing. I don't want to make a prediction without having clear data, but I think by summer we will have our first full-fledged crypto legislation in the US.” These Altcoins Will Benefit the Most! The passage of the GENIUS Act marks another milestone for the crypto market, as spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January 2024. “I believe this law paves the way for a long-term, sustainable rally in crypto assets beyond Bitcoin. The biggest beneficiaries will be Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and various decentralized finance (DeFi) altcoins like Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE).” The Bitwise CIO also added that the status of stablecoins, which have been in the gray zone for many years, will be clarified and will allow major banks to issue stablecoins and merchants to accept them. “I predict that the stablecoin market will quickly become a $2.5 trillion market once the legislation is passed. Just close your eyes here and imagine a world where JPMorgan and Bank of America are issuing stablecoins, where Amazon gives you a 2% discount if you buy with stablecoins instead of Visa, and where accepting stablecoins is as common as accepting Venmo or PayPal. Because that’s the world we’re going to live in soon.” *This is not investment advice.

The token trading platform achieved volumes of $2B on May 20, setting a new all-time record. Binance Alpha 2.0 achieved daily volumes of $2B as of May 20, setting a new price record. The activity on BNB Smart Chain and Binance Wallet increased, incentivized by token airdrops and trading competitions. Binance Wallet reflected the growing demand for alpha points farming and DEX swaps for the hottest tokens. | Source: Dune Analytics Binance Alpha once again became the main source of volumes for the Binance Web3 wallet, which has set daily records for the past week. In the past week, Binance Alpha increased its volumes by 223%, tapping both centralized and decentralized users. Binance Alpha 2.0 boosted by airdrop hunters The main goal of Binance Alpha 2.0 was to consolidate Web3 activity and connect it to Binance’s centralized trader user base. The launch led to special incentives for Binance Wallet users, in turn expanding volumes and transactions. Initially, the platform saw limited usage until traders noticed multiple incentives for valuable airdrops. This, in turn, increased the farming of alpha points, especially after the initial valuable airdrops. The early users of Binance Wallet and the Alpha feature gained access to ZORA, DOOD, SIGN, and other valuable assets. Binance Alpha had relatively low requirements for its first clients. Currently, there is a longer checklist for airdrop hunters, including a balance on the centralized exchange and in the Binance Web3 wallet. The other requirement is active trading of all the newly offered tokens through the Binance Alpha program. The inflow of users into Binance Alpha follows the increasing value of alpha points. The points balance will become one of the main criteria for future airdrops and token sales through Pancake Swap. BNB Smart Chain saw 365 IDO and ICO events in the year to date, based on Cryptorank data. Despite the relatively low number, PancakeSwap IDOs have the second-highest profitability. The exposure and potential listings on Binance raise demand for those events, further drawing in users to Binance Alpha. BNB Chain regains its lead BNB Chain returned as a leader in EVM-compatible networks. PancakeSwap now carries over 41.9% of DEX volumes, surpassing Base and even Uniswap on Ethereum. PancakeSwap now produces over $2M in daily fees, retaining a higher baseline in May. The native BNB token once again flipped Solana (SOL), rising to $653.73. Binance Smart Chain competes with Solana as the go-to chain for memes and token activity. The airdrop incentives are generating additional traffic, though not all of the swaps are organic. In 2025, Binance continues its deliberate efforts to increase traffic, grow value locked and become the go-to hub for Web3 activity. The chain increased its DEX volumes and saw higher demand, as PancakeSwap solved the issue of sandwich attacks. At the same time, Solana activity depends on the appeal of meme tokens, leading to a mix of hype and slower periods. Solana retains the leadership as the main network for bots, while BSC hosts only 1.2% of all bot traffic. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams announced a digital advisory council to explore blockchain use in public services. In contrast, South Korea is enacting stricter rules for nonprofit crypto sales and exchange operations, including tighter listing standards and mandatory real-name accounts, ahead of broader institutional participation in its crypto market. NFT Royalties Likely Not Securities United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce clarified that many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), particularly those programmed to pay royalties to artists and creators, likely do not fall under federal securities regulations. In a recent address, Peirce pointed out that the functionality of NFTs allowing for resale royalties is more similar to the compensation models used in the music and film industries. Hester Peirce She explained that just as streaming platforms reward creators every time their work is played, NFTs can make it possible for artists to earn from the appreciation of their work on secondary markets—without necessarily qualifying as securities. Peirce did add that these royalty features do not give NFT holders ownership in a business or rights to any profits in the traditional sense associated with securities. Her remarks were largely welcomed in the crypto community but were reportedly misrepresented by some media outlets. Oscar Franklin Tan , chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, believes that the idea of NFTs paying resale royalties has never been controversial or considered to fall in the SEC’s jurisdiction. According to Tan, compensating a creator through resale royalties is considered business income, not investment income, and thus falls outside the scope of securities law. He added that the legal framework never prohibited creators from earning royalties from the resale of their works, whether via traditional contracts or smart contracts on blockchain networks. However, he acknowledged that legal complexities can arise if NFT structures begin to promise royalty shares to holders beyond the original creator, which may resemble profit-sharing schemes. In a case like this, regulators might be more inclined to classify them under securities law. Still, Tan urged regulators to apply traditional legal principles logically, asking, “If this were done on paper instead of blockchain, would it be a legal issue?” On a related note, NFT marketplace OpenSea recently emerged from a regulatory challenge involving the SEC. In August of 2024, OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC suggesting that NFTs on the platform might be considered unregistered securities. But on Feb. 22, 2025, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer confirmed that the SEC officially closed its investigation into the platform. The move was seen by many in the industry as a positive outcome. After this resolution, OpenSea’s legal team wrote a letter to Commissioner Peirce in April, arguing that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea should not be classified as brokers or exchanges under current US securities law. The lawyers contended that these platforms do not facilitate transactions directly or serve as intermediaries and asked the SEC to formally clarify that NFT marketplaces are not exchanges. While royalty mechanisms for artists seem safe from classification as securities, broader questions about the structure and function of NFT trading venues are still on the table. Eric Adams Vows to Make NYC the Crypto Capital Crypto regulation is also making strides in The Big Apple. New York City Mayor Eric Adams once again said that he is committed to making the city a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation, and announced plans to form a digital advisory council that is aimed at attracting jobs and investment. At the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams explained that the initiative was not about following fads but about embracing technologies that can enhance government services and economic development. While he did not share the full composition of the upcoming advisory group, Adams said a chair and formal policy recommendations will be unveiled in the coming weeks. The mayor also placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of crypto and blockchain technologies in creating a more efficient and inclusive city infrastructure. He pointed to tokenization, fintech, and blockchain applications as tools that could enhance how the city manages sensitive records and delivers public services. Specifically, Adams said the city will explore the use of crypto for paying taxes and other services, as well as implementing blockchain technology to secure documents like birth and death certificates. To support these efforts, the city already enlisted the help of financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale, who will contribute to shaping New York's crypto strategy. Adams said these partnerships will help the city stay ahead of emerging digital trends and build a stronger, more inclusive tech sector. New York State lawmakers are also pushing forward with their own digital asset legislation. Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill in April to allow state agencies to accept cryptocurrency as payment, while state Senator James Sanders Jr proposed the Blockchain Study Act in February to examine the broader impact of crypto in New York. Although the latter has not yet passed the House, the state’s legislative activity reflects a growing interest in digital assets. Mayor Adams attracted national attention after opting to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin when he took office in January of 2022, and continues to champion digital assets despite past controversies. He was previously indicted on allegations of accepting illegal campaign donations from the Turkish government, but the case was dismissed with prejudice by federal authorities. South Korea Tightens Crypto Rules On the other hand, South Korea is set to implement stricter regulations for digital asset transactions in June as it prepares to open its crypto market to institutional investors. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced the finalized measures during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting on May 20, and introduced new rules for nonprofit crypto sales and digital asset exchange operations. Under the new guidelines, nonprofit organizations will be allowed to accept and sell crypto donations, but only if they have at least five years of audited financial records and establish internal committees to review each donation and liquidation plan. All transactions must go through verified Korean won accounts, with banks and exchanges sharing verification responsibilities. To reduce speculative risks, nonprofits can only handle cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges, and liquidation must occur immediately upon receipt. Exchanges, meanwhile, will be permitted to liquidate user-paid crypto fees solely for operational costs, with strict daily limits and restrictions to the top 20 tokens by market cap. Exchanges are also barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest. The FSC is also tightening token listing standards, requiring minimum circulating supply before a token can be traded and temporarily banning market orders after new listings. Tokens with low volume, limited market cap, or no clear utility—like meme coins—will face more scrutiny and may be delisted if they fail to meet liquidity or engagement benchmarks.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XYZVerse sparks massive presale buzz as investors eye it as the next 50x memecoin ahead of the 2025 supercycle. Table of Contents XYZVerse ignites hype: Could this be the next 50x memecoin? Dogecoin fluctuates Conclusion Some early cryptocurrency investors have seen their fortunes multiply beyond imagination. Dogecoin made millionaires out of everyday people. Now, the focus shifts to XYZVerse, a new digital asset with enormous potential. With predictions of a meme coin supercycle in 2025, XYZVerse could be the opportunity that creates billionaires. Is this the next big chance for unprecedented wealth? XYZVerse ignites hype: Could this be the next 50x memecoin? The excitement surrounding XYZVerse is heating up fast. Positioned to break records in the memecoin space, XYZVerse is aiming for an explosive 50x growth from its launch price, and the momentum is real. Currently in presale, XYZ tokens are being offered at a fraction of the projected listing price, giving early buyers a chance to lock in major gains before the broader market catches on. Already listed on CoinMarketCap, XYZVerse has received overwhelming support from the community. Over 95% of voters are bullish on XYZ, expecting major growth. Adding to the buzz, well-known crypto influencer DanjoCapitalMaster, with nearly 800,000 followers, has publicly called XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity,” drawing even more attention to the project. XYZVerse isn’t just another copy-paste memecoin. It’s creating a new blueprint by merging the thrill of sports culture with the viral energy of meme communities. The result? A rapidly growing fanbase and surging presale numbers. Starting at just $0.0001, the XYZ token has climbed to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with more than 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. With a final presale price target of $0.1, the upside for early buyers is attracting serious attention. XYZVerse isn’t built on hype alone. Its tokenomics model is designed for long-term viability: 15% is allocated for liquidity to ensure strong market support. 10% is reserved for community rewards and airdrops. 17.13% will be burned, helping reduce supply and support future price appreciation. XYZVerse is putting its community at the center. The Ambassador Program rewards loyal supporters with free tokens, while behind the scenes, the team is in talks with major sports figures to amplify the brand. The recent partnership with Bookmaker, a decentralized sportsbook, marks a critical step in bringing real-world utility to the token. It’s not just a coin, it’s a movement with growing use cases. Backed by a surging presale, an engaged community, and a bold vision, XYZVerse is quickly gaining traction as one of the hottest memecoin contenders. While crypto markets remain unpredictable, early investors are eyeing this project as a rare chance to get in before liftoff. With the presale already moving fast, timing could be everything.

In the past week, its price dipped by 2.87%. Over the last month, however, it surged by 42.68%. Looking back six months, DOGE has dropped by 40.83%. This mix of gains and losses shows a volatile market for the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 49.14, indicating a neutral market. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.23, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.22. This suggests a minor upward trend. The MACD level is 0.0009963, hinting at potential bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is $0.28, while support is at $0.19. If DOGE breaks above the $0.28 resistance, it could reach the next resistance at $0.31, marking a potential gain of around 24%. On the downside, falling below the $0.19 support might lead to testing the $0.15 support level, a possible drop of about 30%. The substantial monthly gain indicates growth potential, but the recent weekly dip urges caution. Monitoring these key levels will be crucial for anticipating DOGE’s next move. Conclusion Coins like DOGE have shown great potential, but XYZVerse unites sports fans for unprecedented growth in the 2025 bull run.

The platform's unique social trading features and multi-asset offerings provide a competitive edge over peers like Robinhood, attracting both novice and sophisticated investors. Recent U.S. crypto regulation changes and eToro's Nasdaq listing open significant growth opportunities in North America, despite some regulatory and competitive risks. While risks remain, eToro's current valuation and business model suggest substantial upside potential compared to sector peers, making ETOR stock attractive. Israeli online trading company eToro Group Ltd ( ETOR ) went public last week on Wednesday, raising $310 million via an initial public offering. The IPO was priced at $52.00 per share, valuing the company at $4.2 billion. eToro shares opened trading on Nasdaq at $69.69 per share, 34% above the IPO price. Even though the stock price has pulled back slightly to about $66.00 per share, the company is still valued about 27% above its IPO valuation. It is also significantly higher than the $3.5 billion the online brokerage platform reported in the $300 million venture funding announced in 2023. However, at the current market cap of about $5.4 billion, eToro’s current market value is just above half the $10.4 billion valuation the company sought when it first planned to go public via a SPAC in 2021. eToro's value proposition eToro’s 2024 total commission income rose 45.6% last year to $931 million, according to the company’s pre-IPO filings. The fourth quarter brought in $303 million, mainly driven the Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 following Trump’s election. Overall, crypto-related commissions accounted for 38% of the total for the year, again with the fourth quarter a major contributor. This is even though eToro had agreed to delist multiple cryptocurrencies from its trading platform in September, following its settlement with the SEC. However, things have taken a turn for the better in the U.S. overall, with the securities regulatory agency seemingly retreating on oversight after withdrawing or pausing cases against Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood’s crypto unit. Earlier this year, the Trump administration reclassified several digital asset types as collectibles rather than securities, paving the way for a potential relisting on crypto exchanges and other trading platforms in the U.S., where they had been previously delisted amid the SEC’s wrath on crypto companies. Although bitcoin is by far the biggest contributor to daily crypto trading volume, listing products like meme coins can help attract new traders to a platform, thus potentially increasing commission revenue. Reuters reported that eToro CEO, Yoni Assia, shares the sentiment that “speculation on meme coins generally brings more people into the market.” If U.S. traders are able to trade more tokens than the three that are currently allowed on eToro, it creates an avenue for more people to begin using the platform. This, in turn, translates to higher commission revenue. The current shift in the U.S. crypto regulatory environment, coupled with eToro’s public listing, will also likely draw more institutional investors to the platform. eToro established itself as one of the leading retail trading platforms before expanding to crypto assets in 2013. More recently, the company expanded its digital assets offerings to include “experimental crypto assets”, which it described as a class of digital assets that include meme coins, initial coin offerings and token sales, innovative products, and decentralized finance ((DEFI)) strategies. Memecoins played a big part in the Solana blockchain’s rapid growth over the past two years, helping it recover from the impact of the FTX collapse. Their role in eToro’s growth might be different, but like Assia said, they could still onboard more traders to the market. eToro’s value proposition eToro has established itself as a leading social trading platform, driven by the community. Although a majority of its 3.5 million funded accounts are in Europe and the UK, its listing on the Nasdaq opens up an opportunity to fully grow its footprint in North America. The eToro social trading platform also offers more features than most of its publicly listed competitors, including the ability to follow and copy the trades of expert traders. Tzahi Kanza, CEO of Syndika , a Web3 venture studio and a founders syndicate, also believes eToro has positioned itself strategically at the intersection of retail investing, social trading, and cryptocurrency access. “Unlike traditional brokers, eToro integrates a social feed where users can copy the strategies of top-performing investors, blending education with execution,” Kanza said in a May 16 Q&A interview emailed to me exclusively for this Seeking Alpha article. “Moreover, eToro offers direct exposure to crypto assets alongside equities, ETFs, and commodities, making it one of the few platforms where retail users can build a multi-asset portfolio with a Web3 edge.” For this reason, Kanza also believes eToro’s model is difficult to replicate at scale. Its approach to crypto is now being mirrored by multi-billion dollar companies like Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ), which has rapidly expanded its asset offerings to include cryptocurrencies. This approach — of traditional banks and neobanks/fintech companies integrating crypto services, is gaining traction within the crypto community at a faster rate than when native crypto companies try to integrate traditional financial services. This is primarily because of the strong foundations that mainstream finance companies are built on traditionally, and Hong Yea, co-founder and CEO of GRVT , a licensed on-chain exchange, thinks this could be yet another strong value proposition for eToro, especially now it has gone public. On May 16, in an emailed Q&A interview exclusive for this Seeking Alpha article, Yea said, “As a non-crypto native, Gen Z-focused brand that has progressively and intuitively moved deeper into the crypto ecosystem, eToro has precisely caught the wave of the recent on-chain finance narrative, which is gaining huge momentum, making its IPO particularly attractive.” However, Hong Yea thinks it is still too early to predict whether or not eToro will become one of the main crypto trading companies, offering caution about what happened in the dot-com bubble. “Many companies went public with IPOs [in the dot-com bubble] only to burst afterwards,” Yea added. However, Syndika’s Tzahi Kanza offers a different perspective, one that I happen to share. Last year, crypto became eToro’s biggest revenue contributor with 38% of the total commissions. eToro’s top line has been on a steady rise over the past three years, increasing to $639 million in 2023, up from $632 million in 2022, before spiking to $931 million last year. This is still below the company's $1.23 billion revenue reported in 2021 at the height of the previous crypto boom, which makes a realistic target for 2025 if the current crypto rally continues. Kanza believes the growing impact of crypto on eToro’s revenue is more structural than a one-time anomaly caused by the massive surge in crypto trading activity in the final quarter of the year. “With the cryptocurrency sector expected to outperform other asset classes, I believe its contribution to eToro’s revenue will continue to grow. While competition from pure crypto exchanges will remain intense, many of them lack the multi-asset exposure, social trading layer, and compliance credentials that eToro offers,” Kanza said. If eToro's revenue can hit the 2021 highs this year, that implies a 32% growth. This could be a catalyst for an ETOR price rally, potentially pushing it closer to $90 per share. The stock has already traded above $74 per share since going public last week, again, which means a high $80s valuation is not beyond the realms of reality. As of December 31, 2021, when eToro reported annual revenue of $1.23 billion, the company had 2.4 million funded accounts. The latest filings say it has 3.5 million funded accounts, which is about 45.8% more. The company's assets under administration are also up significantly, rising to $16.6 billion ($12.15 billion crypto), up from $10.7 billion in 2021, approximately 55.7% growth. This again supports the case for higher revenues if trader activity hits 2021 highs. If the current crypto boom generates a similar trading activity in 2021, the 55.7% increase in assets under administration should be able to boost revenue further to about $1.9 billion. That's more than 100% growth potential in top-line overall, which, based on the current ETOR stock valuation of about $5.4 billion on revenue of $931 million, would make a $10.8 billion eToro market cap realistic. eToro’s closest publicly listed peer is Robinhood Markets, which saw its revenue increase by 58% (YoY) to $2.95 billion in 2024. Based on Robinhood’s current valuation of $57.28 billion, the company's market cap is more than 10x eToro's $5.4 billion, yet its 2024 revenue is about 3x eToro's. That leaves a lot of room for the eToro stock price to catch up, thus making a $10 billion market cap realistically achievable. Risks eToro’s revenue last year was hugely impacted by the late surge in crypto trading activity, which was driven by Trump’s election and the hopes that the 45th and 47th President of the United States would usher in a better market for digital assets companies in the U.S. Since then, Trump has appointed a leadership team, widely viewed as ‘crypto-centric’. However, that team, starting with the new SEC chair Paul Atkins, is already being questioned about questionable crypto projects (the TRUMP meme coin) and ties to certain crypto people (Tron blockchain’s Justin Sun). The Crypto and AI task force will have to stand firm and implement Trump’s digital assets vision for the companies trooping into the U.S. crypto market to enjoy success. Furthermore, while the likes of Robinhood, Kraken, and Coinbase have had the SEC withdraw or pause its lawsuits against them, it remains to be seen whether there will be retrospective applications to companies whose cases had already been settled with the securities regulator. Will U.S. traders be allowed to trade more tokens in eToro? Also, unlike Robinhood, which is headquartered in the U.S., it remains to be seen whether eToro will be able to wrestle a significant chunk of the U.S. crypto trading market as a foreign company, even if it is eventually allowed to list more cryptocurrencies. Conclusion eToro’s social trading platform offers a unique approach to crypto trading, enabling even new traders to easily start trading without worrying about the technical terminologies that confuse most novices. Its public listing gives it the aura that comes with companies whose books are routinely scrutinized by regulators, making it a safer place for the risk-averse. It also provides a clearer path to expanding its North American footprint, which will be further boosted by the recent shift to crypto regulation in the U.S. Moreover, while there are genuine potential hurdles that could still mitigate eToro’s growth prospects, its current valuation relative to its closest peer based on last year's revenues suggests there is still room for the ETOR price to go higher.",ETOR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-21 13:35:52

The SEC claimed that they made false and misleading statements about their tokens and raised over $100 million from investors. Unicoin Accused of Violating Securities Laws in Raising Over $100 Million In a complaint filed in the Southern District of New York on May 20, the SEC accused Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, former board chair Maria Moschini, senior vice president and general counsel Richard Devlin and former chief investment officer Alejandro Dominguez of misleading over 5,000 investors about so-called “rights certificates” that conveyed rights to receive Unicoin tokens and stock. “We allege that Unicoin and its executives exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises that its tokens, when issued, would be backed by real-world assets including an international portfolio of valuable real estate holdings,” Mark Cave, associate director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement . “But as we allege, the real estate assets were worth a mere fraction of what the company claimed.” The SEC argued that Unicoin never actually owned the real estate properties it told investors it had purchased, and that those properties’ values were greatly exaggerated. Unicoin allegedly placed ads in airports, taxis, office building elevator screens, and on television programs to lure investors, touting the offerings as the “next generation” secure investments. The complaint further alleges that Unicoin falsely claimed its tokens were registered with the SEC and that it had made $3 billion in sales by June 2024, when it sold just over $110 million in its rights certificates. According to court documents, the SEC is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties against all named defendants, as well as officer-and-director prohibitions for the three senior executives. Devlin agreed to pay a $37,500 civil penalty, without admitting or denying the charges. The lawsuit comes as the SEC, under the new Trump-Vance administration, has dismissed several high-profile crypto enforcement cases, including recent cases against Coinbase , Ripple , Robinhood , and Consensys. These SEC actions are part of a radical change from the hostile regulatory stance adopted by the previous Biden regime.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|SEC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 13:39:13

But in 2025, something unusual is happening—DOGE holders are leaving behind the world of memes and moving toward purpose-driven crypto assets. Their top pick? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a DeFi lending protocol that is rapidly gaining attention with real-world use cases and long-term earning potential. With a price surge to $0.025 in Phase 4, over 10,900 holders, and $8.9 million+ raised, Mutuum Finance is no longer a hidden gem. Analysts now believe MUTM could deliver a 10x return before the year ends, and investors are racing to join before prices rise in the next phase. From memes to meaning: why DOGE holders are switching to utility In the past, DOGE delivered incredible gains—but much of its value was built on internet jokes and speculative trading. With market conditions changing, many investors are now seeking real utility and sustainable growth. Mutuum Finance offers exactly that. It is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets through both pool-based (P2C) and direct peer-to-peer (P2P) models. It stands out in the DeFi space by providing flexible interest rates, a wide variety of supported tokens, and non-custodial control of funds. Unlike meme coins that rely on hype, MUTM holders are rewarded with real passive income, staking opportunities, and exposure to a rapidly growing lending ecosystem. Analyst forecast: MUTM may deliver 10x growth in 2025 Industry experts are feeling confident about the future of Mutuum Finance—and for good reason. The price has already climbed from $0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.025 in Phase 4. That means early investors are already sitting on a 150% return, and the momentum doesn’t seem to be slowing down. That’s already a 2.5x return, and we’re only in Phase 4. With seven more phases ahead, each increasing in price by $0.005, the final presale price will be $0.06. That’s a 500% increase from the Phase 1 price—and once the token hits public exchanges, experts believe the price could climb 10x or more due to growing demand for DeFi lending. For DOGE holders used to unpredictable swings, MUTM offers something far more stable—and potentially more profitable. Utility-Driven Value: What Makes MUTM So Powerful? MUTM isn’t just another token—it powers the entire Mutuum Finance ecosystem. Here’s how MUTM tokens provide real value to users: Mutuum redistributes a portion of its protocol revenue by buying MUTM tokens on the open market and sending them to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This ensures that holders not only benefit from price appreciation but also receive regular token rewards as long-term contributors. When you deposit ETH, DAI, or another asset into Mutuum, you receive mtTokens, which represent your share in the lending pool. These tokens automatically accrue value as borrowers pay interest—so you earn passively without having to trade or manage your position daily. For example, if you deposit $1,000 in ETH and the pool’s utilization stays high, you could generate 8%–12% annually in passive income—much more than just holding a meme coin. By staking mtTokens, you help secure the protocol and unlock dividend rewards. As more users lend and borrow assets on the Mutuum platform, the demand for MUTM tokens rises—creating a natural price appreciation fueled by real utility. Why the fear of missing out is real right now The fear of missing out on Mutuum Finance is very real right now—and here’s why. Early backers who joined in Phase 1 are already up by 150%, with the token now priced at $0.025. As Phase 5 approaches with a price of $0.03, each new round narrows the window for bigger gains. Experts are projecting a potential 10x return once the project goes completely public. With over 10,900 holders already on board and a rapidly growing community, the momentum is undeniable to ignore. Every new phase means paying more for the same number of tokens. If you’re thinking of joining, now is the time—before the lower entry points disappear and early rewards are gone. Meme coins like Dogecoin served their purpose—they brought millions into crypto. But now, the trend is shifting. Investors are demanding value, purpose, and performance. Mutuum Finance checks all the boxes. With an active lending protocol, passive income mechanisms, a growing user base, and built-in demand for its native token, MUTM is positioned as one of the most promising DeFi tokens of 2025. Dogecoin holders are known for taking bold bets—but this time, they’re betting on utility, not memes. With MUTM currently priced at $0.025 and expected to rise to $0.06 in the presale alone, every day of waiting could mean less profit. Whether you’re seeking passive income, real use cases, or simply a smarter long-term play, Mutuum Finance is leading the way. Don’t wait until it’s on every headline. Get in now—while it’s still early.

According to Remi , this exponential growth could see the price of XRP skyrocket to $1,700 per coin between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. His analysis, deeply rooted in historical market behavior, particularly the 2017–2018 cycle, has sparked renewed interest and debate about the long-term potential of XRP as both a digital asset and a critical component of global financial infrastructure. Told everyone months ago… We’re following the 2017-2108 breakout and to expect a 64,000% increase in XRP to a $1700 XRP Q4/Q1 Told everyone conservatively $1200 EOY Overall I’m expecting 80,000%-150,000% increase in XRP this run (if not more) Now you’re seeing it from a… https://t.co/2klSFT1Efm — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 20, 2025 Historical Patterns and Market Outlook The Real Remi Relief draws a compelling parallel between the current XRP price action and its historic breakout during the 2017–2018 bull run. At that time, XRP defied expectations by rising from mere fractions of a dollar to a peak near $3.84—an astronomical gain that positioned it temporarily as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Remi believes XRP is now following a similar trajectory, only with even more dramatic implications due to broader adoption, legal clarity, and a maturing crypto market. Based on this historical framework, Remi sets a conservative price expectation of $1,200 by the end of 2025. However, he remains confident that XRP could ultimately exceed this target and reach between $1,700 and beyond during the next market expansion phase. This translates to an unprecedented price appreciation of between 80,000% to 150,000%, which he describes as both historic and transformative. Legal Clarity and Ripple’s Strategic Positioning One key driver behind Remi’s optimistic forecast is the increasing legal clarity surrounding XRP and its issuer, Ripple Labs. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a landmark ruling in the ongoing SEC v. Ripple case, declaring that XRP is not a security when sold on public exchanges. This judgment was widely celebrated as a legal breakthrough for Ripple and a turning point in the broader regulatory landscape for digital assets. Since then, Ripple has aggressively expanded its presence in the global payments ecosystem. With strategic partnerships spanning financial institutions, central banks, and payment corridors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Ripple is poised to serve as a foundational layer in the future of cross-border settlements. The XRPL’s rapid development—including its native decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT support, and the recent EVM sidechain innovations by Peersyst Technology—further strengthens the case for XRP’s utility and long-term value. Macroeconomic Trends and Institutional Demand Beyond the internal XRP ecosystem, macroeconomic forces and growing institutional interest in blockchain-based solutions contribute to Remi’s bullish thesis. As global economies seek faster, cheaper, and more transparent payment infrastructures, blockchain networks like RippleNet offer a viable alternative to the legacy SWIFT system . Moreover, as central banks continue exploring digital currencies (CBDCs), Ripple’s CBDC platform, built on the XRP Ledger, positions it as a top contender for technological collaboration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional investors are also warming up to the crypto sector, driven by the proliferation of regulated financial instruments like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. While XRP has not yet received similar investment vehicles, the recent legal developments and increasing enterprise usage could change that. Remi suggests that once institutions recognize XRP’s potential as a neutral, bridge asset for global liquidity, demand could surge dramatically, fueling the kind of price explosion he anticipates. Community Reactions and Market Sentiment Remi’s forecast has sparked both excitement and skepticism across the crypto community. While some users dismiss such projections as overly ambitious, others point to past examples, like Bitcoin’s meteoric rise from under $1,000 to $69,000, as evidence that such parabolic moves are not only possible but integral to crypto’s speculative cycles. What sets The Real Remi Relief apart is its detailed comparison of market cycles and unwavering conviction. His call, while extraordinary, echoes a broader sentiment gaining traction among XRP holders: that the asset is significantly undervalued relative to its use case and future potential. As he stated, “History will be made,” capturing the belief that XRP is on the verge of a historic revaluation. The Real Remi Relief’s 64,000% XRP forecast may seem extreme at first glance, but it is underpinned by a confluence of historical data, technological advancements, and improving regulatory clarity. While such predictions should be approached with cautious optimism, they reflect a growing narrative that XRP could play a central role in the next era of digital finance. With market cycles heating up and institutional capital flowing into the space, XRP’s journey toward $1,200—or even $1,700—may no longer be a distant fantasy, but a bold possibility rooted in the convergence of history, technology, and belief.

According to a new report from local news publication MyLondon , Jacob Irwin-Cline from Portland, Oregon, was on a two-day layover when he requested an Uber after leaving The Roxy, a nightclub in Soho, around 1:30 AM on May 9. The 30-year-old former software developer and crypto investor said he was intercepted by a driver who appeared to match the profile displayed in the app and who called out the alias he had saved as his name in the Uber account. Having reportedly later asked the nightclub for CCTV footage of the incident, Irwin-Cline said it was a “dark sedan” that pulled up, and not the Toyota Prius that was listed on his Uber app. “The guy seemed super chill, super nice,” Irwin-Cline narrated. The techie said he accepted a cigarette from the driver and started feeling disoriented shortly afterwards. He believes the cigarette may have been laced with scopolamine, also known as “Devil’s Breath,” a powerful sedative known for causing blackouts while keeping victims conscious. While in a semi-conscious state, Irwin-Cline inadvertently handed over his phone’s passcode and access to his crypto accounts before he was abandoned in a London suburb as the fake taxi driver fled with his phone. “Less Than 1% Chance” Of Recovering Lost Funds After returning to his hostel with the help of a stranger, he discovered his laptop had been wiped remotely, and he was locked out of his digital accounts. He later regained access but realized that roughly $123,000 in crypto had been withdrawn from his wallet, including around $73,000 in XRP tokens and $50,000 in Bitcoin. He reportedly shared screenshots with MyLondon revealing his XRP holdings dropped from $73,000 to under $1,000 and his BTC from $50,000 to less than $10 on that fateful night. Irwin-Cline said he doesn’t think he was targeted beforehand and that instead the assailant got “lucky” that he had some wealth “stored away.” The FBI’s Virtual Assets Unit is investigating the case, though the crypto investor believes there is “less than one per cent chance” of getting his funds back.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|London|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 13:47:50

The announcement officially introduced Pi Network Ventures , a Silicon Valley-style investment initiative that will fund startups building within or integrating with the Pi ecosystem. While the fund represents a bold and strategic pivot towards broader adoption, it was not well received by investors. This can be considered a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” event as the Pi token dropped sharply after the reveal. The fund will prioritize blockchain startups along with those in sectors like fintech, generative AI, e-commerce, and social platforms. The initiative isn’t just about investment capital; it’s about integrating Pi into everyday use cases. According to the Foundation, the fund is designed to deliver strategic value and a long-term impact while favoring businesses that can extend Pi’s reach beyond its core crypto community. Still, not all reactions have been positive. For traders, the lack of immediate token impact was a letdown, as Pi’s price erased much of its early-May rally. However, from a development perspective, the initiative suggests Pi Network is playing the long game by positioning itself to back builders. In an ecosystem increasingly saturated with short-term hype, this signals a deeper commitment to sustainable growth. To better understand what Pi Network Ventures means for developers, users, and the broader community, crypto.news interviewed a Pi Network spokesperson to explore how the fund will be structured, what kinds of projects are likely to be backed, and how the community will play a role in shaping the next chapter of Pi Network’s evolution.

Pi: The Pi earmarked for the initiative comes from the 10% of tokens that are specifically allocated for foundation reserves (more information on Pi supply and tokenomics is available here ). CN: Will the funding be provided in fiat, stablecoins, Pi tokens, other cryptos, or a mix of all? Pi: The initiative is held in Pi and USD. While the investments will generally be denominated in US dollar terms, Pi Network Ventures will seek to make the majority of its investments directly in the form of Pi. This means that companies who join the ecosystem will receive investments in the very currency that their businesses [transact in and] will help to strengthen and grow. CN: Who will be making the investment decisions for Pi Network Ventures and what role or titles will the Pi Core Team hold? Pi: Pi Network Ventures is an investment pool established through Pi Foundation, an ownerless organization created to guide the long-term development of the Pi ecosystem and ensure the sustainability and greater good of the network for generations to come. CN: How will Pi Network Ventures deploy the $100 million? Is there an investment timeline or cap per deal, or is it a more flexible, rolling deployment that will be allocated as opportunities arise? Pi: Pi Network Ventures’ investments are intended to provide both capital and strategic value over a broader timeframe to those companies believed to be best positioned to create value in the world and seeks to help companies provide additional ways to use Pi worldwide. Pi Network Ventures may make investments over time and from time to time, and may discontinue investing at any point in time. CN: If Pi Foundation is taking a VC approach to its investing, how will it differ from traditional venture capital? Pi: Companies that Pi Network Ventures may invest in will gain something incredibly rare in crypto and in traditional venture capital: the funds come with access to the market—potentially addressing two of the essential components of building startups. Portfolio companies will have the opportunity to access a sizable, active, and KYC-verified userbase with tens of millions of users of Pi Network across 200+ countries and regions, with over 19 million already identity-verified through Pi KYC. CN: What are the criteria and process for selecting startups to receive Pi Network Ventures funding? Does a project have to be built exclusively on the Pi blockchain or is simply integrating Pi in some way (i.e accepting Pi as payment) sufficient? Pi: More details on criteria and process will be released later. But the initial factor to be considered is whether a startup or business is innovative and creates value for the world or not, and whether there is a strong team to make that happen. Thereafter, Pi Network Ventures will evaluate whether the business can help expand Pi’s utility and contribute to the ecosystem. Specific requirements will be included in future announcements. CN: What expertise or safeguards are in place to make sure $100M is allocated wisely and not just to well-intentioned but unviable projects? Pi: Pi Network Ventures’ investment processes will seek to mirror common practices utilized by traditional Silicon Valley venture capital firms, in sourcing, selection, vetting processes and more, designed to identify and support high-impact and disruptive startups and businesses. Note that Pi Network Ventures’ investments are intended to provide both capital and strategic value over a broader timeframe to those believed to be best positioned to create value in the world and help provide additional ways to use Pi worldwide. Pi Foundation is not obligated to invest the entire $100M, based on the quality of applicants and number of startups accepted into the initiative. Pi Network Ventures may make investments over time and from time to time, and may discontinue investing at any point in time. CN: Are there any particular sectors or use cases you are prioritizing for investment? Pi: While blockchain-native startups will certainly be part of the portfolio, Pi Network Ventures’ investments will also focus heavily on general technology sectors, including generative AI and AI applications, FinTech, embedded payments, ecommerce platforms, marketplaces, social networks and real-world consumer and enterprise applications. From a global ecommerce platform that accepts Pi, to an AI-enabled service that leverages Pi for access or credits, to a traditional business integrating Pi into its loyalty program—if a company can drive real-world utility and ecosystem progress, the Pi Foundation plans to explore investment opportunities to support it. CN: Pi Network Ventures has the objective to “boost Pi utility”. How do you see that happening in practice? Pi: As more businesses accept Pi and integrate it into real-world applications—products, services, transactions, and experiences—users will be able to use Pi in more diverse ways. When businesses adopt Pi, they introduce it to new users and use cases. This creates natural growth while keeping usage aligned with real activity and utility, which creates a stronger ecosystem. A stronger ecosystem means more opportunities for Pi users to participate—as users, builders, workers, and entrepreneurs. Will you be providing mentorship, networking, etc? Pi: Mentorship and developer support programs have continued from the Enclosed Network period to present – see earlier answer. Pi Network Ventures is part of Pi’s diverse strategies to boost utility and empower the Pi ecosystem: high-signal investment and incubation working in parallel with grass-roots utility and ecosystem movements. While high-signal investment and incubation typically target and support a limited number of high-quality startups and businesses based on selective criteria, grass-roots movements can leverage the existing community of Pi and potentially generate a larger quantity of attempts for utility at scale. Pi employs both strategies. Pi Network Ventures belongs to the former strategy, while measures like hackathons and any other platform that scales utility building are under the latter strategy. CN: What role will the Pi community have in Pi Network Ventures? For example, would you consider incorporating community feedback in selecting which products get funded, or perhaps allow users to beta test products from these startups? Pi: Pi Network has always had decentralized input in developer and project selection in the past. This has occurred in the Pi app called Brainstorm which is accessible through Pi Browser where Pioneers provide their input on projects through multiple blind reviews or evaluations in the app, which help remove noises and surface better projects. Their review results led to candidates of many hackathon winners in the past. As for more specific integration of community feedback in the selection process for Pi Network Ventures, stay tuned for future details. CN: How does Pi Network Ventures fit into Pi Network’s long-term vision? How will this venture fund shape Pi’s roadmap for the future and what a mature Pi economy might look like if the plan succeeds. Pi: This initiative enables more of the world’s production onto Pi Network. It’s meant to get more real-world production processes, whether in the form of apps, transactions or companies, onto Pi by investing early on in startups and companies that create such processes. This moment marks a pivotal step forward for Pi—especially now that Open Network has launched and external connectivity is enabled—opening the door to more impactful utility creation and real-world integration. By investing in startups and businesses, many of which build, integrate, and innovate with Pi, and bring real-world utility to the network, Pi Network Ventures is laying the groundwork for a decentralized ecosystem that is globally accessible, community-driven, and economically meaningful.",Interviews|News|funding|Pi Network|Venture Capital,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-21 13:48:02

Both $ETH and $SUI are analysed. $ETH breaks out of falling wedge Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $ETH displays the big surge out from the 5-month long descending trendline. Once the local high was made at $2,700, the price action started to form a descending wedge, which is a bullish pattern. Having just broken out of this wedge, the price is currently consolidating, and may just head down to confirm the top of the wedge again, and the very strong support at $2,500, before heading higher. $ETH ready to break upwards from critical $2,500 horizontal support Source: TradingView The weekly time frame gives more of a clear-cut view of the situation for $ETH. The $2,500 could be about to become that extremely strong support level that $ETH bulls can use as a base for the next surge higher. The last swing high at $4,100 is the target. Failure to get above this would mean a failed rally, therefore making $2,500 into critical support is an absolute must. $SUI about to break out of second successive bull flag Source: TradingView Since breaking beyond its own major descending trendline, the $SUI price is now in its second bull flag. A breakout of this current bull flag would likely provide the impetus to also break through the $4.10 horizontal resistance level. $SUI $4.10 resistance key to all-time high Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame, the significance of the $4.10 resistance can be really appreciated. A break through this level, and consolidation above, would leave the path open for the bulls to make an assault on the $5.36 all-time high.

The project is built on the Binance Smart Chain, boasting fast transactions and zero trading fees. Over 9000+ members have joined the endeavor, working steadily towards the development team’s set goal of 10,000 members. According to official reports , the first phase is intended to attract and reward early adopters, with elements in place to encourage user participation. $25 Buy-In Leads to Shareable Referral Code In a bid to encourage wider use, the project has embraced a $25 buy-in entry point. Upon spending this minimum to buy $KOPS tokens, an automatic referral code is generated. Any future purchase with that referral code will reward the first member. Referral mechanism is the foundation for KOPS’ viral expansion plan and brings natural value to initial community members. The team has mentioned that this model is a means to reward activity without resorting to such measures as normal advertisement. The scheme also indicates that the team is keen on not letting bot activity get in the way, so all interactions are real. This anti-spam approach is supported by a closed-access policy. Participants must join the official Telegram community to access essential elements, including referral tools and contest entry requirements. UGC Contest Offers 85M KOPS of Incentives To once more boost engagement , the team has launched an 85 million $KOPS valued user-generated content (UGC) contest. Users can post memes, videos, or thread-based content to compete for various tiers of rewards. The top content creator will receive 20 million $KOPS, the second and third creators will receive 10 million and 5 million, respectively. In addition to this, 30 million tokens will also be distributed among 20 up-and-coming creators. Another 5 million will be awarded through community voting, and 15 million tokens are reserved for unique, funny, or viral entries. This format encourages creative freedom, and one quality submission could result in a substantial token reward. However, every contestant must first complete an official entry form before submitting content. All valid submissions must be posted under the designated UGC Contest Topic within the Telegram group. Any entries posted elsewhere will not be considered. After submitting the entry form, each participant receives a KOPS Profile Card delivered to their provided Telegram username. Early Participation Aligned with Platform Development Strategy The contest will run for 30 days, and early participants are encouraged to make strategic submissions. This move is aligned with an overall strategy by the development team to organically grow and gain momentum in a competitive memecoin market. Despite overall market tough times, the $KOPS project continues to grow, with an identified target user and community development in progress. UGC contest and referral system each support the other to give multiple points of interaction. Overall, users sign up and invite their friends, or post for the contest, and the community develops through direct interaction. Meanwhile, the fact that tools are only accessible by being part of the official Telegram community keeps the users involved and informed throughout.

(Pi Network Price Prediction),https://cryptonews.com/news/pi-coin-is-down-now-but-could-this-be-the-setup-for-a-100-moonshot-pi-network-price-prediction/,"The Pi Network price has jumped by 9% in the past 24 hours, climbing to $0.798 as the crypto market as a whole falls by 1% today. Despite this rally, PI remains down by 33% in a week, although it holds on to a 37.5% increase in a fortnight and a 25% gain in a month. Today has also witnessed a lift in its trading volume, but what’s particularly bullish about PI at the moment is that its indicators have begun bouncing from a bottom. And when combined with attempts to improve Pi Network’s utility, this could be the foundation of big moves for the altcoin . Pi Network Price Prediction – Where is PI Heading Next? Pi Network (PI) is once again flashing strong bullish potential, with its 4-hour chart pointing to a structured path toward a major breakout — and a long-term target that could stretch well beyond $50. Following its breakout from a descending wedge earlier this month, PI has retested and stabilized above previous resistance, now turning that level into solid support. The RSI has climbed back above 56, signaling rising bullish momentum. Meanwhile, volume remains elevated — reinforcing the conviction behind this move. The RSI is trending upward around 56, suggesting that buying pressure is returning. Volume also remains relatively strong, indicating renewed interest from traders following the recent dip. Immediate resistance sits around $1.70, followed by the psychological $3.00 level — both of which acted as key zones during the last spike. A clean break above these levels would likely confirm a fresh uptrend, setting the stage for a more aggressive rally. If momentum continues building and market sentiment remains favorable, the path toward a long-term target between $50 and $100 could begin to take shape in the coming weeks. All signs point to a high-conviction setup with parabolic potential. Notably, some analysts are now also arguing that the Pi Network price has begun a bullish reversal. $PI reversal mode on Next stop 1$ later 1.5 and 2$, #picoin community is too strong and price cheap like this won't last long #PiNetwork2025 $BTC $ETH $SOL #AltcoinSeason pic.twitter.com/XSqpo3pUaF — GEM HUNTER (@TrueGemHunter) May 21, 2025 Of course, in the medium- and long-term, the Pi Network price will depend on various factors, including the coin’s fundamentals and its ability to attract listings on the top exchanges. It has already gone some way to improving its utility in the past week or so, having announced the Pi Network Ventures fund , which has $100 million to spend on new projects building within the PI ecosystem. As for big exchange listings, the Pi community remains hopeful that Binance is nearing the point where it will list the token, with some members even suggesting that the exchange is dropping hints of an incoming listing. Hold up Did you noticed the same. Did Binance just drop a clue? Their latest Facebook post is packed with #Pi symbols coincidence or something BIG brewing? With more than 86% of voters pushing for $PI to be listed on Binance, the community is loud and clear. Could this… pic.twitter.com/J2BhQgYsgr — Justin Wu π (@hackapreneur) May 15, 2025 If PI does receive listings from Binance (not to mention Coinbase, Kraken and other big platforms), then there’s no doubt that the Pi Network price will surge. Assuming that the ongoing tariff situation has simmered down by such a point, PI could easily hit $3 or $4 in a matter of weeks after any such listing. Breakout Potential? This New Presale Altcoin Could Steal the Spotlight This Summer As promising as PI could be if the above does happen, it may not do much if Binance and other exchanges continue to refuse it a listing. In such a scenario, traders may be better off diversifying into newer alts, including into some of the more promising presale coins. One of the most interesting presale tokens right now is MIND of Pepe (MIND) , an AI crypto that has now raised $9.7 million in its ICO, which will end in ten days. Last chance to buy $MIND https://t.co/Co2K02Tpkb pic.twitter.com/DDNkhkf0B6 — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 16, 2025 Running on the Ethereum blockchain, MIND of Pepe has won over investors because of its plans to launch an autonomous AI agent that will interact with the crypto market and produce market advice. It will scan masses of data to provide MIND holders with actionable analysis, while it will also use its insight into prevailing trends to generate its own coins. These coins could become highly successful, and investors can gain early access to them – before they list – by holding MIND. This means that MIND could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up over time. While its sale has only a week and half to go, you can still join it at the MIND of Pepe website , where MIND costs $0.0037515. This is its final presale price, but based on its popularity (e.g. on social media), it could rise far beyond this price once it lists.

What happened to Jacob Irwin-Cline sounds like a Black Mirror meets Web3 episode. The 30-year-old ex-software dev from Portland built a small fortune investing in Bitcoin as a teenager. On a short layover in London before visiting his parents in Spain, he went out for drinks in The Roxy nightclub in Soho. He called an Uber around 1:30 AM on May 9 to return to his hostel. Outside, a driver flagged him down, knowing his name, and matched the photo shown in the app. So he got in, but the car didn’t match the app, which was supposed to be the first red flag. Fake Uber driver drains tourist’s crypto wallets As per a report, the driver offered him a cigarette. At first, Jacob said no, but relented, “Sure, if you want to bond over a cigarette.” It is believed that the cigarette was laced with scopolamine, a drug so dangerous that even Vice once called it “the world’s scariest.” Jacob started fading in and out, and the driver asked for his phone “for directions.” He got confused and gave it along with the passcodes. He vaguely recalls the driver scrolling through apps. By the time he realized what was happening, it was already too late. The driver accessed his crypto apps, including Revolut and reportedly drained everything. He woke up in a random London suburb where a stranger called him a cab back to his hostel. He finally grabbed his laptop to find out that it had been remotely wiped. Jacob said, “They took the majority of my wealth,” and believes there’s “less than a 1% chance” of recovery. Authorities confirmed the attacker accessed his wallets through Revolut , using a forced login. Jacob’s losses included $72,000 in XRP, around $50,000 in Bitcoin, and a handful of smaller altcoin positions. Altogether, $123,000 vanished, his life savings, built from teenage Bitcoin investments, drained in minutes. London crypto heist The attack fits the definition of a “wrench attack,” where no hacking is needed. Just physical coercion, social engineering, and in this case, a sedative. Jacob doesn’t believe he was targeted for his wealth. He thinks the thief got lucky. Jacob says he has a good idea where the stolen crypto ended up—but without insurance, and with most of it in cold wallets, recovery is “virtually impossible.” He’s now working with the FBI’s Virtual Assets Unit. Jacob is an early crypto investor. “I was investing in crypto before anyone. I was really into it in high school before Bitcoin was $1,000,” he added. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $106,576 with a trading volume of $54 billion. BTC knocked off its all-time high (ATH) of above $109K on January 20, 2025. It holds a market cap of around $2.11 trillion. On the other hand, XRP price has seen its biggest rally after Ripple bagged a partial win in the legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP is trading at an average price of $2.34 as of press time.

33767162,[object Object],1747835856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,One of the Best Presales of 2025 Ends in 26 Days; Solaxy Raises $38M,https://bitcoinist.com/solaxy-raises-38b-as-one-of-the-best-presales-of-2025/,"Solaxy ($SOLX), one of the best presales of 2025, is set to end in 26 days. It’s had an impressive run, having already raised over $38M since its start. With over $500K pouring in after the deadline announcement yesterday, investors are racing to grab $SOLX at its current presale price of $0.00173 before it lists on exchanges. The project is set to revolutionize Solana by tackling the main issues that plague the ecosystem: slow and failed transactions, downtime during peak times, and high fees. The upgrade couldn’t come at a better time. Solana’s ecosystem is booming – its total value locked (TVL) has hit $9.1B , outstripping Ethereum’s top Layer-2s like Arbitrum and Optimism. Staking also highlights confidence in Solana, with $65B $SOL staked. However, while Solana grows, so do its challenges, and Solaxy is here to fix them. $SOLX is both one of the most promising meme coins and a utility-imbued token that allows for high-speed and low-cost transactions within Solana’s ecosystem. It’s perfectly timed for a buzzing market – Solana-based tokens like $WIF ( 138% ) and $BONK ( 63% ) have soared in the last month. What Solaxy Aims to Achieve According to the whitepaper , Solaxy ($SOLX) is the next evolution of Solana – its first Layer-2 – implementing several innovative technologies to enhance scalability: Roll-Up protocol : Reduces network congestion by bundling transactions to speed up the on-chain validation process. Modular infrastructure : Offers developers flexibility with plug-and-play tools for custom dApps, ideal for gaming, DeFi, and meme coin platforms. Off-chain processing : Allows for infinite scalability and faster transactions without compromising Solana’s functionality or security. Long-term, Solaxy showcases clear potential applications, especially for high-frequency dApps like gaming ecosystems – Solana already captures 50% of gaming fees with 1M daily active users in Q1 12025 – meme coin platforms like Pump.fun. Its cross-chain bridge with Ethereum even further boosts its interoperability and skyrockets its versatility. Is Solaxy One of the Best Presales of 2025? As of right now, Solaxy is clearly one of the best presales and one of the most promising new crypto projects , and the stats speak for themselves: $38.7M raised since its start with a token price of $0.00173 A token pool of 138B, 11B staked, with a dynamic APY of 104% 4,377 $SOLX per $ETH as rewards A clear roadmap with several milestones and constant upgrades The tokenomics distribution is fair, designed to fuel the ecosystem in the charts post-launch: Treasury: 20% (27.6B) Development: 30% (41.41B) Marketing: 15% (20.7B) Rewards: 25% (34.51B) Exchange liquidity: 10% (13.8B) More importantly, the devs work on updating and polishing the project constantly, posting regular updates with the newly-implemented features like the Testnet Bridge for smoother and faster transactions. Then there’s the Igniter Protocol (announced May 19), a no-code token launchpad for holders of $SOLX to create their own tokens, fueling the ecosystem’s decentralized economy. It’s Not Too Late to Join The Solaxy Presale These are the latest in a long series of updates that keep pushing Solaxy to new heights as the launch day approaches. Even though the presale is nearing its end, you can still join to reap the benefits, as our analysts believe that the token will rally in the long run. According to our official Solaxy 2025–2030 price prediction , we expect $SOLX to reach a $0.2 price point by the end of 2026. This translates to a wealth-producing percentage boom of over 12,400%. Short-term, $SOLX should experience a solid 2025 run, as our analysts envision a 3,100% growth by this year’s end.

At $167, SOL is now down by 6.5% in a week, but the alt remains up by 13% in a fortnight and by 20% in a month. And while yesterday’s news may come as a disappointment for some holders, for others it wasn’t surprising, with the SEC still having a final deadline in October for most of the ETFs. Given Solana’s stature as the second-biggest layer-one after Ethereum, it has every chance of witnessing ETF approvals later in the year, something which could send its long-term price prediction sky high. Solana Price Prediction: ETF Delays Raise Red Flags – Is a Drop Below $100 Coming? It’s not the first time that the SEC has delayed making a decision on spot-based Solana ETFs, with the regulator doing the same back in March . This is why yesterday’s delay has not had a particularly negative impact on Solana’s price, which is actually more than 40% up where it was on March 11, when the SEC delayed decisions on the 21Shares, Canary and VanEck Solana ETFs. SEC just delayed ALL Solana ETF applications from Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary, citing market manipulation concerns. They're ""instituting proceedings"" to review if the SOL ETFs meet Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) standards for investor protection. pic.twitter.com/IxGPjWfC0a — NeomaVentures (@NeomaVentures) May 20, 2025 This time, the SEC has added the Bitwise Solana ETF to the above list of re-delays, following last week’s delay for the Grayscale SOL ETF . It’s entirely arguable that such delays are routine, given that the regulator dragged its feet for years on Bitcoin ETFs, before approving the first batch last year. As such, Solana holders needn’t be too concerned, with the coin’s chart today showing that the coin remains on an upwards curve. Its relative strength index (purple) has been climbing since early April, and given how long it was below 50, it still has time to remain in an elevated, bullish position. Source: TradingView Indeed, SOL’s 30-day average (orange) also points to ongoing gains, seeing as how it’s about to climb over the 20-day (blue) and form a golden cross. We could therefore see several more weeks of sustained rallies for the Solana price, despite the SEC delaying over ETFs. This is partly because the market as a whole is recovering in the face of an improved tariff situation, but also because Solana remains one of the strongest alts in the market in terms of fundamentals. It boasts a total value locked of $9.2 billion , making it the second-biggest layer-one network in the crypto ecosystem. The Solana price could therefore reach $200 in the next few weeks, before topping $300 by Q4. A New Solana-Based Token for Big Gains Solana has also been the home of several hugely successful meme tokens in the past year or so, yet there’s one new Solana-based token that will bring rock-solid fundamentals when it launches in the next month. This is Solaxy (SOLX) , which has the distinction of being Solana’s first layer-two network. SOLX has raised $38.5 million in its presale, which will now end in 26 days. We’re going interstellar! 38M Raised! pic.twitter.com/udfUBJ0GBC — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 20, 2025 This figure makes Solaxy’s sale one of the biggest of the past few years, while another sign of its popularity comes from its follower count on X , which now numbers over 75,000. This suggests that Solaxy has plenty of momentum behind it, with the platform promising to provide ultra-low transaction fees and ultra-fast confirmation times once it launches. It will enable traders to avoid the delays and congestion that can still affect Solana, even after recent upgrades. It will also provide instant bridging between itself and Solana, making for a seamless experience for traders and DeFi users alike. Holders of SOLX will also be able to stake the token for passive income, and given that you will need SOLX to pay for Solaxy’s transaction fees, demand for the token could be very high. You can still buy it as part of its presale at the Solaxy website , where it now costs $0.00173. As noted above, the sale will end in 26 days, at which point the token will list on exchanges, and potentially rally.

According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa. Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and Webacy Crypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds. The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million. Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them? Web2 security in a Web3 world Trugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added: “Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“ The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.” Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacks The machine learning approach O’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output. In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction. O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“ Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-21 14:00:55

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said he did not like Bitcoin but understood that customers deserve the right to choose which assets they invest in. The remarks by Dimon come at a JPMorgan investor day event, which aims to promote the bank and champion its progress. JPMorgan has a market cap of $740 billion, making it the largest bank in the world. JPMorgan manages over $4 trillion in assets, adding to its reputation and pride when dealing with investment preferences. Dimon has a history of disparaging Bitcoin, calling it a fraud , and during a Senate hearing with Elizabeth Warren, saying that he would close it down if he were in charge . Such statements, however, could not stop the tide of history, with many investors demanding that JPMorgan let them buy Bitcoin. Despite its CEO disparaging Bitcoin, JPMorgan will release a managed fund for Bitcoin investors. JPMorgan will actively manage the fund, but will not maintain custody of a Bitcoin wallet. The mega bank seems to be the least likely institution to embrace Bitcoin, given the comments made by its CEO. The new Bitcoin fund will be released this summer. The custody of cryptocurrencies will be outsourced to NYDIG, a crypto company. JPMorgan will actively manage the Bitcoin fund, a new development because many fund managers like Pantera Capital allow clients to invest in Bitcoin without handling it themselves. Dimon has been very vocal about his criticism of Bitcoin, even going so far as to say that he would fire any JPMorgan employee who traded the digital asset. He said that the act of trading Bitcoin was “stupid” and noted that Bitcoin has no “intrinsic value”, which most likely refers to the fact that Bitcoin doesn’t have cash flows. However, Bitcoin is an unprecedented financial innovation. Dimon also said that criminals use Bitcoin. However, fiat currency is still the preferred medium for crime. JPMorgan, meanwhile, is investing in blockchain technology, executing its first transaction on a public blockchain last week. Dimon, meanwhile, is more concerned about the economy. He says that the risk of stagflation is most likely two times the amount factored in by the market. Dimon believes that stagflation will cause many problems for banks and companies. Dimon has both positive and negative things to say about Trump’s administration. He praises regulatory efforts and states that there is a clear motive to fix problems in that area. But he also points out that JPMorgan has lost a lot of business due to Trump’s tariff war. Dimon seems to flip-flop on his attitude towards Bitcoin. The JPMorgan CEO said he thinks blockchain is overrated and less important than people think. This recent statement during his speech this week contrasts with his previous comments about blockchain, where he has treated blockchain innovation separately from Bitcoin and even supported practical blockchain projects. Regardless of Dimon’s remarks, JPMorgan ran its first transaction on a public blockchain last week and has its own blockchain-based JPM coin.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|JPMorgan,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 14:00:59

Key technical signals point to strong bullish momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the verge of making history again as it approaches a new all-time high. After months of bearish structure defined by the 21 EMA, a major shift has taken place. A recent breakout above this level flipped market sentiment, creating a strong foundation for higher prices. With the price structure now showing clear signs of strength, a new ATH could be just around the corner, potentially within the week. Key technical points 21 EMA Flip: The 21 exponential moving average, which previously acted as resistance, is now confirmed support. Bullish Market Structure: Bitcoin has formed consistent higher highs and higher lows. Key Support Level: $102,790 is the critical support to maintain current bullish momentum. BTCUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Following the previous all-time high, Bitcoin entered a corrective phase, where price action was consistently rejected at the 21 EMA. This moving average defined the bearish structure, acting as dynamic resistance and leading to repeated pullbacks. However, once the swing low was established at $74,448, a significant surge in volume triggered a strong bullish reaction. This breakout was marked by bullish engulfing candles and a clear flip of the 21 EMA into support, a technical event that signaled the end of the bearish trend. Since then, Bitcoin has continued to respect the 21 EMA, bouncing off it to form new higher highs and higher lows, the textbook definition of a bullish market structure. The shift in momentum has also been supported by an uptick in trading volume and positive funding rates across major derivatives exchanges. These metrics reflect growing confidence among market participants, suggesting that institutional and retail investors alike are positioning for further upside as Bitcoin approaches price discovery territory.

As long as Bitcoin holds above this support, the upward trend remains intact. The consistency in structure and momentum suggests that a new ATH is not just possible but likely, especially with only 3% separating price from its previous peak. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin maintains support at $102,790, a breakout to new all-time highs could occur as early as this week. The strong bullish market structure and momentum-driven rally suggest that buyers are in control, and the stage is set for continued upside.

Wall Street’s biggest regulator said in Tuesday filings that it had extended its review period for the 21Shares Core XRP Trust, the Grayscale XRP Trust, and the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. The SEC suspended the original May 21-22 decision deadlines to further examine whether the proposals satisfy Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) requirements for preventing fraud and protecting investors. Cboe and NYSE, where the 21Shares and Grayscale funds would be listed, respectively, submitted their requests for rule changes earlier this year. The 21Shares Core XRP Trust plans to track the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, with Coinbase Custody providing storage for the assets. Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust would track CoinDesk’s Dogecoin Price Index, while its XRP Trust would follow CoinDesk’s XRP Price Index. Dogecoin is the world’s oldest and largest memecoin, with a market capitalization of around $33.7 billion as of May 21, according to data from CoinGecko. XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger blockchain network. It has a market capitalization of approximately $138 billion, CoinGecko data shows. “Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change,” the SEC wrote. Delays Are Expected The SEC has postponed decisions on a bevy of crypto ETF proposals in recent months as it mulls dozens of proposals, despite the Commission under the Trump administration adopting a friendlier approach to digital assets. Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the SEC has dismissed several enforcement cases against crypto firms, and the commission’s crypto task force has met with reps of several companies in recent months as part of efforts to explore potential changes to digital asset regulation. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, SEC delays on spot crypto ETFs are to be expected. “If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — I wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at the absolute earliest. More likely to be in early Q4,” Seyffart wrote in a May 20 post on X. Seyffart pointed out that the SEC usually takes advantage of the full time allotted to respond, no matter who is in charge at the SEC. “Almost all of these filings have final due dates in October. Early decisions would the action that’s out of the norm. No matter how ‘Crypto-friendly’ this SEC is. There’s no conspiracy here. lol,” Seyffart opined.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 14:07:43
