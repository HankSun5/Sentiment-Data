Over the past several weeks, major Ethereum holders known as whales have significantly increased their positions, indicating strong conviction in the asset‚Äôs future. These whales, each holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH, have been aggressively accumulating since mid-April, just as Ethereum‚Äôs price began a steep climb. This pattern, alongside key technical signals, is raising expectations of a longer-term bullish phase. Whale Accumulation Aligns with Price Breakouts According to analyst Crypto Rover, large Ethereum wallets added over 1.4 million ETH between mid-April and mid-May. Their holdings grew from 15.8 million to more than 17.2 million ETH. This accumulation period closely matches Ethereum‚Äôs price rally from around $1,600 to over $3,100.

But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there‚Äôs even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE üî•#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakoutüíπ The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs ‚Äî Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it‚Äôs still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn‚Äôt spiked yet, so the setup isn‚Äôt sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There‚Äôs no way I couldn‚Äôt take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv ‚Äî Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a ‚Äútwofold rally‚Äù from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That‚Äôs about 114% higher. He‚Äôs confident there‚Äôs ‚Äúno way you won‚Äôt take a Dogecoin trade‚Äù if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week‚Äôs gains. Wujastyk‚Äôs bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge‚Äôs support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‚Äëand‚Äëshoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that‚Äôs capped gains since December‚Äôs $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42‚Äì$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100‚Äì104% jump from today‚Äôs price.

The Commission‚Äôs clarified guidance on compliance mechanisms has sparked renewed confidence among blockchain projects. This regulatory clarity comes on the heels of Asian economic hubs ramping up blockchain adoption to streamline digital identity, finance, and cross-border payments. Within this recalibrated environment, digital finance is shedding its speculative shell and moving toward practical utility. Qubetics , a fast-rising force, is redefining how digital assets interact with real-world economies. As markets reevaluate what defines a ‚Äútop crypto to buy,‚Äù tokens like Qubetics are not merely participating‚Äîthey are steering the transformation. With its distinctive application in real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics has emerged as a consistent favorite when ranking the top crypto to buy. Qubetics ($TICS) has already gained early traction for directly addressing challenges many established protocols have overlooked. These developments make Qubetics one of the top crypto to buy before the crypto presale concludes. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization at the Right Time While the market fixates on transaction speeds and DeFi interoperability, Qubetics is pioneering a more impactful frontier‚ÄîReal World Asset (RWA) Tokenization. This application enables tokenizing tangible assets like real estate, commodities, or financial instruments onto blockchain ledgers. Qubetics stands apart with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a platform built for global businesses, professionals, and even governments seeking compliant asset digitization. Unlike generalized marketplaces, Qubetics creates a bridge between physical and digital economies. The marketplace is designed to: Enable cross-border trade settlements using tokenized invoices Allow professionals to tokenize service contracts and intellectual property Support small enterprises with compliant debt issuance through digital tokens Facilitate real estate-backed stable asset creation By streamlining tokenization through built-in regulatory protocols and an intuitive IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Qubetics makes complex processes accessible to non-technical entities. This leap positions it as the top crypto to buy for those seeking tokenomics rooted in practical value. Qubetics Token Stats Stage: 35th of the ongoing crypto presale Price: $0.2785 per $TICS Total Tokens Sold: 513M+ Holders: 26,700+ Capital Raised: $17.1M+ Analyst ROI Projections $TICS at $1 post-presale = 258% ROI $TICS at $5 = 1694% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 5284% ROI Without relying on speculation, the growth narrative around Qubetics is underpinned by its ongoing adoption, strong economic model, and increasing relevance in global tokenization policy discussions. Aptos to Host Global Pizza Party Meetup in Palo Alto on May 23 to Celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day Aptos, the high-performance Layer 1 blockchain known for its security and scalability, will co-host a meetup with OnePiece Labs in Palo Alto on May 23, 2025, to celebrate the fifth annual Global Pizza Party by PizzaDAO and mark the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day. This event brings together Web3 developers, enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs, highlighting Aptos‚Äô commitment to fostering blockchain innovation and community. Powered by its Move programming language and modular transaction processing model, Aptos continues to push the limits of throughput, transparency, and user safety on the decentralized frontier. Tron Coin Breakout? Whale Activity Explodes After Golden Cross Tron (TRX) has rallied 11% since the golden cross on, where the SMA50 overtook the SMA100, signaling a bullish shift after January‚Äôs bearish death cross. Whale activity surged early May as $1M+ TRX transactions peaked between 07:00‚Äì15:00 UTC‚Äîprime global market hours‚Äîbefore easing off, hinting at a growing influence from retail traders. Despite reduced whale dominance, TRX continues climbing, hovering around $0.27 with strong support at $0.23. However, momentum indicators suggest overbought conditions, raising the potential for a short-term pullback if price dips below the $0.24‚Äì$0.25 range. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters in 2025 The transition from speculative cryptocurrencies to tangible digital assets is accelerating. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is central to this shift. Here‚Äôs why: Asset Liquidity: Real estate, fine art, or debt instruments become instantly tradable Regulatory Alignment: Platforms like Qubetics implement compliance-first token design Economic Access: Enables small and mid-size businesses to raise capital without traditional banking Ownership Proof: Digitally notarized contracts increase legal enforceability Programmability: Smart contracts automate dividend payouts and usage rights With $17.1M raised and over 513M $TICS sold, Qubetics is actively proving that tokenized ownership has moved from theory to implementation. This positions it not just as another blockchain startup, but as a foundational layer for the next stage in global finance. Conclusion: Why These Three Are the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 From Qubetics‚Äô powerful asset tokenization infrastructure to Aptos blockchain ecosystem and Tron‚Äôs mass-market adoption success, these three projects address different layers of blockchain‚Äôs evolution. Their updates, strategic rollouts, and growing traction across sectors reinforce their place as the top crypto to buy in 2025. As blockchain technology enters a new utility-driven era, projects like Qubetics, Aptos, and Tron offer unique propositions tailored to emerging real-world needs.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , the claim came from Olga Tisen, head of the legal department of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring). Warning for Russians: Crypto Exchanges Are Working With Police Tisen was speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, currently underway at the city‚Äôs ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Center. Tisen said that the ‚Äúanonymity of crypto transfers is a myth.‚Äù She claimed that even though Russia has yet to regulate crypto exchanges and brokers, platform operators ‚Äúdisclose all data on the owners of crypto wallets at the request of law enforcement agencies.‚Äù The ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Centre, St. Petersburg. (Source: Ekatekat [CC BY-SA 4.0]) In many other countries, regulation requires crypto exchanges to flag suspicious-looking transactions and report these to anti-money laundering agencies. However, in Russia, crypto exchanges have no legal status and are almost completely unregulated. But Tisen suggested that exchanges are pre-empting future efforts to police the sector. As such, she said, they are ‚Äúopenly admitting‚Äù to sending customer information ‚Äúat the request of law enforcement and government agencies.‚Äù Tisen added that police do not even need court orders to obtain crypto exchange customer data, ‚Äúsince cryptocurrency transactions are not subject to banking privacy protocols.‚Äù The Rosfinmonitoring executive added that ‚Äúall crypto platforms with offices in Russia‚Äù currently ‚Äúinteract with the authorities.‚Äù Tisen added that many platforms openly state on their websites that they interact with Russian law enforcement agencies. She added that this practice ‚Äúcomplies with international standards.‚Äù In addition, Rosfinmonitoring says that it receives data from banks on crypto transactions.

At present, the coin trades between a support level at $0.41 and a resistance level at $1.01, with a broader range from $0.11 to $1.32 also in view. Indicators such as an RSI near 50 suggest neutrality, while mixed oscillator signals indicate caution. Bulls are present, but recent dips warrant trading ideas focused on short-term consolidation within these key levels. Toncoin: Past Trends and Current Opportunities Over the past month, Toncoin experienced a modest gain of nearly 3%, while the past six months showed a significant decline of around 42%. The price movements illustrate a pattern of volatility, with short-term gains failing to compensate for larger losses. This behavior reflects broader market uncertainties and the reactions of investors to external factors, leading to fluctuating sentiment. TON currently trades between $2.55 and $3.99, facing immediate resistance near $4.82 and a support level around $1.94. Recent activity indicates bears are in control, highlighted by a weekly drop of 8.79% and negative momentum indicators. Without a clear long-term trend, traders may consider opportunities between these key levels while remaining cautious of potential downward movements. Raydium Price Snapshot: Mixed Trends and Key Levels in Focus Raydium experienced a 44.13% gain over the past month alongside a 43.62% drop over the last six months. Price activity has been volatile, reflecting rapid rallies and deeper corrections. The past month has shown strong upward movement while the half-year performance highlights significant pullbacks. Trading sentiment has shifted quickly, revealing a market characterized by both aggressive buying and selling phases. Raydium currently trades between $1.73 and $3.50, with resistance at $4.21 and support at $0.68. Price action indicates balanced pressure with hints of bullish strength recently, though the trend remains unclear. Traders might consider entering near support and watching for rejection at resistance to guide short-term decisions. Conclusion EOS , TON , and RAY are showing strong signs of growth. Each offers unique features and benefits. EOS stands out with its quick transaction speeds. TON provides impressive security and privacy. RAY excels with its staking rewards. These coins are gaining serious traction in the market. Staying informed on their progress may be beneficial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

April tariffs triggered global market losses and sharp price increases in US consumer goods. Core inflation eased slightly, but financial analysts and lawmakers warn of long-term economic risks. President Donald Trump claimed the U.S. economy is ‚Äúroaring,‚Äù citing March‚Äôs addition of 228,000 jobs.

In a world rapidly reshaped by artificial intelligence, few think as personally about its impact as Manit Parikh. As the Founder of The Binary Holdings , Manit is at the forefront of building digital infrastructure that blends the best of Web2 and Web3 while embedding AI deeply into product design and user experience. Rather than generic chatbots, TBH's vision is for AI companions to learn each user's tastes, routines, and even moods. This ambition echoes a broader tech trend: one analyst predicts that by 2025, our smartphones will function as full-fledged AI assistants, able to perform complex tasks on our behalf and operate like personal assistants in our pockets.Parikh says TBH will deliver that future in emerging markets by blending AI with the company's vast Web3 distribution network. We sat down with Manit to explore his journey, the genesis of Binary Holdings, and how his team uses AI to create hyperpersonalized, behavior-driven platforms that could redefine digital interaction. Q: Can you share a quick background about yourself and what you've been up to lately? Manit: Thank you so much for having me. I'm an economist and lawyer by education‚Äîturned investment banker, consultant, and entrepreneur. I started Binary Holdings in August 2020. COVID had just hit, my daughter had just been born, and like many people, I was forced into a digital-first life. That's when I decided to channel all the product-building skills I'd picked up over the years and turn my vision into something tangible. Q: Tell us more about Binary Holdings. What was the starting point, and how has it evolved? Manit: Binary Holdings started with a product called Fando‚Äîour OG. It was like TikTok meets Twitter, but designed for sports fans with a loyalty program and marketplace built in. We weren't just building a platform; we were building an economy where users could earn value by engaging. As we grew, Fando became just one part of a larger vision. Today, Binary Holdings is an infrastructure company at the intersection of Web2 and Web3, primarily mobile networks and financial services. We're building verticals that can scale across ecosystems. Q: You've been actively building in AI. Where do you see AI's role in our everyday lives right now? Manit: AI is already embedded in how we live. Think about how we used to use Google‚Äîsifting through thousands of results. Now, a single AI response can give you what you need. Whether you're a student, entrepreneur, or creative, we all use AI, from brainstorming to automating personal tasks. Today, maybe AI handles 20% of our digital workload. In five years, it'll be closer to 60‚Äì70%. Q: Let's talk about your AI companion. You mentioned it's central to your roadmap. Can you elaborate? Manit: Absolutely. We've created a voice-based AI companion that doesn't feel robotic; it's conversational and context-aware. Unlike static voice AIs, we aim to make it feel like a real assistant. It's voice-based, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent. It adapts based on your tone, mood, and preferences. It can play multiple roles‚Äîa therapist, a tutor, a friend, a co-pilot. Take mental health. In the West, you go to therapy. In much of Asia, it's taboo. But what if you could talk to an AI that listens, understands your emotional state, and helps you process your thoughts? We're not trying to replace professionals; instead, we're augmenting the support system. Q: As a builder in the Web3 and AI space, how do you stay ahead of the curve? Manit: I'm not an engineer, but I understand financial and business models. That allows me to integrate AI strategically. We collect massive amounts of behavioral data, not personal data, due to GDPR, but enough to understand patterns. We then use AI to create upstream and downstream' mind maps' of user personas. For example, if you're a fan of LeBron James, we map all related content and products into your digital journey. It's like building an AI around your interests, behavior, and ecosystem. Q: That sounds like serious personalization. Why is hyperpersonalization such a big deal? Manit: Discoverability is the biggest pain point in digital platforms. We can remove that friction by using AI to dynamically change what you see based on your behavior. So instead of you searching, the right product or content finds you. Your screen becomes your mirror. Every time you come back, it's slightly more tuned to you. That's what increases engagement and retention. He chuckles, I genuinely believe we're heading to a point where AI could even know when you're hungry based on patterns, location data, and daily habits. That's where hyperpersonalization is going. Q: What tangible results have you seen from hyperpersonalization so far? Manit: It's incredible that the average time spent on our platforms increased from two or three minutes to almost 10 to 12 minutes daily because of personalization. That's nine additional minutes of engagement. Because people consume more content, they burn through mobile data faster. This means they recharge their plans more frequently, three to four times a month instead of once or twice. This directly translates to increased average revenue per user (ARPU) for our telco and data partners. So now, the partnership makes business sense; it's no longer just a cool tech demo; more so, it's real ROI. Q: What does this mean for users in emerging markets? Manit: Most of our users come from underdeveloped or emerging economies‚Äîmiddle and lower-income groups that make up about 90% of the population. For them, the value they earn through our platforms can feel like a secondary income stream. We take things like going out for dinner or a movie for granted, but for some families, this is a real financial boost. It empowers the already empowered, but more importantly, it uplifts those who live hand-to-mouth. That's meaningful. Q: What are the most untapped opportunities for enterprises with AI right now? Manit: There are three big ones. First, they have their internal data. Many enterprises collect data but don't structure it in sandboxes to study behavior. That's a missed opportunity. Second, AI can help forecast the next five years of their business. It can generate strategic product ideas or analyze competitors, giving product managers a head start and saving the company from investing time and capital in dead ends. Third is true hyper-personalization. Let's take gaming. You buy FIFA, and a million people play the same game. But your PlayStation knows how you play. Why doesn't it adapt the gameplay accordingly? If I'm getting better, the AI should level up, too. This not only enhances user experience but also boosts retention and in-game monetization. Q: AI is powerful but also complex. Given the bureaucratic hurdles enterprises face, how do you see them adopting it? Manit: Great question. Enterprises have their plates full with budget cycles, approvals, and public company disclosures. AI becomes another challenge to stack on top. So when we approach them, we don't ask them to change their entire system. We start a parallel thread about a small integration that proves our value. Then, slowly, they come to us asking what else we can help with. Over 12 to 36 months, our tools become embedded into 95% of their operations, including AI, ML, and automation, all without disrupting their existing ecosystem. Q: With so much happening in AI, what excites you most about the future of AI-native products? Manit: I always say, the AI market isn't a pond‚Äîit's the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans combined. What we're seeing now is just scratching the surface. One use case is driving. Say you're on a night drive and tired. The AI companion activates. You choose your mood: 'educational,' ‚Äòbusiness,' or just 'talk.' Maybe you decide to learn a new language during your commute. Since the AI retains your context and adapts, it's far better than static apps. It's a therapist, a study buddy, and a voice coach‚Äîall in one. But with that growth will come consolidation. We're in a collaborative economy now, not a monopolistic one. If we don't collaborate, we'll all get pulled back. And as AI becomes mainstream, it'll attract regulation, just like crypto did. Regulation will separate the real players from the opportunistic ones. Those who build compliant, ethical AI will scale. The rest? They'll fade. As the digital world leans ever more into AI, Manit Parikh and Binary Holdings are not just following trends but shaping them. With personalization as their north star and infrastructure as their foundation, their vision offers a glimpse into what the next generation of platforms could look like, including intuitive, adaptive, and deeply human.

LINK price has recorded a high correlation with Bitcoin price YTD, which is almost entering a parabolic bullish phase. The gradual Bitcoin (BTC) price rise in the past few weeks, has significantly influenced the wider altcoin market led by Chainlink (LINK). The highly anticipated crypto summer of 2025 has seen the overall capital inflow to the altcoin market experience a sharp uptick. Moreover, an imminent reversal and fall of Bitcoin dominance in the coming months will trigger a sustained altseason, fueled by FOMO traders. Chainlink Network Growth Outlook The Chainlink network has received significant adoption in the past few months amid the mainstream adoption of digital assets and web3 protocols. Furthermore, the Chainlink network enables DeFi protocols to provide reliable services in an interoperable ecosystem. Earlier this week, the Chainlink network announced a strategic integration with the Solana (SOL) network to enable its DeFi ecosystem to access Chainlink‚Äôs CCIP infrastructure.¬†On Tuesday, several DeFi protocols announced a strategic integration with the Chainlink network to access its CCIP infrastructure. Some of the notable integrations include Zeus Network, Liquity Protocol, and Shift RWA. The continued adoption of the Chainlink products by institutional investors has bolstered the LINK token, which is used to reward node operators and data providers. Midterm Targets for LINK Price The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.7 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $604 million, has been attempting to recover from last week‚Äôs 10 per decline. In the daily timeframe, LINK price has established a rising trend since April 9, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. Moreover, the LINK price has already broken out and retested a falling wedge pattern established in the first quarter of 2025. In the four-hour timeframe, LINK price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, coupled with a rising divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . As a result, LINK price is well positioned to rally towards the next short term target around $19.8.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 23:52:27

But while these large-caps fight for renewed upside, one emerging name is gaining traction among serious traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Without needing flashy announcements or trend cycles, it‚Äôs steadily cementing itself as one of the most talked-about contenders in the 2025 lineup ‚Äî and buyers are beginning to realize that this project is built to lead, not chase. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Bold Positioning, Relentless Confidence, and Real Market Presence MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising for one clear reason ‚Äî it refuses to play small. In a sea of short-term meme projects and recycled narratives, this coin is commanding attention through consistent strength, focused branding, and clear long-term potential. Analysts are watching closely as sentiment consolidates around what many now view as a high-conviction opportunity for early entry . It is not just hype ‚Äî it is becoming a headline project with all the traits of a breakout altcoin designed for this cycle, not the last one. Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity and Airdrops Keep Bulls in Control Cardano is showing solid structure on higher timeframes, fueled by whale buying and new layer integrations. With ADA hovering just below key resistance, analysts are forecasting a breakout toward $1.32 ‚Äî assuming the recent momentum continues. Speculation around the upcoming Midnight airdrop is also fueling accumulation. If ADA clears the $0.80 barrier, upside movement could accelerate heading into June. Sui (SUI): Technical Breakout in Play With Strong Ecosystem Support SUI remains a trader favorite in the Layer-1 space, offering clean structure and growing DeFi traction. The token is consolidating near recent highs and is flashing early breakout signals, with analyst targets ranging from $6 to $7.70 . Sui‚Äôs ability to sustain user activity while attracting new DEX protocols makes it one of the more structurally solid plays heading into the second half of Q2. Polkadot (DOT): Undervalued Performer With Cross-Chain Advantage DOT is quietly climbing back into view, with multi-chain interoperability and renewed builder interest supporting its rise. Currently trending under key resistance, price targets for this quarter range from $1.05 to $1.30 . If market sentiment shifts in favor of legacy Layer-1s, DOT could reprice quickly ‚Äî especially with increased attention on cross-chain infrastructure and parachain expansion. Final Thoughts Cardano is climbing on whales and incentives. Sui is technically primed and DeFi-proven. Polkadot is setting up as the quiet Layer-1 rotation pick. But while all three fight to reclaim past highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is defining its own lane ‚Äî and rapidly becoming one of the most confident altcoin bets of the year . In a market overflowing with short-lived speculation, this project is shaping up to be the coin built for staying power ‚Äî and more investors are beginning to treat it that way.

While established players like Monero (XMR) keep their privacy edge and meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) catch attention with quick price surges, newer projects are focused on creating lasting value. Web3 ai stands apart by offering a clear, structured roadmap for growth, aligning product development with investor opportunities. With upcoming releases for AI tools, mobile integration, and exchange listings, Web3 ai offers something unique. For those on the lookout for high-return crypto investments, this project presents an exciting, timely opportunity. What Could Push Web3 ai to the $1 Mark? Web3 ai is quickly becoming a top contender for the best crypto investment in 2025, and its momentum is impossible to ignore. With more than $4.3 million raised in just a matter of days, it‚Äôs clear that investors are already catching on. Currently in presale stage 5 at $0.000365 per token, the presale price will soon rise to $0.005242, meaning early investors could see returns of up to 1,747% before $WAI even hits public exchanges. What‚Äôs fueling the buzz? It‚Äôs not just the numbers, it‚Äôs the impressive roadmap Web3 ai has laid out. The team is rolling out a suite of powerful tools, including an AI trading assistant, ROI prediction engine, staking dashboards, and cross-platform API integrations. Plus, a mobile app is already in the works and is set for release just months after launch. But that‚Äôs not all, wallet and social media integrations, developer SDK access, and even plans for centralised exchange listings are on the horizon. As each milestone is hit, the demand for $WAI only grows, driving up the token‚Äôs utility and value. With a capped supply and a rapidly climbing presale price, the window of opportunity is shrinking fast. For those who want to maximise returns in 2025, now is the time to act before this presale phase ends. Monero‚Äôs Unmatched Privacy: A 2025 Standout Monero (XMR) continues to lead the charge when it comes to privacy in the crypto space. Thanks to its use of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions, Monero ensures total anonymity for users, from who‚Äôs sending the funds to who‚Äôs receiving them, and even the transaction amounts. This unwavering commitment to privacy has earned Monero a strong following among those who prioritise financial confidentiality. As concerns around surveillance and financial tracking continue to rise, Monero‚Äôs privacy-first approach is more relevant than ever. It‚Äôs not just about concealing identities; it‚Äôs about making it nearly impossible to trace any transactions. This has kept the interest high among users who want complete control over their financial history. With the growing importance of data protection, Monero‚Äôs privacy isn‚Äôt just an added feature; it‚Äôs a core principle driving its adoption. While other projects dabble with partial privacy, Monero delivers full anonymity by default, giving users exactly what they want: total transactional privacy. What‚Äôs Next After SHIB‚Äôs Gain? Shiba Inu (SHIB) recorded an impressive 14.48% jump this week, marking its best performance since late 2024. This surge came after a period of consolidation where SHIB found solid support at the $0.00001107 level. As buyers regained confidence, momentum picked up, and the token ended the week around $0.00001417. This upward trend indicates a shift in market sentiment and growing interest from investors. However, despite this recent gain, SHIB is still below its previous peak of $0.0000297, leaving plenty of room for potential growth. The next key resistance level to watch is around $0.00001698, which traders are eyeing closely. If SHIB can maintain this momentum, with rising trading volume and continued buyer interest, there‚Äôs a real chance the token could build on this positive trend in the coming weeks. All signs point to a recovery, and SHIB‚Äôs potential for further gains remains strong. Final Thoughts In a crypto landscape where trends come and go, true progress stands out. Monero (XMR) maintains its dominance in privacy, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows how market sentiment can fuel huge gains. But Web3 ai is carving its path, offering a solid, utility-driven roadmap with clear milestones. With a range of AI tools, a mobile app launch, and potential exchange listings lined up, Web3 ai is building a strong foundation before any major price jumps.

Notably, this marks the second time Bitcoin has rejected around $107,000 in the past few days. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin managed to close last week‚Äôs candle above a key resistance level that had capped its price action for weeks. This close, recorded just above the red horizontal line at $103,000, has introduced confidence in the continuation of the uptrend, and points to the bulls still in control of Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. Bitcoin Weekly Closes Above Range ‚Äì First Bullish Step Current Bitcoin price action shows that bullish investors and buyers are still controlling the momentum behind the largest cryptocurrency and, in essence, the rest of the crypto market. Notably, Bitcoin initially experienced a brief surge to nearly $107,000 over the weekend before retreating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top This price movement was followed by a dip to around $102,000, with the back-and-forth most likely being influenced by factors such as Moody‚Äôs downgrade of U.S. debt and investor reactions to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, in an interesting note, the BTC price managed to close above the $103,000 range during this first move to $107,000, which is very important in terms of technical analysis going forward. This sentiment is echoed by crypto analyst Rekt Capital on social media platform X, who pointed out the next step that might play out for Bitcoin. Post-Breakout Retest Underway, Says Rekt Capital The $104,000 price level had previously acted as a stubborn ceiling throughout much of the recent Bitcoin price consolidation between $102,000 and $104,000 since May 9. However, since breaking above this level, the ensuing price action has seen the Bitcoin price retracing towards this level after another rejection at $107,000. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 ‚Äì Here‚Äôs What It‚Äôs Saying Now According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the dip following the $107,000 rejection isn‚Äôt necessarily bearish. Instead, it could be part of a post-breakout retest, a pattern often seen in strong bullish structures. If this retest successfully confirms the former resistance as new support, BTC¬†could set the stage for a breakout into fresh all-time highs. As shown in the 1W Bitcoin price chart above, the red resistance level is very close to Bitcoin‚Äôs January 2025 all-time high around $108,780. Furthermore, the chart shows that the recent breakout above the $90,000‚Äì$103,000 zone appears to mirror a pattern of Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout after a consolidation move, after another bounce from a low. In this case, the bounce occurred at the $75,000 low in early April. If Bitcoin does rebound with enough trading volume around $104,000, this could provide the much-needed momentum for a move above $107,000 and finally above $108,700 again. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,555, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart. The bearish reversal signal suggests that bullish momentum is waning even though an asset‚Äôs price is moving higher or sideways. Says Bluntz, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a daily BTC bear div brewing here if it closes red by [today]. It‚Äôs unfortunate that it has appeared before fresh all-time highs, but it‚Äôs the first one since last year. Be careful with longs in my opinion.‚Äù Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,546. Turning to gold, the analyst believes that the precious metal is poised to ignite a rally to a new all-time high after completing an ABC corrective wave. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states a bullish asset will continue its uptrend after an ABC correction. The trader shares a chart suggesting that gold will rally to a new record high of $3,600. ‚ÄúGold gathering steam for the next leg up here.‚Äù Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, gold is worth $3,221. As for the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), Bluntz predicts that the altcoin would dip to around $0.00008 before exploding to $0.00018. ‚ÄúLooks like FLOKI is one of the few memes with a clear impulse five-wave rise from the lows on the daily, indicating the low is in.

While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects primed to outperform as capital rotates outward.From established names like XRP and Ethereum to surging contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Aptos, a handful of strategic plays are positioning themselves for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. Here are four breakout candidates that could capture serious momentum in Bitcoin‚Äôs shadow. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP ‚Äì ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA‚Äôs $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x‚Äì40x returns‚Äîand some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continuesWhat sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure that‚Äôs attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges . In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA‚Äôs combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. Solana‚Äôs Technical Setup and Whale Accumulation Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $171.54, consolidating within a strong support and resistance range between $158 and $175. Analysts highlight a long-term Cup and Handle pattern forming, with a breakout above $175 potentially opening the door to $183 and beyond. SOL‚Äôs fundamentals remain robust, and smart money continues to accumulate, but as capital rotates, many investors are also looking to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper growth while SOL trades sideways. Ethereum‚Äôs Bullish Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with ETH above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern.If ETH can break above $2,700, analysts see a move to $2,750‚Äì$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. As Ethereum‚Äôs rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. Aptos: Quiet Accumulation and Upside Potential Aptos (APT) is consolidating after a recent event-driven rally, with analysts forecasting a price range of $5.13 to $8.81 for May 2025. While APT‚Äôs tech-first approach has strong backing, some early investors are rotating out profits in favor of lower-cap exposure.MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefitting from that shift, with many short-term speculators taking gains from APT and placing them into MAGA, where exponential upside still remains. XRP‚Äôs Futures Launch and the $100 Question XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15‚Äì$30 possible if key catalysts align.While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Solana, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. JOIN NOW ‚Äî $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the tone for a powerful 2025, the spotlight is shifting to altcoins with strategic positioning and high-growth potential. Solana and XRP offer credibility and scale, while MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early entry with outsized return potential. Investors rotating now‚Äîbefore listings finalize and media attention catches up‚Äîmay be best positioned to benefit from the explosive upside that defines every crypto supercycle.

This milestone will unveil the complete lineup of 20 crypto exchanges where BDAG will debut. Originally set for 10 exchanges, the expansion to 20 signals the growing confidence in the project. Buyers now have a chance to lock in BDAG at $0.0020 before listings go live. With over $258 million raised so far, this launch could reshape the Layer-1 market. The first five listings are already public: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. These platforms give an early glimpse of BlockDAG ‚Äôs broad market reach. The full list remains under wraps until the GO LIVE day, which adds suspense and urgency. More than just a listing event, this date marks the final chance to buy BDAG at a reduced price before its rates jump. For many, June 13 signals more than just a listing update, it‚Äôs a defining moment for 2025‚Äôs best performing crypto. BlockDAG GO LIVE Reveal: Strategic Importance of June 13 For anyone watching the crypto presale closely, June 13 holds serious weight. It marks the end of BlockDAG‚Äôs frozen pricing period at $0.0020. That fixed price offers early supporters a rare entry before listings push the coin into open market volatility. With the listing price set at $0.05, this entry window represents unmatched value. Returns since Batch 1 now sit at 2,520%, and more than 20.9 billion BDAG coins have been sold. As the current Batch 28 trades at $0.0262, the opportunity to still buy at $0.0020 before June 13 creates a notable advantage for those seeking gains on the best performing crypto of the year. This deadline is also pushing activity higher as more buyers aim to lock in their coins before the GO LIVE reveal reshapes BDAG‚Äôs pricing forever. Why This Exchange Launch Sets a New Standard Unlike typical launches, BlockDAG‚Äôs GO LIVE reveal showcases real progress, strategic alignment, and global exchange presence. With 20 confirmed exchanges, BDAG is not just appearing in the market, it‚Äôs entering with strength. Each listing brings access to broader audiences, liquidity, and exposure that many new projects never achieve this early. BlockDAG is also following through on its delivery roadmap. Miners have started receiving their X Series mining equipment orders, underlining the project‚Äôs commitment to real-world results. This kind of follow-through supports BlockDAG‚Äôs appeal as a long-term player in the space. Presale excitement continues to grow, thanks to the Buyer Battles and referral rewards program. These efforts keep the community engaged and encourage more users to participate before the deadline. As June 13 draws closer, BlockDAG looks increasingly like the best performing crypto entering the market this year. In Summary Mark June 13 on the calendar. It will be one of the most important moments of the year for anyone eyeing the best performing crypto before launch. BlockDAG‚Äôs GO LIVE reveal will confirm 20 exchange listings and finalize the $0.0020 entry price period. With over $258 million raised, over 20.9 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a standout in 2025. Once the listings are live, prices will likely react quickly. Until then, the opportunity to get in at a frozen price still stands. This is one presale that deserves full attention before June 13 resets the market dynamics.

Some are introducing new tools, expanding partnerships, or leveraging cross-chain solutions to grow their networks. These moves aren‚Äôt just about marketing hype; each coin here shows signs of actual traction. Those tracking the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 will find this mix particularly engaging. The list features projects tied to AI, multichain access, and infrastructure development, offering a broad view of where value is forming. With Unstaked‚Äôs rollout plan, Cosmos expanding Ethereum access, and Sui bringing Bitcoin into DeFi, these assets are carving out strong narratives. Some launch major initiatives, while others aim to rebound after market dips. Every pick on this list presents a setup worth noting right now. 1. Unstaked: AI Utilities That Deliver Real Results Unstaked has been gathering momentum for its hands-on AI approach. The platform allows users to run AI agents that manage tasks like handling community posts and automating responses on Telegram and X. These aren‚Äôt inactive features; they‚Äôre judged by what they achieve, and rewards are based on their work. This system, named Proof of Intelligence, promotes active use instead of passive holding. Every interaction is stored transparently on-chain. With 60% of tokens offered publicly and no allocations for private rounds or VC parties, it gives broader access to early participants. Priced at $0.009267 in stage 13 and targeting a launch price of $0.1819, it reflects a possible ROI of 2700%. There‚Äôs also a $1 million prize pool campaign underway. Anyone purchasing at least $100 in $UNSD and completing social steps can enter to win $50,000, 20 winners in total. So far, the presale has raised $6.3 million, with $2 million collected in just two days. While some mention the platform has live agents, it‚Äôs important to clarify that these tools will only activate once the presale wraps up and the platform goes live. With a working model, strong interest, and transparent metrics, Unstaked deserves its place among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 2. Sui: Bitcoin Utility and Expanding Features Sui has been pushing forward technically by linking Bitcoin-backed tokens into its ecosystem. Through a tie-up with Bitlayer, Peg-BTC (YBTC) can now be used within Sui‚Äôs DeFi framework, allowing BTC holders to earn through the platform. It also teamed up with 21Shares to support real-world asset applications. On top of that, Sui just crossed 8 million new wallet holders this month, which points to rising traction. With its current price near $1.85, down slightly for the day but up nearly 70% in a month, SUI still looks strong. Analysts believe the asset could move toward $6 if this pace holds. The addition of Axelar enables wider dApp development across chains. Thanks to fresh features and cross-chain potential, Sui earns a place on the list of fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 3. Cosmos (ATOM): Enhancing Access and Developer Reach Cosmos has made several updates that support adoption. It was just added to Bitbank, a top exchange in Japan, with zero trading fees during launch. That could draw new trading volume from Asia. But more importantly, Cosmos rolled out IBC v2, which improves how users and developers interact with Ethereum rollups. It makes multi-chain work smoother and cheaper, key for future growth. ATOM is priced around $4.90, with short-term charts hinting a drop toward $4.50 by May 18. However, projections for later this year point to a bounce to $6.80. With improved cross-chain tools and increased exchange access, Cosmos is set to stay on the watchlists of those looking into the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Development Growth Despite ETF Delay Polkadot has seen mixed sentiment recently after the U.S. SEC delayed its decision on a DOT ETF proposal from 21Shares. This pause caused a slide below $5, and the price currently sits at $4.82, still struggling to break the $5.30 ceiling. Forecasts suggest a short-term dip to $4.45, with potential for a slow rise back to $5.15 later this year. But behind the scenes, development remains active. OpenZeppelin confirmed smart contract compatibility with Polkadot, which opens the door for more dApps on the chain. While prices are soft for now, continued work on developer tools helps Polkadot stay competitive. Its evolving ecosystem keeps it in talks among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025, especially if ETF updates go positive. Final Thoughts! Momentum is forming across these projects. Sui is growing with Bitcoin integration and asset tokenisation, Cosmos is unlocking better Ethereum rollup access, and Polkadot keeps adding dev tools while waiting on ETF clarity. Yet Unstaked remains a standout, combining performance-based AI tools, a strong $6.3 million presale, and an open supply model without outside allocations. Anyone evaluating the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 should keep these four in sight. Sui, Cosmos, and Polkadot all offer strong technical moves, while Unstaked adds an upcoming utility layer tied to real activity. With the launch still ahead, Unstaked also brings a rare entry chance before full rollout. These picks represent some of the sharpest plays in today‚Äôs market trends.

Experts warn that this blind spot could have serious consequences for Silicon Valley and the broader digital economy. Allianz Trade, an intelligence firm that tracks global trade risks, published a report on Tuesday based on a survey of 4,500 companies worldwide. It aimed to measure the impact of rising trade tensions and warned that a focus on the United States‚Äô trillion-dollar goods deficit threatens to overlook the fastest-growing part of global trade, the ‚Äúinvisible exports‚Äù of financial and digital services. Though tracking these services is challenging, the report cites estimates showing a US digital trade surplus of at least $600 billion, including digital advertising, video streaming, cloud platforms, and online payment services. Digital surplus by firm (USD bn). Source: Allianz Trade Global Survey 2025 The report calls this ‚Äúhidden trade immense‚Äù. It says these invisible exports have greatly outpaced the growth of goods exports over the past two decades, yet they do not show up in standard trade statistics. Allianz Trade warns that if Washington does not ‚Äúrethink trade policy and narratives‚Äù to begin tracking these services more closely, it could undermine one of America‚Äôs innovative companies and massive data infrastructure, just as the president is negotiating deals with much of the world. The report stresses that overlooking this trade could leave US firms exposed to foreign retaliation. Furthermore, US digital exports now make up about 3.6% of all trade worldwide and continue to grow quickly. These unseen exchanges add to US trade revenues without filling any container ships. In today‚Äôs economy, routers and data centers are as crucial as ports and factories for keeping America in a leading position. Yet, President Trump‚Äôs current plan requires countries hit by his reciprocal tariffs to strike a deal by July 8, a deadline he admits may not allow talks with every partner. US trade partners are already exploring tariffs or taxes on digital services Experts agree that if these measures become permanent, they might damage the US tech industry and even split the internet by forcing companies to tailor their services to different regions. Jovan Kurbalija, a former diplomat and head of the DiploFoundation, warned in an April blog that a shift into the digital domain could carry ‚Äúfar-reaching consequences‚Äù for Silicon Valley and the global digital economy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed to the Financial Times last month that she is planning countermeasures if talks between the European Union and the United States fail. Those could include a tax on digital advertising revenues aimed at firms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, as well as tariffs on services traded across the entire EU market. Kurbalija said that beyond Europe, Trump‚Äôs goods tariffs give other countries both moral and tactical reasons to fast-track digital taxes under the banner of ‚Äúreclaiming revenue from foreign tech ‚Äòfree riders.‚Äô‚Äù Half of US firms considering more investment in China In an opinion piece , Neal K. Shah, CEO of CareYaya Health Technologies, warned that ‚Äútariffs on digital services would directly reduce revenues for American tech companies.‚Äù He said a full-blown digital trade war could harm the Internet‚Äôs infrastructure and force firms to operate ‚Äúparallel digital universes with incompatible standards.‚Äù Shah said that means higher costs, less market access, and slower growth for startups and innovators. He added that splitting the digital world could end globally scalable platforms, scare away investors, and cut world GDP by up to 5% over the next decade. Trump‚Äôs answer to these threats remains more tariffs. He has said that ‚Äúonly America should be allowed to tax American firms,‚Äù Reuters reported . In February, he issued a memo ordering research into how to respond to digital service taxes, including new duties. Yet Allianz Trade found that many US firms are not returning operations home. Instead, half of those surveyed are weighing increased investments in China, while only eight percent plan cuts there. Others said they are rerouting supply chains to Southeast Asia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Latin America. Experts like Bertin Martens of the Brussels think tank Bruegel say imposing digital services tariffs is hard in practice. Laws barring measures against platforms with a significant local presence require detailed user data. Some see open-source technology as the clear winner if tariffs force firms to seek alternatives that sidestep trade barriers.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Could Lead 2025‚Äôs Political Crypto Boom",https://thecoinrise.com/500-to-7-figures-magacoin-finance-bitcoin-and-xrp-could-lead-2025s-political-crypto-boom/,"Introduction With Bitcoin regaining momentum, XRP drawing institutional flows, and Ethereum breaking out above key resistance, investors are zooming in on a select group of tokens set for major upside in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge‚Äînot just for its explosive growth potential, but because Stage 8 is now live and analysts are calling it a high-conviction 40x altcoin candidate. Kaspa (KAS) is also catching attention as its ecosystem expands, but the spotlight is squarely on MAGA, BTC, XRP, and ETH as the market pivots toward political and narrative-driven plays. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 CLICK HERE ‚Äì ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 nears completion, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x‚Äì40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. With each stage filling rapidly and community growth accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the final major entry before the price curve steepens and Stage 9 begins. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Political Narrative Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and now less than 7% below the $100,000 mark. On-chain data shows demand rebounding, with major wallets accumulating as US-based ETF inflows stabilize. While institutional conviction is still ramping up, analysts see a plausible summer rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As the political narrative heats up in the US and abroad, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a macro hedge and a political statement is drawing new capital‚Äîwhile early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from this shift in sentiment. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading around $2.39, with forecasts for late 2025 targeting $2.65‚Äì$2.80 if current momentum holds. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while whale accumulation continues to rise. Legal clarity and Ripple‚Äôs expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Kaspa: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Growth Kaspa (KAS) is trading at $0.097, showing resilience after its recent hard fork and ecosystem expansion. Analysts predict moderate gains this year, with a possible move to $0.15 if broader market conditions remain favorable. Kaspa‚Äôs unique blockDAG architecture and active developer community are positioning it as a standout proof-of-work contender, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the more aggressive play. Ethereum: Breaking Out With Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with a target range of $2,750‚Äì$2,900 for May and projections as high as $5,925 by year-end. Institutional adoption, Layer 2 advancements, and DeFi growth are all strengthening ETH‚Äôs long-term outlook. As Ethereum‚Äôs rally matures, smart capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of exponential returns. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY ‚Äì ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly complete, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing‚Äîand those watching closely know this could be the cycle‚Äôs defining moment.

Gox. Strive said in a May 20 regulatory filing that it partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target claims to Bitcoin ( BTC ) that have received definitive legal rulings but are still awaiting distribution. The company said buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities ‚Äî which is expected to be completed sometime mid this year. Strive hasn‚Äôt disclosed any Bitcoin holdings but claims it will face fewer restrictions on purchasing Bitcoin than companies going public through Special Purpose Acquisition Company mergers. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger compared with a SPAC merger. Source: Strive Strive said it would need shareholder approval to pursue Mt. Gox claims. The company said it intends to lodge a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to outline the full terms of the proposed transaction. A proxy statement would then be sent to shareholders to seek their approval. Strive would need to obtain shareholder approval relatively soon, as Mt. Gox is expected to fully repay its creditors by Oct. 31. The Japan-based Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange before it collapsed in 2014 from a security breach that resulted in the theft of approximately 750,000 Bitcoin . Strive‚Äôs pivot to become a Bitcoin treasury company reflects a broader industry trend as more firms look to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term strategic asset.

Gox plans Asset Entities (ASST), a social media marketing company that Strive announced it would merge with on May 7 to create a Bitcoin investment company, has seen its shares close May 20 trading up 18.2% to $7.74, Google Finance data shows. The latest share price bump brings its market cap to $122.1 million, and ASST is now up 1,170% since Strive announced its merger plan. Strive is expected to own 94.2% of the combined entity once the reverse merger is complete, while Asset Entities will hold the remaining 5.8%. The merged companies will be named Strive and Asset Entities, and will still trade under the ASST ticker.

With XRP gaining momentum from increasing institutional adoption and clearer regulatory standing, analysts are forecasting a potential 10x to 20x upside as global payment use cases expand. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, still under the radar but rapidly climbing, offers early entry into what many believe is the next big crypto before the 2025 bull run peaks. Investors who participate in Phase 4 of the Mutuum Finance presale can look forward to reaping 140% returns when the token goes public, with a guaranteed launch price of $0.06. To date, the presale has generated more than $8.9 million and has attracted over 11,000 holders, with Phase 4 being more than 95% sold. Together, these two tokens represent a unique blend of established credibility and untapped growth potential, making them standout choices for those asking what crypto to buy now before the next wave of gains hits. Over $8.9 Million Raised by over 11,000 Adopters The presale of Mutuum Finance continues to rise to greater heights. Now in Phase 4, the token costs $0.025 and will appreciate in value. As the presale progresses to Phase 5, the token price will appreciate to $0.03, earning current investors an immediate 20% gain. With an expected launch cost of $0.06, the profit potential keeps mounting. Crypto experts have already branded MUTM as among the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the year. Supported by over $8.9 million in backing and over 11,000 users, Mutuum Finance is poised to take off. To help create a more social atmosphere, Mutuum Finance has added a leaderboard showing the top 50 token holders in real time. Users with a lot of tokens are rewarded with bonus coins, which brings competition to the platform and motivates users to keep their tokens for a long period. It also promotes better interaction among the main supporters of the project. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is developing a completely collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Its overcollateralized design prioritizes price stability, sidestepping risks associated with algorithmic stablecoins.

While XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE.With Stage 8 now live and inflows surging, traders from across the ecosystem‚Äîincluding XRP and Solana holders‚Äîare pivoting toward what‚Äôs now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Holding Above $105K Bitcoin is holding strong at $105,941, up 2.8% in the last 24 hours and approaching new all-time highs. Institutional inflows are at record levels, with $6.9 billion entering U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past three weeks. Major corporate buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have added thousands of BTC to their treasuries, signaling growing confidence in Bitcoin as a macro asset. As BTC consolidates above $105K, capital is flowing into breakout altcoins‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the top of that list for traders seeking the next 10,000% run. CLICK HERE ‚Äì 2025‚ÄôS BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE: The #1 Breakout Entry of the Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching fire across presale trackers and trader dashboards. With Stage 8 nearly full, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007, analysts are projecting up to 50x returns as listings approach. Its scarcity-driven model‚Äîa capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts‚Äîsets it apart from typical meme coins.As capital rotates from majors, MAGA‚Äôs structure, community-first strategy, and strong early-stage momentum are making it the most-watched presale of 2025. For those seeking exponential upside, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Futures Launch and Institutional Surge XRP is trading at $2.36 as of May 20, 2025, with the CME Group‚Äôs launch of XRP futures marking a major milestone for institutional adoption. While short-term volatility is possible, analysts see $5‚Äì$10 as the next major target, and some project $20+ if ETF approval and global settlement use cases accelerate.As institutional flows grow, many XRP holders are also rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper upside during this cycle. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with three new wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days.Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, with bullish technicals supporting further upside. As Solana‚Äôs rally matures, traders are diversifying into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum: Quiet Build-Up and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With Layer 2 upgrades, DeFi growth, and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750‚Äì$2,900 in the coming months.As Ethereum‚Äôs rally consolidates, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting investors seeking the next explosive move. TRON: Steady Growth Amid Market Rotation TRON (TRX) is holding at $0.124, maintaining steady growth as network activity remains robust.

Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal ‚Äì Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level ‚Äî a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin‚Äôs midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin‚Äôs potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level ‚Äî a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market‚Äôs uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level ‚Äì $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219‚Äì$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal ‚Äì Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction.

The alleged motive? Her family‚Äôs cryptocurrency fortune . In a chilling new reality, digital wealth is no longer just vulnerable to hackers‚Äîit‚Äôs putting lives on the line in the physical world. Crypto owners are being kidnapped , tortured, and extorted across the globe. From France and India to Latin America and Nigeria, these incidents are rising with alarming frequency as criminals adapt their tactics to pursue a new high-value target: anyone visibly successful in the digital asset space. Crypto is providing criminals with a new type of target Crypto‚Äôs allure has always been its promise of autonomy, borderless wealth, and anonymity. However, that autonomy is becoming a liability for individuals who have struck it big. Unlike a bank account that requires bureaucratic steps to access, crypto wallets can be emptied in minutes‚Äîunder duress. Michael Lyons , an anti-money laundering attorney at Clifford Chance, concurs. He holds, ‚ÄúCrypto transactions are more likely to escape the level of scrutiny applied to traditional banking systems.‚Äù In India, a Bengaluru businessman was lured to Lucknow under the pretext of a business deal, only to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of 10 million rupees. In Latin America, kidnapping crews with cartel ties have begun demanding ransom not in cash but in Bitcoin, often using privacy-enhanced coins like Monero to mask their tracks. One Venezuelan crypto trader, who asked not to be named, described being tailed for weeks before armed men intercepted him outside a mall. ‚ÄúThey knew what I drove, where I lived, even which exchange I used,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey held my family until I transferred the funds.‚Äù Kidnappers have gone digital The rules of engagement have shifted. Where old-school ransom schemes might involve anonymous wire transfers or suitcases of cash, today‚Äôs criminal outfits are leveraging the technologies that gave rise to crypto: decentralization, pseudonymity, and global reach. According to a report by BankInfoSecurity , criminals are increasingly demanding ransom in Monero and other privacy coins because they are harder to trace than Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe privacy coins make the laundering process easier for them, so they obviously prefer it, but they will still accept BTC,‚Äù said a cybercrime analyst quoted in the article. In some instances, criminals are no longer waiting for the wealthy to become careless. They‚Äôre using facial recognition, blockchain transaction tracking tools, and even SIM swapping attacks to isolate targets. The lines between cybercrime and street-level violence have blurred. The Interpol has also reported increased coordination between cybercrime units and traditional law enforcement as crypto crimes cross national borders. These cases have created a new breed of hybrid criminals employing a mix of digital sophistication and brutal coercion to their nefarious ends. The crypto industry is taking notice Security, once an afterthought in the fast-moving world of crypto, has become a front-and-center concern. Executives and influencers are hiring private security firms, sometimes staffed with former intelligence operatives. High-net-worth individuals are relocating, installing panic buttons, and switching to encrypted communications. Amid a spate of kidnappings and the Coinbase hack, increasingly large crypto holders are hiring private security firms. Some investors have opted for a lower profile. They now conduct meetings virtually, scrub their social media of luxury photos, and use pseudonyms even within crypto communities. This stance is a far cry from the early days of crypto culture‚Äîwhere flexing wealth was part of the brand. Today, discretion is survival. Meanwhile, exchanges and wallet providers are reevaluating their user education practices. Physical security awareness campaigns now supplement tutorials on setting up hardware wallets and using multi-signature authentication. All these initiatives show that while a user‚Äôs seed phrase is important, so is their situational awareness. Combating crypto crime requires understanding that air-gapping your wallet is unhelpful if you broadcast your wealth through social media and other means. Law enforcement is playing catch-up While the threats are global, the responses have been fragmented. Law enforcement agencies often lack the technical know-how to investigate crimes involving digital assets. Jurisdictional challenges complicate matters: when a ransom is paid in France and funneled through wallets in Panama, who has authority? Some progress is being made. INTERPOL has launched a Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre to address transnational financial threats, including crypto-related ones. However, international coordination remains a major hurdle. In the U.S., the Department of Justice has stepped up crypto training for its cybercrime units and partnered with blockchain analytics firms to trace illicit transactions. However, experts say the lag between policy formulation and technological evolution is widening. There is also debate about whether crypto platforms should shoulder more responsibility. Some argue exchanges need to implement AI-driven behavior detection systems that could flag suspicious patterns before funds are forcibly withdrawn. Yet privacy advocates caution against sweeping surveillance in the name of safety. They argue that we can‚Äôt sacrifice decentralization and privacy entirely to police bad actors. So, we must find ways of achieving that difficult balance. Crypto must address its cultural problem Beyond policy and policing lies a deeper cultural issue: the glamorization of sudden wealth. Crypto communities on YouTube, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) are rife with images of Lamborghini, luxury watches, and high-rise living. This culture of conspicuous consumption has painted targets on the backs of newcomers and veterans alike. Some of the most at-risk individuals are early adopters who experienced 1000x returns overnight. Many are young, inexperienced with wealth, and unaware of the attention they‚Äôre attracting. To these investors, the rising number of crypto kidnappings shouldn‚Äôt just be another crime wave. Rather, it‚Äôs a wake-up call. They must understand that their success stories must come with robust identity protection, not flaunting their assets and always assuming someone‚Äôs watching them. What‚Äôs the way forward? As the crypto industry matures, so too must the systems around it. That means that investors need to take personal security as seriously as they take portfolio diversification. Platforms and exchanges should include user education on physical safety, not just cyber hygiene. Furthermore, l aw enforcement agencies need cross-border frameworks and technical expertise to respond effectively. But beyond systems and policy, a cultural shift is needed. We must move away from the glamorization of sudden wealth and toward a culture of security-minded, privacy-conscious engagement with digital finance. Cryptocurrency has opened the door to financial freedom for millions. But freedom, in this case, comes with a price‚Äîand for too many, that price is proving far too high. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.

The SEC said on May 20 that it charged Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former investment chief Alex Dominguez with misleading investors about certificates that conveyed rights to receive Unicoin tokens and stock.

The SEC sued Unicoin , CEO Alexander Konanykhin, former board chair Maria Moschini, senior vice president and general counsel Richard Devlin and former chief investment officer and investor relations officer Alejandro Dominguez on securities law violations, Among its allegations , the SEC said Unicoin never actually owned the real estate properties it told investors it had acquired, and that those properties' values were inflated. ""For example, between September 2023 and January 2024, the Promoting Defendants announced acquisitions of properties in Argentina, Thailand, Antigua, and the Bahamas, purportedly with appraised values totaling more than of $1.4 billion; in fact, the majority of those transactions never closed and the actual combined value of the four properties was no more than $300 million,"" the complaint said. The defendants also ""overstated the Company's sales"" of its rights certificates, suggesting in social media posts and to investors that it had raised far more funds than it actually had, the SEC alleged. While Unicoin claimed it had made $3 billion in sales by June 2024, it actually never sold more than $110 million in its rights certificates, according to the complaint. Moreover, Unicoin advertised its rights certificates, including by promising outsized returns of up to 9 million percent, the SEC alleged, pointing to marketing efforts on taxi cabs, ferries, ""office building elevator screens,"" digital billboards, coasters, television programs, news websites and public wi-fi kiosks. ""Additional examples of the Promoting Defendants‚Äô statements include: (a) social media and website posts that touted potential returns of 9,000,000% based on bitcoin‚Äôs 9,000,000% growth in the past 10 years and told investors to 'take advantage of the early days of Unicoin and get them today,' highlighting that 'Bitcoin experienced a tremendous rise in value, transforming early adopters into millionaires, and even billionaires,'"" the filing said.

Crypto legislation proposed in New York New York State lawmakers have already introduced several bills to regulate crypto. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill to amend the state‚Äôs financial law to allow New York State agencies to accept crypto as payment. However, the legislation is yet to reach the state‚Äôs full House or Senate. New York state Senator James Sanders Jr proposed the Blockchain Study Act in February, which would create a crypto task force to investigate the current state of crypto in the State. It has yet to advance past the House.

The case was dismissed with prejudice on April 2, meaning it can‚Äôt be reopened. An increasing number of US states are also working on crypto-related legislation, with at least 18 considering bills to establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

While the market has faced a few pullbacks, the bigger picture still looks hopeful for XRP fans. Key Resistance Holding XRP Back Recently, XRP tried to break through a tough resistance zone between $2.55 and $2.62, but once again, the price got rejected. This area has been a problem for XRP for a while now, just like it has for many other altcoins in the market. After this rejection, the price pulled back slightly, but it‚Äôs still holding above important support levels. The Bigger Trend Stays Bullish Even with these small dips, the overall trend for XRP is still moving up. On the daily chart, XRP continues to form higher highs and higher lows, which is a classic sign of an uptrend. Right now, the price is finding support around $2.30 to $2.34, a zone that was previously a resistance area. As long as XRP stays above this level, the bullish momentum is expected to continue. If the price falls below $2.30, however, the next important support sits between $2.10 and $2.15. Dropping below this zone could lead to a deeper pullback in the short term. Short-Term Price Action: Calm Before the Move XRP is still under the effect of a recent bearish divergence, which caused a small drop followed by sideways price movement. At the moment, it looks like XRP won‚Äôt make any big moves right away. Bitcoin, which often leads the crypto market, is still holding strong ‚Äî and when Bitcoin stays steady, altcoins like XRP usually follow quietly for a while before making their moves. Many market watchers believe that if Bitcoin continues its upward trend, XRP could start recovering in the coming days. Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests One More Rally According to a recent market analysis based on the Elliott Wave theory ‚Äî a popular tool to predict market cycles ‚Äî XRP might still be in the middle of its fifth and final wave to the upside. This wave likely started when XRP hit a bottom in July last year. If this pattern continues, XRP could aim for new highs, with long-term price targets between $4.20, $5.00, or even $5.65 before a bigger market correction begins. Crucial Support and Resistance Levels to Watch (long term) For now, XRP remains in a tight range. Key resistance sits just above $3.30, while strong support lies at $1.21. As long as the price stays above $1.21, the bullish outlook stays in place. A drop below this level, however, would weaken the current setup and might force analysts to rethink their predictions. In the short term, XRP has completed a five-wave pattern, and according to Elliott Wave rules, a three-wave pullback could be next. The expected support for this pullback lies between $2.60 and $1.79. As long as XRP holds above $1.79, the bullish trend remains safe.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 01:46:19

Beijing placed fresh restrictions on seven key rare-earth elements and on the permanent magnets made from them. The minerals are crucial for electric cars, wind turbines, humanoid robots, and advanced fighter jets. Under the rules, Chinese exporters must secure a licence from the Ministry of Commerce before each shipment can leave the country. Exporters and trade bodies now say those licences are being approved at a slow pace. Some shipments to Europe have been cleared, but the pace is far behind demand. ‚ÄúThe window to avoid significant damage to production in Europe is rapidly closing,‚Äù said Wolfgang Niedermark, a member of the executive board of the Federation of German Industries, or BDI. Big US manufacturers are also sounding the alarm. In recent briefings, executives at Tesla, Ford, and Lockheed Martin told investors that China‚Äôs new export controls could slow or even halt supply chains. One European executive based in China, who asked not to be named, called the present delays ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù for foreign firms. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm witnessing on the ground is that there is really incompetence; they underestimated what the impact would be and what you would need to prepare at the working level,‚Äù the executive said. Beijing widened its export controls just after US President Donald Trump announced steep new tariffs on Chinese goods on 2 April. Many analysts saw the rare-earth move as a direct response, highlighting China‚Äôs leverage as the world‚Äôs dominant supplier of minerals. China‚Äôs rare-earth controls may be a strategic response to US tariffs So far, it is not clear whether any shipments bound for the United States have received licences since Washington and Beijing declared a 90-day ceasefire in their tariff war earlier this month. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetic Material, based in Shandong Province, confirmed it had secured export permits and had ‚Äúresumed‚Äù taking orders from certain buyers. Two people familiar with the situation said at least one consignment destined for Volkswagen‚Äôs operations in Germany had also been cleared. Volkswagen stated that its supply of parts containing rare earths remained stable and that its suppliers had received ‚Äúa limited number of these [export] licences.‚Äù Inside the industry, companies fear the ministry will be overwhelmed as licence applications pour in. One executive said European importers ‚Äúare not sure how to prove‚Äù that their shipments will not be re-exported to the United States, a step that would break the permit rules. Slow license approvals would affect Western companies Tesla chief Elon Musk told investors last month that Chinese officials had asked for assurances that the rare-earth magnets used in the company‚Äôs robot arms would not go into military hardware. ‚ÄúThat is an example of a challenge there. I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll overcome these issues,‚Äù he said. Permanent magnets made from rare earths are found in combat aircraft such as Lockheed‚Äôs F-35. Short-term shortages could disrupt production lines, and experts predict that the new controls will speed up long-term efforts in the West to build alternative supply chains. Evan Scott, chief financial officer at Lockheed, told investors this week that the company had enough rare-earth material for the rest of the year. He added that he expected US authorities to give priority to Lockheed‚Äôs needs ‚Äúgiven the importance of our programmes.‚Äù Cameron Johnson, partner at the Shanghai-based consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions, said he believes some big companies with long histories in China have managed to move rare-earth cargoes even before their licences were formally approved. ‚ÄúThere is still material going out,‚Äù he said. Cory Combs, associate director at Trivium China, a Beijing consultancy, noted that there is ‚Äúcertainly no evidence‚Äù that China has ‚Äúbluntly cut everyone off.‚Äù With the 90-day tariff truce now in place, he expects the commerce ministry to grant more permits, but he warned that uncertainty remains high. ‚ÄúEveryone wants Mofcom to provide clarity,‚Äù Mr Combs said. ‚ÄúBut China‚Äôs strategic leverage relies partly on the ability to pull the export control lever to the extent that the US does not provide a satisfying deal.‚Äù KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|USD|Yuan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 01:48:29

It now requires one more vote and Governor Greg Abbott‚Äôs signature to become law. The bill draws inspiration from successful efforts in other states, notably New Hampshire‚Äôs model for adding new tokens to its Reserve. Under SB 21, Texas would allow altcoins to be included only if they maintain a market capitalization of at least $500 billion for a continuous period of two years. Texas is rapidly headed to form its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Legislators voted resoundingly to advance the‚ÄÇbill. This legislation hopes to see Texas become the third state to own and operate a state-funded Bitcoin Reserve in the United States. The third and final reading would come next, and experts said that was likely to pass easily. SB 21 passes second reading with strong bipartisan support Upon its second reading, the bill, also called Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), received overwhelming bi-partisan support. The vote was 105 to 23. This demonstrates clear partisan agreement. SB 21 would allow Texas to join the‚ÄÇhandful of states that already hold Bitcoin by authorizing the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to operate a state-owned Bitcoin Reserve. The fund will strategically invest taxpayer funds in Bitcoin to create a diversified financial portfolio for Texas, including digital and regular assets. To preserve the state‚Äôs investment, the reserve will be limited to digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion held for at least two years, meaning only stable and established cryptocurrencies will qualify. The reserve‚Äôs operation will be funded through appropriations by the Legislature and other state funding sources. The comptroller‚Äôs office, which under the law is also guided by the city‚Äôs finance department and the Office of Management and Budget, will be the trustee of the currency and will purchase, hold, and sell Bitcoin on behalf of the reserve. Texas joins New Hampshire and Arizona in establishing state Bitcoin Reserve Texas is on its way to being the third state to create an official Bitcoin Reserve after New Hampshire and Arizona. This is just one example of an emerging trend in the US as more states turn to Bitcoin to help fortify their finances. Popularity has been rising for the initiative to hold Bitcoin after President Donald Trump suggested it was a good idea for states to hold Bitcoin; parties such as the South Carolina GOP found this a good time to ask followers to give their opinions. Supporters believe holding Bitcoin can enable states to hedge against inflation and economic instability. The cryptocurrency market has already felt the impact of news of the bill. Amid the state-backed interest in Bitcoin Reserves, the asset price has soared to $106,000, targeting an all-time high. Confidence in Bitcoin and state-led digital asset initiatives is steadily increasing. While primarily a Bitcoin Reserve, SB 21 also includes other digital assets‚Äîprovided they maintain a market capitalization of $500 billion or more for at least 24 months. Texas set to approve Bitcoin Reserve as global interest surges The bill now heads to the‚ÄÇdesk of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it. Abbott has previously expressed support for cryptocurrency projects and is widely expected to sign SB 21 into law. Following Trump‚Äôs signing of the Bitcoin Reserve into law, interest in similar initiatives has surged to unprecedented levels. States like Utah, Oklahoma, and Kentucky are inching forward with their versions of a bill to join the industry as early movers. A Ukrainian lawmaker has unveiled plans to introduce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill to be the first in the EU. However, the move has garnered Binance‚Äôs support, with the exchange poised to become a strategic partner for Ukraine‚Äôs Bitcoin ambitions. Additionally, Conor McGregor has plans to launch an Irish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the European country. The former UFC fighter has also scheduled a meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele‚ÄÇto support a nationwide Bitcoin accumulation strategy. UFC fighter turned Irish political hopeful Conor McGregor has endorsed building a Bitcoin Reserve in his country to give more ‚Äúpower back to the people.‚Äù ‚ÄúCrypto in it‚Äôs origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people‚Äôs money,‚Äù McGregor wrote¬†to X on May 9. He wants the Irish people to have a stake in this exciting venture. This suggestion immediately appealed to President Nayib Bukele, who is using aggressive tactics of purchasing Bitcoin for his country and disregarding any institutions that are hesitant in doing so KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|Bitcoin reserve|Texas,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 01:49:40

He also rejected claims that the White House is easing military help for Kyiv. Rubio spoke in a Senate hearing one day after President Donald Trump spent two hours on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a call that ended without a clear step toward ending the war that began when Moscow invaded its neighbour. Several Democratic lawmakers said the president squandered the chance to raise the heat on the Kremlin. They faulted him for not warning Putin that Washington and its European partners would widen sanctions unless the Russian leader agreed to a cease-fire. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking at a Senate hearing. Source: PBS NewsHour During testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio was asked about a bill led by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. The proposal would slap wide-ranging new punishments on Moscow, aiming to choke the money it uses to fight the war. The measure calls for a 500 percent tariff on goods coming from countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, along with other limits on finance and technology. ‚ÄúIf in fact it is clear that the Russians are not interested in a peace deal and they want to keep fighting a war, it may very well come to that point,‚Äù Rubio said. But he added that Trump thinks ‚Äúright now if we start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking. There‚Äôs value in us being able to talk to them and drive them to get to the table.‚Äù Democratic committee member Senator Jeanne Shaheen said Putin offered no ‚Äúmeaningful negotiation that would end this war in Ukraine.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúAs President Trump has admitted, Vladimir Putin is taking him for a ride.‚Äù Senator Chris Van Hollen went further, telling Rubio, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve teamed up with President Trump to throw the Ukrainian people under the bus, and have been played like a fiddle by Vladimir Putin.‚Äù Rubio affirmed that the Trump administration has leverage against Russia Rubio insisted that the administration has the ‚Äúsame leverage today that we had under the previous administration.‚Äù He noted that ‚Äúwhen Vladimir Putin woke up this morning, he had the same set of sanctions on him that he‚Äôs always had since the beginning of this conflict,‚Äù and he stressed that American weapons are still moving into Ukraine. ‚ÄúPutin hasn‚Äôt got a single concession, he hasn‚Äôt got a single sanction lifted,‚Äù Rubio said. Even so, the Florida Republican argued the war can end only through a negotiated deal. ‚ÄúWhat the president‚Äôs trying to do is end a war,‚Äù he told the panel, saying the United States must keep channels open so both sides will sit down. His remarks did little to calm allies who had hoped for tougher language in Monday‚Äôs Trump-Putin talk . The call produced no pledge from Moscow to halt its attacks. Instead, Putin suggested that both parties draft a ‚Äúmemorandum‚Äù that would outline future treaty terms, a move critics dismissed as a stalling tactic that allowed Russian troops to keep fighting while talks dragged on. European and Ukrainian leaders also voiced unease after Trump floated the idea of stepping back as mediator and proposing that the Vatican take over the role instead. They warned that every day without a truce brings more civilian deaths and damage across Ukraine.

But BlockDAG (BDAG) is changing that, making mining available to anyone through practical tools and mobile-friendly options. Whether you‚Äôre a full-time miner or just someone with a smartphone, BlockDAG opens the door to earning. With $258 million raised during its presale, 20.9 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since batch 1, the numbers are speaking for themselves. There‚Äôs a reason people call it the crypto with 20,000x potential. From BDAG‚Äôs Powerful X-Series Miners to X1 App, Mining Is Now for Everyone Mining isn‚Äôt just for those with high-end setups anymore. BlockDAG has created a toolkit that works for both pros and newcomers. The X10, X30, and X100 miners, over 17,600 units of which have already been sold, offer top-tier power and performance for serious miners. But the biggest shift is the X1 mobile app. With only a smartphone, anyone can start mining. There are no upfront fees, no complicated setup. That simplicity opens doors to a much broader user base, giving more people access to the crypto with 20,000x ROI potential. It‚Äôs smooth, easy, and perfect for beginners. What makes this important is BlockDAG‚Äôs focus on real-world usage. The X1 app isn‚Äôt just a gimmick, it helps grow the network and rewards users for activity, referrals, and time spent engaging. Even if traditional miners doubt mobile mining, BlockDAG‚Äôs hybrid PoW and DAG design ensures that every miner, big or small, helps power a strong, scalable system. Whether you‚Äôre using a $1,000 miner or a basic phone, you‚Äôre part of a broader mission to grow a decentralized network. A $258M Presale That‚Äôs Building More Than Hype BlockDAG‚Äôs rise isn‚Äôt driven by empty promises. With more than $258 million raised, 28 batches released, and 20.9 billion coins sold, this project is building real value. While the current batch is priced at $0.0262, a limited-time offer brings it back to just $0.0020 until June 13. That‚Äôs the same as the batch 1 price, offering late buyers a shot at early-stage ROI. This isn‚Äôt just about catching a dip, it‚Äôs about seeing an entire system in motion. The mining hardware is ready. The beta testnet is active. The X1 app is already gaining users. Unlike other projects that offer promises, BlockDAG is giving users an ecosystem to engage with before the mainnet even goes live. When you combine all this, tools, adoption, and accessibility, it‚Äôs easy to understand why people believe it‚Äôs the crypto with 20,000x potential. What also sets BlockDAG apart is its transparency. The team has rolled out multiple video keynotes, giving real updates on features, roadmap progress, and community milestones. That kind of openness gives both retail buyers and institutions confidence that they‚Äôre backing more than just a whitepaper; they‚Äôre backing results. Making Regular Users Active Earning Nodes BlockDAG‚Äôs smart approach to mining isn‚Äôt just technical, it‚Äôs about how people behave. Many crypto platforms struggle to bring in new users, and even more fail to keep them involved. BlockDAG avoids that by making mining fun and interactive with its X1 app. Users become active nodes by simply participating, earning rewards, making referrals, and competing in real time. A good example is the Buyer Battles contest, which hands out 150 million BDAG daily to the top participants. This adds fun and competition to the mix, turning mining into something people want to do daily. Instead of asking people to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù first, BlockDAG lets them earn while they learn. That strategy removes the usual barriers that stop people in low-income areas or those who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy. With mining options that include everything from pro-level machines to a free mobile app, BlockDAG is ready to grow fast and far. For people who care about more than just flipping a coin, BlockDAG offers a full system. It brings together technology, economics, and a community setup built around real use. This is mining made simple. And if BlockDAG keeps building this way, it may not only live up to the crypto with 20,000x potential, it could redefine what crypto utility actually means. Final Chance to Get In BlockDAG isn‚Äôt chasing crypto trends, it‚Äôs setting its own path. With physical miners from the X10 to the X100, and a user-friendly X1 app, it gives every user a way to mine and earn. The crypto presale speaks for itself: $258 million raised, a 2,520% ROI from batch 1, and a rare $0.0020 offer open until June 13. This isn‚Äôt just another presale, it‚Äôs the beginning of a bigger vision. If you‚Äôre searching for a real opportunity with long-term value, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just a name to watch. It‚Äôs a chance to join something early, something real, and possibly the crypto with 20,000x potential ready to be realized.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Solana Are Leading the Shift",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-next-big-move-magacoin-finance-ethereum-and-solana-are-leading-the-shift/,"Introduction As May 2025 unfolds, conviction-driven capital is flowing into a new set of crypto leaders . From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Each brings a distinct edge‚Äîmacro leadership, DeFi infrastructure, early-stage asymmetric potential, and cross-border utility. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns CLICK HERE ‚Äì FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the top early-stage play of Q2 2025 , with Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007. Its scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply and Hashex audit have analysts forecasting 35x‚Äì50x returns before listings.MAGA‚Äôs blend of viral narrative, transparent tokenomics, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital is fueling unmatched momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. The window for early entry is closing fast, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025. Bitcoin Holds Ground as Institutional Confidence Grows Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $95,000, consolidating after a strong recovery from April lows. Analysts are targeting $104,000‚Äì$109,000 as key resistance, with the next leg of the supercycle potentially pushing BTC to $150,000 or higher.As Bitcoin anchors the market, it‚Äôs enabling capital to cascade into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the opportunity for exponential gains remains open. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,356, retreating from its recent high of $2,728 but still up significantly for May. Technical analysis points to a potential retest of $2,600‚Äì$2,700 if ETH holds above $2,250, with long-term targets as high as $4,500 by late 2025.As the cornerstone of Web3 and DeFi, Ethereum‚Äôs rising institutional interest and rapid Layer 2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Solana: Ecosystem Growth Drives Major Momentum Solana (SOL) is trading at $162.08, reflecting a modest pullback after recent highs near $183. For May 2025, the expected trading range is $158‚Äì$175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 resistance. Solana‚Äôs positive trend remains supported by DeFi growth, Web3 participation, and strong investor confidence. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Utility and Cross-Border Reach Stellar Lumens (XLM) is quietly gaining traction as a cross-border payments leader. While not as headline-grabbing as BTC or ETH, XLM‚Äôs consistent utility and adoption make it a favorite for those seeking stable, long-term growth.As capital rotates, some XLM holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, early-stage upside. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON ‚Äì ACT NOW Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction‚Äîrotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, Solana and XLM offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns.With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

Asked why ETH had rallied over 50% in a week, Hayes dismissed technical triggers and pointed instead to sentiment. ‚ÄúThe most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just human nature.‚Äù For Hayes, the Ethereum comeback was long overdue after years of being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens. ‚ÄúETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running‚Ä¶ it was time.‚Äù Why Ethereum Could Soar To $10,000 Despite not having added to his position, Hayes said he remained long Ethereum and was unfazed by the current price. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great it‚Äôs going up, but okay‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk at $10,000 or $15,000. Let‚Äôs talk when it‚Äôs meaningful.‚Äù Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal ‚Äì Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Hayes placed Ethereum‚Äôs rebound in the broader context of what he calls a global monetary ‚Äúphase shift‚Äù‚Äîa transition away from the US Treasury as the world‚Äôs reserve asset, toward a bifurcated system where store-of-value flows increasingly shift toward gold and Bitcoin. In this paradigm, Ethereum benefits not just from speculative risk flows, but also from structural changes in how capital moves under increasing financial repression and capital controls. While he reiterated his belief that gold and Bitcoin are the two neutral reserve assets in a politically fractured world, Hayes sees Ethereum as a powerful high-beta trade in the coming wave of liquidity expansion. ‚ÄúThey print the money,‚Äù he said bluntly. ‚ÄúAnd the consequence will be gold and Bitcoin going through the roof.‚Äù Still, Ethereum‚Äôs path won‚Äôt be linear. Hayes acknowledged ETH‚Äôs underperformance versus Bitcoin so far, but suggested that ETH‚Äôs moment is coming‚Äîparticularly if regulatory clarity improves or if decentralized finance regains traction with sustainable cash flows. He singled out projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that might finally justify valuation through fundamentals. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why The potential for Ethereum to outperform dramatically remains, Hayes argued, especially as the market continues to digest what he sees as the beginning of the end for the 50-year US Treasury-based global financial system. ‚ÄúIf you want to preserve access to capital and spend it how you want, the only things you can own are gold and Bitcoin,‚Äù he said. But for the investor with appetite for asymmetry, ETH is ‚Äúa hard slog‚Äù now‚Äîyet still in the early stages of what could be a runaway rally. Whether Ethereum reaches the $10,000 mark in 2025 or beyond, Hayes is positioning for that outcome. ‚ÄúMailstream is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% ETH and then you know a lot of other shitcoins and term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it‚Äôs physical gold and gold miners and T bills. That‚Äôs it,‚Äù Hayes revealed. At press time, ETH traded at $2,477.

What Happened? The SEC claims that Unicoin and its leaders, including CEO and Board Chairman Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former Chief Investment Officer Alex Dominguez, tricked investors with big promises about their crypto project. They sold ‚Äúrights certificates‚Äù that were supposed to give people access to Unicoin tokens in the future ‚Äî tokens they claimed would be backed by valuable real estate and investments in private companies. But according to the SEC, these promises were mostly made up. The real estate the company bragged about was worth only a small portion of what was advertised, and the company raised nowhere near the $3 billion it claimed ‚Äî bringing in only about $110 million from over 5,000 investors. Unicoin reportedly went big with their marketing. Ads popped up in airports, taxis across New York City, on TV, and all over social media. The company presented itself as a next-generation crypto investment opportunity, supposedly safe, stable, and profitable. They even told investors their offerings were ‚ÄúSEC-registered,‚Äù when in reality, they weren‚Äôt. The SEC says Konanykhin personally sold millions of these certificates, targeting investors the company had previously tried to avoid so they wouldn‚Äôt lose their legal exemptions. The Charges and What‚Äôs Next The SEC has officially charged Unicoin and its executives with breaking federal securities laws, including fraud and making unregistered sales. The legal action demands they pay back the money they gained unfairly, along with extra fines and bans from holding executive positions in public companies. Even Unicoin‚Äôs general counsel, Richard Devlin, wasn‚Äôt spared. He‚Äôs been accused of spreading misleading information through investor documents. Devlin has agreed to settle his charges without admitting or denying the allegations and will pay a $37,500 penalty.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 02:01:11

The premiere episode featured Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX, who provided an in-depth discussion on several recent platform highlights. These included the launch of the ‚ÄúMars Program Special Edition,‚Äù the early partnership with the Trump family‚Äôs crypto project, and the powerful growth drivers contributing to HTX‚Äôs Q1 performance. According to Justin, this new series underscores HTX‚Äôs commitment to transparency and building trust within its user base. By engaging directly with users, HTX intends to facilitate open communication, strengthen the connection between users and leadership, and enhance the platforms‚Äô credibility. HTX representative Molly also participated in the show, directly addressing user questions in real-time. Q: The launch of HTX‚Äôs special edition Mars Program has sparked significant buzz within the crypto community. What‚Äôs the strategic thinking behind it, and what message does HTX hope to convey to users through this campaign? Justin Sun: A journey to Mars is actually a personal dream of mine. Interestingly,the Chinese names HTX and Mars form a natural alliteration. My lifelong dream has been to venture into space, a goal I‚Äôve been pursuing incrementally. While sending myself or our users to Mars is not currently feasible, it remains a vision I hope to witness in my lifetime. For now, the first step is space travel. Acknowledging its niche appeal, I believe it‚Äôs a pursuit worth sharing with the HTX community. If there‚Äôs ever an opportunity, I aspire to offer our users the chance to experience space as well. Of course, this is a massive undertaking and not something that will happen overnight. My own space journey has already been delayed over four years. So managing expectations is important. That said, our investment in the space sector is long-term. Our collaboration with companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin is a long-term partnership. Safety is paramount, both in space exploration and in cryptocurrency trading. In the context of spaceflight, our benchmark for safety exceeds that of driving a car. Therefore, I want to emphasize three key aspects of this initiative: its inherent difficulty, its long-term nature, and our unwavering commitment to safety. Our focus on space does not imply any deceleration in our core product development. On the contrary, HTX remains aggressive and ahead of the curve in new asset listings. As a Top 10 exchange, HTX possesses both significant momentum and established credibility. Regarding the speed and quality of token listings, our competitiveness matches, if not surpasses, that of any other exchange in the market. The Mars Program symbolizes our vision for the future, reaching for the stars and beyond. Simultaneously, we remain firmly grounded in our commitment to our community. Our ongoing reward campaigns and $HTX token empowerment initiatives continue to operate at full capacity, delivering tangible value to our users. Q: You partnered with the Trump family‚Äôs crypto project, WLFI and you engaged in a discussion with Eric Trump in Dubai. At the same time, HTX was among the first exchanges to list Trump-related tokens, TRUMP and USD1. How do you view the value of this rapid response to trending topics in terms of brand building and user base expansion? And looking ahead, will HTX continue to double down on hot-red tokens? Justin Sun: Absolutely. We were one of the earliest players to recognize the significance of the Trump family‚Äôs involvement in crypto. From the beginning, I believed that Donald Trump‚Äôs influence would bring a huge wave of positive momentum into space, and now we‚Äôre seeing that come to life. The entire industry got a new lease on life after his campaign ramped up. I am honored to serve as an advisor to the Trump family‚Äôs crypto team. I‚Äôm actively involved in providing insights and helping bridge the gap between crypto and traditional politics and, in a broader sense, possibly even between the two major economies. Our objective is to establish a robust, long-term relationship with the Trump family and onboard individuals from traditional industries into Web3. Our partnership with the Trump family is a long-term commitment. We are dedicated to driving growth across the entire cryptocurrency industry, fostering greater adoption and integration of digital assets. Q: HTX was the only Top 10 exchange to record positive trading volume growth in the first quarter of this year. Could you share more insights into HTX‚Äôs current revenue performance and identify the key sectors driving this growth? Justin Sun: I‚Äôm confident that as long as HTX stays on the right course, sustainable growth will follow. Our strong brand influence, coupled with our established reputation as a veteran exchange, fosters deep and enduring trust among our user base.. The platform also benefits from significant organic traffic and demonstrates robust growth momentum, further solidifying our position in the industry. What sets us apart is our unwavering focus on doing what‚Äôs right, especially in security and risk controls. HTX has maintained an unblemished security record for over twenty months, a significant accomplishment considering the frequency of security breaches within the industry. This exemplary standard remains our top priority. We will soon launch a major win-back campaign for dormant users. If you‚Äôve been away from HTX, there‚Äôs never been a better time to come back and rediscover what we offer. The ‚ÄúReal Talk with HTX Executives‚Äù program was conceived based on my conviction that security is the paramount concern for cryptocurrency users. A lack of public engagement from exchange leadership can potentially erode user trust. This on-camera series will enable HTX executives to speak directly to our users, share important updates, and listen to their thoughts and concerns firsthand. This commitment to open communication is fundamental to how HTX continuously builds and reinforces user trust. There‚Äôs nothing quite like the trust that comes from face-to-face interaction. Direct dialogue between executives and users plays a vital role in fostering mutual confidence and reinforcing user trust in the platform‚Äôs products and services. It‚Äôs something I consider paramount. In response to inquiries about the future role of exchanges and HTX‚Äôs potential redefinition of the ‚Äútrading platform,‚Äù HTX representative @HTX_Molly provided her insights. She explained that HTX is evolving beyond the traditional exchange model, aiming to be a builder driving the industry‚Äôs long-term progress rather than a ‚Äúcrypto arcade‚Äù. By cultivating DAO culture and prioritizing community engagement, HTX is forging deeper connections among miners, developers, and users. This collaborative approach aims to facilitate the integration of Web3 from its current niche into mainstream adoption through genuine consensus-building. She stressed that ‚Äúdaily incremental progress is not just a slogan.‚Äù Writing solid code and providing comprehensive user support are the foundations for reshaping what an exchange can be. For HTX, rankings and short-term recognition are secondary; user trust is the platform‚Äôs most valuable asset. As she put it, ‚ÄúWe prefer to move forward slower, ensuring that every brick we lay can withstand the test of a bull market.‚Äù Addressing a user‚Äôs question about ‚ÄúHow does $HTX compare to other exchange tokens?‚Äù, Molly explained, ‚Äú$HTX is like HTX‚Äôs stock, backed by solid fundamentals rather than speculation.

Recent market indicators paired with bullish sentiment have reignited interest in XRP, with several analysts and community participants aligning around an optimistic outlook for 2026. The combination of improving technicals, upward revisions in price forecasts, and a solid support level near $2.37 is adding strength to the broader narrative. According to Binance‚Äôs latest forecast model, XRP is projected to hit $2.495738 in 2026, reinforcing the growing attention toward this established asset. This momentum, coupled with technical alignment on both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, positions XRP favorably in the coming quarters, especially in a market steadily regaining volume. Meanwhile, Qubetics continues to garner attention among early buyers as its QubeQode-powered infrastructure offers meaningful utility beyond speculative narratives. With more than $17.1 million already raised in its ongoing presale and over 513 million $TICS tokens sold, this rising contender is defining what the next generation of blockchain platforms should look like. As XRP builds toward new milestones, Qubetics is making its own mark through structured innovation, measurable ROI potential, and developer-centric functionality tailored for real-world application. XRP Price Prediction 2026: Growing Technical Strength Backs Forecasts The current price of XRP stands at $2.376894 as of May 20, 2025. Market participants appear increasingly confident that XRP will continue to move upward, supported by a strong ‚ÄúVery Bullish‚Äù consensus rating from over 56% of 774 voters on Binance‚Äôs sentiment tracker. The token has demonstrated steady performance, with predictions for May 2026 setting a potential price level at $2.495738. This aligns with a broader pattern suggesting gradual upward movement through 2030, where the token could reach as high as $3.033586. Several factors support this projection. XRP‚Äôs 50-day moving average is currently sloping up, and its 200-day moving average began to tilt positively as of May 15, 2025. This shift confirms a structurally bullish condition across both short-term and long-term indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also reflects a neutral stance, residing between 30 and 70, with no recent divergence, which reinforces a stable continuation of trend rather than imminent reversal. With no major resistance in the short term and supportive fundamentals in place, the mid-range XRP price prediction 2026 appears technically justified. Sentiment and Forecasts: How Users Are Aligning on XRP‚Äôs Trajectory The market consensus on XRP continues to build momentum heading into 2026. According to the platform data, the forecast curve suggests moderate but consistent growth. Users who participated in Binance‚Äôs predictive tool indicated a strong probability that XRP may trade near or above $2.495738 within the next year. Price expectations for subsequent years extend to $2.620525 in 2027, $2.751551 in 2028, and above $3.03 by 2030. These figures indicate growing long-term confidence in XRP‚Äôs capacity to regain ground lost during earlier consolidation phases. On a shorter horizon, XRP is forecasted to gradually rise over the next month, with a target of $2.386444 by June 19, 2025. This reflects a potential gain of approximately 0.4% in 30 days based on current trends. While these increases may appear modest compared to newer, more volatile assets, XRP‚Äôs appeal lies in its structural resilience and consistently improving base metrics. For long-term participants aiming to avoid speculative volatility, XRP offers a more measured profile with clearly defined growth projections. That makes XRP price prediction 2026 particularly relevant for those evaluating projects with trackable historic data and tested network performance. Technical Foundations Remain Stable Heading into the Next Cycle From a technical perspective, XRP continues to maintain structural integrity across major timeframes. The alignment of both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signals growing market stability. Importantly, there are no recorded bullish or bearish divergences in the RSI readings for the past 14 candles, which indicates the absence of trend reversal warnings. These conditions support the ongoing forecast of steady upward pressure, aligning with XRP price prediction 2026 across multiple sources. Price target models reinforce the technical readings. Whether viewed through daily forecasts or multi-year projections, the token‚Äôs valuation model suggests incremental but meaningful progression. The broader sentiment indicators and predictive analytics all point to XRP potentially solidifying its place among the most structurally sound digital assets over the next 12‚Äì18 months. While the asset may not deliver triple-digit returns in short order, its position as a value-retaining asset continues to strengthen, particularly as broader crypto sentiment recovers. Qubetics Is Reinventing Utility Through the QubeQode IDE and Tokenized ROI Design As XRP builds on its technical base, Qubetics is capturing attention for an entirely different reason: real-world functionality tailored for builders, freelancers, and enterprises. At the center of its offering is the QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment designed to make decentralized application development accessible without technical complexity. Through drag-and-drop components, pre-built user authentication modules, and token management tools, QubeQode transforms the blockchain development process into something practical‚Äîeven for non-engineers. This functionality is especially impactful for freelancers and small businesses looking to deploy secure, blockchain-based apps without incurring the cost of traditional backend development. Form-based configuration allows users to define application logic visually, while the embedded code snippet library speeds up development with tested components. Enterprises seeking to automate workflows, secure user authentication, or tokenize internal systems are now evaluating Qubetics as a functional alternative to expensive Web2 platforms. With its mainnet launch expected in Q2 2025, this initiative is gaining traction as more users discover the depth behind its technology stack. The Qubetics presale has also emerged as one of the most discussed initiatives among those looking for entry into the best crypto presale opportunities of 2025. Each presale stage lasts precisely seven days and ends every Sunday at 12 a.m., followed by a 10% increase in token price. Currently in Stage 35, Qubetics is priced at $0.2785 per $TICS token. Over $17.1 million has already been raised, and more than 513 million tokens have been distributed to a growing base of over 26,700 holders. What makes the Qubetics presale particularly compelling are the ROI projections associated with various post-launch scenarios. If $TICS reaches $1, buyers entering now would lock in a 258.95% return. A $5 valuation after mainnet would equate to 1,694.74% ROI, while a $6 price projects a 2,053.68% return. Should $TICS hit $10 after its utilities roll out, that return jumps to 3,489.47%, and a $15 outcome would deliver an exceptional 5,284.21% ROI. For example, a $5,000 investment in Stage 35 currently buys 17,950 tokens. If $TICS were to reach just $5, the total value of this holding would be $89,750. At $10, that climbs to $179,500, and at $15, the portfolio‚Äôs value would reach $269,250. These numbers underline why community participants are recognizing Qubetics as not only a technology project but a serious ROI proposition under the best crypto presale conditions currently available. Conclusion XRP continues to deliver a case for long-term confidence through well-aligned technical indicators and structured forecasts, with the XRP price prediction 2026 providing a compelling reason for its re-evaluation. Its consistent support near the $2.37 mark, combined with bullish market sentiment and upward-trending moving averages, strengthens its position as a viable hold through the next cycle. Meanwhile, Qubetics is defining a new direction for crypto adoption through developer empowerment and a clearly structured presale model. The QubeQode IDE offers immediate use cases for a range of users, while the $TICS token provides tangible ROI pathways for participants entering now. As the countdown to its Q2 mainnet launch continues, more buyers are choosing to join this best crypto presale ahead of the next round of price increases.

What The Charts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ready-new-aths-what-the-charts-say/,"An analyst has explained what some charts related to Bitcoin could say regarding whether the current run can lead to a new high or not. Bitcoin Momentum May Be Stalling According To These Signs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about some technical analysis (TA) signs that could reveal if it‚Äôs time for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says Here are the charts that the analyst has shared: The first graph shows a TA pattern that Bitcoin has potentially been trading inside for the last few months. The pattern in question is a ‚ÄúParallel Channel,‚Äù which emerges whenever an asset‚Äôs price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. There are different types of Parallel Channels, but in the context of the current topic, the most ordinary version is of interest: the one with the channel parallel to the time-axis. This case naturally corresponds to a completely sideways movement from the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that BTC has recently observed a rise to the upper line of the pattern. During previous retests, the coin ended up finding rejection at this mark. Thus, it‚Äôs possible that it may also face resistance here during the current retest. This isn‚Äôt the only trend that could make a break to the ATH a tricky one. As is visible from the second graph, the RSI has shown divergence from the Bitcoin price recently. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the speed and magnitude of changes that the asset‚Äôs price has witnessed recently. This metric is generally used for judging overpriced and underpriced conditions for the token. BTC‚Äôs RSI formed a peak in the overbought region earlier in the month, but while the price has gone up since then, the indicator has only managed to form a smaller peak. This type of divergence between the asset and the RSI is often considered to be a bearish signal. Lastly, there is also a bearish development in the MACD, displayed in the third chart. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is another TA indicator that‚Äôs used for gauging momentum. It involves two lines: the MACD line calculated by taking the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the price and the signal line determined as the 9-day EMA of the MACD line. Recently, the MACD line for Bitcoin has dipped under the signal line, which is usually considered as a bearish crossover. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $103,000 Relatively Cool Per This Indicator, Quant Says Based on all these patterns, Martinez has noted that momentum is stalling for BTC. It now remains to be seen how the asset would develop in the coming days and if a reversal to the downside would happen.

While BTC commands institutional dominance, many traders believe the real upside lies in smaller-cap assets that benefit from its momentum. That‚Äôs why tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP , and Cardano (ADA) are dominating current watchlists. With fresh inflows, expanding narratives, and key technical setups, these three may be best positioned to push toward the elusive 1,000x tier before the year ends. Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) round out the group with steady performance and ecosystem strength‚Äîbut the spotlight is clearly shifting toward early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE ‚Äì $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge: The Market Catalyst Bitcoin‚Äôs latest rally is driven by global economic uncertainty, institutional adoption, and regulatory clarity. Moody‚Äôs US credit downgrade and major banks enabling Bitcoin purchases have strengthened its narrative as a macro hedge, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, it often triggers a ‚Äútrickle-down‚Äù effect: capital first flows into BTC, then rotates into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Exponential Potential or Hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout among early-stage altcoins. With over $8 million raised and a presale price under $0.001, analysts project potential returns ranging from 35x to as high as 18,500% (185x), with some even suggesting a $1 target by year-end 2025‚Äîthough this would require a meteoric rise. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics (100 billion cap, 45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and viral meme appeal are fueling rapid community growth and investor interest. Conservative analyst targets: 35x‚Äì50x returns Aggressive projections: Up to 185x, with $1 as a ‚Äústretch‚Äù target Key drivers: Early entry, scarcity, community momentum XRP Prepares for Institutional Access XRP continues to trade above $2.30 , supported by speculation around CME Futures and potential ETF developments. With global settlement infrastructure already in place, and regulatory clarity opening the doors to institutions, XRP is being revalued by investors aiming for long-term growth. Price targets as high as $10‚Äì$15 are being floated as adoption expands. Cardano Shows Quiet Strength With Rebuilding Momentum Cardano (ADA) remains one of the most resilient Layer-1s, and recent upticks in smart contract deployment and active wallet usage are catching attention. While its pace is slower than peers, ADA is regaining confidence as a stable growth play‚Äîand some are looking at it as an undervalued opportunity heading into summer. Ethereum Anchors Portfolios With ETF Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is holding near $2,700 , bolstered by anticipation of spot ETF approval and strong Layer-2 expansion. While not as high-risk as other altcoins, ETH continues to provide solid upside potential for portfolios seeking stability in a rapidly evolving market. Cosmos (ATOM) Builds Developer Engagement Cosmos (ATOM) is seeing renewed developer activity and ecosystem interest. With cross-chain infrastructure gaining traction, ATOM may be one of the more underrated projects quietly building momentum behind the scenes. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE ‚Äì ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin‚Äôs strength is creating the conditions for the next round of high-return altcoin plays. While XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum offer layered value, it‚Äôs MAGACOIN FINANCE that currently holds the greatest potential for exponential returns . As early entry narrows and capital flows accelerate, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive opportunity of 2025.

Many market experts believe ETH could be preparing for another price jump, especially with important updates and events lined up. Doctor Profit‚Äôs move is a good example of how traders often book profits from one coin and invest those gains into another, based on current market opportunities. With Ethereum performing well compared to many other cryptocurrencies lately, it makes sense for traders to consider it for fresh entries.

The trio misled investors while selling ‚Äúrights certificates‚Äù linked to an unissued Unicoin token. The complaint , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, May 20, names chief executive and board chairman Alex Konanykhin, former president Silvina Moschini, and former chief investment officer Alex Dominguez. According to the SEC, the defendants inflated asset values and wrongly implied federal approval to boost sales. ‚ÄúWe allege that Unicoin and its executives exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises that its tokens, when issued, would be backed by real-world assets including an international portfolio of valuable real estate holdings,‚Äù said Mark Cave, associate director in the SEC‚Äôs Division of Enforcement. ‚ÄúBut as we allege, the real estate assets were worth a mere fraction of what the company claimed, and the majority of the company‚Äôs sales of rights certificates were illusory,‚Äù he added. The agency says Unicoin placed ads in airports, thousands of New York City taxis, on television, and on social media, portraying the certificates as a safe ‚Äúnext-generation‚Äù digital investment. More than 5,000 people bought in, believing each certificate would later convert one-for-one into Unicoin tokens. Unicoin CEO sold 37.9 million of his own certificates Investigators highlight three key misstatements. First, executives said the future tokens were ‚Äúasset-backed‚Äù by billions of dollars in property and stakes in pre-IPO firms, even though company assets were only a fraction of that figure. Second, they boasted of selling more than $3 billion in certificates, while actual proceeds never exceeded $110 million. Third, they described the certificates and tokens as ‚ÄúSEC-registered‚Äù or ‚ÄúU.S. registered,‚Äù though no registration had been filed. The complaint also accuses Konanykhin and the company of running unregistered offerings. Regulators say the chief executive sold more than 37.9 million of his own rights certificates, often at a discount. Unicoin, Konanykhin, Moschini, and Dominguez are charged with violating antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC asked the court for ‚Äúpermanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties ‚Äù and orders barring the trio from serving as officers or directors of public companies. The action also seeks civil fines against the company itself. The suit further names general counsel Richard Devlin, alleging he repeated similar false claims in private placement memoranda.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Bitcoin May Lead the Charge First",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-xrp-going-to-10-magacoin-finance-solana-and-bitcoin-may-lead-the-charge-first/,"Introduction With XRP showing strong technical structure and fresh investor interest, the question on every trader‚Äôs mind is whether a move to $10 is truly on the table. While XRP continues to gain strength, a handful of other tokens are already accelerating ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm, Solana (SOL) is maintaining bullish pressure‚Äîand MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning into one of the most talked-about early-stage altcoins of 2025. Alongside them, Polkadot (DOT) is starting to reenter investor conversations, rounding out a lineup of assets that could lead this cycle before XRP fully ignites. JOIN NOW ‚Äî $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as a Front-Runner MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most aggressively positioned altcoins on the market. Now entering the final stretch of Stage 8 , the project has raised over $8 million and is gaining attention for its unique mix of political narrative, capped supply, and high-engagement community. With a verified HashEx audit and a target listing price of $0.007 , analysts are treating it as a legitimate high-upside contender for this year‚Äôs altcoin breakout list. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from others in the meme and political token space is its structure. Investors from Bitcoin, Solana, and even XRP communities are now reallocating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for one reason: it still offers real asymmetric entry in a market where most plays are already priced in. XRP‚Äôs $10 Ambition: Hype or Reality? XRP is once again at the center of bullish speculation, with analysts and investors debating whether the token can reach the coveted $10 mark. As of May 2025, XRP is trading around $2.33‚Äì$2.60, buoyed by regulatory clarity after Ripple‚Äôs settlement with the SEC and renewed institutional interest. But is $10 a realistic target in the near or medium term‚Äîand what role do MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Bitcoin play in this evolving narrative? Bitcoin Anchors the Market, Fuels Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) : Bitcoin remains the benchmark, stabilizing above $100,000 and projected to reach $200,000‚Äì$250,000 by year-end as institutional demand outpaces new supply. Its continued dominance is setting a bullish tone for the entire crypto sector. Solana Maintains Its Position as the Cycle‚Äôs Layer-1 Leader Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $158‚Äì$175, with bullish forecasts targeting $240‚Äì$280 later in 2025 as its ecosystem grows and institutional adoption rises. SOL‚Äôs consistent performance is prompting some investors to rotate profits into emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside Polkadot Reenters the Spotlight on Ecosystem Revival Polkadot (DOT) is seeing a slow but steady return to relevance, with ecosystem upgrades and parachain innovations reviving investor interest. While still early in its rebound, DOT could become a solid rotation play as attention spreads beyond the biggest names. CLICK HERE ‚Äì TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP may be heading toward $10, but the path there may be paved by faster-moving tokens first. MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana , and Bitcoin are leading the charge, attracting early capital and building strong positioning in Q2 2025. With MAGACOIN FINANCE nearing Stage 8 completion, this could be one of the most time-sensitive opportunities in the market today.

Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH‚Äôs total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble‚Äôs size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups ‚Äì Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset‚Äôs market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum‚Äôs Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum‚Äôs impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset‚Äôs future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH‚Äôs 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses ‚Äì Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ‚Äã‚ÄãIn another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle‚Äôs upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum‚Äôs daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her ‚ÄúTalk Tuah‚Äù podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother‚Äôs house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam. ‚ÄúAfter the coin launch, the feds came to granny‚Äôs house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‚ÄòThe FBI is here after you, what have you done?‚Äô‚Äù Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who ‚Äúinterrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey cleared me, I was good to go,‚Äù Welch said. Welch went viral for her response about an oral sex technique in a vox pop interview posted to YouTube in June. The HAWK memecoin, based on her viral catchphrase, launched in early December and almost immediately lost 90% of its value and blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps‚Äô alleged insider wallets and snipers bought up and dumped massive quantities of the token at launch. Haliey Welch speaking on her Talk Tuah podcast about the HAWK memecoin. Source: YouTube Welch said on her podcast that the Securities and Exchange Commission also asked for her phone, and she sent it off ‚Äúfor two or three days‚Äù before she was cleared. Welch‚Äôs lawyer James Sallah told TMZ in March that the SEC ‚Äúclosed the investigation without making any findings against, or seeking any monetary sanctions from, Haliey.‚Äù ‚ÄúI trusted the wrong people‚Äù Welch admitted knowing very little about crypto before the HAWK memecoin and said she ‚Äútrusted the wrong people‚Äù for the launch. She claimed a company, which she said she couldn‚Äôt name for legal reasons, was in full control of her X account, which posted videos of her promoting the memecoin. Welch said she was sent lines to record on video, which were then posted on her X account by someone she trusted but could also not legally name. She added that on the day of HAWK‚Äôs launch, she ‚Äúkind of knew something was up‚Äù and was pulled into a room where a team of people told her to talk on a livestream with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, better known as Coffeezilla. ‚ÄúCoffeezilla got on there and they're like ‚ÄòMute it, mute it,‚Äô‚Äù Welch said. ‚ÄúNobody warned me about this guy at all, like nobody at all, they didn't tell me he was like a crypto wizard, that's exactly what he is ‚Äî he ate me the fuck up.‚Äù Related: Justin Sun to attend Trump's dinner with memecoin backers Welch said she was only paid a marketing fee and ‚Äúdid not make a dime from the coin itself,‚Äù which she said had been totally spent on legal and public relations fees. A now-deleted post where Welch shared the HAWK token‚Äôs tokenomics before it launched. Source: X Despite being cleared of any legal wrongdoing, Welch took some accountability, admitting that she let many of her fans down who invested in the coin: ‚ÄúIt makes me feel really bad that they trusted me, and I led them to something that I did not have enough knowledge about. I did not have enough knowledge about crypto to be getting involved with it. And I knew that, but I got talked into it, and I trusted the wrong people.‚Äù A group of HAWK buyers sued the alleged creators of the token in December, claiming Alex Schultz, the token‚Äôs backing Tuah the Moon Foundation, the token launchpad overHere Limited, and its founder Clinton So promoted and sold HAWK as an unregistered security.

While some legal experts following the case closely believe it might take a few more months before a final verdict is reached, misleading claims and rumours continue to spread on social media. Recently, a user named Altcoin Bale posted on X, claiming that the case was already closed, banks were quietly buying XRP, and retail investors would soon be priced out. But this statement didn‚Äôt sit well with pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan, who has been actively tracking the lawsuit. Bill quickly responded, saying, ‚ÄúFFS the case is not closed, or did you miss the news last week about an unsuccessful motion for an indicative ruling and an Appeal and Cross-appeal in abeyance but not over.‚Äù Another user replied to Bill, saying that the case had hit a procedural snag because both Ripple and the SEC submitted a dismissal request using the wrong form.

In simple terms, the judge stated that if the court‚Äôs jurisdiction were restored, she would deny the motion as it was filed under the wrong procedural rule. This means Ripple and the SEC will likely have to refile the motion correctly, and possibly plead their case once again.

The suit, brought to federal court on May 13, claims the company violated Illinois‚Äô Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by capturing users‚Äô facial data without proper notice or consent. Consumer Fraud and Data Breach Charges According to the submission , users were asked to upload a government ID and a selfie as part of the sign-up procedure. These images were then sent to third-party facial recognition tools that analyzed facial features like geometry and faceprints. However, the suit claims this was done without the consent of users, which the violates BIPA. ‚ÄúAt no point during the verification process are Coinbase users asked to consent to the collection of their biometric information, notified that their biometric data will be collected by an unrelated third party, nor provided with any information about the process,‚Äù the lawsuit states. The complaint also accuses Coinbase of transmitting this data to several third-party vendors, including Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris, without getting permission from the parties. Further, the document reveals that over 10,000 individuals filed arbitration demands, but Coinbase‚Äôs refusal to pay the required fees led to their cases being dismissed. As a result, the plaintiffs have charged the exchange with three claims of violating state biometric privacy laws and one for consumer fraud under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. They are seeking damages of $5,000 for every reckless or intentional violation, and $1,000 for each negligent one. The group has also lodged an order to stop the alleged data practices and wants Coinbase to cover its court costs. A Privacy Time Bomb This is not Coinbase‚Äôs first involvement in such legal troubles. In May 2023, similar action was taken over the company‚Äôs handling of facial recognition during onboarding. Meanwhile, the exchange is also dealing with the fallout from a recent data breach in which customer support agents were allegedly bribed to leak sensitive customer information. That incident caused at least six separate class-action lawsuits between May 15 and May 16, with Coinbase being accused of negligence, poor cybersecurity measures, and a slow response. Nanak Nihal Khalsa co-founder of Holonym, a privacy-focused identity company, said the problem is bigger than just the platform. ‚ÄúThe Coinbase breach proves what we‚Äôve known all along, KYC without zero knowledge is a privacy time bomb. You can‚Äôt collect and warehouse millions of user identities without eventually becoming both a target and a liability.‚Äù Khalsa added that users should not have to give up privacy just to access crypto services. According to the specialist, the future of identity is not in storing data but in using zero-knowledge tools that let people prove who they are without giving away personal details.

The price is trading above $0.740 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7580 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.760 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Upside Break In the past few days, Cardano saw a fresh increase from the $0.710 level, but it underperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to clear the $0.7250 and $0.7320 resistance levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7762 swing high to the $0.7110 low. However, the price is now approaching a couple of key hurdles on the upside, starting with $0.7580. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7580 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading above $0.740 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.7580 zone and the trend line. The first resistance is near $0.760 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7762 swing high to the $0.7110 low. The next key resistance might be $0.7720. If there is a close above the $0.7720 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.80 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.8250 in the near term. Another Decline In ADA? If Cardano‚Äôs price fails to climb above the $0.760 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.7420 level. The next major support is near the $0.7260 level. A downside break below the $0.7260 level could open the doors for a test of $0.710.

Latest Delay Explained,https://coinpedia.org/news/when-will-sec-approve-an-xrp-etf-latest-delay-explained/,"The post When Will SEC Approve an XRP ETF? Latest Delay Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Once again, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has hit the pause button on an XRP ETF proposal , this time from 21Shares. While it may sound disappointing, this delay is more routine than alarming. In fact, it would be way towards the approval of the XRP ETF. Despite such a massive news of delay XRP coin saw a slight a 2% drop in price in the last 24 hours. It‚Äôs Not a No‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Just ‚ÄúNot Yet The proposal from 21Shares to launch a spot XRP ETF is now delayed. But this is not a surprise. The SEC follows a long process before making decisions, and delays like this are very common. They usually take several months‚Äîup to 240 days‚Äîto review, gather public feedback, and study market data.So far, the SEC hasn‚Äôt approved any altcoin ETF‚Äînot even for Solana. It‚Äôs still testing the waters, just like it did with Bitcoin and Ethereum before giving them the green light. XRP Isn‚Äôt Alone in the Waiting Room This delay doesn‚Äôt just affect 21Shares. Other XRP ETF proposals from Franklin Templeton and Bitwise have also been pushed back earlier this year. But here‚Äôs the good news, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were also delayed many times before they were approved. It‚Äôs just how the process works. In fact, crypto analyst James Seyffart believes the SEC might take action by late June or sometime in the last quarter of this year. So, the wait may not be too long. Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets ‚Äî i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Positive Signs Are Already Here Even though there‚Äôs no ETF yet, XRP is moving forward in other ways. Regulated XRP futures have already gone live this week, showing that institutions are getting more comfortable with the token. That‚Äôs a big step toward wider acceptance. And according to Polymarket predictions, there‚Äôs an 83% chance that an XRP ETF will be approved by the end of 2024. That shows strong confidence in XRP‚Äôs future. XRP Saw temporary Dip, But Long-Term Hope After the news of the delay, XRP‚Äôs price fell by about 2%, now trading around $2.35.

The latest data from TradingView shows Tuesday's candle ended (UTC) at $106,830, the highest-ever daily closing price. The bullish move came as investors poured money into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid chaotic price action in bond markets that suggested heightened concerns about the fiscal health of major economies, including the U.S. Analysts told CoinDesk last week that the worsening fiscal debt situation could bode well for BTC and other assets such as gold. The Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index , which measures the percentage difference between the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and the price on Binance (USDT trading pair), remained positive, indicating a persistent buying pressure from the U.S.-based investors. With the uptrend in progress, the next key level to watch is $110,000. Data from Deribit's BTC options market, tracked by Amberdata, shows dealers or market makers hold a large net "" negative gamma"" exposure at the $110,000 level. Dealers holding negative gamma typically trade/hedge in the direction of the market to maintain their overall market exposure delta neutral. That, in turn, amplifies bearish and bullish moves. In other words, the rally may accelerate on a potential breakout above the $110,000 mark.

Texas is following in President Trump‚Äôs footsteps by calling for a national Bitcoin reserve . However, other states like New Hampshire and Arizona have already passed similar measures, beating Texas in the race to lead U.S. crypto integration. What‚Äôs Next? Lee Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council told Axios that while SB 21 sets up the reserve, separate legislation is being prepared to decide how much Bitcoin the state will actually allocate to the fund. That decision, however, remains pending. If signed into law, Texas could soon become a major player in government-backed Bitcoin investments, further cementing the state‚Äôs pro-crypto stance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Crypto Sensei noted that the report identifies a ‚Äú$12 billion annual gain‚Äù in productivity for existing markets and highlights the opportunity to create liquidity in traditionally illiquid assets. These developments are expected to transform asset accessibility, including in the housing sector, by enabling fractional ownership through tokenization. He also drew attention to the comparative lag in the U.S., contrasting it with the progress. Ripple‚Äôs Expanding Network in Australia Ripple has been active in the region for years. Crypto Sensei shared a clip where Eric Van Miltenburg, Ripple‚Äôs Senior Vice President of Business, confirmed the expansion of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors into Australia and other parts of the globe.

Here Are 2 Altcoins Going Viral,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/finding-the-next-crypto-to-explode-500-like-ripple-xrp-here-are-2-altcoins-going-viral/,"Ripple (XRP) has long been a crypto poster child for dramatic price surges. It is known to have exploded by over 500% in the past, fetching those who stuck with it gargantuan profits. But with its legal issue rearing its ugly head, XRP doesn‚Äôt look like replicating those meteoric rallies anytime soon. Instead, investors are looking towards Remittix (RTX) and Sui crypto tokens for such types of returns. Do these trailblazing tokens have what it takes to deliver? Let‚Äôs find out. Remittix holders prepare for a rocket price surge Remittix is a cross-border payments solution that bridges crypto and fiat seamlessly. Users send crypto, and recipients get instant bank transfers, with no blockchain complexity involved. With a flat-fee structure and support for 30+ fiat currencies, Remittix is poaching users from traditional giants like Wise and Western Union. The numbers speak volumes: over $15.2M raised in presale, more than half a billion tokens sold, and a 500% price increase since launch. These are metrics of a high-potential crypto token that is heading to the top. Crypto analysts expect Remittix to appreciate by at least 1,000% before its presale concludes, which makes its entry price of $0.0781 extremely attractive to investors. Even more, the coin‚Äôs presale is nearly concluded, which means that an exchange listing is imminent. When this happens, analysts expect the RTX price to surge to the moon. SUI crypto price booms 75% as institutional interest rises SUI is a Layer-1 blockchain platform that focuses on offering secure, scalable, and powerful decentralized applications. This means that it operates in an extremely competitive crypto niche, but that hasn‚Äôt stifled SUI. Over the last month, SUI price appreciated by 75%, hitting $4 for the first time since January. Sui derivatives volume. Source: CoinGlass In addition to that, institutional interest in SUI is rising. The coin recently saw weekly inflows to the tune of $9.3 million, eclipsing the likes of Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Should this continue, SUI could retest $4 and even hit a new high above $5. Can XRP price rediscover past meteoric forms? In late 2024, XRP surged by over 400% within weeks, sending shockwaves throughout the crypto world. Fast forward to May 2025, and XRP is once again in the spotlight. But this time, XRP isn‚Äôt making the news for spurious rallies; people are commenting about its never-ending SEC case and its struggles. After a US judge threw out a motion to finally resolve its case with the SEC, XRP has steadily declined. The coin has fallen from above $2.6 to around $2.3. While this drop is minimal, several signals suggest a bearish XRP run could be in the works. Source: TradingView In essence, XRP is displaying a classic head-and-shoulders pattern, which is basically a higher peak flanked by two lower peaks. It has bearish tendencies, and analysts suggest XRP could drop to $2 or lower should the status quo remain. Conclusion It would be difficult for XRP to embark on another 500% rally. Sui crypto might rally remarkably given its current momentum, but the resulting returns are likely to be minimal. Remittix, on the other hand, is set to rocket to the stars and fetch as much as a 10x profit for early investors. That‚Äôs because it packs immense potential to disrupt the global remittances market. This makes it the optimal choice for crypto investors who want to maximize their profits in 2025.

In 2024, the German government liquidated nearly 50,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $57,900, missing out on more than $2 billion in gains as BTC surged past $106,000. Meanwhile, US-based investment firm Strive is taking the opposite approach and accumulating Bitcoin by purchasing distressed Mt. Gox claims at a discount. Strive Targets Mt. Gox Claims to Expand Bitcoin Holdings Ahead of Asset Entities Merger Vivek Ramaswamy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy is entering a bold new phase. Strive, the investment firm co-founded by the former Republican presidential candidate, has disclosed a plan to acquire distressed Bitcoin claims from the long-defunct Mt. Gox exchange, an aggressive play designed to accelerate its transformation into a full-fledged Bitcoin treasury company. In a May 20 regulatory filing , Strive revealed it has partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target legally validated but undelivered claims tied to over 75,000 BTC‚Äîcurrently worth more than $8 billion at market prices. These claims are part of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate, which has yet to fully repay creditors more than a decade after the infamous 2014 collapse. The move, according to Strive, is aimed at acquiring Bitcoin at a significant discount compared to current spot prices. Since Mt. Gox claimants are often willing to accept less than full value in order to gain liquidity, Strive sees the opportunity as both financially compelling and strategic. By accumulating BTC through discounted claims, Strive aims to increase its Bitcoin -per-share ratio, thereby enhancing shareholder value, especially ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities (ASST), a publicly traded social media marketing company. Unlike a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) structure, which imposes additional regulatory and operational constraints, Strive argues the reverse merger offers greater flexibility in executing Bitcoin purchases and treasury management strategies. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger (Source: Strive ) The firm said it will soon file a proxy statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) outlining the full terms of the proposed Mt. Gox transaction. Shareholder approval will be required before Strive can proceed, and time is of the essence as Mt. Gox‚Äôs trustee is expected to begin full creditor repayments by Oct. 31, 2025. If Strive successfully acquires the claims before the repayment window closes, it could secure a substantial BTC cache at steep discounts, an outcome that would immediately elevate its standing among corporate Bitcoin holders. Mt. Gox: A Brief Background Once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after a massive security breach led to the loss of approximately 750,000 BTC, worth just hundreds of millions at the time, but tens of billions today. Since then, trustees have recovered and secured more than 140,000 BTC, with various entities and individuals holding legal claims. The repayment process has been slow and complicated by legal wrangling, evolving crypto regulations, and logistical hurdles. Strive is now capitalizing on this complexity, hoping to become a middleman between Mt. Gox and the open market by acquiring the right to those BTC allocations from existing claimants. Strive‚Äôs pivot toward Bitcoin mirrors a growing trend among companies looking to embed BTC into their balance sheets as a strategic reserve asset, a movement gaining significant momentum in 2025. A key example is Twenty One Capital, the Jack Mallers-backed Bitcoin treasury startup, which is preparing to launch with 42,000 BTC and has received strategic backing from Tether, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm is also merging via a blank-check deal with Cantor Equity Partners. Asset Entities Stock Surges on Merger News The market has responded positively to Strive‚Äôs plans. Shares of Asset Entities (ASST) surged 18.2% on May 20, closing at $7.74, according to Google Finance. The surge puts its current market capitalization at $122.1 million, representing a staggering 1,170% gain since the merger was first announced on May 7. Asset Entities share price (Source: Google Finance ) Following the reverse merger, Strive is expected to control 94.2% of the combined company, with Asset Entities shareholders retaining the remaining 5.8%. The merged firm will continue trading under the ASST ticker, but will operate under the unified brand name: Strive and Asset Entities. With strong market interest, favorable legal timing, and a clear path to gaining discounted BTC exposure, Strive is positioning itself to become a major corporate holder of Bitcoin, potentially rivaling firms like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Tether in scale and ambition. For Strive, the combination of a Bitcoin accumulation strategy and a reverse public market entry could establish a new model for digital asset treasury management. The firm is betting that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value appreciation will outweigh the risks involved in acquiring legacy claims. Should shareholder approval be granted and the Mt. Gox repayment schedule remain on track, the next six months could be transformative‚Äînot just for Strive, but for the emerging corporate Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. With regulatory oversight intensifying and macroeconomic volatility shaking confidence in fiat currencies, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly attractive hedge, and Strive is among the latest to make a bold, strategic bet. German Government Missed Out on Over $2 Billion in Bitcoin Gains After 2024 Sell-Off Meanwhile, Germany‚Äôs federal authorities may have inadvertently cost taxpayers billions of dollars by selling off a massive trove of Bitcoin far too early, according to a new analysis by blockchain intelligence platform Arkham. The decision to liquidate tens of thousands of BTC in mid-2024 has now become a cautionary tale in the world of government-managed digital assets, with missed profits exceeding $2.35 billion. In a post on X, Arkham revealed that a wallet labeled ‚ÄúGerman Government (BKA)‚Äù sold 49,858 BTC, worth around $2.89 billion at the time, between June and July of 2024. The average sale price of approximately $57,900 now looks deeply discounted in hindsight, as Bitcoin currently trades above $106,000, per CoinMarketCap. ‚ÄúIf they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24 billion,‚Äù Arkham stated. Seized Bitcoin Sold in Haste The funds were originally believed to have been confiscated by German law enforcement from Movie2k, a major piracy platform that was shut down in 2013. The site‚Äôs operators reportedly laundered tens of millions of euros through digital assets, including the nearly 50,000 BTC eventually transferred into a government-controlled wallet. The first signs of an impending sell-off emerged on June 19, 2024, when the wallet made a transfer of 6,500 BTC, valued at over $425 million, triggering speculation among analysts and market watchers about a coordinated liquidation strategy. However, that speculation quickly turned into confusion and concern as on-chain activity revealed that the German government was dispersing the BTC across multiple exchanges, rather than working with over-the-counter (OTC) desks or institutional brokers. The move sparked volatility in the Bitcoin markets and drew criticism for its lack of tactical finesse. Timeline of events (Source: CoinMarketCap) While the government‚Äôs intention may have been to maximize liquidity or preempt regulatory or market risks, the aftermath of the sale paints a stark picture. Arkham estimates that the early exit cost Germany over $2.35 billion in potential profit, given Bitcoin‚Äôs explosive 80% rally since the sell-off. Bitcoin‚Äôs price dipped sharply throughout June and early July 2024, a period that coincided with the BKA wallet‚Äôs most active selling. Analysts believe it was not the sheer amount of BTC sold, but rather the public knowledge of the sale that intensified bearish sentiment across the market. Bitcoin Price Recovers After Wallet Drains Interestingly, Bitcoin staged a recovery almost immediately after the German government wallet was depleted. On July 14, 2024, BTC rose back above the psychologically important $60,000 level, marking the end of a multi-week period of price suppression and investor caution. Amid the turmoil, Tron founder Justin Sun publicly offered to purchase the government‚Äôs Bitcoin stack, valued at over $2.3 billion at the time, directly from the state, in order to ‚Äúminimize market impact.‚Äù Sun‚Äôs proposal echoed a broader conversation within crypto circles about transparency, responsibility, and the systemic risk posed by large, sudden liquidations of digital assets by public institutions. Lessons for Global Regulators The German experience is now likely to serve as a reference point for other countries managing seized or tax-recovered crypto assets. Several governments, including the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, have begun exploring digital asset auctions or structured sales to reduce adverse market effects. As more jurisdictions deal with seized digital assets, analysts suggest governments should collaborate more closely with crypto-native custodians, financial advisors, and institutional trading desks to optimize their strategy‚Äîand reduce public losses. The missed windfall comes at a time when Bitcoin has increasingly been embraced by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate treasuries as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical instability. In 2025 alone, inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $20 billion, and sovereign wealth funds are rumored to be testing crypto allocations. Germany, one of the EU‚Äôs most economically powerful nations, had the rare opportunity to become a top sovereign Bitcoin holder. Instead, its decision to sell may go down as one of the most financially shortsighted in the history of public crypto asset management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 05:30:00

Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade‚Äôs arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the ‚Äòreal‚Äô value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it‚Äôs visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric‚Äôs value goes down, it‚Äôs a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn‚Äôt been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. ‚ÄúSince the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (‚Äì1.8% and ‚Äì8.4% respectively) ‚Äì but churn is notably lower as well (‚Äì8.5%),‚Äù notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week.

Meanwhile, Bancor launched a separate lawsuit against Uniswap, accusing the DeFi giant of patent infringement for using its constant product AMM technology without permission. This was a system Bancor claims it pioneered in 2016. Adding to the turmoil, bankrupt crypto lender Genesis sued parent company DCG and CEO Barry Silbert for allegedly siphoning more than¬†$1 billion through fraudulent loans and misleading transactions. The Genesis lawsuit seeks to recover more than $3.3 billion. Unicoin Hit With SEC Lawsuit The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency platform Unicoin and three of its top executives, accusing them of misleading investors and raising $100 million through deceptive and unsubstantiated claims. The charges were announced on May 20 and filed in Manhattan federal court. Press release (Source: SEC ) The lawsuit names Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former investment chief Alex Dominguez as defendants. According to the SEC, the three made false and misleading statements about so-called ‚Äúrights certificates‚Äù that investors purchased, believing they granted access to future Unicoin tokens and equity in the company. Unicoin executives The SEC alleges that these certificates were aggressively marketed as being backed by real-world assets, including a diversified international portfolio of valuable real estate. However, the regulator pointed out that the real estate assets were worth only a fraction of what was advertised, and most of the investment claims made to the public were either inflated or entirely fictitious. Associate Director of Enforcement Mark Cave stated that the executives exploited thousands of investors by promoting false opportunities that had little to no foundation in reality. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Unicoin and the people involved, along with disgorgement of what the SEC described as ‚Äúill-gotten gains.‚Äù This case is now part of the regulator‚Äôs scrutiny of crypto-related fundraising practices that skirt securities laws. Bancor Sues Uniswap for Patent Infringement Other crypto projects are also facing legal trouble. Bancor, a pioneer in decentralized finance and creator of one of the earliest automated market maker (AMM) protocols, filed a lawsuit against Uniswap, alleging patent infringement related to the core technology that powers modern decentralized exchanges. The lawsuit was announced on May 20 and was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. It accuses Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation of using Bancor‚Äôs patented invention without authorization and profiting from it. Bancor press release According to Bancor, the disputed technology revolves around the concept of a ‚Äúconstant product automated market maker‚Äù‚Äîwhich is a mathematical model that governs how assets are added to or withdrawn from liquidity pools. Bancor claims to have developed this method in 2016 and secured patents for it in early 2017. This innovation later became a foundational component of many DeFi platforms, and enabled token swaps without relying on traditional order books. Bancor alleges that Uniswap, which launched its protocol in November of 2018, utilized this same invention without permission and since became one of the most dominant players in the DeFi space as a result. Mark Richardson, project lead at Bancor, stated that the decision to take legal action stems from Uniswap‚Äôs continued use of Bancor‚Äôs technology without a license, and that such unchecked behavior could undermine future innovation in the sector. Top DEXs by 24 hour volume (Source: DefiLlama ) Despite being the originator of the AMM concept, Bancor has not matched Uniswap‚Äôs success in terms of trading activity. According to data from DeFi analytics platform DefiLlama , Uniswap ranks second among all decentralized exchanges with close to $3.7 billion in 24-hour trading volume on May 20. Bancor, by contrast, was ranked 142nd, with a comparatively modest daily volume of $378,579. Uniswap has processed an impressive $2.8 trillion in total trading volume since its inception. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for what Bancor describes as the unlicensed use of its patented system and wants to hold the Uniswap Foundation accountable for encouraging the continued infringement. Genesis Sues DCG and Barry Silbert for Fraud To add to the legal onslaughts in the crypto industry, Genesis filed two lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of orchestrating a massive scheme involving fraud, reckless mismanagement, and the siphoning of more than $1 billion in value from the now-bankrupt firm. The allegations were brought forth by Genesis through its Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), and claim that DCG and its affiliates drained funds via self-serving loans, concealed transactions, and manipulative accounting practices, ultimately misleading creditors and pushing Genesis further toward insolvency. A key component of the lawsuit was unsealed on May 19 in Delaware‚Äôs Court of Chancery. It describes how DCG allegedly treated Genesis like a corporate ATM by extracting over a million digital coins‚Äîvalued at $2.1 billion‚Äîwhile providing a false impression of Genesis‚Äôs financial strength. The complaint also shared more details about how Silbert and other insiders, including former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG CFO Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy, and investment banking partner Ducera Partners, conducted sham transactions at the end of multiple financial quarters in 2022. These moves were allegedly designed to mislead Genesis lenders into believing DCG was injecting liquidity into the lender, while in reality, the support was largely an illusion. Among the most damaging claims is that Genesis was forced to accept illiquid shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as collateral‚Äîshares that were not only locked for six months due to SEC restrictions but were also explicitly prohibited from resale by DCG even after the lockup period ended. Genesis creditors are still owed an estimated $2.2 billion in crypto assets, including over 19,000 Bitcoin and almost 70,000 Ethereum. In a second lawsuit that was filed in US Bankruptcy Court, Genesis accused DCG and affiliates of withdrawing more than $1.2 billion in digital and fiat assets during the year leading up to Genesis‚Äôs bankruptcy filing. These withdrawals allegedly took place during periods of extreme market stress, including the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX, at a time when Genesis was already insolvent . According to internal documents, insiders managed to recover nearly all their funds, while retail and institutional investors were left to shoulder the losses. DCG dismissed the lawsuits as baseless and opportunistic, and claims that the complaints recycle outdated accusations and ignore efforts that were made to resolve matters through negotiations. Nevertheless, Genesis is now seeking to recover over $3.3 billion through these legal actions.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|UNI,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 05:31:20
44888068,https://coinpedia.org/?p=458598,1747805835,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,New SEC Chair Paul Atkins Faces Heat Over Crypto Regulation and Political Bias,https://coinpedia.org/news/new-sec-chair-paul-atkins-faces-heat-over-crypto-regulation-and-political-bias/,"The post New SEC Chair Paul Atkins Faces Heat Over Crypto Regulation and Political Bias appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. SEC is again entering a controversial phase under new Chair Paul Atkins . In his first major congressional appearance, Atkins faced tough questions about the agency‚Äôs handling of crypto fraud cases, particularly its pause in proceedings against Justin Sun and the growing political noise around meme coins tied to Donald Trump . The hearing spotlighted concerns about regulatory inconsistency, lack of transparency, and possible political misuse. Lawmakers Raise Eyebrows Over Justin Sun and Meme Coins During the May 20 House Appropriations Committee hearing , Rep. Glenn Ivey questioned why the SEC appeared to slow-roll its fraud case against Sun, who recently disclosed he‚Äôs a top holder of a Trump-themed meme coin. This came after Tron‚Äôs $30 million token purchase from a Trump-inspired crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. While Atkins confirmed the case remains active, he avoided offering specific details, fueling speculation about external influence or internal hesitation. New Chair Signals Shift in SEC‚Äôs Crypto Strategy This sudden shift is quite fishy for senators, even though Atkins‚Äô presence has been seen as a positive shift from Biden-Gensler‚Äôs restrictive move. In his testimony, he stressed the need for structured guidelines around issuance, custody, and trading of digital assets. His emphasis on policy-making rather than litigation hints at a softer stance going forward. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: SEC Charges America‚Äôs First Crypto Company in $100 Million Crypto Scam , Crypto Task Force and Upcoming Policy Moves The SEC‚Äôs Crypto Task Force , now led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to release its first report in the coming months.

Meanwhile, with the Senate advancing the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill , Washington may be inching closer to a unified crypto policy.

This expansion includes new partnerships with Zand Bank and Mamo in the UAE, marking a notable milestone in Ripple‚Äôs international growth. BIG NEWS: Ripple now helps businesses in 6 countries move money across borders in minutes using $XRP ! Now in Dubai, U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Australia, and Switzerland ‚Äî with Zand Bank & Mamo just added in the UAE. ‚Äî Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) May 19, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs strategy to enhance cross-border payments has gained momentum in recent months, with several key developments supporting this trend. In April, Ripple integrated RLUSD, its stablecoin, into its Ripple Payments platform . This integration aims to improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border treasury operations for select customers, with plans to expand RLUSD‚Äôs use over time. One of the most impactful partnerships announced in April was the purchase of Hidden Road for $1.25 billion . This partnership positions XRP as a key player in mainstream financial transactions and enhances Ripple‚Äôs credibility among major financial institutions worldwide. It also makes Ripple the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. More Positive News for XRP In the UAE, Ripple‚Äôs recent licensing by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March paved the way for its official operations in the region. Following this, Ripple signed Zand Bank and Mamo as its first licensed blockchain payment clients in the UAE. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Both institutions will utilize Ripple Payments to enable fast, cost-effective cross-border transfers leveraging blockchain technology. The DFSA license addresses inefficiencies in legacy payment systems and supports the UAE‚Äôs growing fintech ecosystem. The company continues to onboard financial institutions across continents, including major banks in Brazil, Australia, and the United States, further reinforcing XRP‚Äôs role as a bridge currency in cross-border payments. XRP‚Äôs popularity is also growing, and the eagerness of both retail and institutional investors to engage with the asset shows its broad appeal. Excitement for XRP‚Äôs Future Recent developments demonstrate the accelerating adoption of XRP for cross-border payments across multiple countries. Santander, one of Ripple‚Äôs key partners, released a video outlining the importance of digital payments and how the crypto market could grow significantly by 2030 , and XRP is perfectly positioned to dominate this growing market. The combination of stablecoin integration, strategic partnerships with global giants, and regulatory clarity in key markets such as the UAE collectively affirm that countries are increasingly ready for XRP adoption in their financial infrastructure.

According to a May 20 complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Unicoin and its leadership, CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Maria Silvina Moschini, and former chief investment officer Alex Dominguez, made false claims while promoting ‚Äúrights certificates‚Äù tied to a future token, Unicoin. The company marketed these certificates as asset-backed instruments, supposedly tied to a multi-billion-dollar real estate and pre-IPO equity portfolio. In reality, the SEC claims, the assets backing Unicoin were worth only a fraction of what was advertised. Of the real estate deals highlighted in Unicoin‚Äôs promotional materials, spanning Argentina, Thailand, and the Caribbean, many never closed, and their combined value was estimated at no more than $300 million. The SEC also disputes Unicoin‚Äôs claims that it raised over $3 billion from investors. The agency alleges that actual sales amounted to roughly $110 million, gathered from more than 5,000 investors worldwide. Additionally, Unicoin reportedly touted its offerings as SEC-compliant or ‚ÄúU.S. registered,‚Äù even though the certificates were never officially registered and failed to meet exemption requirements under federal securities law . You might also like: Crypto languished in ‚ÄòSEC limbo‚Äô for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments Unicoin is also accused of distributing tokens via airdrops without verifying investor accreditation, which the SEC says constitutes another violation. CEO Konanykhin allegedly sold nearly 38 million certificates to investors who had previously been excluded to preserve the company‚Äôs legal standing. Unicoin‚Äôs general counsel, Richard Devlin, was also charged for his role in the scheme but has already settled with the SEC. Without admitting wrongdoing, he agreed to pay a $37,500 fine and accepted a permanent injunction. The SEC is seeking civil penalties, disgorgement of funds, and executive bans against the remaining defendants. In response, Konanykhin has denied the charges and vowed to challenge them in court, claiming the SEC‚Äôs actions damaged the company and blocked critical fundraising opportunities. Despite a massive shift toward more crypto- friendly policies under the Trump administration, the SEC continues to pursue enforcement in cases it views as involving clear fraud.

Traders are now locked onto Congress, where budget negotiations are stalling and blue state Republicans are throwing up roadblocks. The House‚Äôs massive federal budget bill hit a hard pause Tuesday when several GOP lawmakers refused to support it without a bigger write-off for state and local taxes, known as SALT. That demand is now threatening to derail the entire timeline for passage. Even with President Donald Trump getting directly involved in the talks, the standoff continues. The Republican leadership had initially aimed to pass the bill before Memorial Day weekend, but that goal is fading fast. And even if lawmakers in both chambers somehow reach a deal, the final version is expected to add more government debt, piling onto America‚Äôs already eye-watering $36 trillion deficit. SALT fight stalls Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòbeautiful bill‚Äô The SALT issue has become a battle line. Republicans from states with high local taxes want the bill to allow a larger deduction, or they won‚Äôt vote for it. Their threat is serious enough that it‚Äôs delayed everything. Trump has been actively pushing behind closed doors, but his efforts haven‚Äôt yet unlocked the gridlock. The delay is making investors nervous, and they‚Äôre watching every move from Washington like hawks. The bigger concern is what comes after a deal‚Ä¶ the consequences. If this bill goes through, analysts say it‚Äôs going to flood the bond market with more Treasury debt, which will likely drive interest rates up and hurt investor demand. Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a Tuesday note that Trump‚Äôs bill ‚Äúis likely to see various amendments before it is passed in the two chambers of Congress and signed into law, but it nonetheless is expected to add trillions of dollars to the country‚Äôs [$36 trillion] deficit over the next decade.‚Äù She warned that this could push the supply of Treasury debt even higher, which means more strain on the bond market. At the same time, Stephen Juneau, a US economist at Bank of America , warned of a possible ‚Äúbond-buyer-strike.‚Äù In his note, also released Tuesday, Juneau wrote, ‚ÄúAdding more supply to the market at a time when demand is softening could result in a spike in borrowing rates, a decline in the dollar, and a drop in equities. This could overwhelm any growth effects from the bill itself.‚Äù Wall Street slides as traders brace for budget chaos And the markets are already reacting. On Tuesday night, the S&P 500 closed down, breaking a six-day winning streak. The Nasdaq dropped too, logging its first red day in three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 100 points, snapping a three-day climb. By early Wednesday, futures tied to all three major indexes were also sliding. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures both dropped 0.3%, while the Dow gave up 120 points, or 0.28%. Investors had been hopeful just a few weeks ago. After Trump unveiled steep import tariffs back on April 2, markets dipped briefly, then staged a fast rebound. That rally had lifted all three indexes above their April levels, with the S&P 500 clawing back into the green for the year. The 30-year Treasury yield is now hovering just below 5%, a level not seen in years. Rising yields mean falling bond prices, and that spells trouble for a market already unsure about what comes next. Add the Moody‚Äôs credit downgrade from last week to the mix, and the pressure is stacking up fast. Meanwhile, the budget bill , originally billed as Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúone big, beautiful bill,‚Äù may still pass, but not without wrecking confidence along the way. And until Congress figures out how to deal with SALT, debt, and the deficit without wrecking demand in the bond market, Wall Street has no choice but to sit and wait‚Äîwith one eye on the headlines and the other on portfolios. There‚Äôs no major economic data scheduled for Wednesday, so for now, all eyes stay glued to Congress and the growing federal deficit.

At the time of writing, PI Coin ( PI ) is trading at $0.7796, up 6% over the last 24 hours. Still, it remains down 38% over the past week and more than 70% below its all-time high of $2.99, which was recorded in February. Trading volume also has risen slightly, with over $221 million in the past day, a 0.8% increase that suggests renewed market interest. Looking at the daily chart, technical indicators show mixed signals. The relative strength index is near 51, which points to a neutral trend. Meanwhile, momentum and moving average convergence divergence indicators show the persistence of some selling pressure. Pi Network price analysis. Credit: crypto.news While the 20- and 30-day moving averages have flipped to buy, indicating that some buying strength is returning, short-term moving averages, like the 10-day EMA and SMA, are still flashing sell signals. Support seems to be forming around $0.77, but the token will need to break above $0.84 to confirm a stronger recovery. You might also like: Pi Network price crashes amid insider sales, rug pull claims Although PI is showing early signs of recovery, it still faces significant challenges that could restrict any sustained price growth. Many users have been unable to access their coins since the mainnet‚Äôs February launch because of persistent Know Your Customer delays. This has caused frustration, especially among early miners who expected to freely use or trade their tokens. Concerns have also been raised regarding the coin‚Äôs absence from prominent exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Although PI is traded on sites such as Gate.io, Bitget, and OKX, the lack of a Tier 1 listing has kept liquidity low and held back wider adoption. Some community members believe the team‚Äôs limited transparency might be one reason for the lack of listings. There are also questions about the $100 million Pi Network Ventures fund, which was supposed to support new projects in the ecosystem, but has yet to show any progress. Despite having a large user base, possibly as many as 60 million, PI still has little practical application. Beyond speculation, there isn‚Äôt much demand for the token because there aren‚Äôt many widely used decentralized apps or decentralized finance services on the network. Events like PiFest have helped build hype, but without working products or real usage, price gains don‚Äôt tend to last. PI may target the $1 mark once more if it can maintain support above $0.77 and overcome resistance at $0.84. But if it doesn‚Äôt take off, prices might return to the $0.70 range. The price might find it difficult to increase much more unless important problems like token accessibility, exchange listings, and ecosystem growth are addressed.

Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Kaspa (KAS) have continued to show momentum, but another name is starting to rise. BlockDAG is now gaining attention with a strong mix of early access pricing, technical features, and growing support. Unlike projects that rely on hype, BlockDAG is grounded in real-world delivery and strategic development. Priced at just $0.0020 in its current presale, it offers a clear path to a confirmed launch price of $0.05, setting the stage for major returns. In this article, we look at how SOL, DOGE, and KAS are faring in today‚Äôs shifting landscape and why BlockDAG could soon be counted among the top crypto projects of 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Gem That Has Raised Over $258M! BlockDAG (BDAG) has become one of the most talked-about top crypto projects this year. Its $0.0020 presale entry stands out until June 13, which is much less than the $0.0262 original price of batch 28. With a confirmed launch value set at $0.05, those buying BDAG now are set for a projected ROI of 2,400%, making it a standout in today‚Äôs crowded space. To date, more than 20.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold and $258 million raised. This shows strong market interest. What gives BlockDAG an edge is its EVM-compatible Layer 1 setup, allowing it to run Ethereum dApps without added complexity. It‚Äôs a ready-to-use network from day one. The project has passed a full CertiK audit and has begun shipping its 17,000+ mining units, showing that it‚Äôs already active and functioning. Five exchange listings are already confirmed, and 15 more are planned to be revealed during the June 13 GO LIVE event, bringing the total to 20 platforms set to support BDAG. If you are watching for top crypto projects with real traction and early pricing, BlockDAG is one to keep in view. The $0.0020 level might not last much longer as it moves toward a wider market release. 2. Solana (SOL): Staying Strong with DeFi Growth Solana continues to demonstrate resilience. Trading near $173, SOL recovered after a decline sparked by FTX‚Äôs move to release $5 billion in assets, including $236 million worth of unstaked SOL. This update led to added sell pressure but hasn‚Äôt shaken Solana‚Äôs core strengths. Solana‚Äôs DeFi total value locked (TVL) jumped from $7.5 billion to $9.6 billion in May. Such growth reinforces its standing among the top crypto projects, especially for those focused on decentralized finance and practical use cases. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Standing Out in a Shifting Market Space Dogecoin, priced at approximately $0.2271, is showing it has staying power beyond its meme roots. The network recorded a 528% rise in active addresses after the SEC acknowledged a spot Dogecoin ETF filing by 21Shares. Futures open interest also rose by 70%, reaching $1.65 billion. Analysts suggest DOGE may push past $0.24 and aim for $0.40 if momentum persists. While its origins remain lighthearted, growing adoption and trading activity make DOGE a notable mention among top crypto projects. 4. Kaspa (KAS): Price Patterns Drive Positive Momentum Kaspa (KAS) gained 30% in the past week, currently trading at about $0.1189. A bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart and solid support at the $0.101 Fibonacci level are helping to boost confidence. Short-term expectations now target $0.1554. With strong community support, scalable architecture, and an engaged development team, Kaspa is earning its place among the top crypto projects gaining attention. Future Outlook: Emerging Strength Across the Board Solana‚Äôs DeFi expansion signals solid growth, Dogecoin is gaining traction through ETF developments, and Kaspa is showing strength with technical gains. Each has qualities that justify its place among top crypto projects today. BlockDAG, however, is the outlier rising fast. At $0.0020 and set for a $0.05 launch, it features EVM compatibility, a completed CertiK audit, and 20 exchange listings on the way. With over 20.8 billion coins already sold and 17,000 miners running, its foundation is already active. For those watching early-stage projects with solid structure and future promise, BlockDAG could be one of the top crypto projects to watch in 2025. It is gaining ground before broader market recognition arrives.

Institutional inflows remain steady, and long-term projections toward $250,000 are now more widely accepted than ever. But while Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, savvy investors are noticing a much faster-moving trend under the surface‚Äîone that‚Äôs shifting momentum toward smaller, faster, and more narrative-driven altcoins. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Quietly but rapidly, it has begun outpacing some of the biggest names in the space‚Äîincluding Solana , XRP , and HBAR ‚Äîby wide margins. This isn‚Äôt just early hype. It‚Äôs a signal. CLICK HERE ‚Äì ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Why Everyone‚Äôs Talking About MAGACOIN FINANCE Right Now The speed at which MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the radar has taken many by surprise. Originally launched as a politically inspired altcoin, it‚Äôs since gained serious market traction thanks to strong fundamentals, bold branding, and capped supply mechanics that reward early positioning. What‚Äôs making traders pay close attention is the clear divergence in performance. While larger caps are still consolidating, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown consistent growth in both volume and community strength. Early metrics suggest it‚Äôs outperforming some competitors by as much as 10 to 1 ‚Äîand that gap could widen once listings begin. A transparent roadmap, and rising organic attention, this project is no longer flying under the radar. Many believe it may become one of 2025‚Äôs defining early-stage altcoin stories. Solana Holds Support, But Lacks Immediate Breakout Solana (SOL) remains one of the most technically robust Layer-1s, but recent weeks have seen it trade in a tight range. Developers continue to build, but traders seeking rapid upside are beginning to rotate into faster-moving opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE while SOL consolidates. XRP Eyes Expansion but Faces Resistance XRP is stable above $2.30 and remains in accumulation mode ahead of the CME Futures launch. While long-term fundamentals are strong, short-term growth has slowed, giving investors time to seek higher-velocity opportunities elsewhere. HBAR Builds Slowly on Utility Strength HBAR continues to add enterprise-grade partnerships and long-term value through real-world integrations. However, its price performance has yet to reflect these developments, leading more aggressive investors to allocate toward higher-momentum plays. CLICK HERE ‚Äì FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Bitcoin‚Äôs rally is undeniable‚Äîbut for those seeking real movement, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. With stronger growth than Solana , XRP , and HBAR combined, it‚Äôs emerging as one of the most compelling early-stage opportunities of 2025. For traders focused on speed, scarcity, and outsized return potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the move others are too late to catch.

Speaking before the House Budget Committee, Atkins was questioned about memecoin projects linked to President Donald Trump and his possible ties to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun. Democratic Representative Glenn Ivey drew attention to some events that took place before Trump‚Äôs inauguration in January. Ivey brought up the $30 million token purchase by Tron, a company owned by Justin Sun, from decentralized finance firm World Liberty Financial, which said it was inspired by Trump. The SEC later suspended the fraud case against Justin Sun and his companies. This development led to various speculations in the public. On the other hand, a memecoin connected to Trump is currently trading on the market and Trump is preparing to hold a special gala for the first 220 memecoin investors this week. ‚ÄúThis situation doesn‚Äôt smell good to me, frankly. I hope the SEC looks into this connection,‚Äù Ivey said. Atkins, on the other hand, stated that the case against Sun is still ‚Äúactive‚Äù and reminded that the SEC does not classify memecoins as securities. Related News: Analyst Warns: ‚ÄúBitcoin's Record High Has No Meaning, Focus on This Level Instead‚Äù Atkins, who was appointed by Trump, said that the institution had entered a ‚Äúnew era‚Äù after his predecessor Gary Gensler took a ‚Äúhostile‚Äù stance against the crypto industry. During Gensler‚Äôs term, the SEC filed numerous lawsuits against the industry, but some of them were later dropped. In his written statement, Atkins described his plan for crypto regulation as ‚Äúrulemaking through a notice and comment process.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy primary goal during my presidency will be to develop a sound regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that operates with clear rules,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis framework will continue to deter malicious actors who engage in illegal activities while regulating issuance, custody and trading processes.‚Äù Republican Representative Chuck Edwards asked whether the SEC‚Äôs newly established crypto task force needed additional funding. The task force, established earlier this year by former interim chairman Mark Uyeda and led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, aims to clarify how securities laws apply to crypto by holding roundtables with industry representatives. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a definitive opinion,‚Äù Atkins said. ‚ÄúThe task force is comprised of existing staff and led by Commissioner Peirce, so there is no additional budget request,‚Äù he added. *This is not investment advice.

According to a May 21 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, trading volume has spiked as Ethereum ( ETH ) nears this resistance zone. This increase in activity has coincided with a spike in short-term profit-taking. When a market is said to be ‚Äúoverheating,‚Äù it typically means that prices have risen too quickly due to speculation rather than long-term conviction. In this instance, ETH‚Äôs quick 55% recovery over the last month after a 45% decline in Q1 raises the possibility that the rally may be about to pause or reverse. The overheated market suggests a potential short-term pullback, creating room for fresh accumulation once conditions stabilize. Technical data supports this view. The relative strength index, at 69, is hovering just below the overbought zone, a level that often precedes short-term corrections. Meanwhile, momentum is still positive and all of the major moving averages, from the 10-day to the 200-day, are pointing upward. This suggests that there is still strong underlying support even when the current price action has stalled. Ethereum price analysis. Credit: crypto.news If Ethereum is unable to break $2,700, it may retreat to the $2,300‚Äì$2,350 range, where support is starting to form. If there is a more significant correction, prices may approach $2,100. However, the rally may continue if ETH makes a strong breakout above $2,700 on high volume, particularly if there are positive developments to back up the breakout.

Behind the scenes, large players appear to be positioning for what could come next. On-chain data shows that since late April, large holders, wallets with more than 10,000 ETH, have accumulated more than 450,000 ETH. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds have seen $108 million in net inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . Now, a significant catalyst is approaching. By June 1st, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make a decision regarding the inclusion of staking in ETH ETFs. By allowing institutions to earn yield from these regulated products, it could stir a new wave of demand. Along with the demand for ETFs, London-based asset manager Abraxas Capital purchased 350,703 ETH, worth about $837 million, between May 7 and May 20. With favorable on-chain trends and increasing institutional appetite, Ethereum‚Äôs long-term narrative seems intact despite short-term pressures.

The altcoin dropped to $2,400 before staging another recovery and returning to $2,600. New data now point to the possibility of a short-term pullback before a potential breakout materializes. Cooling Period Before Breakout Ethereum‚Äôs market is showing signs of overheating as it nears the $2.5K resistance level. There has been a surge in trading volume, which indicates intensified activity. In fact, according to CryptoQuant‚Äôs latest report , the sharp uptick is attributed to profit-taking and the presence of resting supply at this key psychological level. As Ethereum enters an overheated state, analysts anticipate a short-term correction that could allow the market to cool before potential upside resumes. ‚ÄúConsequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term.‚Äù While short-term market signals suggest a cooling phase, long-term holders continue to accumulate the altcoin. Long-Term Conviction Ethereum‚Äôs presence on centralized exchanges has fallen to its lowest point in over a decade, driven by growing accumulation from institutional investors and large holders. As of May 19, Santiment reported that only 4.9% of the total ETH supply is held on trading venues, which represents a historic low. Over the past five years, 15.3 million ETH have been pulled from these platforms. Meanwhile, CryptoRank.io revealed that more than 1 million ETH exited exchanges in the last month alone. This trend suggests that users are leaning toward holding ETH long-term rather than trading it. On-chain data confirms this behavior as it shows whales ‚Äì wallets with over 10,000 ETH ‚Äì have accumulated 450,000 coins since late April. By May 10, they collectively held 40.75 million ETH, the highest level since March. Ethereum-linked investment products also saw a much-needed respite over the past week, recording inflows of $205 million during the period, amidst a renewed investor confidence following the Pectra upgrade. This brought its year-to-date total to $575 million.

Designed to use the BEP-20 protocol on Binance Smart Chain, $KOPS provides high-speed, cost-effective transactions, support for Ethereum interoperability, and access to a versatile ecosystem that spans two chains. $KOPS is aiming for a decentralized framework with more than 8,000 members in its private Telegram group and a target to reach 10,000+. As the TRUMP Coin remains a catalyst for change in the crypto and financial fields, the KOPS project is strategically preparing for an ICO. With attention growing in the crypto community, the team plans to enter the blockchain market, promoting decentralization, utility, and active investor participation. Gaining early attention in cryptocurrency communities, the project intends to launch in the blockchain space with an emphasis on decentralization, utility, and investor participation. $KOPS Emerges from a Tale of Rebellion and Identity Interest in $KOPS is increasing owing not only to its market position but also to its narrative grounded in resistance and survival. The project is inspired by a fictional tale where a young pig, shamed and ridiculed after his father‚Äôs failed rebellion, disappears into exile. Left only with his father‚Äôs sunglasses‚Äîan inherited symbol of quiet defiance- he returns years later, no longer the subject of jokes but a masked fighter in the king‚Äôs arena. After defeating the tyrant‚Äôs strongest warriors, he removed his mask and revealed his identity. The pig that was once mocked now stood proud, crowned the King of Pigs. He led the suppressed people together and established a place where laughter did not depend on making fun of others. To gently symbolize the leadership he now held, he continued to keep his father‚Äôs sunglasses. The Technology Powering $KOPS and Its Advantages When the TRUMP was launched during January, we all know that it is a politically influential token. But the case of KOPS is different. The KOPS team has a real purpose to achieve and has built it on the most robust Binance Smart Chain. This way it ensures decentralization, community benefits like zero-trading fee, and maximum security. How KOPS Is Building a Community-Led Future in Crypto The development of the token‚Äôs community is accompanied by a robust commitment to collaborative governance, introducing a fresh model in blockchain administration. Currently, KOPS has more than 8,000 users in a private Telegram group, where they work together and talk about the future of the token. This close community anticipates growing, with a shared goal of uniting 10,000 people to advance innovation in the world of cryptocurrencies. As the pool of $KOPS holders enlarges, the group‚Äôs potential impact becomes more significant. The token is founded on principles of collective decision-making, so holders of $KOPS can influence the token‚Äôs future. This is not just about financial value, but about reshaping the way crypto communities operate in the future. The Premium Update The KOPS team is entering the market with a bang, and it‚Äôs time for you to grab the golden opportunity. The ICO event is going to happen, and it‚Äôs time for investors and traders to keep their wallets funded. To know more about the Pigdom, follow on.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin Pepe is turning heads as the first meme ICO on Bitcoin, raking in $1 million in 24 hours ahead of a May 31 listing set to shake up crypto‚Äôs most serious chain. There‚Äôs something brewing on Bitcoin that has the crypto crowd leaning in. Bitcoin Pepe has hauled in $1 million in just 24 hours, with its presale exploding ahead of a high-stakes May 31 listing. Bitcoin is holding strong above $100k in Q2 2025, pushing its market cap past $2.1 trillion, now surpassing giants like Google. Amid that macro strength, Bitcoin Pepe is exploding in popularity as it is doing the unthinkable: making Bitcoin fun again. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, and it‚Äôs gone full viral. It‚Äôs a bold attempt to breathe new life into the BTC chain with utility, virality, and a serious nod to earning potential. This $10.5m raise at only $0.0359 is proof that the market sees real potential in the chain‚Äôs first meme-layer revolution. Here‚Äôs why. ‚ÄòSolana on Bitcoin‚Äô goes live on May 31 Bitcoin‚Äôs already in the endgame; Wall Street‚Äôs all in, the suits are treating it like digital gold, and the fun‚Äôs been sucked out of the room. But Bitcoin Pepe is flipping the lights back on for everyone else. This is the first-ever meme ICO on Bitcoin, but the bigger story is what comes next: a foundation for a fully expressive, fast-moving crypto economy on the world‚Äôs most secure chain. At the heart of this push is PEP-20, a new token standard that lets anyone issue assets directly on Bitcoin, and that could be anything from NFTs to memecoins to other DeFi activities. It‚Äôs the same unlock ERC-20 gave Ethereum, and it could set off a similar explosion of user-generated assets, memes, and communities rooted in Bitcoin‚Äôs native layer. The Bitcoin memecoin supercycle is officially on. BPEP forecast: The real degen trade after BTC‚Äôs ATH? Bitcoin Pepe has eyes on a monster debut, and the charts could light up once it lists. Early chatter suggests that listings may occur on major platforms, including Bybit, OKX, and possibly others. That means access, exposure, and serious trading volume. As that May 31 launch creeps closer, don‚Äôt be surprised if BPEP starts pulling liquidity and attention away from the usual suspects. Bitcoin‚Äôs setting the tone, but this is the afterparty people actually want to be at. The fusion of BTC‚Äôs trust with Solana-style speed is the formula for retail frenzy, especially now that BTC itself is climbing and the broader market‚Äôs turning risk-on. Memecoin mania is already rebooting. Projects like Moo Deng and Goatseus Maximus are making a triple-digit comeback, showing just how fast this sector can flip bullish. Solana gave us a 1,000x run. Bitcoin Pepe might just outdo that because BPEP has something SOL never did: Bitcoin‚Äôs name, its trust, and its untapped potential. The slam‚Äôs coming Bitcoin has grown up, institutions treat it like digital gold, and it‚Äôs the reserve asset of the internet, but Bitcoin Pepe is what could pull retail back into the game. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme ICO on Bitcoin. This alone puts it in the history books, but what happens next could write an entirely new chapter for meme culture on crypto‚Äôs most boomer chain. With Tier-1 listings locked in and over $10.5m raised, Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs got the ball and is sprinting toward the rim. Just as Bitcoin makes headlines with trillion-dollar comparisons, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the next leg of the trade, the slam after BTC‚Äôs alley-oop. Listings drop May 31. That‚Äôs less than 11 on the countdown.

Over the past six weeks, Bitcoin has rallied roughly 40%, and held above $100,000 for more than 11 days.

The passage, which appears on page 1606 of Volume 66 of the journal, suggests that purchasers of XRP may have, in effect, acquired a portion of Ripple‚Äôs anticipated future cash flows generated through licensing its transaction settlement technology. SMQKE‚Äôs post emphasized the significance of the excerpt, quoting directly: ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, XRP purchasers have bought, effectively, a slice of the future cashflows that Ripple would make from the licensing of its transaction settlement system.‚Äù The statement is part of a broader discussion about the relationship between Ripple‚Äôs business model and the distribution of XRP tokens. XRP HOLDERS OWN A SLICE OF RIPPLE‚ÄôS FUTURE CASHFLOWS Read closely. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, XRP purchasers have bought, effectively, a SLICE OF THE FUTURE CASHFLOWS that Ripple would make from the licensing of its transaction settlement system.‚Äù Of course it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/kADEC1GbRT ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 19, 2025 Passage Raises Questions About Security Classification According to the excerpt, Ripple funds its activities through XRP distributions in exchange for investment capital and labor. The line suggesting XRP purchasers effectively acquire future cash flows implies a structure similar to that of a security. The passage compares tracking stocks and asset securitizations, stating that such instruments serve effectively the same economic function. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, the same excerpt also acknowledges the complexity of categorizing XRP. It notes that Ripple has structured its business in a way that gives it room to argue against the classification of XRP as a security. Specifically, the text mentions that Ripple can claim there are no direct contractual rights between the company and XRP holders and that XRP is used as more than a speculative asset. Community Reactions Address Legal and Temporal Context SMQKE‚Äôs tweet has been met with skepticism and analysis by other users. One user, Aurelia Isley, remarked , ‚ÄúThat would make XRP a security so I doubt this is real we just dealt with a four-year lawsuit about this topic.‚Äù Another user, KYCAT, responded , ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs interesting, however, XRP has already been classified as not a security. What is the date of the article? I suspect it‚Äôs pre-court ruling.‚Äù The court ruling likely pertains to the 2023 decision in the SEC v. Ripple Labs case, in which the Judge determined that XRP was not a security. However, some institutional sales were found to be investment contracts. This outcome led to partial regulatory clarity around XRP, implicating how crypto assets are categorized under U.S. securities laws. The excerpt highlighted by SMQKE is evidence of documented legal commentary suggesting a deeper economic linkage between XRP ownership and Ripple‚Äôs licensing revenue. The implications of such a view could reignite debates over the nature of crypto assets and their classification under securities law, particularly in light of recent and ongoing litigation in the digital asset space.

Speaking at the New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams said it has the potential to attract investment, create jobs, and cement New York‚Äôs position as a global centre for blockchain innovation. ‚ÄúWe want to use the technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today,‚Äù Adams said during his speech, adding that the council would help position New York as the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the globe.‚Äù The advisory body will be composed of industry experts tasked with identifying use cases that serve the public interest. While full details of the council are still pending, Adams confirmed that a chairperson would be appointed and that key policy recommendations are expected in the coming weeks. Adams revealed that New York City is exploring blockchain use in administrative functions, including managing sensitive records like birth and death certificates. ‚ÄúBringing blockchain security capabilities to the city means that birth certificates and death records can remain private but accessible,‚Äù he noted. Further, he added that the city is evaluating whether select services and taxes can be paid in cryptocurrency, as part of a broader initiative to modernise financial infrastructure.

He is well known for converting his first three mayoral paychecks into Bitcoin as a symbolic gesture of support . That vision is increasingly being echoed at the state level with top New York officials pushing for a pro-crypto environment. For instance, in April, Assembly member Clyde Vanel reintroduced a bill to allow New York agencies to accept cryptocurrency for fines, taxes, and other obligations. Vanel has also advocated for studying blockchain‚Äôs role in securing election systems and protecting voter data. If passed, his bill would require the State Board of Elections to deliver findings within a year.

Gox at Discount appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Strive, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking to scoop up 75,000 Bitcoin tied to Mt. Gox, the bankrupt exchange that famously collapsed in 2014. These Bitcoins are part of claims that have already received legal clearance but haven‚Äôt yet been distributed. By acquiring them, Strive hopes to buy Bitcoin at a discount and boost its crypto holdings fast. The Plan Behind the Purchase In a May 20 filing , Strive revealed its partnership with 117 Castell Advisory Group to pursue the claims. The company says this move will help it grow its Bitcoin-per-share ratio ahead of its reverse merger with Asset Entities, a deal expected to wrap up by mid-2025. Interestingly, Strive hasn‚Äôt disclosed any Bitcoin holdings yet but claims it has more flexibility than typical public companies when it comes to buying BTC. What‚Äôs Next? Shareholder Green Light Before making a move, Strive will need shareholder approval. The firm is preparing a filing for the SEC and will send out a proxy statement to outline the deal and get the go-ahead. In the meantime, Mt. Gox is expected to repay its creditors by October 31, meaning Strive has to act fast. Mt. Gox was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange before a 2014 hack wiped out 750,000 BTC. Creditors have waited over a decade for repayment, and now companies like Strive are stepping in to grab discounted claims. A Trend Among Bitcoin Treasury Firms Strive isn‚Äôt alone. New firms like Twenty One Capital, backed by Tether and SoftBank, are also diving into the Bitcoin treasury game, planning to launch with tens of thousands of BTC. Moreover, Strive‚Äôs merger partner , Asset Entities (ASST), has seen its stock skyrocket, jumping 18.2% on May 20 and up 1,170% since the merger news broke. Once the deal closes, Strive will control 94.2% of the merged company, which will continue trading under the ASST ticker. Strive Joins the Bitcoin Rush Overall, the move shows that Strive‚Äôs motive to buy more Bitcoin follows the lead of big players like Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy and Japan‚Äôs Metaplanet. Just this week, Strategy grabbed 7,390 BTC worth nearly $765 million, bringing its stash to over 576,000 BTC. Metaplanet also added 1,004 BTC, now holding 7,800 in total.

In Q1 2024, when the critical demand zone was seen tested at $2, the next few months showed a catastrophic rise. Similarly, in 2025, the adoption and institutional interest will rise, and improving regulatory and geopolitical conditions are nourishing the entire altcoin market too.

Currently the bulls hold strong as the XMR price maintains its ascending channel pattern. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to continue holding above the $360 mark after brief consolidation below the $340 mark. However, the bulls need to guard the $330 and $325 key support levels to prevent a fallback below the $320 price mark. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR up today? Monero price gained increased buying demand below the $340 dip. This resulted in a strong push toward $360 level, strengthening the buying domination. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero‚Äôs commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Through a series of annotated charts, Egrag outlines the historical significance of the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 33-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) as primary indicators for identifying both bull market tops and the beginning of major declines. #XRP ‚Äì The Secrets Are Revealed ($5.7, $9.5, $27 & $37): It all comes down to the relationship between the 21 EMA and the 33 SMA.

According to his post, whenever the 21 EMA crosses below the 33 SMA on the weekly chart‚Äîa formation he refers to as a ‚Äúbearish cross‚Äù‚Äîit has historically coincided with the start of prolonged downtrends in XRP‚Äôs market cycle. He identifies two key instances in the past where this occurred: first in May 2018 and again in November 2021. In both cases, XRP suffered significant losses following the cross, with approximately 87% and 72% declines, respectively. Egrag calculates the average of those two drawdowns to forecast what a future bearish cross might imply. Applying the average decline of 79.5%, he estimates the potential downside if such a signal emerges again. He warns that despite possible short-term optimism from market participants, the bearish cross should be taken seriously as a major trend reversal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Crosses: Launchpads for Significant Price Surges Conversely, Egrag emphasizes the positive implications of the opposite signal‚Äîa bullish cross‚Äîwhen the 21 EMA moves above the 33 SMA. His historical review identifies four major instances where such bullish crosses preceded significant price surges. In each of those events, XRP underwent substantial upward movement, including a 1600% surge, which he uses as a reference for his current outlook. Based on the present chart structure and the recent performance of XRP around the EMA/SMA levels, Egrag speculates that a similar rally could be on the horizon. He projects a potential rise toward $27, citing the 1600% historical move as precedent. His charts illustrate extended targets, including speculative price levels as high as $37, representing a 6500% increase from current levels. Mid-tier projections include $5.712 and $9.575, aligning with past market reactions and Fibonacci-based resistance zones. Critical Support and Timeline Marker Identified The analysis also includes a clearly defined threshold at $1.6394, shown in red across all visuals, potentially acting as a support level or invalidation point depending on price action in the coming weeks. The timing of this analysis is further underscored by a vertical marker on the chart pointing to September 29, 2025, which appears to be highlighted as a pivotal future date. However, no explicit rationale is given in the tweet for its significance. In conclusion, Egrag Crypto acknowledges that markets are unpredictable but maintains that these technical signals remain highly relevant. His message to XRP holders is one of vigilance, encouraging them to stay alert to moving average dynamics rather than sentiment-driven speculation.

The company‚Äôs stock has surged over 4,800% over the past year because of the company‚Äôs pivot to Bitcoin investment strategy. Originally a budget hotel operator, Metaplanet turned to Bitcoin-first treasury strategy in 2024 and has since seen a significant rise in its stock prices. As of today, the company holds 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million after its latest purchase of 1004 BTC two days ago . Apparently Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan. Do they really think betting against Bitcoin is a winning strategy? pic.twitter.com/SAKsOMO4MX ‚Äî Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) May 21, 2025 A Setup for Global Short Squeeze? Despite a meteoric rise in Metaplanet‚Äôs stock, many investors have questioned the sustainability of Metaplanet‚Äôs valuation, leading to a sharp increase in short interest by hedge fund managers in the Japanese market. Short sellers, betting the stock will fall, are now under pressure as the company‚Äôs shares hit upper daily price limits and trading halts were triggered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for two consecutive days. With the TSE temporarily restricting access, short sellers have turned to OTC trading in international markets to cover their positions. However, these exchanges offer significantly lower liquidity, forcing traders to compete for a limited supply of shares, often at prices above their original short-sale levels. This dynamic has led to mounting speculation of a global short squeeze in the making, sentiments echoed by Bitcoin bull and Tesmanian founder Vincent Yu in a post on X . He added: ‚ÄúThis could be a really huge Metaplanet short squeeze. Short sellers are now needed to buy back in the lowest liquidity market $MTPLF & DN3 which will push up the price higher and faster, that cause more halted in Japan.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally Bad Timing to be Short‚Äù: Blockstream CEO Hashcash inventor Blockstream CEO Adam Back also posted on X replying to Metaplanet‚Äôs CEO saying that in his opinion the stock is still relatively cheap based on historic mNAV ranges, and on months to cover metric. ‚ÄúShorting it seems like a really bad idea to me! This is the second 3350:TYO circuit-breaker limit-up day in a row, really bad timing to be short.‚Äù In related news, Bitcoin soared past $107,700 earlier this morning during Asia trading hours, just 1% shy from its all-time high of $108,786.

The asset manager has added Bitcoin ETFs and crypto ATM shares. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT leads U.S. Bitcoin ETFs in inflows. Blackstone, the world‚Äôs largest alternative asset manager, has made its first move into crypto markets, purchasing shares in BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a May 20 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. The investment was added to the firm‚Äôs $2.63 billion Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), marking the asset manager‚Äôs initial exposure to Bitcoin via regulated financial products. Blackstone Adds ProShares Bitcoin ETF and Crypto ATM Shares to Portfolio The filing also reveals that Blackstone purchased 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), totaling $181,166, and a smaller position in Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM), a crypto ATM operator, with 4,300 shares worth just $6,300. Though modest in size‚Äîespecially relative to Blackstone‚Äôs $1.2 trillion in assets under management‚Äîthe move represents a notable shift for a firm that has historically kept crypto at arm‚Äôs length. In 2019, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman expressed skepticism about crypto, stating, ‚ÄúI was raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,‚Äù and admitted difficulty understanding the technology behind it. Blackstone‚Äôs entry into Bitcoin ETFs comes as demand for institutional access to digital assets grows. $1 TRILLION BLACKSTONE JUST REVEALED BUYING #BITCOIN ETF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THIS IS WILD!!! pic.twitter.com/PvlIddtndp ‚Äî Vivek (@Vivek4real_) May 20, 2025 IBIT, launched by BlackRock in January 2024, has quickly become the leader among U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. As of mid-May, the fund has recorded over $46.1 billion in net inflows and has not seen a single outflow since April 9, according to Farside Investors. In contrast, the Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the first U.S. public pension funds to gain Bitcoin exposure, reported on May 15 that it had fully liquidated its 6 million IBIT shares during Q1. IBIT continues to outpace competitors like Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC and ARK‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF, which have seen $11.8 billion and $2.8 billion in net inflows, respectively. DigiAsia Stock Doubles on $100M Bitcoin Purchase Plan Shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy. The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve. DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. In addition to deploying profits into Bitcoin, DigiAsia is actively exploring a capital raise of up to $100 million to kickstart its holdings. Notably, public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor‚Äôs firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin.

But there‚Äôs one thing that 94% of traders chasing the best crypto to buy now overlook. This hidden driver fuels adoption, builds loyalty, and powers long-term success. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , an AI-powered meme coin on Ethereum, showcases how this metric can elevate a cryptocurrency to top status and possibly lead the next bull run. The Power of Community in Cryptocurrency Success Cryptocurrencies with active communities‚Äîmarked by robust social media interactions, meme contests, and user participation‚Äîachieve higher market cap growth than less engaged projects. Community engagement isn‚Äôt just hype; it‚Äôs a cornerstone of blockchain adoption. It drives trust, encourages innovation, and attracts partnerships, making it a vital indicator for investors seeking the best crypto to buy now . Dawgz AI harnesses this metric with its ‚ÄúDawgz Army,‚Äù a growing community fueled by 15% of its 8.89 billion token supply dedicated to community rewards. By incentivizing meme creation and social interaction, $DAGZ builds a loyal base, positioning it as a crypto to watch in 2025. This community-driven approach could make it one of the best cryptocurrencies for long-term gains. Dawgz AI: Blending AI Innovation with Meme Culture Unlike traditional meme coins, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) combines AI-powered trading algorithms with meme-driven community hype, creating a unique value proposition. Its presale, raising over $3.61 million out of the $4.91 target, reflects strong market interest. The project‚Äôs blackbox AI system, developed by seasoned Wall Street analysts, analyzes market trends in real-time to optimize yields, offering potential for consistent returns. This blend of fun and utility sets $DAGZ apart from other assets. The community rewards program, allocating 15% of tokens, encourages users to create and share memes, fostering engagement. Additionally, 20% of the token supply is reserved for staking rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. By supporting payments in ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, and SOL, the presale allows a broad community to join the Dawgz Army. This strategy could drive $DAGZ to prominence in the cryptocurrency space. Why Community Engagement Defines the Best Crypto in 2025 In 2025, community engagement is more critical than ever. A vibrant community expands a project‚Äôs reach, secures exchange listings, and builds trust among investors. Dawgz AI‚Äôs roadmap, outlined on its website, emphasizes community building across four phases: Puppyhood: Launching the presale and sparking meme-driven hype on social media. Growing the Pack: Strengthening the Dawgz Army through contests and partnerships. Big Dog Stage: Expanding globally with enhanced AI features. Alpha Dog Status: Aiming for mainstream adoption and sustainable growth. This focus on community engagement positions $DAGZ as a crypto to buy for long-term success. Its smart contract, audited by SolidProof on June 4, 2024, ensures security, boosting community confidence. With 24% of tokens allocated to marketing, $DAGZ is set to expand its reach, making it a project to keep an eye on as it prepares for the launch. AI and Blockchain: The Future of Cryptocurrency The integration of AI and blockchain is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Dawgz AI‚Äôs AI algorithms are at the heart of its ecosystem, offering potential for high yields through real-time market analysis. This advanced technology, paired with meme culture, makes $DAGZ a standout in the market. The project‚Äôs 10% liquidity pool allocation ensures smooth trading on exchanges post-presale, enhancing its appeal. By fostering a community-driven ecosystem, $DAGZ aligns with the growing demand for cryptocurrencies that offer both fun and utility. Its presale price of $0.00438 (set to rise to $0.00474 soon) offers investors an accessible entry point before the price moons. Why Traders Should Prioritize Community in 2025 Community engagement is the backbone of cryptocurrency success. Projects with active, loyal communities are more likely to secure exchange listings, attract investors, and sustain long-term growth. Dawgz AI‚Äôs focus on meme culture and AI innovation creates a unique ecosystem that resonates with both retail and institutional investors. Its presale success, raising over $3.61 million and surging, underscores the strength of its community. Stage 8: Checked off the list. ‚úÖAnother win on the board. This isn‚Äôt luck, it‚Äôs strategy, support and solid execution. On to Stage 9 with even more fire. üî•Don't say we didn't warn you, we know where we‚Äôre going and stage 9 is just the next step. ‚§¥Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/aENcREe7U0 ‚Äî Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) May 20, 2025 By leveraging blockchain security (via its SolidProof-audited smart contract) and AI-driven utility, $DAGZ offers a compelling case for investors looking for the best crypto to buy.

SXT ( SXT ), the native token of decentralized data platform Space and Time, rose as high as 37% to an intraday high of $0.146 on May 21 morning Asian time. The rally followed Microsoft‚Äôs announcement that it would begin integrating real-time blockchain data feeds into Microsoft Fabric through a partnership with Space and Time Labs, a crypto startup previously backed by a Microsoft venture arm. According to the May 20 announcement , the collaboration will allow Microsoft Fabric users to access verifiable data from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Sui blockchains via Azure OneLake, a cloud data storage solution often described as a ‚ÄúOneDrive for data.‚Äù For the uninitiated, Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics platform that unifies several tools across Microsoft‚Äôs data suite, including Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI. As part of this integration, enterprise users of Fabric will now be able to incorporate tamper-proof blockchain data directly into their analytics, smart contracts, dashboards, and even AI models. The verifiability of this data is made possible by Space and Time‚Äôs proprietary ‚ÄúProof of SQL‚Äù technology, which uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to validate SQL database queries securely and efficiently. You might also like: Pi Network hints at trend reversal after pullback, but major obstacles could keep price below $1 Commenting on the development, Nate Holiday, CEO of Space and Time Labs, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to expand our collaboration with Microsoft to provide verifiable blockchain data to enterprises, institutions, and developers building on Fabric. This integration enables a wealth of new data-driven use cases across financial services, Web3 apps, and AI.‚Äù This announcement comes around a week after Space and Time launched its public, permissionless mainnet. The platform operates on a decentralized network of database validators and enables sub-second query speeds through its ZK-powered SQL coprocessor. Space and Time was developed by MakeInfinite Labs and is backed by Microsoft ‚Äôs venture arm, M12. M12 led the company‚Äôs strategic funding round back in 2022 and joined their $20 million Series A round later. So far, Space and Time has raised a total of $50 million. SXT price analysis On the 4-hour chart, SXT has managed to hold strong above the $0.12 support level and is now approaching the key $0.15 psychological resistance. SXT price, Aroon and RSI chart ‚Äî May 21 | Source: crypto.news The Aroon Up indicator is sitting high at 92.86%, while the Aroon Down is low at 21.43%, a sign that the uptrend is still going strong. The Chaikin Money Flow is at 0.14, showing steady buying pressure is still in play. On top of that, the Relative Strength Index has cooled off to around 62 after briefly hitting overbought territory, which leaves some room for more upward movement. Hence, the next likely target for SXT is its all-time high of $0.1621, and if the bullish momentum continues, it could break into price discovery beyond that level.

Dogecoin, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are drawing sharp attention as top cryptocurrencies for savvy investors. Dogecoin‚Äôs bullish patterns signal a potential 300% surge, while Cardano‚Äôs steady climb rides on whale accumulation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in presale phase 4 at $0.025, has raised $9,000,000 with over 500 million tokens sold to 11,000 holders. Phase 4 is 92% filled, and phase 5 looms with a 20% price jump to $0.03. These coins offer unique opportunities for those seeking the next big crypto. Let‚Äôs explore why they‚Äôre the best cryptos to buy now. Dogecoin‚Äôs Bullish Surge Dogecoin is igniting optimism among traders eyeing the best crypto to invest in. Currently trading at $0.24, it‚Äôs forming a falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal hinting at a breakout. Analysts note this setup mirrors a past rally that tripled its price. A diamond bottom reversal pattern further fuels confidence, suggesting a shift from selling to buying pressure. Dogecoin‚Äôs 53% monthly gain underscores its momentum, outpacing many peers. Whale activity is surging, with 100 million tokens snapped up recently, boosting crypto prices. While volatile, Dogecoin‚Äôs technical strength makes it a top crypto to buy. Yet, its speculative nature pales against more structured projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Cardano‚Äôs Steady Ascent Cardano is climbing steadily, cementing its place among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. Priced at $0.784, it‚Äôs up 52% from April‚Äôs low. Founder Charles Hoskinson predicts a crypto market ‚Äúheartburn‚Äù for two months before a bull run resumes. Whales are accumulating, holding 12.93 billion tokens, driven by upcoming airdrops for DUSK and NIGHT tokens. Cardano‚Äôs weekly chart shows a megaphone pattern, suggesting a dip to $0.4 before soaring to $2 by Q4. Cardano‚Äôs Midnight project, a zero-knowledge sidechain, adds utility. Cardano‚Äôs stability is compelling, but its slower growth contrasts with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs explosive presale momentum. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding attention as a top crypto in DeFi. Its presale phase 4, priced at $0.025, is 92% filled, signaling fierce demand. Investors are rushing to secure tokens before phase 5‚Äôs price hike to $0.03, a 20% gain for current buyers. The project‚Äôs tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at its $0.06 listing price. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, yielding a 9,900% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $9,000,000, with 500 million tokens sold to 11,000 holders. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with updates soon on socials. This urgency underscores why it‚Äôs the best crypto to buy now. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its lending platform. Users can lend assets to liquidity pools, earning interest based on pool utilization. Borrowers access funds by locking collateral, like $7,000 in ETH for a $5,000 USDT loan, ensuring stability. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates constant buy pressure, bolstering long-term value. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. This innovative approach makes it a standout in crypto investing, surpassing Dogecoin‚Äôs speculative allure and Cardano‚Äôs gradual climb. Why Mutuum Finance Shines Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs mtTokens are a game-changer. Depositing ETH yields mtETH, which accrues interest over time, offering passive income. These tokens are transferable across DeFi platforms, enhancing utility. A planned overcollateralized stablecoin will further strengthen the ecosystem. Unlike Dogecoin‚Äôs reliance on market sentiment or Cardano‚Äôs slower innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers practical financial tools. Its presale success and structured tokenomics position it as the next crypto to explode. Investors eyeing what crypto to buy for long-term gains find MUTM‚Äôs model irresistible. The crypto fear and greed index reflects growing confidence in such utility-driven projects. Seizing Crypto Opportunities Dogecoin, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are shaping the crypto market in 2025. Dogecoin‚Äôs chart patterns excite traders seeking the next big cryptocurrency. Cardano‚Äôs whale-driven growth appeals to those pondering which crypto to buy today for long-term gains. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steals the spotlight with its presale fervor and 140% listing return. It‚Äôs predicted $2.50 post-launch price makes it a top crypto to invest in.

Prominent market commentator Fred Krueger detailed his prediction in a 10-part thread on X posted on May 20, painting a hyperbullish picture for BTC powered by monetary instability, institutional Bitcoin adoption, and a full-scale flight from traditional markets. A Doomsday Scenario for Traditional Markets Krueger is basing his thesis on a catastrophic breakdown in U.S. financial stability, beginning with a failed $200 billion Treasury auction in late July 2025. According to his projection, weak demand for U.S. debt will potentially force the Federal Reserve into emergency interventions, sparking a crisis of confidence in the dollar. Within weeks, BRICS nations, led by economic heavyweights China and Russia, will announce a gold-backed global payment system, speeding up the decline of USD dominance and pushing BTC to $180,000. By August, the investor claims the situation will escalate dramatically, with a major U.S. pension fund possibly halting redemptions, which will force the Fed to impose yield cap control that should cap Treasury rates at 6.5% while the dollar goes into freefall. Meanwhile, countries such as Nigeria, Turkey, and Venezuela will ostensibly start shifting foreign reserves into Bitcoin, pushing its price to $265,000, with gold potentially rallying to the $6,700 level. The most explosive phase in the $600,000 timeline will arrive in September, when Krueger predicts several U.S. tech titans, including Apple, Tesla, and Google, will reveal huge BTC holdings, with the iPhone maker allegedly accumulating as much as 200,000 BTC since April. At this juncture, he postulates that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price will have reached $460,000. Additionally, the expert speculates that the IMF will make a historic move, announcing a new global reserve basket with Bitcoin making up half of it, gold covering 30%, and the remaining 20% taken up by other assets. By early October, Krueger claims the U.S. government will be forced to convene an emergency ‚ÄúNew Bretton Woods‚Äù summit, where it will restructure the dollar to be partially backed by BTC and gold. It is in this macro-maelstrom that he sees the king cryptocurrency hitting $600,000, gold reaching $10,400, and the S&P 500 losing half its value. Strong Fundamentals While Krueger‚Äôs roadmap reads like financial fiction, Bitcoin has shown some of the resilience and bullish momentum he‚Äôs basing his prediction on. At the time of writing, the asset was trading at $107,000, up a slight 1% in 24 hours, which has put it just 1.3% away from rediscovering its all-time high. On a monthly basis, BTC is up 23.1%, and year-over-year, it has surged 51.6%. Much of this strength comes from steady institutional demand and constrained supply.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have recorded eight days of positive flows out of the last ten, with total inflows topping $3.3 billion since the beginning of May, according to Farside Investors. This comes as heavyweights like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet announced additional BTC purchases, totaling nearly $850 million.

What‚Äôs often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user. But here‚Äôs the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience. Did you know? According to a recent survey , 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step. Common crypto transfer mistakes A single slip ‚Äî wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee ‚Äî tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes. Here‚Äôs a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes: Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient‚Äôs wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger‚Äôs wallet. Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt ( USDT ) over Ethereum instead of Tron ? That‚Äôs a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient‚Äôs supported network. Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely. Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can‚Äôt handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify. Sending tokens on the wrong network ‚Äî like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain ‚Äî can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network. Failed crypto transaction explained Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes. A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees . If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days. Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract‚Äôs code has flaws or can‚Äôt handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion ‚Äî especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum , where every block is a battle for space ‚Äî and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning. Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures. Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven‚Äôt landed. If your crypto transfer isn‚Äôt received, don‚Äôt panic. Check these first: Confirm the recipient‚Äôs address is correct. Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum , BNB Smart Chain (BSC) , Polygon , etc.). Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana). Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending . Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent. If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee . What to check before sending crypto Prevention is your best friend. Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient‚Äôs wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you‚Äôre sending. Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you‚Äôre sending. And don‚Äôt forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you‚Äôll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer‚Äôs going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform. Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help. Crypto transfer speed and networks Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network‚Äôs typical confirmation time. Chains like Solana , Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they‚Äôre not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem. That‚Äôs why knowing the average speed of the network you‚Äôre using matters. Sending Bitcoin ( BTC )? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana ? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre racing to secure a trade or make a payment ‚Äî choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress. How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn‚Äôt line up across jurisdictions. The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn‚Äôt match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges. Other problems arise from the ‚Äú sunrise issue ,‚Äù where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven‚Äôt. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won‚Äôt process transfers to wallets they can‚Äôt verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers. Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse. How to avoid failed crypto transactions Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing. Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask ) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds. Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees. How to verify a crypto transfer Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed. Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details. Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move. Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn‚Äôt just about saving your wallet; it‚Äôs about owning your peace of mind. As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here‚Äôs the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you‚Äôre using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed. The pros don‚Äôt rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it. Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Utility tokens are evolving from hype to substance, as MBG by MultiBank Group leads a new wave of regulation-first, infrastructure-backed crypto tied to real-world finance. Table of Contents A new approach: Beginning with infrastructure A landmark $3 billion tokenization agreement in the UAE Focus on regulation and legal clarity Real-world assets and the future of digital finance Utility tokens presented a straightforward concept: digital assets that projects could utilize to access services, pay fees, or earn incentives. However, in practice, many tokens have struggled to demonstrate genuine utility. Some debuted before a functioning product was ready. Others functioned under unclear legal conditions, preventing consumers from understanding the potential uses and locations of the tokens. The disparity between token supply and platform readiness has raised questions about whether most utility tokens serve a useful purpose or are primarily fundraising tools. A new approach: Beginning with infrastructure One movement in the space includes connecting tokens to functional, regulated financial institutions. MultiBank Group , a financial firm located in Dubai, has embraced this approach with its upcoming coin, MBG. Instead of launching first and then constructing, the business planned ahead of time to establish its infrastructure. The goal is to incorporate token-based functionality into current platforms that already serve retail, institutional, and digital asset customers throughout the world. These include transaction management, awards, and tier-based access, all inside existing systems. A landmark $3 billion tokenization agreement in the UAE In a significant step toward connecting traditional banking with web3, MultiBank Group has struck a $3 billion real-world asset (RWA) tokenization deal with MAG, the UAE‚Äôs top real estate developer, and Mavryk, a blockchain technology startup. The agreement focuses on digitizing real estate assets, which involves transforming their ownership or value into blockchain-based tokens that may be monitored, exchanged, or retained digitally. This is one of the world‚Äôs greatest real estate tokenization endeavors to date. This is a growing interest in utilizing blockchain to represent assets that exist outside of the crypto realm, resulting in increased transparency, possible liquidity, and automation of complicated ownership systems. You might also like: Bridging traditional finance and blockchain: The strategic positioning of MBG Focus on regulation and legal clarity Regulation, or the lack thereof, has been an obstacle to many digital asset ventures. 17 financial licenses, including those from Australia (ASIC), the UAE (VARA), and India (FIU), regulate the MultiBank ecosystem. This implies that any new digital components, including tokenized assets, will operate inside predefined legal frameworks. Clear regulatory footing protects consumers and opens the door to partnership with larger institutions that have hitherto shunned blockchain owing to compliance issues. As part of its token strategy, MultiBank intends to progressively limit the number of MBG tokens via buyback-and-burn techniques backed by company activities. This technique differs from inflationary token models, in which supply rises with time. A deflationary system can impact long-term token behavior, although the outcomes vary based on use and market conditions. Real-world assets and the future of digital finance The rising emphasis on real-world asset tokenization indicates a change in how digital finance may evolve. Rather than operating independently of traditional markets, blockchain-based solutions are beginning to integrate with established industries such as real estate and banking. For both observers and players, these trends point to a future in which digital assets are no longer merely speculative tools but integral parts of broader financial systems.

The disclosure came via a May 19 post on X, where Sun announced that he had secured an invite to an exclusive dinner with the former U.S. president, scheduled to be held at the president‚Äôs golf club near Washington, D.C. Sun to Attend Trump Dinner as Top Memecoin Holder According to Sun, his wallet, which holds around $19 million worth of the TRUMP token at a trading price of $13.20, earned him a top spot among the 220 holders eligible for the May 22 dinner. More notably, being the leading wallet on the leaderboard also grants Sun access to a private reception and VIP tour reserved for the top 25 token holders. He stated that he plans to ‚Äútalk crypto‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscuss the future‚Äù of the industry at the event. The crypto community had long speculated that Sun was behind the wallet, especially after his previous $75 million investment into Trump-backed crypto ventures through World Liberty Financial ‚Äî a platform reportedly supported by Trump‚Äôs sons. This included a $30 million token purchase shortly after the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Sun also serves as an adviser to the firm, further tightening his link to the Trump crypto ecosystem. Concerns Over Influence and Regulation Sun‚Äôs involvement has raised red flags among lawmakers, particularly those wary of political influence being bought through crypto investments. The timing of his announcement ‚Äî just hours after the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins ‚Äî has intensified concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the move, calling it a sign of ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù that the GENIUS Act fails to address. During a May 20 congressional hearing, Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins about the timing of Sun‚Äôs stayed legal case and his ties to Trump‚Äôs ventures. Although Atkins assumed office after the SEC agreed to pause its lawsuit against Sun ‚Äî which involves allegations of unregistered securities offerings and market manipulation ‚Äî Ivey pointed to the troubling proximity between Sun‚Äôs crypto activities and regulatory decisions. As of May 20, other confirmed attendees of the dinner include notable figures from the crypto world, such as Vincent Liu of Kronos Research and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick.

ARKHAM ALERT: ETHEREUM COFOUNDER JEFFREY WILCKE JUST SENT $262M OF ETH TO KRAKEN pic.twitter.com/tgUpS0mCBJ ‚Äî Arkham (@arkham) May 20, 2025 Following the transfer, Wilcke‚Äôs ETH holdings dropped to under 300 coins. The last time he made such a large move was in November 2024, just before Ethereum hit a 12-month high, after which the price corrected. So naturally, this triggered fears that another major dump might be on the way. Is He Selling? Or Just Moving Funds? At first glance, the transaction looked like a sign that Wilcke might sell. But shortly after the deposit, eight new wallets withdrew the same amount of ETH from Kraken. This led some analysts to believe he may have simply redistributed his funds rather than offloading them. Interestingly, Wilcke even reposted news of the transaction, but didn‚Äôt offer any explanation. His silence has kept people guessing, but the activity doesn‚Äôt clearly point to a dump So while the recent transfer looked dramatic, it may not have been a bearish move after all. Impact On ETH Price Despite the massive transfer, Ethereum‚Äôs price held up well. As of now, ETH is trading around $2607, reflecting a rise of 2.24%, with the market cap hitting $314 billion. Despite the major move, one positive signal is that Ethereum‚Äôs supply on exchanges has dropped to just 4.9%, the lowest in 10 years. That suggests fewer people are preparing to sell, which is often seen as a positive signal for long-term holders. Meanwhile, there are also some concerns about a possible bug in the EIP-7702 upgrade, which might slow Ethereum‚Äôs recent momentum.",News|Uncategorized,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 07:45:00

In a recent post , Buterin commented on an X user‚Äôs skeptical take on an announcement from Succinct Lab‚Äôs co-founder Uma Roy about her team‚Äôs recent demo of a full ‚ÄúzkVM‚Äù proof system for the ecosystem‚Äôs execution layer. Although Buterin does congratulate the Succinct team on their progress, he proceeds to point out four areas that the project ‚Äî as well as the wider network ‚Äî needs to tackle in order to make real-time proving a reliable feature for users on the Layer1 . ‚ÄúSo, truly amazing work by @pumatheuma and team, but definitely still a few steps to the final destination,‚Äù said Buterin. Buterin underlined how the Succinct Labs‚Äô demo for real-time Ethereum ( ETH ) proving mechanism was tested out on average-case timings, not worst case tests. He emphasized the need for worst case timings in order to make the mechanism safe for wider L1 use. Moreover, he stated in his post that the Ethereum team aims to raise the Layer1 gas limit by 10 to 100 times its current rate. According to data from YCharts, Ethereum‚Äôs current average gas limit is at 35.99 million, a slight increase from yesterday‚Äôs average gas limit which stood at 35.98 million. ‚ÄúWe wanna 10-100x the L1 gas limit,‚Äù said Buterin. Ethereum‚Äôs gas limit has reached 35.99 million in the past 24 hours, May 21, 2025 | Source: YCharts You might also like: Binance founder proposes lowering BSC gas fees by three to 10 times Buterin also said Succinct‚Äôs proving mechanism still lacks formal verification, which is necessary to assure users that it is seamless and relatively bug-free. Not only that, the real-time proving system still needs around 100 kilowatts of power to churn out proofs at the demonstrated speed. Buterin argued that to make it available for broader participation, the energy cost needed to generate proofs should be around as low as 10 kW. This way, the energy rate is home-use friendly and would enable small teams or individuals to run their own real-time proofs. What is Ethereum‚Äôs current gas limit? Compared to a year ago, on May 21, 2024, the ecosystem‚Äôs gas limit has increased by nearly 20%. The number increased by nearly 6 million from 30 million one year ago. If Ethereum does manage to raise its gas limit by 10 to 100 times, its gas limit could reach as high as 360 million to 3600 million. Ethereum‚Äôs gas limit represents the maximum gas units needed to process a transaction or smart contract on the network. It acts as a cap, preventing transactions from using excessive resources that could lead to high fees or generating congestion on the network. Even if real-time proving mechanisms become available on-chain, each one requires a considerable amount of gas. Therefore, in order to make it viable at scale, it would require a higher gas limit compared to what the network‚Äôs current block gas limit would allow. Last February, the Ethereum network raised its gas limit for the first time since 2021. The gas limit reached 32 million gas units, surpassing 30 million for the first time in nearly five years. At the time, around 51.1% of validators approved the gas limit adjustment without a hard fork.

Theta Capital Management has pulled in over $175 million for a new fund-of-funds designed to help institutional investors get exposure to early-stage blockchain startups by backing some of the industry‚Äôs top crypto venture firms. The new fund, dubbed Theta Blockchain Ventures IV, will invest in venture capital firms that specialize in crypto, Bloomberg has learned , referring to Ruud Smets, the company‚Äôs managing partner and chief investment officer. Founded in 2001, the Netherlands-based firm began focusing on cryptocurrencies in 2018 and now manages around $1.2 billion in assets. Theta has previously backed firms like Coinfund, Polychain Capital, and Castle Island Ventures. It‚Äôs still unclear though how Theta plans to allocate the newly raised capital.

According to a May 14 report by PitchBook, VC deal value in Q1 rose to $6 billion, more than double the $2.6 billion seen a year ago. However, the number of deals fell to 405 from 670 over the same period. PitchBook‚Äôs senior crypto analyst Robert Le said the $1.4 billion Bybit theft , which he described as the first and only ‚Äú10-digit hack in history,‚Äù served as a stark reminder of the operational risks still present in the industry. He suggested the incident could drive greater institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tools, improved custody systems, and middleware that simplifies key management. Le also said startups working on these areas might find a more favorable funding environment, even amid a broader reset in valuations. Despite Bitcoin hitting a record high of $100,000 in Q4 2024, venture capital activity in crypto startups remained flat , with VC deal size down nearly 90% since 2018.

He noted that NYC had sufficient experts to help New Yorkers navigate solutions through blockchain technology. Speaking at the first ever crypto summit hosted at the mayor‚Äôs official residence, Gracie Mansion, Adams asserted that NYC was ‚Äúopen for ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô business‚Äù and the proposed digital assets council would be composed of industry individuals, with a chair to be confirmed in the coming weeks.

He also pointed out that in addition to business interests, the city will explore putting birth and death records onto a blockchain to help New Yorkers‚Äô next of kin easily access these types of documents. Adams told the inaugural NYC crypto summit on May 20 that the plan to establish the city‚Äôs crypto advisory council was not about chasing memes and trends. He added that the world is currently in the age of tokenization‚Äîwhich includes, blockchain, and other fintech innovations‚Äîand NYC was going to continue to move forward with it. ‚ÄúWe want to use technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today ‚Ä¶ That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy.‚Äù ~ Eric Adams, the Mayor of New York City The self-proclaimed ‚Äútech mayor‚Äù also revealed his history as a computer programmer, highlighting that he was one of the original architects of OLTPS, the precursor to COMPStat. He disclosed that he came into the tech world with a real mindset that technology could improve the lives of people, and the establishment of the crypto advisory council was part of ‚Äúthe evolution of that improvement.‚Äù NYC Mayor asks crypto companies to set up shop in the Empire State Mayor Adams made a pitch to crypto companies returning to the U.S. or expanding their presence in the country to set up shop in New York City. He said at a previous press briefing at Gracie Mansion that the city of New York should be looking forward to building crypto empires. Adams, who is running for reelection, reiterated his commitment to making NYC a crypto hub, telling reporters that he would work with tech and crypto companies‚Äîboth big and small‚Äîto create a friendly environment to attract and help them succeed. He added that his goal remained the same as it was on day one as mayor, helping President Trump make the U.S. the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the planet.‚Äù Adams also claimed that New York would attract world-class talent, provide opportunities for underbanked communities, and make the government more user-friendly. He pointed out that his office was focused on the long-term value of these technologies for the city and its people. In the past, Adams was critical of Bitlicense, claiming that it stifled regulation, and he advocated scrapping it shortly after taking office as mayor in 2022. He, however, seemed to strike a more conciliatory tone towards NYDFS, saying that it was good to know that the city would have safe regulations in place for those who were investing and that there would not be any abuses.

As investors seek alternatives to traditional staking options like BNB, Unilabs presents a compelling opportunity to benefit from automated fund management and passive income. The platform‚Äôs AI-backed structure, staking utility, and strong referral rewards have sparked speculation that it could challenge the staking dominance of Binance Coin. Unilabs: The First AI Asset Manager Revolutionizing Crypto Portfolios As the first decentralized AI asset manager, Unilabs holds responsibility for assets worth more than $30 million in AUM. The purpose of Unilabs is to help investors set aside emotional influences by using real-time machine learning, creating four distinct funds: There are the AI Fund, the BTC Fund, the RWA Fund, and the Mining Fund. The multifaceted funds fuse DeFi with traditional models to let users access Bitcoin along with tokenized yield opportunities, while leaving portfolio management to the Unilabs AI. Instead of speculating manually, Unilabs users gain intelligent, rebalanced exposure to crypto‚Äôs fastest-growing sectors. With tokenized yield, dynamic risk profiles, and on-chain NAV tracking, Unilabs creates a bridge between traditional asset management logic and DeFi‚Äôs speed, offering an increasingly popular alternative to BNB staking products. In fact, many early adopters are reallocating funds from Binance Coin to protocols like Unilabs for their AI-powered alpha generation. The Current Opportunity: 21.5% Gains at Presale Price The Unilabs presale is live, and the window to buy in before the next price tier closes is narrowing quickly. With over 155 million UNI tokens sold, demand is clearly surging. Currently priced at $0.0051, the next presale tier will move the token price to $0.0062, giving new buyers an opportunity to lock in a 21.5% immediate ROI, a gain that‚Äôs purely based on entering early. This isn‚Äôt just a speculative play; it‚Äôs a calculated move for investors looking to front-run the next valuation bump in a project backed by AI and $30M AUM. The UNIL token itself is more than just a trading chip. It‚Äôs a multi-utility asset designed for long-term engagement. Holders benefit from staking rewards, which fuel liquidity across the platform‚Äôs diversified funds. Finally, governance rights give every UNI holder a say in how the platform‚Äôs strategies evolve, ensuring the community drives decision-making. Unlike BNB, which focuses heavily on validator-based staking, Unilabs enables users to have a direct say in fund performance through transparent AI metrics. Binance Coin Dominance Meets Real AI Competition Just this week, BNB Chain recorded a surge in user and network activity, with daily transactions climbing past 8 million and active wallet addresses exceeding 2 million. Binance‚Äôs native token, BNB, price also spiked to $648, a three-month high, fueled by rising on-chain activity and a key development. The proposed ETF has ignited bullish speculation about Binance coin‚Äôs future as an institutional-grade crypto asset, further lifting sentiment across the Binance ecosystem. Source : CoinMarketCap However, BNB‚Äôs staking and DeFi dominance may no longer be unchallenged. As capital floods into Layer-1s and DeFi-native platforms, investors increasingly seek platforms that offer more than just staking rewards. They want active asset management, real diversification, and access to early-stage alpha capabilities that Unilabs delivers through enterprise-grade AI and structured investment products. Unilabs is quickly emerging as a serious contender other than Binance coin in the next evolution of decentralized finance. While BNB Chain continues to lead in raw transaction volume and validator uptime, its staking system and DeFi structure may soon appear static compared to Unilabs‚Äô dynamic asset management ecosystem. Conclusion Unilabs isn‚Äôt a concept; it‚Äôs a live, growing protocol with $30M in managed assets and a presale that‚Äôs gathering serious momentum. Early participants in protocols like Lido and Yearn Finance saw outsized returns by entering before public listings. Unilabs may be next. Binance coin remains a dominant force, but dominance can erode. As more users demand smart asset management, diversified staking, and performance-linked rewards, platforms like Unilabs could rewrite the rules. The UNIL token offers exposure to a fully automated financial machine with real-time AI execution and a referral-powered ecosystem. With staking, diversified fund access, and real-time performance tracking, Unilabs gives retail investors the tools previously reserved for hedge funds.

The British multinational bank said sovereign entities increased their indirect exposure to the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency in the first quarter by buying shares in Strategy (MSTR), noting that the trend bolsters its half-million BTC price projection. Increasing Allocations To MSTR Is Bullish For Bitcoin Roughly 12 government entities increased their exposure to MSTR in Q1, holding 31,000 Bitcoin worth of Strategy shares, Standard Chartered‚Äôs global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. Although investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were greenlighted in the U.S. in 2024, government entities‚Äô increased Strategy holdings reflect ‚Äúwidening structural demand‚Äù for Bitcoin and Strategy‚Äôs continued use as a Bitcoin proxy, Kendrick explained. ‚ÄúWe believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,‚Äù he added. Government entities upped their MSTR holdings during the first quarter, with Norway‚Äôs Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea‚Äôs pension and investment bodies each adding the equivalent of 700 BTC. Meanwhile, United States state retirement funds across California, New York, North Carolina, and Kentucky added a combined 1,000 BTC equivalent. Sweden and Liechtenstein made minor increases, while France and Saudi Arabia took first-time positions, albeit tiny, indicating growing sovereign interest in indirect BTC exposure, according to Kendrick. ‚ÄúThe latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,‚Äù the banker opined. The latest first quarter 13F filings ‚Äî reports that institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file each quarter ‚Äî indicate that sovereigns‚Äô exposure to Bitcoin via spot exchange-traded funds ‚Äúwas disappointing at first glance,‚Äù while increasing MSTR holdings were ‚Äúvery encouraging,‚Äù Standard Chartered said. The most notable ETF move came from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which sold off its entire 3,400 BTC-equivalent stake in BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust. Kendrick argued that these 13F filings are the best way to test ‚Äúour thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures,‚Äù pushing the price of the asset to the $500,000 milestone. ‚ÄúWhen institutions buy Bitcoin, prices tend to rise,‚Äù he summarized.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 07:52:20

According to a May 20 filing , Blackstone bought just around $1.08 million worth of BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), despite boasting approximately $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of IBIT at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone‚Äôs Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, as per Google Finance data. This is the first time the asset manager has disclosed investing in anything crypto-related. Despite IBIT‚Äôs outstanding performance, it appears that Blackstone is not yet ready to commit substantial capital to investing in the apex crypto. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Blackstone has largely steered clear of crypto. Back in September 2019, Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said he liked the blockchain technology but thought its use for money was ‚Äúpretty odd.‚Äù ‚Äú[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,‚Äù he noted at the time. Schwarzman further admitted he wasn‚Äôt much of a fan of Bitcoin, citing difficulties understanding the technology. BlackRock On Track To Overtake Satoshi‚Äôs Bitcoin Stash BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT has drawn in a net inflow of over $46 billion since it went live on Wall Street in January 2024, signaling institutions‚Äô persistent confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects. Bloomberg‚Äôs senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a recent post on X that BlackRock is now the second-biggest Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only the mysterious BTC inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Balchunas believes the asset manager is poised to surpass Satoshi‚Äôs holdings by next summer. The pundit reckons that if the Bitcoin price climbs to $150,000 in the coming months, it could spark a ‚Äúfeeding frenzy‚Äù among financial advisors, which would help BlackRock attain this milestone even more quickly.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Blackrock,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 07:55:58

In a post on X, he pointed to XRP and RLUSD as mechanisms that could reshape how value moves across borders. Aljarrah pointed out that banks currently hold capital in Nostro/Vostro accounts, but XRP eliminates this requirement, which many now see as a fundamental inefficiency in the traditional banking system. He then added that RLUSD can tokenize collateralized debt, and these tokenized treasuries could significantly transform sovereign debt markets. Banks hold capital in Nostro/Vostro accounts ‚Äî XRP eliminates that friction. Governments collateralize debt with treasuries ‚Äî RLUSD tokenizes it. Now imagine this entire system operating 24/7 across borders. pic.twitter.com/BRqHvEzaNB ‚Äî Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) May 19, 2025 The Role of XRP in Streamlining Cross-Border Settlements The traditional international banking system relies on Nostro and Vostro accounts, where correspondent banks hold foreign currency balances to facilitate cross-border transactions. This system often results in idle capital and slow settlement times. XRP functions as a bridge asset that enables real-time settlement between currencies. It allows institutions to avoid pre-funding accounts in foreign currencies, thus reducing capital lockup and operational delays. Ripple‚Äôs On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system, which utilizes XRP, is already employed worldwide to simplify and accelerate cross-border transfers. The core advantage is XRP‚Äôs ability to settle transactions in seconds, offering near-instant finality. This addresses a long-standing issue in the global financial system, where delays in settlement can lead to counterparty risks and liquidity inefficiencies. Tokenizing Treasuries with RLUSD Governments traditionally issue treasuries to finance debt, and these instruments are widely used as collateral in financial markets. However, access to them, particularly across borders and outside regular trading hours, remains constrained by legacy systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Aljarrah suggests that RLUSD could tokenize U.S. dollar-denominated assets, such as treasuries, onto blockchain infrastructure. Ripple is making strides in the tokenization market, as real-world asset tokenization could bring significant growth to the crypto space. By tokenizing treasuries, RLUSD could become more than just a stable digital representation of the U.S. dollar, but serve as a programmable, on-chain instrument backed by sovereign-grade assets. This could open new pathways for collateralization and liquidity management in decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional markets. The Future of Global Finance XRP and RLUSD illustrate Ripple‚Äôs vision for a borderless, always-on financial system. XRP removes the inefficiencies of pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies, while RLUSD introduces tokenized, liquid collateral that can be moved and settled around the clock. Some analysts believe tokenization is just the start , and with these assets, Ripple could play a major role in global finance in the coming years.

At this point, Binance made both a delisting and listing announcement today. Accordingly, announcements came for AWE, ACA, MASK and TRU.

44893910,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67873,1747814896,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP ETF Sees Fresh Delay. Here‚Äôs What the SEC Says,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-sees-fresh-delay-heres-what-the-sec-says/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again postponed its decisions on spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals tied to cryptocurrencies, including XRP and Dogecoin. Among those impacted are filings submitted by Grayscale, 21Shares , and a separate application for the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. According to documents recently published on the SEC‚Äôs official site, the agency has formally initiated proceedings to assess the proposed products further. As part of this process, the commission is inviting feedback from the public to aid its evaluation of the legal and regulatory implications surrounding these ETF proposals. Bitwise Ethereum ETF Staking Amendment Also Faces Delay Also, the SEC has deferred its ruling on an amendment tied to the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. The amendment seeks to include staking options, potentially enabling investors to earn additional returns through network participation. This feature is a step toward increasing investor exposure to yield-generating opportunities in the Ethereum ecosystem. The agency is delaying its decision and seeking public input, indicating the issue needs more review. Public Consultation Opens as Regulator Seeks Broader Perspective The SEC‚Äôs call for public input reflects its ongoing effort to navigate the evolving crypto investment landscape. While no formal conclusions have been reached, the regulator emphasized that the proposals raise complex questions deserving of in-depth public discourse. Stakeholders have 21 days to submit comments and up to 35 days for rebuttal comments after publication in the Federal Register. Delays Consistent with SEC‚Äôs Pattern on Crypto ETFs For market watchers, the latest round of deferrals comes as no surprise. Over the past several months, the SEC has repeatedly extended review timelines for various crypto-linked ETFs. Notably, in March, the agency delayed rulings on applications from Grayscale, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary. At that time, the decision on Grayscale‚Äôs XRP Trust ETF was moved to May 21. That deadline has been pushed back further as the commission continues to examine whether the ETF proposals meet regulatory requirements under Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act. These measures aim to shield investors from fraud and ensure fair market practices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Experts Predict Extended Review Period Through October Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart noted that these delays align with the SEC‚Äôs standard approach to ETF filings, especially those involving spot crypto assets. He stressed that the regulator generally utilizes the entire 240-day review window before making a final decision. Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets ‚Äî i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Seyffart expects spot-based crypto ETFs to be approved by Q4 2025, ruling out June-July approvals. He highlighted that October remains the most likely timeframe for a final ruling on the XRP ETF proposals. Industry Leaders Remain Optimistic Despite Regulatory Hurdles The ETF and crypto industries remain upbeat despite delays. Nate Geraci believes the SEC will approve proposed ETFs, including altcoin-related ones. Geraci‚Äôs remarks reflect a broader sentiment in the crypto industry that regulatory clarity is on the horizon, even if the path involves extended deliberation. While the SEC‚Äôs latest actions add another chapter to its cautious stance on crypto-linked financial products, they also reinforce the agency‚Äôs commitment to thorough due diligence and public engagement. As the comment and rebuttal periods unfold, the market will be watching closely for signs of regulatory evolution that could shape the next wave of crypto investment opportunities.

From banning USDT to nabbing illegal crypto mining in the country, they are making sure that crypto is safe from scams. The country‚Äôs anti-money laundering agency, Rosfinmonitoring, has made it clear to the Russian citizens that crypto transactions in the country are no longer as private as people think. Despite crypto exchanges having no legal recognition in the country, they‚Äôre already handing over customer data to law enforcement, with no need for a court order. Crypto Anonymity Is a ‚ÄúMyth,‚Äù Says Official Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, Olga Tisen, Rosfinmonitoring‚Äôs legal head, said that Russian crypto exchanges are actively sharing wallet owner data with authorities upon request. She emphasized that the idea of crypto transactions being anonymous is outdated, especially as these platforms aim to align with future regulations. No Court Order? No Problem KEYANB Alert: Russian AML agency confirms crypto exchanges share ALL transaction data without court orders. ""Anonymity of crypto transfers is a myth."" Their surveillance tool reaches 12,000+ officials. Privacy illusion finally shattered. https://t.co/fo5OKeIVHn pic.twitter.com/2F8zVDPk4a ‚Äî Keyanb (@keyanb_) May 21, 2025 Tisen says crypto data in Russia isn‚Äôt protected like bank information, so the police can get their hands on it pretty easily, no court order needed. Some exchanges even mention on their websites that they‚Äôre working with law enforcement, which might sound surprising, but it actually lines up with global anti-money laundering standards. Even though crypto still operates in a bit of a legal gray area in Russia, these platforms seem to be playing it safe and following stricter rules ahead of time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia to Launch Exclusive Crypto Exchange for Ultra-Wealthy Investors , Meanwhile, the Russian government is gearing up to keep an even closer eye on things. Rosfinmonitoring, the country‚Äôs financial watchdog, plans to give banks access to a blockchain tracking tool called Transparent Blockchain before the year ends. It‚Äôs already being used by police and even agencies outside Russia to track crypto transactions. Moreover, the Central Bank is using it too, to keep tabs on how often Russians are checking out big international crypto exchanges online. The Bigger Picture Over 12,000 regulators and officers across Russia and neighboring countries have access to this blockchain tracking tool. The agency is also pushing for stricter rules around illegal crypto mining, with strong backing from the Central Bank. While Russia may not have fully regulated the crypto space, it‚Äôs already watching closely, and user privacy is quickly becoming a thing of the past. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Hagerty says stablecoin issuers will likely purchase massive amounts of US Treasuries as reserve funds to ensure the digital assets remain pegged to the dollar. Says Hagerty, ‚ÄúStablecoin issuers will be the largest holders of US Treasuries in the world.‚Äù Hagerty introduced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which aims to establish federal regulations around the use of stablecoins. The bill is currently being debated by Congress. Asked what will back stablecoins, Hagerty says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be equities. It‚Äôs going to be high quality short-term assets, either short-term US Treasuries or cash. I think the majority of it will be US Treasuries.‚Äù On Monday, Hagerty celebrated the bill moving closer to becoming law. ‚ÄúTonight, the Senate moved forward on the GENIUS Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America‚Äôs payment system into the 21st century. The GENIUS Act skyrockets the United States with a digital payment framework with the fastest rails possible. It will ensure US dollar dominance. Customers will be protected, the demand for US Treasuries will balloon to the tune of more than $1 trillion, and innovation in the digital asset space will thrive in the United States going forward. I look forward to making history with my colleagues this week.‚Äù The potential legislation would require stablecoin issuers to maintain backing for their assets on a 1:1 ratio. The bill also states that stablecoin issuer reserves can be made up of US currency; funds held as demand deposits or insured shares at an insured depository institution; and Treasury bills, notes or bonds.

As you know, Ripple and Coinbase are now locked in a multi-billion dollar bidding war to acquire Circle ‚Äì the powerhouse behind USDC. The reported price tag is as high as $11 billion. This one could shake the foundation of the stablecoin market. If Ripple wins, it wouldn‚Äôt just gain control of a major dollar-backed asset but could instantly become one of the most dominant forces in the entire ecosystem. And not everyone‚Äôs okay with that. Critics are already throwing up antitrust red flags and warning of potential chaos if the deal goes through. Why does this acquisition matter so much? Here‚Äôs the buzz. A Disaster Is Brewing Gabriel Shapiro, founder of MetaLeX Labs, did not hold back when weighing in on the possible Ripple-Circle deal. ‚ÄúMaking Ripple the largest asset issuer on every blockchain would obviously be disastrous and anticompetitive,‚Äù he warned, raising serious antitrust alarms. Shapiro believes that if the acquisition goes through, it won‚Äôt sail past regulators. ‚ÄúIf a definitive agreement is signed, we will be at the DoJ‚Äôs and FTC‚Äôs doorstep, citing Ripple‚Äôs history of campaigns against Bitcoin and Ethereum‚Ä¶‚Äù He also pointed to Ripple‚Äôs past behavior, calling out how the firm previously used its influence to hurt competitors ‚Äì like when Chris Larsen teamed up with Greenpeace in 2022 to target Bitcoin mining. According to Shapiro, Circle needs to consider the Revlon doctrine , which requires companies to act in shareholders‚Äô best interests ‚Äì including weighing antitrust risk. Oof, a well-researched lash out! Rejected Offers, XRP Leverage & a Heated Bidding War Reports suggest Ripple had initially offered around $4-$5 billion to acquire Circle earlier this year ‚Äì but was turned down. Now, it‚Äôs apparently back at the table with deeper pockets, possibly combining cash and XRP reserves for a much higher bid. ‚ÄúRipple is setting on holdings at about $94 billion based on estimated around $40 billion in XRP at the current price at $2.37,‚Äù said Paul Barron in a now-deleted post. But legal roadblocks still exist ‚Äì Ripple can‚Äôt easily liquidate those tokens without a judge‚Äôs nod. On the other side, Coinbase holds a healthy balance sheet: around $8.5 billion in cash and nearly $2.8 billion in crypto investments. Yet despite its financial strength, it hasn‚Äôt made a move ‚Äì raising questions. Circle‚Äôs Fate: Ripple, Coinbase‚Ä¶ or a Surprise Player? While Ripple appears aggressive, Coinbase may still have the edge ‚Äì especially with U.S. regulators likely to scrutinize Ripple‚Äôs bid harder. ‚ÄúIf Coinbase wanted to buy them, Circle would sell in a heartbeat,‚Äù one banker reportedly said. And let‚Äôs not rule out a dark horse. Firms like Japan‚Äôs SBI Holdings, one of the biggest XRP holders, could jump in with support. Ripple‚Äôs acquisition push could shift stablecoin dynamics overnight. But if Shapiro‚Äôs warnings play out, this could turn into a defining moment for crypto‚Äôs future.

During a May 21 episode of her ‚ÄúTalk Tuah‚Äù podcast, Welch opened up about the federal probe for the first time, revealing that the FBI had shown up at her grandmother‚Äôs house after the token‚Äôs disastrous debut. ‚ÄúThe feds came to granny‚Äôs house,‚Äù she said, recalling how her grandmother called her in a panic, saying, ‚ÄúThe FBI is here after you, what have you done?‚Äù Welch said she immediately cooperated, turning over her phone and meeting with agents, who questioned her about her role behind HAWK. She described it as a full-blown ‚Äúinterrogation,‚Äù adding that she was eventually ‚Äúcleared‚Äù and told she was ‚Äúgood to go.‚Äù She also revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission got involved, requesting access to her phone for a few days. Welch complied and later learned that the SEC had closed the case without pursuing any charges or sanctions. Her lawyer, James Sallah, confirmed that outcome, stating that regulators found no wrongdoing and placed no restrictions on her future involvement with crypto. Welch had ‚Äúno clue‚Äù about crypto On the podcast, Welch admitted that she had ‚Äúno clue‚Äù about cryptocurrencies when she agreed to the project and said she ‚Äútrusted the wrong people.‚Äù ‚ÄúI did not have enough knowledge about crypto to be getting involved with it. And I knew that, but I got talked into it, and I trusted the wrong people,‚Äù Welch said. She alleged that a company, whose name she withheld for legal reasons, was fully in control of her X account and posted promotional content on her behalf. Welch insisted she was only paid a flat marketing fee and ‚Äúdid not make a dime from the coin itself,‚Äù saying any earnings went toward legal and PR expenses. Despite her claims of limited involvement, blockchain sleuths and angry investors were unconvinced. The HAWK meme coin launched in early December and briefly hit a $500 million market cap before crashing over 90% within minutes. Analytics firm Bubblemaps flagged the token as highly centralized, revealing that insider wallets, allegedly linked to Welch‚Äôs team, controlled 96% of the supply and dumped large amounts during the launch window. A flurry of lawsuits As criticism mounted, Welch vanished from social media shortly after a tense interview appearance on December 5 with YouTuber Voidzilla. Her vague sign-off during the interview, ‚ÄúAnyhoo, I‚Äôm going to go to bed and see you guys tomorrow‚Äù, became infamous as she remained silent for nearly two weeks. She finally resurfaced on December 20, releasing a statement claiming she was fully cooperating with a federal lawsuit filed by Burwick Law on behalf of 12 US residents who allegedly lost a combined $151,000. Welch said she took the matter ‚Äúextremely seriously‚Äù and wanted to help ‚Äúuncover the truth‚Äù and ‚Äúhold the responsible parties accountable.‚Äù While Welch avoided personal legal consequences, alleged HAWK token‚Äôs backers, including OverHere Limited, Clinton So, and Alex ‚ÄúDoc Hollywood‚Äù Schultz, faced a federal lawsuit accusing them of launching an unregistered security and misleading investors. OverHere later tried to shift blame onto Doc Hollywood, who has since locked his X account and disappeared from public view. Welch‚Äôs team has maintained that she did not personally profit from the token and cut ties with the LLC behind it. According to reports, she was never named as a defendant in the lawsuit. By early 2025, Welch confirmed that both the FBI and SEC had cleared her.

Over the past few weeks, markets have witnessed volatility across asset classes, gold has continued to rise, and uncertainty, in general, is at its highest point in years. Traditionally, bonds, especially treasuries, have been the primary go-to safe havens in turbulent times. However, the fixed income markets as we know them haven‚Äôt always been easy to access, nor have they been the absolute safe haven of previous years, given the current market uncertainties. High entry thresholds, lack of liquidity and opaque structures have kept many everyday investors on the sidelines. However, this is starting to change. Amidst the chaos, tokenised fixed yield and fixed income assets are bucking the trend to offer investors clarity at a time of confusion, at least those that are aware of the nascent asset class. Why Tokenise Fixed Income Assets? Tokenised bonds are digital representations of traditional bonds, issued and managed on blockchain infrastructure. These bonds retain all traditional bond characteristics, such as principal, interest rate and maturity date, while leveraging blockchain technology to ensure security, transparency and efficiency for investors. For instance, there are tokens in the market that invest in short-term US Treasury Bills which, although not offering a fixed yield, have notably been less affected by the current market turmoil. In fact, the total market cap of tokenised US Treasuries as at 1 April 2025 was $5.12 billion ‚Äì as at 06 May 2025, the figure now sits at $6.59 billion, representing a 29% increase despite the tariff saga. These tokens can attract investors who may typically struggle to access US Treasuries directly due to geographical restrictions. With low minimum tickets to invest in the primary market, retail and institutional investors alike can often access, and even trade on secondary markets, these assets. Meanwhile, small- to mid-sized governments and businesses are issuing tokenised securities that are accessible to all types of investors, offering coupons with returns ranging from 8% to 15% with typically sub-five-year maturities. Tokenised assets are recorded on a blockchain ‚Äì a secure ledger housed across multiple computer networks ‚Äì which allows investors to verify ownership, payment history and asset performance in real time. This level of transparency reduces information asymmetry, which is often a key driver of fear and volatility for investors in murky markets. Additionally, the disintermediation ensures that investors seeking to re-allocate their capital can do so through instant settlement or trading on liquid secondary markets, which can be critical during times of market flux. Blockchain technology also ensures immutable records of ownership which reduces counterparty risk, especially during periods of stress when traditional intermediaries may become unreliable. Smart contracts also facilitate automatic interest payments and redemptions, lowering the risk of delayed or failed settlements for investors. Tokenisation not only disintermediates technologically unnecessary counterparties but also allows investors to have more control. As the industry grows and assets are cross-listed across platforms, investors will be able to withdraw their bonds, send them to other exchanges for arbitrage, self-custody them, and even trade them peer-to-peer within whitelisted ecosystems. Challenging Legacy Markets and Financial Institutions We are clearly in a time of significant change for markets, geopolitics, and more. Looking at the broader picture, blockchain technology and, by extension, tokenisation is the first genuine opportunities we have had in generations to rethink finance and do things differently. Many regulators worldwide have adopted a progressive stance towards tokenisation. Some of the most forward-thinking approaches are emerging from small- to mid-sized economies, such as El Salvador and Kazakhstan, where pushback from layers of technologically obsolete intermediaries is less influential. These economies are enabling innovative governments and companies to issue fixed-yield assets that offer investors an alternative to the norm which, under current circumstances, is fuelled by policy uncertainty and market volatility. Tokenised bonds bring a traditional safe haven into the digital age through improved accessibility, efficiency, and transparency.

Pi Network coin was trading at $0.80 on Wednesday, down by 52% from the highest point this month. This article explores whether Pi is a ghost chain and the impact on price. Pi Network aimed to change the crypto industry Pi Network is a crypto project started seven years ago to solve a key problem that Bitcoin has: its cost of mining. Bitcoin mining has continued rising over the years and is now dominated by large publicly-traded companies like Mara and Riot Platforms that run huge mining farms. Pi Network became popular by creating a platform that enables anyone with a smartphone to mine the coin. Users just need to download an app and then start mining coins by just tapping a button. Pi also hoped to solve the challenge where Bitcoin lacked smart contract features, making it almost impossible for developers to build dApps on top of it. It provided developers tools to build applications in industries like e-commerce, gaming, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Pi‚Äôs goal was that its coin would be used in the physical and digital worlds, giving it utility. Also, as with other chains, Pi Network hoped that these transaction costs would be used to burn the token, reducing those in circulation and boosting its price. The presence of an ecosystem was so important that it was a precondition for the mainnet launch to happen. It had to have at least 100 mainnet-ready applications. Pi Network price chart | Source: TradingView Is Pi a ghost chain? Therefore, the question is whether Pi Network is a ghost chain or not. A ghost chain is a blockchain project that has no developers and apps in its ecosystem. It also refers to those chains with ecosystems that people don‚Äôt use. A closer look at the Pi Network ecosystem shows that there are applications in its marketplace. Maps of Pi is a search engine that shows the locations of businesses accepting the Pi Coin. Fruity Pi is a game that has become fairly popular in the ecosystem. Other apps in the network are WorkforcePool (an Upwork of Pi), MyFestMap, Pet for Pi, and ChatGPT for Pi. The challenge for Pi Network is that there are signs that developers are not building in its technology stack. Also, no mainnet-ready application has gone mainstream in the past few months. This explains why the developers launched Pi Network Ventures last week. This initiative will see the company deploying $100 million to fund startups leveraging the Pi Network ecosystem. An ecosystem fund is a good initiative that other blockchains have launched similar initiatives. Solana has a $300 million ecosystem fund, while Ethereum launched a $1.03 billion fund. Kava, Skale, Harmony, Kadena, and Velas are other chains with similar funds. The challenge for Pi Network is that the process of identifying projects to fund will take time. After that, the process of building applications will be a lengthy one. As other chains like Harmony, Kadena, and Velas have showed, it is not guaranteed that projects that receive funding will succeed. Kadena‚Äôs KDA token is now valued at $183 million, while Velas, which launched a $100 million fund is worth $11 million. Centralization problem In addition to being a ghost chain, Pi Network also faces the accusation that it is a highly centralized network. This accusation stems from the fact that it is overseen by two entities: Pi Core Team and Pi Foundation. For a project with a fully diluted valuation of over $70 billion, token holders should know more about these entities. Also, there should be a clear audit by a top auditor. Nothing is known about the Pi Core Team and the foundation, if it exists. Besides, Pi Foundation today controls over 90 billion. As such, holding Pi is giving this foundation the benefit of the doubt that it will do the right thing and not dump the tokens. There is also a risk that these addresses may be hacked, leading to substantial losses to token holders. The fact that it is a ghost chain and that it is highly centralized explains why many mainstream exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are yet to list it. It also explains why Pi Coin price has crashed. Read more: Pi Network price prediction: Will Pi Coin recover from this plunge?

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully completed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a cumulative total of $9 million from over 11,000 token purchasers. The structured presale model has currently set the token price at $0.03 in phase 5, accelerating progress toward a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM, a 16.67% rise. With a 200% gain already achieved since its initial launch, MUTM is set to officially launch at $0.06, offering current buyers a guaranteed 100% return on investment (2x ROI). As one of the best crypto coins to invest in during this cycle, post-launch projections suggest MUTM could moon 9000% by Q3, putting it in contention as the next big cryptocurrency to dominate the 2025 bull run. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Mutuum Finance brings a new innovation to mtToken features, the ability to earn yield from assets outside the normal procedure of locking them. Users are not locking up holdings, they can freely use their assets and earn passively as well, which is a valuable change to DeFi users who appreciate revenue and usability. In addition, borrowers are able to easily access USDT using the platform‚Äôs collateralized loan provision, conformed to given ratio patterns. For example, $7,000 of ETH collateral can be used to unlock $5,000 stablecoins, the process being carried out via open source smart contracts. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $9 million from more than 11,000 investors, and Phase 5 is live now at $0.03, but not for long. With a confirmed 2x ROI at launch, $0.06, and momentum building rapidly, buyers in this phase stand to lock in an instant 16.67% gain when Phase 6 activates at $0.035. Already up 200% since presale launch, MUTM is projected to skyrocket up to 9000% by Q3, making it one of the most explosive opportunities this cycle. This is your final chance to buy before the next price hike, secure your position now or risk missing out on one of the top DeFi launches of 2025.

In an official press release , the web browser announced that the new on-chain naming service would become available for more than 85 million active monthly users. The firm aims to make the domains accessible on the Brave Wallet for cryptocurrency payments and within the main browser‚Äôs newest version 1.81, which will be available in Nightly builds and scheduled for release on August 5, 2025. This makes Brave ( BAT ) the first web browser to deploy its own blockchain-based top-level domains or TLDs. Users will be able to mint their named domains as non-fungible tokens on the Polygon ( POL ) network, granting them ownership without renewal fees. The new domains offer users a seamless way to own their digital identity and simplify sending crypto by acting as a replacement to lengthy cryptocurrency wallet addresses, changing them into readable human names. According to the announcement, the domains can be resolved across various networks, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Base ( BASE ), and Sonic ( S ) to name a few.

At the moment, the web browser firm and Unstoppable Domains are exploring the possibility of gaining an ICANN general top-level domain registration for 2026. A ICANN gTLD registration would allow for .brave domains to function in both traditional Web2 and decentralized Web3 environments. As previously reported by crypto.news, the firm‚Äôs wallet recently added support for Cardano ( ADA ) after its recently announced partnership with Input | Output.

However, according to the following six charts, the bitcoin market now appears sturdier than in December-January, suggesting a higher probability of a continued move higher. Financial conditions: (DXY, 10y, 30y yields vs BTC) Financial conditions refer to various economic variables, including interest rates, inflation, credit availability, and market liquidity. These are influenced by the benchmark government bond yield, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, the dollar exchange rate and other factors. Tighter financial conditions disincentivize risk-taking in financial markets and the economy, while easier conditions have the opposite effect. As of writing, financial conditions, represented by the 10-year yield and the dollar index, appear much easier than in January, favoring a sustained move higher in BTC. At press time, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against major currencies, stood at 99.60, down 9% from highs above 109.00 in January. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note stood at 4.52%, down 30 basis points from the high of 4.8% in January. The 30-year yield has risen above 5%, revisiting levels seen in January, but is largely seen as positive for bitcoin and gold. More dry powder The combined market capitalization of the top two USD-pegged stablecoins, USDT and USDC, has reached a record high of $151 billion. That's nearly 9% higher than the average $139 billion in December-January, according to data source TradingView. In other words, a greater amount of dry powder is now available for potential investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bold directional bets BTC's run higher from early April lows near $75,000 is characterized by institutions predominantly taking bullish directional bets rather than arbitrage bets. That's evident by the booming inflows into the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the still subdued open interest in the CME BTC futures. According to data source Velo, the notional open interest in the CME bitcoin futures has jumped to $17 billion, the highest since Feb. 20. Still, it remains well below the December high of $22.79 billion. On the contrary, the cumulative inflows into the 11 spot ETFs now stand at a record $42.7 billion versus $39.8 billion in January, according to data source Farside Investors. No signs of speculative fervor Historically, interim and major bitcoin tops, including the December-January one, have been characterized by speculative fervour in the broader market, leading to a sharp rise in market valuations for non-serious tokens such as DOGE and SHIB. There are no such signs now, with the combined market cap of DOGE and SHIB well below their January highs. No signs of overheating The bitcoin perpetual futures market shows demand for bullish leveraged bets, understandably so, considering BTC is trading near record highs. However, the overall positioning remains light, with no signs of excess leverage build-up or bullish overheating, as evidenced by funding rates hovering well below highs seen in December. The chart shows funding rates, which refer to the cost of holding perpetual futures bets. The positive figure indicates a bias for longs and willingness among the bulls to pay shorts to keep their positions open. It's a sign of bullish market sentiment. Implied volatility suggests calm The bitcoin market appears much calmer this time, with Deribit's DVOL index, measuring the 30-day expected or implied volatility, significantly lower than levels observed in December-January and March 2024 price tops. The low IV suggests traders are not pricing in the extreme price swings or uncertainty that typically exists in an overheated market, indicating a more measured and potentially more sustainable uptrend.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Stablecoins|ETFs|Bonds|DOGE|SHIB|Volatility|market analysis|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-21 09:38:16

According to Financial Times calculations based on company guidance during the current full-year earnings season, firms like Toyota, Sony, and Mizuho could face a loss of 4 trillion yen ($27.6 billion). The nearly $28B total was calculated by adding up tariff impact figures provided by Japan‚Äôs top 100 largest groups by market capitalization, car companies, and others that cited a large impact in their earnings presentations or calls. Most of the estimates given by Japanese groups assume no measures to offset the charges, such as a product price rise. Corporate Japan warns of huge blow from U.S. tariffs *TOYOTA: -180B YEN IMPACT ON PROFIT IN APRIL-MAY FROM US TARIFFS Yeah good luck to you if you work at a Toyota factory in the United States. I tried my best to warn you. ‚Äî Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) May 8, 2025 Japan‚Äôs economy could be steered further off course following figures released on Friday that showed Japanese GDP turned negative in the January-to-March period from the previous quarter, even before the U.S tariffs had begun to show in the export numbers. Japan‚Äôs automotive industry, its biggest export sector, was hit the most by the U.S. trade levies. The country exported 1.5 million vehicles to the U.S. in 2023, worth more than $40 billion, and car manufacturers also ship many vehicles and parts into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, which have been hit by tariffs as well. Chief executive at Honda, Toshihiro Mibe, said that the impact of tariff policies is huge, with the car company predicting 650B yen ($4.5 billion) of extra costs and has slashed its investment plans to 2030 by 3 trillion yen ($20B) to 7 trillion yen. Toyota had the hardest blow, estimating an impact of $1.2 billion in April and May. Tadashi Imai, president at Nippon Steel, which declined to estimate the tariff impact, acknowledged that the levies were expected to have a tremendous impact on the domestic and overseas steel industries, including indirect effects. Other Japanese firms said they could take countermeasures to offset the blow by raising prices or shifting more production to the U.S. U.S. expects trade negotiations with Japan The U.S. issued 25% tariffs on imports from Japanese car companies, as well as steel and aluminum producers, while other sectors have 24% levies on their goods as part of President Donald Trump‚Äôs reciprocal tariffs. Japan is yet to secure a deal with the U.S., with chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa planning a third round of talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent by the end of the month. Bessent mentioned on Sunday that tariff rates will go back to reciprocal levels if countries do not make trade deals with the U.S. during the 90-day pause. ‚ÄúPresident Trump has put them on notice that if you do not negotiate in good faith, you will ratchet back up to your April 2 level.‚Äù Scott Bessent, U.S. Treasury Secretary. The President also mentioned on Friday that the U.S. will set tariff rates for its trading partners within the next few weeks. Trump acknowledged that his administration cannot negotiate trade deals with all countries at once due to limited capacity. According to government data, Japan‚Äôs export growth slowed for a second straight month as the country reels under Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Exports to the U.S. also fell for the first time since December last year, plummeting 1.8% from a year ago. Japan‚Äôs exports to the U.S. inched up 3.1% in March. According to official figures, the country‚Äôs trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed to 780.6 billion yen ($5.4 billion) in April, compared to 846.9 billion yen in March. Customs data also showed that Japan‚Äôs exports of transport equipment, including motor vehicles and parts, to the U.S. fell 4.1% by value from a year earlier.

Memecoins. They evolved from community experiments into extraction systems that exploit fundamental human greed. ‚ÄùLife-changing wealth from one well-timed trade.‚Äù Behind this operates sophisticated machinery. Professional launches with hundreds of thousands of marketing dollars targeting the most susceptible demographics. Artificial time pressures override rational thinking and stimulate impulsive buying. Asymmetrical liquidity pools are designed for controlled price movement. Then, when sufficient retail capital enters, early participants exit.

Without external value creation, profits must come from other participants‚Äô losses. Of 1.7 million memes on Pump.fun, only 41 maintained a $1M market cap‚Äîa 99.998% failure rate by design. The information advantage A LIBRA‚Äôs scandal demonstrates this perfectly. Launched with initial, albeit later retracted, endorsement from Argentine President Javier Milei, LIBRA eventually collapsed and approximately 44,000 individuals lost $251M collectively, on-chain data from Nansen Research indicated. Research also showed that Jupiter Exchange knew about the project two weeks before the public launch. Portnoy reported being offered $30M to promote it. Every successful launch follows a consistent pattern: Inner circle : Developers and initial investors with complete launch information Connected players : Key opinion leaders who receive early information while often telling followers to ‚Äústay locked in‚Äù Technical participants : Users with specialized tools like sniper bots and bundler connections General public : Retail investors who typically gain access last, often buying near local price peaks The RWA alternative RWAs operate on fundamentally different principles. Their returns derive from asset productivity, not information advantages: Tokenized real estate generates rental income regardless of token trading. Infrastructure assets produce revenue through operations. IP creates royalty streams independent of market fluctuations. The critical difference is that memecoins derive value solely from what future buyers will pay; RWAs derive value from what the underlying assets produce. This enables a positive-sum model. If assets perform well, all participants potentially benefit. RWAs‚Äô most transformative aspect is democratizing access to productive assets previously limited to institutions and the wealthy. Blockchain solves key limitations: Fractional ownership reduces minimums from millions to hundreds. Global access eliminates geographic restrictions. Programmable compliance streamlines regulatory requirements. Continuous markets improve liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. The access revolution Information-advantage systems face structural limitations. Market cycles deplete willing participants as losers rarely return. Meanwhile, extraction infrastructure grows more sophisticated as the participant base shrinks. RWAs face different challenges: regulatory compliance, reliable oracles, custody solutions, and market development. But they connect to assets producing value independent of blockchain itself. Both systems will coexist. As BlackRock‚Äôs Fink noted, tokenizing real-world assets isn‚Äôt about eliminating speculation but improving how productive assets operate and who can access them. The infrastructure for RWAs has reached the necessary technical threshold for trillion-dollar markets. What remains critical is distribution‚Äîconnecting these assets with investors.

Ethereum and Ripple also held firm above key technical support levels, helping to sustain a cautiously optimistic tone in broader crypto markets. Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and continues to serve as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. However, its increasing maturity, declining volatility, and rising institutional participation have reduced its appeal for investors targeting outsized, asymmetric returns. In contrast, early-stage tokens like Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among risk-tolerant investors looking for higher upside potential. With sentiment improving across the broader crypto market, these speculative assets are well-positioned to benefit from renewed inflows as traders seek exposure to high-volatility plays. Analysts sees BTC hitting new highs Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, noted several key technical zones traders are watching, including the 21-day moving average (currently at $101,640), the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and the 2025 yearly open. Alan pointed out the potential for a Golden Cross forming between the 50-day and 200-day MAs, with confluence from a longer-term trendline. ‚ÄúIf the $105,000 level continues to hold, a move toward the all-time high looks increasingly feasible,‚Äù Alan said.

In his latest analysis, he flagged $91,800 and $100,700 as key downside levels of interest but emphasized that momentum was favoring the bulls. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always a good morning with Bitcoin at $108,000 and close to a new ATH,‚Äù he wrote on X, forecasting that new record highs are arriving ‚Äúfaster than he expected.‚Äù Van de Poppe sees $120,000 as the next major milestone, with longer-term targets reaching as high as $200,000. Bitcoin Pepe to list soon A renewed rally in Bitcoin, historically a trigger for wider market momentum, is once again lifting sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. As capital rotates back into digital assets, speculative tokens ‚Äî particularly meme coins ‚Äî are regaining investor attention. Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a notable beneficiary of this trend, positioned at the convergence of meme-driven virality and blockchain infrastructure innovation. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network, it combines the network‚Äôs established security with the scalability typically associated with Solana-like architecture. The project has announced a series of strategic partnerships to broaden its Layer 2 ecosystem. These include Super Meme for secure meme coin launches using the PEP-20 standard, Catamoto for BASE chain fair launches, and Plena Finance, which may integrate BPEP into its mobile-first DeFi platform. Additionally, a collaboration with the GETE Network could extend Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs presence into cross-chain Web3 gaming. These integrations aim to enhance the project‚Äôs technical foundation and provide potential real-world utility for its token, distinguishing Bitcoin Pepe from purely speculative meme assets. Investor interest appears strong. Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs presale has raised over $10 million so far, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0359. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, with an exchange listing expected soon after ‚Äî an event that could act as a near-term catalyst for price action.

As of the afternoon on May 21 (Asia time), Pyth ( PYTH ) was trading around $0.124, down about 3% in the past 24 hours. That‚Äôs its lowest point since April 11. The token‚Äôs market cap currently sits just above $22.7 billion. The latest slide follows a scheduled token unlock on May 20, which released approximately 2.13 billion PYTH into circulation, valued at $275.11 million. The unlock, part of Pyth‚Äôs annual vesting cycle, represented 58.7% of the circulating supply at the time and was distributed to early investors, contributors, and ecosystem participants. Following the event, Pyth‚Äôs circulating supply has surged to nearly 5.75 billion tokens, around 57.5% of its maximum supply, which is capped at 10 billion. With this unlock, approximately 36% of the total supply is now in active circulation. The final two unlocks are scheduled for May 2026 and May 2027. You might also like: Pyth Network dips below mid-band and RSI trends lower as $313M token unlock looms Large unlocks like this often unsettle investors, as they inject a significant volume of new tokens into the market without a matching rise in demand. That imbalance can lead to downward price pressure. Even if not all recipients offload immediately, many tend to sell early, anticipating further declines. At the same time, unlocks are often part of a project‚Äôs long-term roadmap to distribute ownership more broadly and reward early contributors. They usually mark key milestones in the development cycle. Since Pyth‚Äôs unlock schedule was publicly disclosed well in advance, some of the impact may have already been factored in, potentially reducing the risk of a sharp, panic-driven selloff. PYTH eyes drop to $0.10 support level Although PYTH price has recovered slightly since the unlock event, there is a risk that the PYTH price will continue downward in the next few weeks as a death cross pattern nears on the 4-hour/USDT chart. A death cross forms when the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages cross each other while pointing downwards. PYTH price, 50-day and 200-day EMA chart ‚Äî May 21 | Source: crypto.news In Pyth Network ‚Äôs case, the spread between the two moving averages has narrowed in the past few months. Its 200-day MA was at $0.1552, while the 50-day was at $0.1589. A death cross often leads to a substantial decline over time. For example, the last time that PYTH price formed this pattern was in December last year, and the coin dropped by over 76%. PYTH Supertrend and RSI chart ‚Äî May 21 | Source: crypto.news On top of that, the Supertrend indicator has also flashed a red signal, adding to the bearish outlook. If the death cross is validated, PYTH could continue falling in the near term, with $0.10 being the next key level to watch as both a psychological support and its lowest point from April. That said, PYTH‚Äôs Relative Strength Index is currently sitting at 30, which is right near the oversold zone. This might trigger a short-term relief rally as buyers look to buy the dip, but any recovery could be temporary unless the broader trend shifts.

He seized the medium to reiterate Ripple‚Äôs mission in the United States and worldwide. In a post on X, Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple has failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with the Senator in the last six years, despite being a U.S.-based company actively working to expand the domestic crypto economy. Garlinghouse acknowledged that last-minute changes are often unavoidable in a senator‚Äôs daily schedule. However, he took issue with the outright refusal to find another time to meet. He stated that the response from Lummis‚Äô staff that the meeting can‚Äôt be rescheduled was troubling. He added, ‚ÄúI really have to wonder if this was Sen. Lummis or someone on her staff making this decision.‚Äù Thanks for this info. Certainly enlightening that Will Cole is related to Sen Lummis.

Will Cole, Head of Product at a Bitcoin payments company, was identified by one community member as Lummis‚Äô son-in-law. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cole is a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and has previously shared content criticizing Ripple and Garlinghouse. His recent repost of a post mocking Garlinghouse has increased scrutiny of the Senator‚Äôs impartiality. What further raises questions is the fact that Lummis has received financial support from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z), a known backer of various crypto and blockchain projects. Lummis has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin and is considered one of Congress‚Äôs most prominent Bitcoin-aligned lawmakers. These affiliations could explain the Senator‚Äôs reluctance to engage with Ripple, a company often positioned in opposition to Bitcoin maximalism. While no formal accusations of misconduct have been made, observers in the crypto community are questioning whether the Senator‚Äôs personal and familial connections are influencing her professional decisions. A popular attorney called Bitcoin maximalists immature as they jumped on the situation, attempting to paint it as a victory for BTC, failing to see the harm their actions can do to the crypto market. What‚Äôs Next for the Crypto Industry Garlinghouse and others at Ripple have consistently advocated for regulatory clarity, industry support in Washington, and an inclusive approach to crypto regulation. The inability to secure a meeting with Senator Lummis, who has positioned herself as a leader on digital asset policy, has raised concerns about favoritism in the crypto space. For Ripple, exclusion from key policy conversations may affect its ability to contribute to the regulatory landscape, but Garlinghouse remains undeterred.

Easing trade tensions creates improved market conditions, which fuel institutional digital asset adoption. As the May 31 listing nears, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) witnesses increasing inflows, gaining traction as the best crypto to buy this altseason. The first and biggest blockchain network, Bitcoin, has achieved a new milestone: its market cap has reached $2.12 trillion for the first time. BTC is now more valuable than major global corporations like Google, valued at $2.022 trillion, and Meta, valued at $1.6 trillion. Image courtesy: CoinMarketCap From the April low of $74,420, the Bitcoin price has surged 43.67% to a 4-month high of $107,137. Bitcoin's historic achievement comes after significant diplomatic developments on the global stage. US President Donald Trump has announced major trade deals, one being with the UK and another ongoing with China. Positive developments in global trade deals have eased tensions in the financial market, improving investors' overall risk appetite. This achievement has made Bitcoin rise in rankings in global assets and has also given a boost to crypto adoption.

Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, has predicted that the Bitcoin price could reach $200k by the end of 2025, while the long-term outlook for 2028 is suggested at $500k. Bitcoin price holds $105K; 10 DMA becomes key support zone Bitcoin's price has reclaimed the $105,000 level after dipping to a low of $102,000 on Monday. With this bounce, $105k and the 10-DMA have now become critical support. This zone, previously a resistance point in early 2025, has been successfully back-tested. According to the chart analysis, BTC's recent close above $105K, combined with a strong candle body and downside wick, signals growing demand from lower levels.

The golden cross forms when the 50-day SMA crosses over the 200-day SMA and is seen as a signal for upcoming price surges. While Bitcoin leads the charge, micro-caps are the ones that create wealth for investors. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is one of the best cryptos to buy now, which aligns with the long-term trend of crypto adoption and more awareness of decentralization and accessibility in equal measure. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Biggest play on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe is one of the emerging projects that could directly benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs rising dominance in global finance. This platform is built to grow by Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing market capitalization as it enables a meme launchpad on BTC‚Äôs $2 trillion liquidity. Major networks like SOL and ETH have had meme manias in recent years, but have you wondered why there haven‚Äôt been any memes on the Bitcoin network? Previous attempts have faced technical difficulties, preventing success, but BPEP has pulled it off with the PEP-20 standard, which will allow the launch of memes on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has always been a valuable asset. Now, Bitcoin Pepe is making it a leader in meme and retail trading. This layer-2 meme platform could revolutionize the sector by combining Bitcoin‚Äôs security with the speed and scalability of Solana. Some devs are calling it ‚ÄúSolana on Bitcoin.‚Äù Additionally, Bitcoin Pepe is establishing major ties with influential crypto projects like Super Meme, Plena Finance, and GETE Network, spanning DeFi, AI, and gaming. This move will significantly enhance BPEP‚Äôs utility across multiple sectors. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it laterSeen they've got some major partnerships lined up too.Heard the tier 1's are after this one... I'd stack now while you can. https://t.co/T3kuv2iX4G ‚Äî Zenia (@Zenia_sol) May 14, 2025 Investor confidence in the project has increased exponentially as the staking pools, totaling over 200 million tokens, are now completely sold out due to high demand. Moreover, the ongoing token presale has raised $10.7m in a short period of time. There is only a brief period of time remaining to buy BPEP tokens at an undervalued price of $0.0359 as the presale is racing towards its May 31st Tier 1 exchange listings. Cardano jumps 20% monthly‚Äîcan it sustain the rally? ADA rose 20% in the last 30 days because of the positive advancements combined with market optimism about network upgrades. Development activity continues to grow on the ADA network thanks to its regular upgrades. Scalability plans alongside strong interoperability functions enable Cardano to develop its position in the market over time. The price movement of ADA faces huge challenges because market conditions and community enthusiasm for new developments tend to drive price changes. The potential increase of ADA might face difficulties because of diminishing investor attention and technical challenges that could disrupt its market position. Best crypto to buy for the biggest bull cycle Bitcoin price holding above $105K is a powerful signal for the broader market. As BTC eyes a breakout above $110K, altcoins are preparing for liftoff. Cardano‚Äôs strong rebound reflects ongoing buyer interest, while Bitcoin Pepe offers one of the most lucrative opportunities of the year. With a public presale offering access at just $0.0359, BPEP stands out as a top-tier pick for investors seeking long-term growth. FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now? Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is currently the top cryptocurrency to consider buying. As the first meme coin launching directly on the Bitcoin network, it introduces the PEP-20 token standard, enabling users to create and trade tokens natively on Bitcoin's Layer 2. With its presale concluding on May 31, BPEP is poised for significant growth upon listing on major centralized exchanges. When is Bitcoin Pepe launching? Bitcoin Pepe will list on centralized exchanges on May 31, after wrapping up its 30-stage presale. Is Caradno a good investment? Cardano (ADA) is considered a promising long-term investment in 2025. Its expanding DeFi ecosystem, which recently surpassed $700 million in total value locked, and growing adoption of smart contracts have enhanced its utility and market appeal. Analysts forecast ADA's price to range between $0.66 and $2.36 by the end of 2025, with some projections reaching up to $2.05, reflecting potential for significant growth. Will Bitcoin reach $250k? As of May 21, 2025, Bitcoin is trading around $107,844 . While a rise to $250,000 would require significant market momentum, the current trends and expert analyses suggest it's within the realm of possibility.

This time around it is providing instant payment remittance services in Malaysia. This further highlights Stellar‚Äôs ongoing expansion into real-world utility and cross-border financial infrastructure. Successively, XLM is now a coin to watch closely. Let us analyze its current technical setup and derive Stellar (XLM) price analysis. Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis: Stellar (XLM) is currently changing hands at $0.2882, although up 1.76% in the past 24 hours, it still remains down 7.65% over the past week. Despite the recent plunge, the rebound from the 200-day moving average is a bullish sign. Historically, this MA acts as a strong dynamic support, and price bouncing from this zone often signals the end of short-term bearish trends. Looking at the 4-hour XLM price chart, the altcoin is pushing above the 9-D SMA, another early indication of bullish momentum. That‚Äôs not all, the RSI at 51.34, breaking above the midline, suggests growing buying pressure after a bearish phase. Moving toward its forecast, XLM is currently ranging between a key support at $0.20 and a resistance at $0.35. Considering the aforementioned developments, if the altcoin runs out of steam, it could tumble down to $0.26. However, if the breakout gains traction, the $0.30 mark could be on the horizon, before a leg-up to $0.35. That being said, it could average out at $0.28. Also, check out our Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term price targets! FAQs 1. Is Stellar (XLM) a good buy now? Considering the technicals and developments, XLM looks promising for short-term gains. A confirmed breakout above $0.30 would strengthen the bullish scenario. 2. What would invalidate the bullish setup? A break below $0.26 and declining RSI back under 50 could invalidate the short-term bullish structure. 3. How much is 1 Stellar coin? The price of 1 Stellar (XLM) coin at the time of press is $0.2882, with an intraday gain of 1.76%.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XLM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 09:57:13

These functions let users explore new tokens , tap into passive income opportunities, and make crypto payments across 130+ blockchains . The Crypto for Everyone Movement In the past year, Bitget Wallet‚Äôs overall user base went up by 300% thanks to the platform‚Äôs expansions in emerging regions like Africa (+959%), the Middle East (+350%), and Europe (+367%), where people rely on crypto to handle inflation , economic instability , and a lack of traditional banking infrastructure. The wallet was also among the first to allow in-app shopping with crypto cards , QR codes, and direct token purchases, supporting payments across over 300 major brands, including Amazon, Google Play, Shopee, and more.

Filed in the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, the complaint accuses the firm of issuing deceptive ‚Äúrights certificates‚Äù tied to Unicoin tokens and falsely marketing them as being backed by real-world assets. Executives Accused of Misleading Investors According to the SEC, Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former Chief Investment Officer Alex Dominguez are at the center of the alleged scheme. The agency claims they falsely promoted investment certificates by asserting they were backed by valuable international real estate‚Äîwhen in reality, the properties were worth only a fraction of what was promised. Unicoin also allegedly overstated its fundraising efforts , claiming to have raised $3 billion through certificate sales. The SEC asserts the actual amount raised was closer to $110 million. Furthermore, Konanykhin is said to have personally sold nearly 38 million rights certificates to investors who were not legally eligible to participate. In addition to the three executives, Unicoin‚Äôs general counsel Richard Devlin was named for misleading investors through a private placement memorandum. Although Devlin has not admitted wrongdoing, he agreed to a $37,500 fine and accepted a permanent injunction. ‚ÄúUnicoin and its executives exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises,‚Äù said Mark Cave, associate director in the SEC‚Äôs Division of Enforcement. ‚ÄúTheir claims of real estate-backed tokens were simply not true.‚Äù Company Denies Allegations, Vows Legal Fight Unicoin and its leadership deny the charges. In a statement to Decrypt last month, Konanykhin dismissed the SEC‚Äôs claims, insisting the lawsuit is politically motivated and not reflective of current agency leadership. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs grotesque that the most compliant crypto company in the U.S. remains the only one being persecuted by the SEC,‚Äù he said, calling the case a remnant of the previous Gensler-led administration. The timing of the lawsuit is also raising eyebrows, as the SEC under President Trump has recently backed off other major crypto enforcement actions, including cases against Coinbase, Ripple, and Kraken. The SEC is seeking permanent bans for the three top executives, alongside disgorgement and civil penalties. The case could become a high-profile test of the agency‚Äôs evolving stance on crypto regulation under the new administration.

Not If You‚Äôre the Guy Who Lost $66M,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-meme-coin-to-buy-not-if-youre-the-guy-who-lost-66m,"The crypto market is a rollercoaster of hype and heartbreak, with meme coins leading the charge in both profits and pitfalls. A good example is the wild swings of the $TRUMP memecoin, where traders who won a dinner with the US president reaped millions, while one investor, possibly Justin Sun, is nursing a staggering $66 million loss. This tale of feast and famine underscores the high-stakes gamble of chasing the best meme coin to buy. Amid this chaos, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , an Ethereum-based token blending AI-driven trading with meme culture, emerges as a potential contender for investors seeking innovation over speculation. The $TRUMP Memecoin Frenzy: A Tale of Wins and Losses The $TRUMP memecoin, launched days before Donald Trump‚Äôs second inauguration in January 2025, skyrocketed to a $14 billion valuation before plummeting to its current $2.6 billion level, per CoinMarketCap. A contest announced on April 23, 2025, fueled its meteoric rise, offering a gala dinner with Trump to the top 25 holders of $TRUMP in publicly visible wallets. The token‚Äôs price surged from $9.26 to $15.33 during the contest window, tempting traders to pile in. However, the aftermath revealed a stark divide. Of the 25 ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù winners, 16 emptied their wallets post-contest, with some cashing out millions. For instance, the ‚ÄúWoo‚Äù account reportedly turned a $2.6 million profit by buying 1 million $TRUMP tokens at $10.8 million and selling at $13.3 million. Others, like ‚ÄúNACH,‚Äù pocketed smaller but still significant gains of around $52,000. However, not all were so lucky. The ‚ÄúSUN‚Äù account, speculated to be linked to crypto mogul Justin Sun, bought 800,000 tokens at a peak price of $61.13, only to see the token crash to $12.96 by May 2025‚Äîa potential $66 million loss. The $TRUMP contest also raised eyebrows. Of the 25 VIPs, 22 only began accumulating tokens after the contest was announced, suggesting speculative plays rather than long-term belief in the coin‚Äôs value. With 56 of 195 additional winners also emptying their wallets, the memecoin‚Äôs lack of intrinsic utility‚Äîbeyond speculative trading and a dinner with Trump‚Äîbecame glaringly apparent. As Trump‚Äôs administration pushes for looser crypto regulations, the market remains a speculative playground, making it critical to evaluate which meme coin offers real potential in 2025. Why Meme Coins Are Still a Hot Topic in 2025 Meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have long captivated the crypto community with their viral appeal and potential for explosive returns. In 2025, the meme coin market continues to thrive, driven by social media hype and community engagement. However, the $TRUMP saga shows that not all meme coins are created equal. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have built loyal followings and some utility, like Dogecoin‚Äôs use in tipping, many newer tokens rely solely on hype, leaving investors vulnerable to crashes. Investors hunting for the best meme coin to buy must look beyond short-term pumps and evaluate projects with tangible value or innovative technology. This is where Dawgz AI stands in the gap, offering a blend of meme-tastic fun and AI-driven trading that could set it apart in the crowded 2025 market. Dawgz AI: A Meme Coin with a Technological Edge Unlike other meme coins that thrive on political hype and celeb endorsements, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) aims to deliver value through artificial intelligence and community engagement. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, $DAGZ is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 8.888 billion DAGZ tokens. Its presale, which has raised $3.61 million of $4.19 million, offers tokens at $0.00438, with the next price increase to $0.00474 looming. Its smart contracts have also been audited by SolidProof to address security concerns in the crypto sphere. But what makes Dawgz AI stand out is its integration of AI-powered trading algorithms to optimize returns. Developed by a team of Wall Street veterans and algorithmic trading experts, these algorithms analyze market trends in real-time, aiming to deliver consistent yields with minimal effort from investors. This focus on advanced technology differentiates $DAGZ from traditional meme coins, which often lack utility. Additionally, 20% of the token supply is allocated to staking rewards, encouraging long-term holding and stability‚Äîa contrast to the dump-and-run tactics seen in other meme contests. Stage 8: Checked off the list. ‚úÖAnother win on the board. This isn‚Äôt luck, it‚Äôs strategy, support and solid execution. On to Stage 9 with even more fire. üî•Don't say we didn't warn you, we know where we‚Äôre going and stage 9 is just the next step. ‚§¥Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/aENcREe7U0 ‚Äî Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) May 20, 2025 The project also leans heavily on community engagement. With 15% of tokens dedicated to community rewards, Dawgz AI promotes participation through meme contests and campaigns, tapping into the viral energy that drives the best meme coins. Its roadmap, spanning from ‚ÄúPuppyhood‚Äù to ‚ÄúAlpha Dog Status,‚Äù also outlines plans for global outreach, exchange listings, and continuous AI improvements, signaling a commitment to sustainable growth. Conclusion The meme coin market in 2025 is a high-risk, high-reward arena where fortunes can be made or lost overnight. The $TRUMP memecoin‚Äôs wild ride‚Äîfrom multimillion-dollar profits to a $66 million loss‚Äîserves as a cautionary tale for those searching for the best meme coin to buy. Amid this volatility, Dawgz AI offers a compelling alternative, blending AI-powered trading with the global energy of meme culture. By prioritizing security, community, and innovation, $DAGZ could be a smart addition to your crypto portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions Which meme coin is best to buy now? Dawgz AI‚Äôs AI-driven trading and community focus make it one of the best meme coins to buy now. Unlike purely speculative tokens, $DAGZ offers a blend of fun and functionality, making it a potential pick for 2025 investors. Which meme coin has the most potential? Dawgz AI stands out as the meme coin with the most potential for its advanced AI technology and Ethereum-based security. Its roadmap and staking rewards also suggest long-term growth. Which meme coin will give 1000x? Predicting 1000x returns is speculative, but Dawgz AI‚Äôs presale price of $0.00438 and projected launch price of $0.00702 offer significant upside potential if the project gains traction. Which meme coin will reach $1? Reaching $1 is a tall order for most meme coins. Dawgz AI focus on AI innovation and community rewards could drive its price to $1 as it gains traction after listing.

This downturn coincides with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) decision to postpone its ruling on 21Shares‚Äô proposed spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), as outlined in a filing on May 20. A week ago, XRP‚Äôs market capitalization stood at $153.56 billion. As of press time, the figure has fallen to $137.45 billion, a decline of $16.11 billion. The token is currently trading at $2.34, reflecting a price drop of nearly 10% over the same period. XRP market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap SEC delays spot ETF approval In announcing the delay, the SEC stated it would extend the review period to assess whether the proposed 21Shares Core XRP Trust complies with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. This provision mandates that ETF products implement adequate safeguards against fraud and market manipulation. The proposed ETF aims to track the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and rely on Coinbase Custody to securely store its underlying assets. Following the delay, stakeholders have 21 days to submit comments and 35 days for rebuttals. On the other hand, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart described the development as ‚Äúexpected,‚Äù noting that the SEC typically utilizes the 240-day review window under the 19b-4 filing process. He stated that approvals for spot crypto ETFs are unlikely before late June or early July and are more realistically expected in early Q4 2025. Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets ‚Äî i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Next SEC ETF decision For instance, as reported by Finbold, the SEC is expected to decide on Franklin Templeton‚Äôs application for a spot XRP ETF by June 17, 2025. Franklin Templeton, one of the largest asset managers pursuing such a product, aims to offer investors exposure to XRP via traditional brokerage accounts, an approval that could potentially drive the asset‚Äôs price higher.

Related News: The Long-Awaited Big XRP Announcement Has Arrived! ""The Date is May 19!"" According to the data, CME XRP futures contracts recorded trading volumes of over $19 million on their first day and at least $10 million on their second day.

According to the statement made by CME, the launched XRP futures offer investors the opportunity to trade both micro contracts containing 2,500 XRP and larger contracts containing 50 thousand XRP. CME XRP futures are settled in cash and are based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is used as the daily reference rate for the XRP price in the US dollar and is calculated daily at 16:00 London time. Market participants view the launch of regulated XRP futures contracts as a potential step towards approval of a spot XRP ETF in the United States. At this point, ETF Store President Nate Geraci also stated in his post that it is only a matter of time for the spot XRP ETF to be approved after futures XRP transactions, implying that he is certain that the XRP ETF will be approved. Despite a strong outflow from futures contracts, the spot price of XRP has remained relatively stable, trading around $2.35. *This is not investment advice.

Vanar Chain is a next-gen Layer 1 blockchain that tackles Web3‚Äôs deepest pain point: data permanence. Most chains store pointers to external files. Vanar stores the files themselves at scale using a breakthrough called Neutron, a compression-powered storage layer that tucks megabytes of data into kilobytes and commits the result straight into the blockchain. Built with EVM compatibility, AI- agent support, and real-world asset (RWA) infrastructure, Vanar is positioning itself as the intelligent backbone for apps that can‚Äôt afford to go dark when a cloud provider stutters. Neutron: Data Meets Chain, For Real Neutron flips the traditional ‚Äúhash plus hosted file‚Äù model and replaces it with a fully self-contained, on-chain data system. Here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs a big deal: AI-powered dual-layer compression - Neutron shrinks files up to 500:1 using both physical and semantic passes. Neutron Seeds - These self-describing assets are retrievable by smart contracts either in full or field-by-field. No external hosts - No S3, no IPFS, no broken thumbnails, no outages from AWS or other clouds. True ownership - Both data and logic live on-chain, making files provable, permanent, and composable. This isn‚Äôt just a new way to store - it‚Äôs a new way to prove and own digital assets. A Chain With a Story 2017‚Äì2022: The team behind Vanar began as Terra Virtua, a digital collectibles platform that learned the hard way how brittle off-chain links can be. Late 2023: The rebrand from TVK to VANRY marked the beginning of Vanar Chain and its focus on AI-native, fully on-chain data. Today: With 80 engineers across Dubai, London, and Lisbon, Vanar has logged over 11.9M transactions, 1.56M unique addresses, and 100+ ecosystem partners - serious traction backing a serious vision. Why Vanar Matters Web3 has talked about truly on-chain assets for years - Vanar is finally making them possible. With Neutron, a DAO can anchor its meeting minutes to the chain, an AI agent can cite and prove its data source, and a lending protocol can execute a loan agreement backed by the actual document it references. This is on-chain memory, not just validation - a critical step for AI, finance, and real-world asset use cases that need transparency and finality. And with validators like Google Cloud and NVIDIA in the mix, Vanar‚Äôs infrastructure is already enterprise-grade. What‚Äôs Next? Q3 2025: Launch of the public Neutron Toolkit and developer portal Q4 2025: Expansion of the Neutron grant program Through 2026: Validator growth, more exchange integrations, and performance optimization to scale for AI-heavy, data-hungry apps Vanar‚Äôs goal? To become the default home for apps that can‚Äôt trust the cloud to keep their assets live. Fun Fact Neutron‚Äôs first public demo was more art show than dev update - it played live on 360¬∞ screens at Dubai‚Äôs Theatre of Digital Art during TOKEN2049, turning file compression into a full visual spectacle. Vanar Chain isn‚Äôt chasing faster blocktimes or TPS records. It‚Äôs solving the actual problem: how to make Web3 work when the internet breaks. For dApps, agents, and protocols that need their data to actually live on-chain, Vanar is the bet that might just pay off.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-21 10:09:44

Introduced by Blockstream CEO Adam Back , this powerful formula shows how long it would take for a company to earn its market valuation in Bitcoin terms‚Äîbased on its current BTC accumulation rate. As the crypto sector matures, ‚ÄòDays to Cover‚Äô is emerging as a key tool to distinguish real Bitcoin builders from hype-driven branders . What Is the ‚ÄòDays to Cover‚Äô Metric? The ‚ÄòDays to Cover‚Äô metric is calculated using the formula: Days to Cover = ln(mNAV) / ln(1 + Daily BTC Yield) Here‚Äôs what it means: mNAV (Market Net Asset Value) is the ratio of a company‚Äôs market cap to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. For example, an mNAV of 4.26 means the market values the company at 4.26x its BTC holdings. The formula estimates how many days it would take for a company‚Äôs daily BTC yield to ‚Äúcover‚Äù its current valuation. In simple terms, this metric shows how long it would take for a company to earn its market cap in Bitcoin‚Äîbased on its current stacking pace. ‚ÄòDays to Cover‚Äô Breakdown for Top Public BTC Companies MicroStrategist , a leading BTC analysis platform , applied this metric to the top BTC-holding public companies. Here‚Äôs what they found: Company mNAV Daily BTC Yield Days to Cover MetaPlanet 5.08 1.49% 110 days MicroStrategy (MSTR) 2.1 0.12% 626 days The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) 9.4 1.48% 152 days Semler Scientific 1.5 0.33% 114 days Companies like MetaPlanet and ALTBG are stacking Bitcoin aggressively‚Äîyielding over 1.4% daily . Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, despite its massive holdings of 576,230 BTC , accumulates at a more conservative pace but remains the most institutionally trusted BTC stock. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Bitcoin Heading to $600,000 by October 2025? , Why ‚ÄòDays to Cover‚Äô Is Crucial for Bitcoin Investors Real-Time Signal : This metric updates dynamically with a company‚Äôs BTC growth.

Interestingly, the Bitcoin dominance experienced a small pullback, which suggests a shift in the investor‚Äôs attention away from the star token towards the other altcoins. Meanwhile, the popular ones are failing to rise above their respective resistance as Ethereum remains stuck below $2600 and the prices of Litecoin & Quant continue to accumulate below $100. Now the question arises whether an ETH price breakout is required to lift the LTC & QNT price above $100 or a major price action is fast approaching. Litecoin (LTC) Price Feared for Another Drop The Litecoin price had broken above the prolonged consolidated range in the first few weeks, but the momentum faded as the token reached the end of Q1. Although the bulls are working hard to validate a V-shaped recovery, the bears are successfully dragging the levels below $100 and have kept the price restricted within the range. The current chart pattern could appear bullish, but in the wider timeframe, the LTC price appears to be primed for a major pullback. The LTC price has remained stuck within a rising parallel channel for over a few years, after triggering a rebound from the 2022 bear market. The token has been trying to breach above the average band of the channel for over a couple of weeks, but the bearish start for the week flashes bearish signals. The 50/200-day MA is failing to initiate a Golden cross while the DMI is heading towards a bearish crossover. Therefore, the Litecoin price is feared to drop back close to $75 if the token fails to trigger a rebound. Quant (QNT) Price in a Decisive Phase Quant has maintained a horizontal consolidation after surging by over 60%. The consolidation has been flashing the weakness of the bulls, which may point towards an extended pullback. The QNT price is trading within a decisive phase, and hence, a breakout could elevate the price beyond current highs. While the volume remains within a restrictive range, it would be interesting to watch whether the price will rise to $111 or drop close to $80. As seen in the above chart, the Quant price is about to experience a rise in volatility as the Bollinger bands are about to contract. On the other hand, the Chaikin Money Flow is heading towards the average range, hinting towards a drop in the money flow. This suggests the token is likely to accumulate for some more time, followed by which a major price action could follow, depending on the volume induced. Considering the current price action, breaching above $100 seems to be quite difficult for the prices of Litecoin and Quant. However, with a rise in the buying volume, the market sentiments could change, which could clear the barriers to rise above the 3-digit figure.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|QNT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 11:27:20

In an X post published on May 20, Aave ( AAVE ) said it now holds 20% of the total value locked across decentralized finance. The sector as a whole has seen a sharp recovery, supported by a strong rally in Ethereum ( ETH ), which is up nearly 60% over the past month. Another post from on-chain analytics platform Sealaunch revealed that Aave‚Äôs DeFi TVL has doubled from $56 billion to $115 billion between Jan. 24 and May 21. Aave now holds 20% of all DeFi TVL. pic.twitter.com/I8FQChIlgv ‚Äî Aave (@aave) May 20, 2025 The token‚Äôs price has followed that momentum. AAVE is trading around $260 at press time, marking an 80% gain in the past 30 days and an 11% rise over the past week. Still, it remains about 60% below its record high of $661 from May 2021. Although $627 million was traded in the last day, that represents a 25% decrease from the previous day, indicating some cooling following the most recent spike. Aave‚Äôs recent surge is supported by a number of important events. Most notably, Aave integrated with a non-EVM chain for the first time ever when it deployed its V3 protocol on Aptos on May 19. This milestone improves Aave‚Äôs cross-chain lending capabilities and widens its network reach.

On the regulatory front, the U.S. Senate‚Äôs progress on the GENIUS Act is seen as a win for large DeFi companies like Aave, which may increase institutional adoption. Looking at the technical picture, AAVE is still on a solid upward trajectory. The price is trading well above all of the major moving averages, with the 200-day EMA hovering around $200 and the 10-day EMA and SMA at about $237, indicating widespread bullish momentum. Aave price analysis. Credit: crypto.news At 74.6, the relative strength index indicates an overbought situation. Momentum indicators, like the MACD, are still in the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù territory. AAVE is riding the upper band in the Bollinger Bands, which is usually a continuation sign during a strong rally. Recent sessions have seen an increase in volume, which supports the move. As long as AAVE remains above the 20-day simple moving average at $214, the bullish trend might continue. A break above $271, the upper Bollinger Band, could open the door for further gains toward the $300 mark, even though overbought conditions suggest a short-term pullback is also possible.

The project has entered phase 5 of its presale after selling out phase 4 faster than expected. MUTM is set to officially launch at $0.06, with a 200% gain already achieved since its initial launch. The next phase prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035. The tokens are available at $0.03, listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9 million raised and attracted more than 11,000 investors. As investors continue searching for the next big crypto, all eyes are on whether MUTM can transition from a low-priced gem to a double-digit token by 2026. Its powerful tech stack, Ethereum-based foundation, and surging popularity across social platforms all signal explosive upside. For those wondering what crypto to buy now for maximum growth potential, MUTM stands out as a serious coin among top coins preparing to lead the next wave. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM‚Äôs Ascent Is Only Beginning The presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9 million raised and attracted more that 11,000 investors. As Phase 5 is in , the token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Mutuum Finance isn‚Äôt just innovating, it‚Äôs building trust. The platform‚Äôs smart contracts are open-source and undergoing rigorous third-party audits. In addition to the native token, a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin is being developed, which circumvents the vulnerabilities of algorithmic stablecoins that have toppled other DeFi initiatives. The project is set to build a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network as one of the main features in the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are fundamentals of the ecosystem. Fostering Growth with $100K Giveaway and Gamified Community Tools To turbocharge adoption, Mutuum Finance is actively incentivizing its early adopters. Already underway is a $100,000 giveaway, where ten participants will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Running in tandem is a gamified leaderboard, displaying and rewarding the top 50 token holders, to encourage greater investment and continued participation. This is supported through a referral program, a new level of grassroots expansion in this rapidly growing community. Over $9 million raised from 11,000+ investors, a 200% gain since launch, and Phase 5 tokens available now at $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving it‚Äôs not just another presale; it‚Äôs a movement. As the next price jump to $0.035 looms, current buyers can lock in a 16.67% instant upside and a 2x ROI at launch ($0.06). With its hybrid lending model, Ethereum-based infrastructure, and growing community driven by a $100K giveaway and gamified rewards, MUTM is well-positioned to hit double-digit territory by 2026. This is your window to enter before Phase 5 sells out and price climbs again. Don‚Äôt be the one watching from the sidelines when the next DeFi rocket takes off.

Atkins, testifying in one of his first public hearings since taking office, reaffirmed his commitment to prioritizing digital asset oversight, while Adams announced the formation of a Digital Advisory Council to attract investment and make New York the world‚Äôs leading crypto hub. New York City Aims to Become Global Crypto Capital with New Digital Advisory Council New York City Mayor Eric Adams is pushing forward with his long-standing digital asset agenda, announcing on Monday the formation of a new Digital Advisory Council aimed at establishing the city as the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the globe.‚Äù Speaking at the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams emphasized the importance of integrating blockchain technology into civic life, not as a passing trend, but as a foundational shift for New York‚Äôs digital future. While specific details remain under wraps, Adams said the council would be composed of local experts and fintech leaders, with a council chair and formal policy recommendations expected in the coming weeks. Mayor Adams made it clear that this initiative is about more than branding. He envisions blockchain technology playing a direct role in city governance and public services. One of the proposals under consideration is enabling New Yorkers to pay for certain municipal services and taxes using cryptocurrencies, a move that would align the city with broader state-level legislative efforts already underway. Adams also floated the idea of using blockchain to safeguard sensitive documentation, such as birth and death certificates, in a secure yet accessible format. This latest push follows a May 12 announcement that financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale would assist in the city‚Äôs broader blockchain adoption efforts. These firms bring fintech, tokenization, and asset management experience to the table, suggesting the advisory council may focus on more than just payments and records. It may also evaluate tokenized infrastructure, digital identity, and blockchain-based capital formation strategies. The mayor‚Äôs commitment to crypto and Web3 initiatives isn‚Äôt new. Since taking office in January 2022, Adams has consistently promoted the city‚Äôs adoption of digital assets‚Äîfamously opting to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin as a gesture of support. State-Level Momentum but Limited Progress While Adams takes the initiative on the city level, several New York State legislators have also attempted to advance digital asset policy statewide. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill allowing state agencies to accept crypto payments. Earlier, in February, State Senator James Sanders Jr. proposed the Blockchain Study Act, aimed at forming a task force to assess the state‚Äôs blockchain landscape. However, both bills remain in legislative limbo and have yet to advance through either the state Senate or Assembly. These developments come amid a broader trend of US states positioning themselves for the crypto economy. At least 18 states are considering proposals to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, and New Hampshire and Arizona have already passed related legislation, according to data from Bitcoin Reserve Monitor. States pushing for Bitcoin reserves (Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor ) Mayor Adams' commitment to crypto faced scrutiny after he was indicted on corruption charges tied to alleged illegal campaign contributions from the Turkish government. However, in a surprising turn of events, the US Justice Department directed local authorities to drop the charges, and the case was formally dismissed with prejudice on April 2. Despite the controversy, Adams has used the clearing of his name as a springboard to reassert his policy platform, which he says is centered on economic inclusion, technological equity, and digital transformation. Crypto Summit Marks Turning Point The New York City Crypto Summit, where Adams made his announcement, marks the city‚Äôs most formal step toward integrating the crypto industry into its public and economic systems. The summit included representatives from fintech startups, blockchain developers, venture capital firms, and policymakers, signaling a concerted effort to position the city competitively against other global crypto hubs like Dubai, Singapore, and London. With new collaborations, a policy council in motion, and continued legislative efforts at the state level, New York City is setting the stage to reclaim its tech dominance. The crypto industry, long skeptical of New York‚Äôs historically strict regulations, may find renewed optimism in Adams‚Äô approach, which blends regulatory realism with a pro-innovation stance. The next steps include finalizing the Digital Advisory Council‚Äôs structure and releasing policy recommendations‚Äîexpected before the end of Q2 2025. In parallel, pilot programs for blockchain-based document security and crypto tax payment systems are reportedly under internal review. Whether these plans will translate into meaningful infrastructure, and actual adoption, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: New York is back in the conversation, and this time, it‚Äôs speaking the language of tokenization. New SEC Chair Paul Atkins Pledges Crypto Reform as GENIUS Act Gains Momentum In related news, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins appeared before lawmakers on May 20 in a highly anticipated congressional oversight hearing, making his position clear: the future of digital asset regulation will be one of his top priorities. Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee, Atkins addressed a slew of questions ranging from regulatory funding transparency to interagency collaboration. While measured in tone, his remarks confirmed that the SEC is preparing to pivot away from the enforcement-heavy stance of past leadership and toward a more structured, collaborative framework for regulating cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Paul Atkins at a May 20 SEC oversight hearing (Source: House Appropriations Committee ) A New Tone at the Top Atkins‚Äô appointment in April, under the nomination of President Donald Trump, was widely seen as a turning point for US digital asset regulation. A former SEC commissioner himself, Atkins brings both institutional credibility and industry-friendly leanings to the role. His early actions have signaled an effort to realign the SEC‚Äôs approach to crypto with market realities and innovation imperatives. This hearing marked his first major public appearance since assuming the role and came just a day after the US Senate moved forward on a vote to consider the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act)‚Äîa landmark piece of legislation that could redefine stablecoin oversight. Lawmakers pressed Atkins on the status of the SEC‚Äôs Crypto Task Force, helmed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, and sought specifics on its budget, timeline, and objectives. Representative Chuck Edwards (R-NC) asked directly how much funding had been allocated to the task force, a question Atkins declined to answer directly, saying only that the findings were ‚Äústill under development.‚Äù Though vague on numbers, Atkins confirmed the task force‚Äôs first formal report is expected within the coming months. This report, he hinted, will lay the groundwork for clearer guidance on token classification, disclosures, custody frameworks, and potentially even DeFi-specific protocols. Upcoming June Roundtable Signals DeFi Focus The SEC is also organizing a series of roundtable discussions with commissioners and private sector leaders, the next of which is scheduled for June 9 and will focus specifically on decentralized finance (DeFi). These forums are expected to influence the Commission‚Äôs internal rulemaking discussions and could set the stage for tailored regulation that distinguishes DeFi from centralized crypto platforms. Sources close to the SEC suggest that these roundtables are part of a broader strategy to rehabilitate the agency‚Äôs relationship with the digital asset sector, which has long criticized the SEC for pursuing regulation through enforcement rather than engagement. Atkins' remarks coincided with major movement in the US Senate on the GENIUS Act, which aims to create a national framework for stablecoin issuance, reserve audits, and regulatory jurisdiction. Under the act, stablecoin oversight would be clarified and shared between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), with the Federal Reserve overseeing reserve asset integrity. The bill is part of a wave of crypto-related legislation currently under discussion in Congress, including proposals for tax deferrals on digital asset transactions, definitions for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and digital identity protection using blockchain technology. Atkins signaled alignment with the GENIUS Act's objectives, suggesting the SEC would welcome legislative clarity that delineates its role in overseeing specific digital asset classes, particularly stablecoins and security tokens. From SEC Limbo to Regulatory Momentum Atkins‚Äô prior statements have been critical of the regulatory vacuum that the crypto market has found itself in under past administrations. Now, with increasing alignment between legislative efforts and SEC reform, the prospect of a more stable and transparent regulatory framework for US crypto markets is closer than ever. Industry groups including the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, and Crypto Council for Innovation have cautiously welcomed Atkins' leadership, noting his willingness to engage constructively with both innovators and lawmakers.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 11:30:00

Coins like XRP and Cardano have dazzled investors with massive rallies and impressive utility stories. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up chasing the echoes of these established titans. But history shows us that the truly life-changing gains, the elusive 1000x returns, rarely come from the well-known giants already in the spotlight. Instead, they hide in the shadows, in projects so new that only a few insiders have their eyes on them. If you want to build real wealth in crypto, the smart move is to look beyond yesterday‚Äôs winners. The real fortune often lies in pre-exchange tokens, those hidden gems in their infancy. This is where the savvy ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù is parking bets, scooping up tokens before the market catches on. And today, we‚Äôre pulling back the curtain on one such opportunity. XRP (XRP): Riding High on Waves of Adoption and Anticipation XRP remains one of the crypto market‚Äôs heavy hitters . As of May 17, 2025, XRP trades at $2.41 and holds a solid position as the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap . Its continued strength is backed by adoption in cross-border payments and a community eager for regulatory clarity. Market forecasts suggest XRP could nearly double, potentially reaching $5.00 within the next four weeks. This optimism stems from ongoing developments and a resurgence of interest in digital payment rails. While XRP‚Äôs rise is impressive, its story is well-known and widely priced in by now. Cardano (ADA): The Deliberate Ascent of a Research-Driven Powerhouse Cardano has carved a niche as a research-first blockchain platform focused on security, scalability, and sustainability. At $0.7719 and ranking 9th in market cap , Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem methodically. Analysts project a climb toward $0.9950 over the coming month, fueled by upcoming protocol upgrades and growing DeFi activity on its network. Cardano‚Äôs steady, science-backed approach makes it a dependable player, but this slow and steady pace means explosive gains are rarer. The ‚ÄúOff-Radar‚Äù Multiplier: Why Pre-Exchange Gems Hold Explosive Potential Here‚Äôs the crucial insight: once tokens hit major exchanges, the early explosive growth phases are usually behind them. The crowd has caught on, valuations rise, and the easy gains diminish. The real 1000x plays live in the shadows : projects still in presale or the earliest community stages, where risk is high but rewards are unmatched. These are the tokens still flying under the radar, awaiting discovery by sharp-eyed investors who know where to look. Unveiling the Enigma: Introducing OpenFundNet (OFNT)‚ÄîThe Community‚Äôs Best-Kept Secret Meet OpenFundNet (OFNT) , a pre-exchange token quietly building momentum as the next big player in decentralized crowdfunding. While few are talking about it yet, OFNT‚Äôs mission is clear: fix the trust, fee, and accessibility problems plaguing traditional crowdfunding by leveraging Web3 technology. Currently in presale or early stages, OFNT offers an unprecedented opportunity to get in before the public stampede. This stealth positioning means early supporters could reap outsized rewards as the platform and token gain visibility. The Anatomy of a Giant Slayer: What Gives OFNT its 1000x DNA? OFNT‚Äôs blueprint for massive growth rests on innovative features that solve real-world issues: Validator-Driven Trust: Unlike traditional platforms riddled with opaque vetting, OFNT uses a validator system to score and approve projects. This transparency builds genuine trust and quality control, attracting serious backers. Zero Platform Fees: OFNT‚Äôs zero-fe e model means creators receive more funding and backers‚Äô contributions go further. This no-extraction approach is a game-changer in an industry notorious for high fees. Dual Rewards & Emission Engine: The tokenomics reward both backers and validators daily with token emissions. This creates an engaged, sustainable ecosystem fueling continuous growth and participation. The Ground-Floor Window: OFNT‚Äôs Presale‚ÄîYour Entry Before the Public Stampede Here‚Äôs where it gets exciting. OFNT has allocated 10% of its total token supply specifically for the presale phase. This limited window is a rare ground-floor chance to secure tokens at favorable terms before they hit major exchanges. Participation is streamlined; early buyers can join using widely accepted cryptocurrencies like USDT. This accessibility ensures that the early community can grow quickly, setting the stage for explosive network effects. Beyond Price Pumps: OFNT‚Äôs Vision for a Self-Sustaining Crowdfunding Universe OFNT is more than just a speculative token. Its vision is to build a decentralized, community-governed crowdfunding platform that is self-sustaining and scalable. Governance tokens empower holders to vote on critical platform decisions, ensuring the project evolves with its community‚Äôs needs. Combined with deflationary mechanisms like scheduled emission halvings , OFNT‚Äô s design supports long-term token scarcity and value appreciation. This isn‚Äôt a flash in the pan; it‚Äôs a foundation for lasting impact. The Final Whisper: Position Yourself in OFNT Before the Market Shouts Its Name XRP and Cardano have proven their value, but the real game-changers for exponential gains are hidden pre-exchange tokens like OFNT. This opportunity offers early adopters a shot at massive returns by backing a project built on trust, innovation, and community power. If you‚Äôre ready to move beyond the obvious and claim your spot in the future of decentralized crowdfunding , now is the time to research OpenFundNet . Join their growing community channels and get in before the market wakes up to this sleeping giant. The whispers are growing louder; don‚Äôt miss your chance before the crowd rushes in.

Hopkinson Makes Shocking Revelation,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-founder-619-million/,"Cardano, and specifically its founder Charles Hoskinson, has come under fire recently after allegations of fraud surfaced online. The rumors quickly spread as the integrity of the blockchain and its founder were called into question. As a result, Hopkinson has delivered a response, with a shocking revelation on how he plans to interact with the public and the community going forward. Alleged $619 Million Going Missing On May 7, 2025, an X user who goes by the name Masato Alexander made a shocking claim: 318 million ADA worth $619 million had been illegally moved and the finger was being pointed at Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. Apparently, this had happened with the Allegra Hard Fork which took place back in 2021 as core functions of the blockchain were changed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top Alexander claimed that Hoskinson had deployed code during what was thought to be routine upgrade with an extra payload. Allegedly, this allowed Hoskinson to erase the original ICO UTxOs which held a total of 318 million ADA and moved the funds to Cardano reserves that were controlled by private keys tied to Hoskinson. The transaction was done through an MIR transaction, which stands for Move Instantaneous Reward transactions. Essentially, Alexander claims that this allowed funds to be moved from reserves and then used for treasury and staking rewards purposes. These claims quickly drew the attention of the Cardano community, with Hoskinson himself responding under the post to denounce the rumors. He initially explained that the ADA vouchers of the users whose ADA were allegedly moved had become unspendable after the hard fork. Thus, they had been moved into a ‚Äúcustodial account controlled by the TGE that then continued redemption for 3 more years to distribute the genesis funds to the original buyers.‚Äù Furthermore, Hoskinson threatened legal action if Alexander did not stop making these claims. Cardano Founder Addresses Rumors Again After the initial interaction, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has once again come out to address the rumors of the missing $619 million. He first addressed the fact that people were quick to condemn him after the rumors surfaced without giving him the benefit of the doubt. This extended to friends who he says did not show up for him during this time. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP Price Will Stabilize At $1,000 And Become ‚ÄòVery Expensive‚Äô As for the rumors themselves, the founder explained that there will be a full audit and a report which will be published for the public to see. He further went on to reveal that the events of the past few weeks will change how he engages with the community from now. While Hoskinson does plan to continue to attend events and take pictures with people, he plans to hand over his X account to a media company. Additionally, he plans to change the format of how he holds his X Spaces and Ask Me Anything (AMAs). ‚ÄúInfinite accessibility just enables it to happen again and again,‚Äù the founder explained.

At the center of this intensifying drama is the recent cancellation of a scheduled meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and a U.S. senator ‚Äîa move many in the crypto space view as a deliberate attempt to stifle Ripple‚Äôs growing influence. This incident, amplified by viral commentary from crypto analyst The Real Remi Relief on X, has been interpreted as a coordinated attempt by Bitcoin Maxis to block what‚Äôs coming for Ripple and XRP. As Ripple charts a new course with game-changing acquisitions and stablecoin initiatives, the tension between camps has reached a boiling point, revealing a high-stakes battle for control over the future of digital finance. Political Snub Fuels Tensions Between Ripple and Bitcoin Maxis According to reports from TimesTabloid , Brad Garlinghouse had been slated to meet with U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis to discuss Ripple‚Äôs regulatory roadmap and its role in the evolving crypto landscape. However, the meeting was canceled at the last minute, without any attempt to reschedule. The decision triggered outrage within the XRP community , with many interpreting the move as politically motivated. According to The Real Remi Relief, the incident was more than just a scheduling conflict‚Äîit was a coordinated effort by Bitcoin maximalists to suppress Ripple‚Äôs growing political capital. ‚ÄúThe BTC Maxis are trying to stop what‚Äôs coming for Ripple & XRP,‚Äù he posted on X, asserting that the senator‚Äôs actions were influenced by forces who feel threatened by Ripple‚Äôs accelerating momentum. The BTC Maxis are trying to stop what‚Äôs coming for Ripple & XRP‚Ä¶ This is what‚Äôs happening behind closed doors‚Ä¶ 1) Ripple is buying Circle USDC 2) USAGov will be using RLUSD & USDC 3) BTC maxis are trying to stall/stop the genius act because once that happens XRP will be‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Fn05PRNxAk ‚Äî The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 19, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs Attempted Acquisition of Circle Adding fuel to the fire, Ripple has been making aggressive moves behind the scenes to bolster its stablecoin position. Timestabloid recently reported that Ripple had made a multi-billion-dollar acquisition offer to Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Initial reports indicated an offer in the $4 billion to $5 billion range, which Circle rejected, deeming it far below its valuation, especially ahead of its anticipated IPO. Undeterred, Ripple reportedly increased its bid to a staggering $20 billion, highlighting the company‚Äôs ambition to not only lead in cross-border payments but also dominate the stablecoin market. This level of investment shows Ripple‚Äôs intent to become a central pillar in the future of global digital finance‚Äîan outcome that Bitcoin Maxis are reportedly desperate to stop. Potential Adoption of Stablecoins Even as negotiations with Circle continued, Ripple had already laid the groundwork for its stablecoin, RLUSD , which launched in December 2024. Backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash reserves, RLUSD is a fully-regulated, USD-pegged stablecoin designed for real-world utility and interoperability. The token operates natively on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, and it‚Äôs engineered for enterprise-grade liquidity, on-chain payments, and tokenization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple‚Äôs strategy is clear: establish a regulatory-compliant, technologically robust stablecoin that can rival USDC and pave the way for adoption by government and financial institutions. With talk of the U.S. government exploring RLUSD and USDC for official digital payment channels, Ripple appears to be positioning itself at the heart of a new digital financial order. A Threat to the Crypto Status Quo For Bitcoin maximalists, these moves represent more than just business competition‚Äîthey threaten the very foundations of their belief system. Maxis advocate for Bitcoin as the only legitimate digital asset, and they often deride other projects as centralized or inferior. Ripple, with its deep institutional ties and regulatory outreach, has long been a target of such criticism. But now, with real political traction and a potentially dominant position in stablecoins, Ripple poses an existential threat to Bitcoin‚Äôs supremacy. The canceled Senate meeting has thus become a flashpoint in this ideological war. To XRP supporters, it represents an act of obstruction by those threatened by Ripple‚Äôs progress. To others, it‚Äôs a sign that the corridors of power are not yet ready to embrace the transformative shift Ripple is advocating. Either way, the friction is undeniable. The Inevitable Shift: XRP‚Äôs Path to the Top Despite the resistance, momentum appears to be on Ripple‚Äôs side. With RLUSD live , major acquisition bids in play, and whispers of U.S. government alignment, XRP‚Äôs ascent seems not only possible but increasingly probable. As The Real Remi Relief put it, ‚ÄúNobody can stop what‚Äôs coming.‚Äù Whether Ripple ultimately overtakes Ethereum or even challenges Bitcoin remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the crypto landscape is evolving fast, and Ripple is at the helm of that transformation. If XRP does rise to the top, it will be because of strategic foresight, regulatory persistence, and its ability to build in the face of opposition, not despite the obstacles, but because of them.

The leading cryptocurrency just broke out of a strong bullish pattern, and traders are now eyeing the $116,000 mark as the next big target. With strong momentum building and multi-month charts showing no bearish signals, many believe a new all-time high could be right around the corner. But amid the excitement, some experts are sounding the alarm on what could come next. Could Bitcoin Crash to $2,000? While Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term outlook looks bullish, one analyst has warned of a massive correction once the rally peaks. Some even call it a ‚Äúmathematical certainty‚Äù that Bitcoin could tumble to as low as $2,000‚Äì$3,000 in the future. The long-term provisional target remains at $140,000. According to technical wave counts, Bitcoin could break its all-time high soon, fueling further gains. However, it‚Äôs crucial for traders to follow the correct wave structure, as many misinterpret ongoing movements. Post $140K, while some might expect an immediate peak, analysts suggest there‚Äôs still more room for growth before Bitcoin enters a major correction phase. Ultimately, though, Bitcoin is expected to undergo a supercycle correction back down to $3,000‚Äì$2,000 once the top is in ‚Äî a cycle seen repeatedly in its history. Macro Risks and Market Warnings Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. Dollar Index is weakening and could slide further, which often helps risk assets like Bitcoin. However, broader economic issues ‚Äî like the recent U.S. credit downgrade and rising bond yields ‚Äî might create new challenges for crypto markets. There‚Äôs also speculation that the Federal Reserve may step in with emergency liquidity measures if financial markets get shaky again, adding more volatility to Bitcoin‚Äôs path. Markets To Be Less Volatile This Time? Bitcoin still moves closely with risky assets like stocks, so it will take time before it truly moves on its own. This cycle, the leverage in Bitcoin is low compared to the 2021 peak, which could mean less wild price swings. Analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe says Bitcoin is heading to new all-time highs faster than expected. He sees $120K, $150K, and even $200K as imminent as more and more people are frustrated with the dollar‚Äôs ongoing devaluation.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 11:35:18
44902609,https://invezz.com/?p=2727233,1747827475,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,From neobanks to deobanks: the future of transparent and universal digital banking,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/21/from-neobanks-to-deobanks-the-future-of-transparent-and-universal-digital-banking/,"Five years ago, as the world retreated indoors during a global pandemic, neobanks emerged as digital alternatives to traditional banks. They offered easy-to-use apps and lower fees, impressing many with their modern interface and fast onboarding. Yet, they rely on the same legacy systems as traditional banks and still follow strict rules that exclude many and depend on outdated frameworks. These limitations leave more than 1.4 billion adults outside the banking system. Today, another transformation is taking place in the form of decentralized on-chain banks, or deobanks. A prime example of this model is WeFi . WeFi introduced the term ‚Äúdeobank‚Äù and has positioned itself to fill the gap left by neobanks. The goal is to show how digital finance can work for everyone. In practice, deobanks simplify compliance by gradually integrating AI-driven KYC and employ blockchain tech to offer non-custodial accounts that let users own their funds and spend them directly from their personal wallets. The global market for decentralized finance is projected to reach $351.75 billion by 2031 , and ‚Äòpayment and transactions‚Äô are set to be the second biggest consumer segment in this industry. Deobanks have significant scope to become a catalyst for this growth and transform fintech services at a global scale. A new decentralized model of digital finance Traditional banks and neobanks face the same challenges that keep them tied to old methods. They often rely on physical infrastructure and centralized control. In contrast, deobanks operate entirely on blockchain networks. This setup eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides real-time transparency. Every transaction is recorded on-chain, and users can track how their funds are managed. This feature builds trust and reduces the risk of unexpected account freezes. If any regulatory issues arise, only suspicious transactions are flagged, leaving funds under the full control of the user. Deobanks also take a strong stand on environmental concerns. Neobanks tend to rely on physical cards, which contribute to a significant amount of plastic waste. Research shows that payment cards alone use over 130,000 tons of plastic . This waste takes centuries to decompose and leaves a lasting impact on climate change. Deobanks like WeFi promote a truly digital-first future in which payments happen via mobile devices using QR codes, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. These modern methods support sustainability and match today‚Äôs consumer habits. Serving the unbanked Macroeconomic challenges of the past decades show how fragile the traditional banking system is. The 2008 crisis, which led to the collapse of many financial institutions, exposed the fragility of legacy banks. More recently, Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs sudden downfall left many customers unable to access their funds. This is even more prominent in developing and underdeveloped regions. In regions like South America and Africa, rapidly increasing inflation has caused many traditional banks to limit financial services to the wider population. Strict regulations and outdated processes leave these banks ill-equipped to meet modern demands. Neobanks have trimmed fees and sped up services, yet they still rely on custodial accounts that deny users true control of their money. Deobanks are built to serve the unbanked and underbanked. They are designed for people who fail to meet strict account opening criteria or who have lost trust in conventional banks. The decentralized nature of deobanks means that there is no central authority to dictate how funds are managed. Instead, users maintain control and benefit from a transparent system. This model directly addresses the needs of millions who remain on the outskirts of the financial system. Most importantly, Deobanks leverage a non-custodial approach that truly establishes universal accessibility. For instance, WeFi allows users to transact using stablecoins and access services via a Telegram bot. This way, users can conduct near-instant transactions at a fractional cost, regardless of their location or demographics. Deobanks are the next chapter of global financial evolution After the concerning failures of traditional banks, the lack of impact from neobanks, and the increasing growth of blockchain integration, the need for on-chain banking in global finance is growing. Deobanks offer a practical, scalable solution that meets the demands of a modern, interconnected world. Looking ahead, investors and users should prepare for a significant shift in global finance. Deobanks have the power to disrupt established players and create new opportunities in cross-border transactions, wealth management, and everyday payments. Developers also have much to gain. The decentralized on-chain banking framework offers a creative, unrestricted ground for developing innovative financial applications. On-chain data and smart contract integration open new avenues for automated yield strategies, lending protocols, and specialized payment systems. The transparent nature of Deobanks will encourage further innovation and drive efficiency in the digital finance space. This new model is expected to accelerate financial inclusion, especially in emerging markets where traditional banking fails to meet demand.

As a result, the crypto market cap registered an increase of nearly 1% and moved to $3.37 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from its sluggish start to the week, recouping its losses on Tuesday and crossing $107,000 during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $107,301. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) registered a marginal increase to maintain its position above $2,500. The world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency is on the verge of reclaiming $2,600. Despite the positive market sentiment, Ripple (XRP) has registered a marginal decline, while Solana (SOL) is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $171. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered notable increases. Dow Drops As Wall Street Momentum Stalls The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27%, and the S&P 500 dropped 0.39%, ending a six-day upward trend. The Nasdaq Composite also dropped 0.38% as mega caps and chipmakers retreated, with Nvidia, AMD, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft registering notable losses. The pullback comes after a five-week rebound that saw the S&P 500 rise over 20% from its April low. The rebound was driven by optimism around tariff de-escalation and reduced US-China trade tensions. Bill Northey, US Bank Wealth Management, stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had the swoon related to tariffs, the furious rally, and now we‚Äôre awaiting clarification. It‚Äôs optimism without clarity.‚Äù Bond markets have added to the recent uncertainty, with the 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.48%, while the 30-year Treasury yield crossed 5% for the second day running. The jump comes after Moody‚Äôs decision to downgrade US Debt, citing rising deficits and interest expenses. Bancor Sues Uniswap For Patent Infringement Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin, the entities behind the Bancor Protocol and the BNT token, have filed a lawsuit against Uniswap. The platforms filed the lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The entities have accused Uniswap of infringing patents around smart contracts used in decentralized trading. Bancor alleged that Uniswap used its patented technology that underpins the constant product automated market maker (CPAMM), the core mechanism powering the Uniswap protocol. Bancor stated in a press release, ‚ÄúWhen an organization continuously uses our invention without our authorization and does so as a means of competing with us, we must take action.‚Äù Bancor has claimed Uniswap used its technology for over eight years without permission. Bancor patented its decentralized trading technology in 2017. The same technology was used to power its AMM-powered DEX protocol. The Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin claim they own all rights to their invention. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) came within touching distance of its all-time high before declining to its current levels as the flagship cryptocurrency finally broke past key resistance levels around $105,000 and $106,000. BTC started the week in the red, dropping to a low of $102,145 before settling at $105,573. Despite selling pressure, BTC rose over 1% on Tuesday before climbing to an intraday high of $108,010 during the ongoing session. The increase brought BTC within 1% of its all-time high after it broke out of a two-week-long consolidation phase, which saw the price hover between $100,000 and $105,000. BTC‚Äôs jump above $105,000 has been fueled by several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Investors have lost confidence in traditional financial systems, while cooling trade war tensions and tariff concerns have fueled a risk-on sentiment, pushing investors towards risk assets. Persistent inflation has eroded purchasing power, while the Federal Reserve‚Äôs cautious stance has kept real yields on the higher side. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also registered steady inflows, indicating a resurgence in institutional interest. Analysts believe BTC bulls are eying the $110,000 level after forming a strong base around $106,000 thanks to solid buyer interest at lower levels. If BTC maintains its position above $105,000-$106,000, the price could surge to a new all-time high. Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at YouHodler, stated, ‚ÄúWhile the risk of a downside correction cannot be ruled out, particularly if negative sentiment returns to the equity markets, the likelihood of such a scenario remains relatively low in the short to medium term.‚Äù Let‚Äôs look at BTC‚Äôs price action over the past few sessions. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.72% to $104,617, but lost momentum on Sunday and settled at $103,802. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,123. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 0.53% and settling at $103,568. Source: TradingView BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday but rebounded to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action remained bearish on Thursday and Friday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. The price recovered on Sunday as markets rebounded, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. BTC started the week on a bearish note, plunging to a low of $102,145 before rebounding to settle at $105,573, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as the price rose 1.21% to $106,855. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If buyers regain control, BTC could cross $109,000 and set a new all-time high. On the other hand, sellers will look to drive the price below $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) bounced back to reclaim $2,500 and briefly crossed $2,600 despite experiencing considerable volatility at the start of the week. The world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency faced significant selling pressure at the beginning of the week as it fell to a low of $2,349 on Monday before recovering to reclaim $2,500. Despite recent volatility, SOL has registered a hugely positive month, with its price up over 50%. SOL has held on to its recent gains and maintained its position above the $2,500 level. Market watchers are also bullish on Ethereum. Arthur Hayes believes that a move to $10,000 or even $15,000 is a realistic prediction for ETH as global liquidity shifts and capital controls take hold. Hayes dismissed technical triggers behind ETH‚Äôs rally and highlighted positive sentiment around the asset, stating, ‚ÄúThe most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle. It‚Äôs just human nature.‚Äù Hayes believes an ETH comeback was long overdue it spent years overshadowed by SOL and other Layer2 tokens. ‚ÄúETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running‚Ä¶ it was time.‚Äù ETH ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 3% and settling at $2,514. It faced volatility on Monday, rising to an intraday high of $2,623 and falling to an intraday low of $2,408 before settling at $2,496, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) registered a noticeable uptick on Tuesday, rising to an intraday high of $173 before settling at $168. The Ethereum-killer is looking to hold on to recent gains and build momentum to reclaim the $170 level. The price flashed a bearish flip after breaking below $170 on Monday when it fell to a low of $159 before reclaiming $160. Despite the selling pressure, the price has remained above $165. SOL remains confined within the $160-$180 range as bulls look to build momentum and push the price higher. SOL ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 3% to $173. It encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $174.

The legislative council on Wednesday passed the bill on its third reading, which directs the token issuers to get licensing from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Stablecoin is a digital asset that is pegged to conventional currencies like the dollar or to commodities such as gold. What the bill entails An issuer of a stablecoin that pegs its value to Hong Kong dollars inside or outside Hong Kong will need to obtain a license from the HKMA. The relevant persons issuing the stablecoins need to satisfy requirements in ‚Äúreserve asset management and redemption, including proper segregation of client assets, maintaining a robust stabilisation mechanism, and processing stablecoin holders‚Äô requests for redemption at par value with reasonable conditions‚Äù, the government said in its release. The issuers also need to make sure they comply with standards for anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, risk management, disclosure and auditing, fitness, and property. The government said the ordinance is expected to come into effect this year. This is to provide sufficient time for the industry to understand the requirements needed under the licensing regime. HKMA added that there will be additional consultations on the detailed regulatory framework. The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Eddie Yue, said, ‚ÄúThe Ordinance has established a risk-based, pragmatic, and flexible regulatory regime. We believe that a robust and fit-for-purpose regulatory environment would provide favourable conditions to support the healthy, responsible, and sustainable development of Hong Kong‚Äôs stablecoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem.‚Äù The latest addition to Hong Kong‚Äôs crypto regulations Hong Kong had enacted a crypto licensing regime in 2023 to protect retail investors. Hong Kong was the first Asian country to accept crypto products as a mainstream investment asset. It had also started Asia‚Äôs first spot crypto exchange-traded funds in 2024. The country had also launched a sandbox in 2024 to allow stablecoin trials in a limited and risk-controlled environment. US‚Äôs GENIUS Act The US Government is also planning a bill that is designed to regulate stablecoins. The bill is dubbed the GENIUS Act. The US Senate advanced the bill earlier this week on a bipartisan vote. The bill was advanced with a 66-32 vote on Monday. The bill would require stablecoins to be backed fully by US dollars or highly liquid assets. It also mandates annual audits with issuers with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion. The bill was voted on by the Senate after a couple of amendments were forced by the Democrats. This includes changes to consumer protection safeguards and limits on tech companies issuing stablecoins. It also includes ethical standards for special government employee,s which would apply to Elon Musk and David Sacks.

The VanEck Purposebuilt Fund will launch on 10 June. According to the press release, the fund will utilize Avalanche-native real-world asset ( RWA ) products ‚Äì including tokenized money market funds ‚Äì to deploy the capital. The novel fund will provide the capital and support for liquid tokens, venture-backed projects, and scalable businesses that are building on the world‚Äôs 18 th -largest chain and launching tokens with long-term utility and value in mind. The projects will hail from across industries, including finance, payments, gaming , and AI . They‚Äôll receive the investment either close to or after a Token Generation Event. Therefore, the company says that ‚Äúthe Purposebuilt Fund reflects VanEck‚Äôs conviction in the ‚ÄòGDP onchain‚Äô thesis.‚Äù This means that blockchain ‚Äúwill eventually be core to global economic and financial systems and that the projects that align with this vision will be the most durable.‚Äù Excited to announce this!

Moreover, VanEck has noted ‚Äúa growing concentration of serious builders‚Äù using the Avalanche network for real-world applications, generating economic activity onchain. These teams build in payments, FinTech, DeFi, RWAs, AI, and gaming. They‚Äôre also providing enterprise-grade products already adopted by Web2 platforms and traditional institutions. Meanwhile, the VanEck Purposebuilt Fund seeks capital appreciation through investments in digital assets with market capitalizations above $100 million. It may invest in RWAs, digital asset projects, and Avalanche ecosystem-related companies. It may also employ staking, yield-farming, and investments across centralized and decentralized platforms, the announcement says.

The team says that DAAF is ‚Äúone of the strongest-performing directional liquid token funds in the market.‚Äù It has over $100 million in assets under management. The team argues that one of the issues the crypto market faces is the difficulty for legitimate blockchain-powered businesses to ‚Äústand out in an environment dominated by short-term speculation. This distorts incentives, undermines token credibility, and slows real adoption.‚Äù The new fund aims to solve this, VanEck claims.

It is up 2.8% in a day and 10% in a month. The price has decreased by 12% in a week and 44% in a year. The coin hit its all-time high of $144.96 in November 2021, falling 84% since. Meanwhile, the company notes that the VanEck Purposebuilt Fund and the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund are not registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds or ETFs. The announcement states that, as of 30 April 2025, VanEck managed $116.6 billion in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts. In March and April this year, it filed for Avalanche and BNB ETFs, respectively.

The highest gainer in this category is Stacks (STX) , having increased by 7.1% to $0.9106. Story (IP) fell the most among the red coins. It‚Äôs down 3.7% to $4.49 Overall, the crypto market rally continues to be fueled by the increase in institutional adoption, surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows, regulatory shifts, and ongoing macroeconomic relief following the easing of trade tensions. In turn, this has fueled risk-on sentiment. Furthermore, the regulation is currently favorable for crypto. All eyes are at the moment primarily on the US. The country‚Äôs Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act , which would regulate stablecoins at the federal level. The Senate advanced the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 bipartisan vote on Monday, marking a big step toward establishing federal regulation for stablecoins and digital currency oversight. #GENIUSAct #Stablecoins https://t.co/JmoPuWjKdf ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins faced questions from lawmakers on 20 May. They focused on the regulator‚Äôs handling of the fraud case involving Tron founder Justin Sun and a Donald Trump-linked meme coin. It remains to be seen if this will have a more pronounced impact on the market. Chairman Paul Atkins will testify before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government today at 10 a.m. ET. A livestream will be available: https://t.co/QDPSVDHlCR ‚Äî U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 20, 2025 ‚ÄòSetting the Stage for New ATH‚Äô According to the latest Glassnode report, BTC has hit a local high of $107,000, moving close to its all-time high of $109,000. This has led to a significant increase in capital inflows. It has pushed the Realized Cap above $900 billion, ‚Äúfor the first time, a historic milestone.‚Äù Only four trading days in history have recorded a higher daily closing price. The last weekly close of $106,500 was the highest ever. The coin is trading some 40% higher over the last six weeks, ‚Äúhighlighting how strong the market recovery has been,‚Äù the analysts say. Source: Glassnode Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler , has commented that BTC may have entered a consolidation phase, marked by accumulation. The current price action could be ‚Äúsetting the stage for another leg higher that could lead to a new all-time high.‚Äù He commented that the $90,000‚Äì$110,000 range is a key consolidation zone, as BTC has spent significant time within this range since November. ‚ÄúThis suggests a high concentration of trading activity and order volume, which could reinforce the area as a strong support level. If this dynamic continues, Bitcoin will likely remain anchored in this range, even following the renewal of all-time highs, as it serves as a psychologically and technically important price corridor.‚Äù Lienkha noted the existing risk of a downside correction but added that the chances are ‚Äúrelatively low in the short to medium term.‚Äù While it‚Äôs too early to declare the beginning of a full-scale altseason, the executive says, Ethereum has seen notable outperformance. This is the result of internal factors, including the Pectra upgrade and the expansion of stablecoins on the network, supported by a favorable macroeconomic environment. Levels & Events to Watch Next After two days of unsuccessful attempts, BTC finally managed to break through the $106,000 level, rising above $106,500. More importantly, at the time of writing, it is holding that level. This shows how today‚Äôs brief high can become tomorrow‚Äôs price in the market‚Äôs push-and-pullback game. The coin couldn‚Äôt sustain the day‚Äôs high of $107,800. However, if it manages to surpass $107,000 and stay there, the next level to keep an eye on will be $108,786, after which it will likely be testing fresh all-time highs. Per Glassnode, the $2,400‚Äì$2,900 range is a crucial zone for Ethereum. This is both a resistance zone and a potential breakout level, ‚Äúessential for maintaining upward momentum.‚Äù Source: Glassnode Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has recorded a slight increase since this time yesterday, from 68 to 69, going deeper into the greed territory. As previously noted, this signals investor optimism, confidence, and willingness to take risks as a result of higher prices and trading volumes. That said, it can also lead to overconfidence and overvaluation, which typically precede a correction. Notably, the market continues to be fueled by significant investor interest and exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows. On May 20, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $329.02 million . This is its fifth consecutive day of inflows. The cumulative total net inflow reached $42.77 billion. Also, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $64.89m in net inflows, for a third day of positive flows, resulting in the cumulative inflow of $2.59 billion. Additionally, major alternative asset manager Blackstone invested in BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) , thus entering the crypto space via an ETF. According to the 20 May filing, as of 31 March, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares, 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) , and 4,300 shares of the ATM operator Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) . According to a recent portfolio filing, Blackstone‚Äôs Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund disclosed holding 23,094 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of March 31. This marks the first time Blackstone has publicly reported a bitcoin-related position. https://t.co/EVhkd04vnw ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 20, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? While crypto has maintained its bull run, stocks went the other way under pressure from rising Treasury yields, ending six consecutive sessions of gains. The S&P 500 is down 0.39%, the Nasdaq-100 fell 0.37%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a decrease of 0.27%. With the rising concerns over inflation and interest rate hikes, investors seek refuge elsewhere. The stocks are pushed down by Trump‚Äôs efforts to pass a tax-cut bill that could add $3 trillion-$5 trillion to the government‚Äôs debt of $36.2 trillion. Is this rally sustainable? The rally seems strong. It is encouraged by strong fundamentals, primarily institutional demand, significant regulatory developments, and macroeconomic tailwinds. That said, there may be a potential regulatory shift ahead, as well as growing greed that could signal short-term corrections. Alternatively, the market could be seeing a consolidation period.

Now, there's buzz about a new player named XYZVerse. Some predict it could create billionaires in the next meme coin boom expected in 2025. What is driving this excitement around XYZVerse, and could it really outshine Dogecoin's legacy? Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse‚Äôs potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project‚Äôs estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings ‚Äì If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth ‚Äì Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions ‚Äì If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Dogecoin: How a Shiba Inu Meme Became a $50 Billion Crypto Phenomenon Dogecoin began in 2013 as a light-hearted cryptocurrency. With a Shiba Inu meme as its logo, it was a fun alternative to serious coins like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum limit and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. What started as a joke quickly gained followers. In 2021, its value soared, reaching a market cap over $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, and a booming crypto market. What makes Dogecoin special today? Its technology is simple. It's based on code similar to Bitcoin's, but transactions are faster and fees are lower. A strong community is one of its biggest assets. People enjoy its fun and friendly vibe. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as attractive due to its growth potential and active supporters. Others caution that its value depends heavily on hype and social media trends. Compared to coins like Ethereum with advanced technology and real-world uses, Dogecoin is seen by some as risky. Whether it will keep rising or fade away is uncertain, but its journey shows how digital coins can evolve. Conclusion While DOGE, PEPE, and MOG have soared, XYZVerse‚Äîthe first all-sport memecoin‚Äîaims for 20,000% growth, potentially redefining success in the 2025 meme supercycle.

One trader thinks that SHIB‚Äôs weekly price action for the past four years or so anticipates an explosive move that could push it to uncharted territory. $SHIB remains one of the most unreal charts I have ever seen. No signs of a breakout, but when this breaks out, you'll want a piece of it. pic.twitter.com/keyjpoxnp9 ‚Äî Joey Keasberry (@birdseye88) May 18, 2025 Crypto trader Joey Keasberry emphasized that Shiba Inu‚Äôs price chart shows ‚Äúunreal‚Äù characteristics as it has been consolidating for nearly four years. Although there are ‚Äúno signs of a breakout yet,‚Äù he emphasized that a bullish breakout could result in the kind of move that traders should not miss. Based on Joey‚Äôs chart, it would take a move above the $0.000050 to confirm a bullish breakout of this consolidation. Hence, this is a key level to watch to draft a Shiba Inu price prediction . Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Ecosystem Growth Supports a Favorable Outlook for the Token Shiba Inu is one of the best meme coins out there in terms of community strength. Its social media accounts are followed by millions and the project has attracted a significant number of developers who have created an entire ecosystem by using its layer-one blockchain. Thus far, they have launched a decentralized exchange called Shibaswap , non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain-based games, and even a layer-two called Shibarium. Ecosystem growth has not been an issue for Shiba Inu. Yet, crypto investors have recently been more attracted to exotic new tokens like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Brett (BRETT). Shiba Inu will likely emerge as a late winner in this latest bullish cycle alongside other well-established tokens with robust communities like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki (FLOKI). The daily chart shows that the price broke above a key resistance at $0.00001530 in the past few days but quickly retreated back into the ascending triangle as the selling pressure was strong after it crossed the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). There are multiple key supports to watch including the 21-day and 50-day EMA, the triangle‚Äôs lower trend line, and the uptrend‚Äôs second-best higher high at $0.00001420. With so many support levels standing in the way of SHIB, the token‚Äôs outlook remains favorable despite this failed break. As meme coins‚Äô outlook continues to improve, the hottest crypto presales in the market like SUBBD (SUBBD) will attract further attention from investors. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises Nearly $500,000 to Launch its Decentralized Content Distribution Platform Content creators have struggled for years with unfair bans and unfavorable payment structures that have taken a significant chunk of their earnings. SUBBD (SUBBD) brings a tectonic shift to the industry by introducing a decentralized content distribution platform that offers a fairer arrangement and a less restrictive environment for influencers. With the help of blockchain technology, the platform enables the creation of AI-generated content that can generate passive income for content creators as well and, through the $SUBBD token, it gives influencers a say in the ecosystem‚Äôs roadmap and growth. SUBBD has already been embraced by more than 2,000 creators with a combined following of over 250 million fans. This will propel the demand for the $SUBBD token and will result in high returns for early buyers. To buy $SUBBD at its discounted presale price of $0.05545, head to the SUBBD website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

According to CNBC, investors pushed yields higher across the board after a credit rating downgrade from Moody‚Äôs rattled confidence and added pressure to an already fragile bond market. The 30-year Treasury yield climbed almost 6 basis points, reaching 5.023%. The 10-year yield was up more than 5 basis points at 4.533%. Even the 2-year moved, ticking nearly 3 basis points higher to 3.996%. Traders weren‚Äôt just reacting to numbers‚Äîthey were responding to the total lack of progress in D.C. and the possibility that this new bill, if passed, could blow up the country‚Äôs finances. One basis point equals 0.01%, and rising yields mean falling bond prices. Moody‚Äôs downgrade rattles bonds while Trump‚Äôs tax bill stalls Last Friday, Moody‚Äôs cut the US credit rating to the second-highest tier, matching what other rating agencies already had. But it wasn‚Äôt just the downgrade that caused the sell-off. It was the reasoning behind it. Moody‚Äôs pointed directly at the expanding federal deficit and the rising cost of servicing government debt. The impact was immediate. The 30-year Treasury shot above 5% on Monday, the second major spike in just a month. Now, all eyes are on Trump‚Äôs latest tax plan. Many Republicans are refusing to back it unless it includes bigger deductions for state and local taxes. The disagreement has stalled progress and raised fresh questions about whether the bill can actually pass. If it does, investors fear the cost will push the deficit even higher. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note, ‚ÄúWhen it comes to the near term, all eyes are now on the tax bill that the Trump administration is seeking to pass through Congress, as the final agreement will go a long way to determining how big the US deficit becomes in the years ahead.‚Äù Adding to the drama, Ray Dalio, billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, warned Monday that Moody‚Äôs downgrade may underplay the real threat. In a post on X, Dalio wrote: ‚ÄúYou should know that credit ratings understate credit risks because they only rate the risk of the government not paying its debt.‚Äù Ray went on to say: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt include the greater risk that the countries in debt will print money to pay their debts thus causing holders of the bonds to suffer losses from the decreased value of the money they‚Äôre getting.‚Äù Stock futures drop as yields test key levels again Markets didn‚Äôt take the news well. Dow Jones futures dropped 337 points, or 0.8%, while futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 each slid by 0.6%. Traders clearly weren‚Äôt thrilled by another jump in Treasury yields, especially after such a shaky few days. By Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield was trading well above 4.53%, and the 30-year moved firmly past the 5% line again. Those levels had already been broken earlier in the week, right after Moody‚Äôs announced its downgrade late Friday. Even with all this, Republican lawmakers in Washington are still trying to finalize the bill. The plan is supposed to lower taxes, but the internal bickering over deductions continues to slow everything down. Traders are worried that if the measure passes without cuts elsewhere, it will deepen the deficit‚Äîexactly what bond markets don‚Äôt want to hear. The drop in stock futures came after an ugly trading session on Tuesday. The S&P 500 ended a six-day winning streak. The Nasdaq Composite fell for the first time in three days. The Dow lost over 100 points, cutting short its own three-day rise. Despite the pullback, all three major indexes remain above their April 2 levels‚Äîwhen Trump imposed his new import tax policy. That rollout had triggered the rally, lifting the S&P 500 to positive territory for the year. Before that, the index had dipped into bear market territory, falling nearly 20% from its highs. That bounce, however, doesn‚Äôt seem as secure as it did just days ago. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Despite improved operating cash flow, the Company's balance sheet remains structurally fragile, with a shareholders' deficit of approximately $4.6 million due to liabilities exceeding assets. Operational focus is shifting from rapid fleet expansion to maximizing unit economics by optimizing the existing BTM network, with second-year kiosks reportedly generating around 50% more revenue. Valuation remains highly attractive relative to peers, with forward P/S around 0.1x, EV/EBITDA around 2.7x, and forward P/E of about 5x. Bitcoin Depot (BTM), the world's largest operator of Bitcoin ATMs also called Bitcoin Teller Machines or BTMs, has been showing sustainable operational improvements and financial stability. Bitcoin Depot's business model is pretty straightforward, it is basically like an on-ramp and off-ramp physical infrastructure for cash-to-Bitcoin and Bitcoin-to-cash conversions. The company also runs a mobile application, BDCheckout, which enables users to load cash for purchasing at participating retail stores. Bitcoin Depot Q1 results were announced last week, and they were a continuation of the improvements seen in previous quarters. I think the reshuffling of the executive bench earlier this year - a new CFO and a new Chief Legal Officer (bringing experience in legal and compliance strategy to support the company's expansion efforts) - and a stronger push into international markets beyond the U.S. are beginning to yield operational results. Q1 top line came in at $164.2 million, up 19% YoY. The margin also expanded, with adjusted gross margin climbing by 7.7 percentage points to 20.2% from 12.5% in Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA more than tripled to $20.3 million, while the company swung to a net income of $12.2 million from a $4.2 million net, the same period last year. Operational cash flow also flipped meaningfully positive at $16.3 million, compared to just $1.3 million last year. This performance couldn't have been announced at a better time than during a market wide recovery and Bitcoin's rally month - in the crypto community they say ""Bitcoin loves May"" because May has been a historically good month for Bitcoin and crypto. Bitcoin is up 24% on the monthly and BTM is up 112%. Most of the gains BTM has printed (over 70% in a week) have been since earnings were released last week (over 30% upside since earnings). Data by YCharts BTM exhibits some sympathy play with Bitcoin's price movement, meaning when Bitcoin is up, BTM also typically records gains and vice versa. Though, BTM's correlation coefficient with Bitcoin is way more modest compared to that of Bitcoin mining stocks like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) or Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), or that of highly leveraged Bitcoin plays like Strategy ( MSTR ). Bitcoin Depot's transaction volume has historically been and remains decoupled from Bitcoin prices. This could explain why while most Bitcoin miners that have reported Q1 earnings this month faced compressed margins and increased operational cost, Bitcoin Depot's Q1 was surprisingly strong and margin-accretive despite the tariff volatility that rocked the market in Q1. Bitcoin Depot I, however, think this uncorrelation in the financials with Bitcoin price will likely change in the long term if Bitcoin Depot's BTC treasury increases to a material figure, as unrealized gains or losses will be recorded directly on the income statement based on the newly adopted FASB fair value rule. Thus, BTC price will begin to impact headline earnings, even if the core BTM business remains operationally distinct. As of Q1 end, Bitcoin Depot held 94.4 BTC in treasury, amounting to ~$10 million as of today's BTC spot price, of which 83 BTC were acquired in Q1. The company has said resources for BTC purchases for treasury will remain opportunistic. What is Driving Bitcoin Depot's Operational Momentum Bitcoin Depot is shifting focus toward optimizing its existing fleet of BTMs rather than rapidly expanding for expansion's sake. Bitcoin Depot deployed fewer new BTMs in Q1 2025 compared to some prior quarters. 250 new BTMs were deployed in Q1, and this is a sharp drop compared to 2024 where an ample amount of capital was allocated to BTM purchases. By Q2 last year, one of the key announcements was the deployment of 8,000 new BTMs. ...kiosks in year two versus year one, typically see at least 50% growth in terms of revenue versus year one. - CEO Brandon Mintz, during Q1 earnings call Q&A It seems less cash will be going out to buy new BTMs in the interim, as management emphasized that kiosks in their second year of deployment typically generate 50% more revenue than in their first year. And I think the reason for this could be anywhere from new Kiosks becoming indexed over time in Google Maps and third-party locator apps, which increases traffic organically, or it could be location-specific adoption or familiarization dynamics, where over time, more people notice the machine, try it, and then return as repeat users, thereby boosting transaction volume. So Bitcoin Depot's focus will be on maximizing unit economics and throughput of the current fleet (I see OpEx not going down much soon because heavy marketing might be needed to achieve this) rather than expanding the footprint aggressively. And this strategy is even more viable for the company now that operating cash flow has improved greatly to $16.3 million in Q1, and this gives the company potential more internal liquidity to reinvest selectively and strengthen the balance sheet. Data by YCharts Examining Bitcoin Depot's financials, I'd say the only concerns for investors will be the negative equity currently on the balance sheet . MRQ data shows $89.7 million in total assets (of which cash and cash equivalent make up around $35 million) and $94.3 million in total liabilities, resulting in a shareholders' deficit of ~$4.6 million. Q1 interest expense (Bitcoin Depot) Though Bitcoin Depot covered its Q1 interest expense and can comfortably meet its interest obligations from earnings, as EBIT in Q1 was $10.52 million and interest expense for the quarter was $3.07 million, putting the interest coverage ratio at 3.4x. I believe, the over 3x interest coverage ratio shouldn't be an outright comfort signal for investors, considering the negative equity which still reflects a structurally fragile balance sheet. An interest coverage ratio at 3.4x is still solid on its own, but it doesn't fully offset the broader balance sheet risks. How Do We Value BTM Bitcoin Depot currently enjoys way lower valuation multiples compared to other Bitcoin stocks because BTM has long been beaten down among Bitcoin stocks. Seems the market has underappreciated the infrastructural role of the company in the broader crypto economy compared to how the market rewards Bitcoin miners or Bitcoin leverage bets. Seeking Alpha But I'm not taking the low multiples at face value and would strongly consider the multiples from the angle of BTM's fully diluted share count of 124.7 million, which includes over 60 million potentially dilutive securities of public and private placement warrants, earn out shares, and RSUs. If exercised or vested, could nearly double the current outstanding share count of ~64 million. Outstanding share data (Bitcoin Depot) But irrespective of how you adjust the valuation, BTM's P/S ratio will be around 0.18x and forward P/S will be around 0.2x. EV/EBITDA will be around 4.5x, and forward P/E will be around 13x. BTM's multiples are still extremely attractive compared to virtually all other publicly traded Bitcoin companies. Data by YCharts Rating and Takeaway On BTM's current momentum, a Q1 pre-earnings review would have been a better time to recommend a Buy. The stock is already up over 30% since earnings, and I think the initial boost the earnings have given will likely stall a bit here, and upside could be limited in the near term. If BTM reports continued sales, margin, and operating cash flow strength in Q2 (they are guiding for sales growth of mid-single-digits in Q2) and deleveraging progress makes equity become positive on the balance sheet, this will restore more confidence in investors and make BTM ready for a more sustained upside. Considering the upside already seen on the weekly (since earnings), a Hold is the more prudent call here, as we watch how balance sheet repair and operating leverage unfold in Q2.",MARA|RIOT|MSTR|BTMWW|BTM,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-21 12:00:00

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whale-alert-in-dogecoin-millions-of-dollars-of-sale-what-does-it-mean-here-are-the-details/,"While Dogecoin (DOGE) has been consolidating just below the $0.26 level in recent days, the sales made by whales are drawing attention. Dogecoin Continues to Maintain Bullish Structure: Whales Sold $40 Million Worth of DOGE, Is a New Bounce Imminent? According to on-chain data, 170 million DOGE, or roughly $40 million worth of tokens, have changed hands in the past few days. This development may indicate that the market is preparing the ground for a possible upward breakout. Technical Outlook: A Healthy Correction? Dogecoin is still maintaining a strong bullish structure despite experiencing an 18% pullback since its local peak on May 11. The price action has formed a structure similar to a classic ‚Äúbull flag‚Äù formation following the rally that began in early April. Analysts predict that the current consolidation is a healthy correction and that DOGE could bounce to the $0.35 to $0.45 range in the next 7 days. These targets imply a potential gain of 52% to 114% from the current price level. Technical Analysis Highlights DOGE formed an upward channel, showing an uptrend between $0.222 and $0.228. The critical support level is positioned in the $0.218‚Äì$0.219 range. Selling pressure was observed in the $0.233‚Äì$0.234 area, which stands out as a key resistance area. The rapid pullback from the daily top suggests that short-term consolidation may continue, but the overall structure is still supported by higher lows. In recent hours, DOGE fell from $0.233 to $0.227, a 2.57% correction. There were several attempts to find support in the $0.227‚Äì$0.228 range, which suggests that traders are watching these levels closely. The Role of Whales Although large-scale selling by whales usually causes short-term volatility in the market, such movements can also be interpreted as a harbinger of the next rally. The fact that technical structures are giving positive signals and the general market sentiment remains strong supports the expectation of a potential bounce for Dogecoin. The next week could be critical for Dogecoin traders as whether the price can break the $0.26 resistance will determine the direction of the next major move. *This is not investment advice.

This surge can be largely attributed to the successful launch of the Pectra upgrade , which significantly boosted investor confidence. Coincidentally, this upgrade also coincided with a positive geopolitical development, which was on May 8th, the US and UK announced a trade deal , marking a historic first. The mere certainty of this agreement sent optimism wave to all altcoins and top coins. Even Arthur Hayes, in a recent interview , agrees that more than technical factors, the sentimental factors led the rise in ETH crypto. He believes that still ETH price presents a unique investment opportunity. Hayes even sets an ambitious target of $5,000 for Ethereum, suggesting that by the end of the year, a price of $10,000 could be within reach. Regardless of the challenges ahead, Ethereum appears poised to play a significantly important role in the crypto landscape of 2025. Its continuous developments and institutional preference could establish it as the leading platform among its competitors, marking a significant turning point for the entire crypto ecosystem. Keep reading to know more. Arthur Hayes Predicts Ethereum Price Run To $10,000 In a recent macro-focused interview on the Bankless podcast, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX and current CIO of Maelstrom, shared his optimistic Ethereum price Forecast. He suggested that if ETH price surpasses $5,000, it could have potential projection to $10,000 or even $15,000 by the end of the year. This ETH price prediction came during a final discussion in the interview when he asked where Hayes sees ETH price this year. In the video, when talked about the second top crypto next to BTC recent run in May, Hayes attributed the ETH price performance to market sentiment rather than any significant technical factors. He noted that the Ethereum price resurgence was long overdue, especially after being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens in recent years. However, he cautioned that Ethereum crypto‚Äôs journey may not be straightforward. While acknowledging ETH crypto‚Äôs underperformance compared to Bitcoin thus far, he strongly believes that the Ethereum price moment is approaching. This is especially due to regulatory clarity seems higher chance of improving or if decentralized finance (DeFi) regains momentum with sustainable cash flows. He highlighted projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that could finally validate their valuations based on fundamentals. As the interview wrapped up, the host inquired about Hayes‚Äô personal holdings. He revealed that his crypto portfolio consists of approximately 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum, along with a variety of other altcoins and tokens. On the non-crypto side, he mentioned holding physical gold, gold mining stocks, and T-bills.

On the daily price chart, the Ethereum price is currently fluctuating between key resistance and support levels, with mixed signals from technical indicators. After a notable bull run in May, momentum appears to be waning, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated from the overbought territory, now sitting at 68.70. At present, ETH price is priced at $2,528, accompanied by an intraday trading volume of $23.47 billion. The future movement of the Ethereum price hinges on its ability to break through the $2,800 resistance level.

In his latest tweet, he claims ‚ÄúThe End is Here‚Äù, pointing to a failed U.S. bond auction and warning of coming hyperinflation. But while the message may sound scary, he also shares hope, and for him, that hope is Bitcoin . FED Bond Auction ‚Äì No One Attended At the center of his warning is a bond auction that reportedly saw very little participation. Kiyosaki explained that the U.S. government recently held an auction to sell its bonds, but no one showed up to buy. Usually, investors or countries buy these bonds to help fund government operations. But this time, according to Kiyosaki, the U.S. Federal Reserve itself quietly stepped in to buy $50 billion worth of bonds, using money it simply created. THE END is HERE: WHAT if you threw a party and no one showed up? That is what happened yesterday. The Fed held an auction for US Bonds and no one showed up. So the Fed quietly bought $50 billion of its own fake money with fake money. The party is over. Hyperinflation is‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 21, 2025 He calls this ‚Äúfake money buying fake assets,‚Äù and says it‚Äôs a sign that the financial system is in big trouble. Hyperinflation Could Be Next He didn‚Äôt hold back from predicting what comes next. ‚ÄúHyperinflation is here,‚Äù he said. When governments keep printing money to cover their spending, it weakens the value of that money. Kiyosaki believes this will lead to hyperinflation, where prices go up very fast and people‚Äôs savings lose value quickly. He warns that ‚Äúmillions, young and old‚Äù could lose everything if they‚Äôre not prepared. The dollar, he says, is on the edge of collapse. Gold, Silver‚Ä¶ and Bitcoin to the Rescue? Despite the bad news, Kiyosaki still sees a way to protect your future. He predicts that as the dollar weakens, people will turn to hard assets, things with real value. He believes gold will reach $25,000, silver will hit $70, and Bitcoin could soar to between $500,000 and $1 million. That‚Äôs a huge jump, but in his view, it‚Äôs not just possible, it‚Äôs likely. Why Bitcoin Stands Out Kiyosaki has long supported Bitcoin. He believes it‚Äôs a safe way to protect your money because no government controls it, and there‚Äôs only a limited amount of it. Recently, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 this year. Right now, Bitcoin is close to its highest-ever price, trading around $106,651, with a total market value of $2.11 trillion.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 12:06:56

At the heart of XRP‚Äôs liquidity and market valuation are key trading platforms that handle the bulk of XRP-U.S. dollar transactions. Recent data shared by leading XRP-focused influencer SMQKE reveals a detailed snapshot of these platforms‚Äô performance as of September 30, 2024, based on cumulative trading volume and market share. This ranking highlights the top five XRP trading platforms, offering a deeper understanding of the market‚Äôs structural dynamics and the exchanges powering the XRP economy. XRP Trading Platforms Ranked by Volume 1. Coinbase 2. Crypto. com 3. Kraken 4. LMAX Digital 5. Bitstamp pic.twitter.com/2OxdVUhvyT ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 21, 2025 Coinbase: Dominating XRP Liquidity At the top of the list is Coinbase , the largest contributor to XRP-U.S. dollar trading volume among all the platforms surveyed. As of the end of Q3 2024, Coinbase recorded a staggering 1,390,594,237 XRP in trading volume, commanding a dominant 49.1% market share. This substantial figure underscores Coinbase‚Äôs unparalleled influence in shaping XRP price discovery and liquidity in the U.S. market. Coinbase‚Äôs status as a publicly traded company and its commitment to regulatory compliance have positioned it as a trustworthy and preferred platform for both retail and institutional investors. Its inclusion in the XRP index further reflects its reliability and significance in the broader crypto trading ecosystem. Despite regulatory headwinds in the past, especially relating to XRP‚Äôs legal standing in the United States, Coinbase has remained a key player in facilitating XRP trades, with its advanced trading tools, liquidity pools, and extensive user base ensuring consistent volume inflows. Crypto.com: Securing the Second Spot Following Coinbase is Crypto.com, which registered 708,146,379 XRP in trading volume, amounting to a 25.05% market share. Crypto.com‚Äôs aggressive global expansion strategy, user incentives, and crypto-friendly mobile platform have significantly boosted its XRP transaction volumes. Its innovative approach to retail user engagement, including cashback offers, staking rewards, and low-fee trading options, has made it a competitive venue for XRP traders globally. Crypto.com has also been proactive in listing XRP trading pairs and promoting liquidity through diverse fiat and crypto pairings. The platform‚Äôs ability to cater to a wide spectrum of users‚Äîfrom casual investors to high-frequency traders, has made it a formidable player in XRP market activity. Kraken: A Resilient Market Participant Ranked third, Kraken posted a total XRP trading volume of 268,454,941, capturing 9.5% of the market. Known for its deep liquidity, strong security protocols, and consistent regulatory alignment, Kraken remains a critical part of XRP‚Äôs trading infrastructure. Kraken‚Äôs emphasis on security and compliance, especially with U.S. and European regulatory standards, has earned it a loyal user base. The exchange has also been instrumental in supporting XRP during periods of legal uncertainty, continuing to list the asset and provide access to global markets when other platforms chose to delist or suspend XRP pairs. Kraken‚Äôs position in the index reflects its resilience and continued trust among XRP traders. LMAX Digital: Institutional Depth LMAX Digital claims the fourth position with a trading volume of 203,020,459 XRP and a 7.18% market share. As an institution-focused exchange, LMAX Digital‚Äôs inclusion in the top five highlights the growing interest of professional investors in XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike retail-heavy platforms, LMAX Digital is designed to serve hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, and asset managers seeking transparent, regulated execution environments. The platform offers low-latency trading, robust infrastructure, and deep liquidity, all of which appeal to institutional XRP investors who prioritize efficiency and scale. LMAX‚Äôs steady rise in XRP volume indicates the strengthening role of institutional capital in XRP markets. Bitstamp: Legacy Platform with Strong Foundations Rounding out the top five is Bitstamp , which facilitated 190,473,389 XRP in trades, equating to 6.74% of the market share. Bitstamp is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and has long maintained a reputation for regulatory compliance, stability, and user trust. Bitstamp‚Äôs continued presence among the leading XRP exchanges reflects its enduring appeal to conservative investors and institutions. The platform has consistently offered XRP trading pairs even during turbulent regulatory times, reinforcing its commitment to asset accessibility. Its partnership with Ripple in earlier years has also helped it remain closely aligned with XRP-related developments. Market Overview Altogether, these top five exchanges account for a combined XRP trading volume of 2,760,689,405 and control an overwhelming 97.66% share of the U.S. dollar-XRP trading market. The data, sourced from SMQKE‚Äôs public status and corroborated by market records, paints a clear picture of XRP‚Äôs trading ecosystem, where a few well-established platforms play an outsized role in determining price action, market sentiment, and liquidity availability. These rankings not only reflect current trading dynamics but also provide insights into the strategic positioning of exchanges within the evolving digital asset landscape. As XRP continues to regain momentum post-regulatory clarification and sees increasing use cases in cross-border payments, tokenization, and DeFi, the role of these trading platforms will become even more critical. Investors, analysts, and institutions would do well to monitor shifts in exchange rankings as they can often signal broader trends in the crypto market.

The DeFi Dapp XRP Investors Have Been Waiting For Despite XRP‚Äôs remarkable speed, low transaction fees, and efficiency, it has long lacked a truly decentralized lending and borrowing platform comparable to those available on Ethereum or Cardano. Centralized options have repeatedly disappointed investors with opaque practices, custody risks, and regulatory uncertainties. XpFinance solves these pain points by offering XRP users a fully decentralized, non-custodial solution, allowing seamless, secure lending and borrowing without intermediaries. By empowering users to maintain full control of their XRP assets, XpFinance provides investors the ideal platform to safely grow their XRP holdings while participating actively in the burgeoning DeFi economy. Why XRP Whales Are Flocking To XpFinance As XRP reaches its highest valuation in months, seasoned XRP whales are strategically moving their profits into XpFinance‚Äôs presale to leverage its remarkable early investment advantages, robust platform utility, and substantial growth potential: Presale participants benefit from a fixed presale rate of 1 XRP = 200 XPF. Following the presale, tokens will list on XP Market, XRPL‚Äôs prominent decentralized exchange, at 1 XRP = 140 XPF, instantly granting early investors a guaranteed 30% profit margin at the listing event. Unlike centralized alternatives, XpFinance ensures full decentralization, transparency, and asset custody directly within users‚Äô wallets, removing third-party risks entirely. XPF token holders earn sustainable staking rewards paid in XRP from platform transaction fees, creating an attractive source of ongoing passive income. Holding XPF tokens substantially reduces platform borrowing fees and provides holders the opportunity to actively participate in governance, shaping the protocol‚Äôs future direction. Limited Presale Allocation, Less Than 30 Days To Go XpFinance ‚Äôs total token supply is capped at just 200 million XPF, with 60 million (30%) specifically allocated to presale investors. Given the rapid uptake within hours, analysts predict the entire presale allocation could sell out rapidly, especially as XRP‚Äôs price momentum continues. Investors who delay might find themselves paying substantially higher prices on exchanges after listing. Secure your allocation now to avoid missing out. How To Join The XpFinance Presale Joining the presale and securing your XPF tokens is simple: Buy XRP: Acquire XRP from trusted exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Bybit). Transfer to XRP Wallet: Move your XRP to a non-custodial XRPL-compatible wallet such as Xaman, XUMM, or Ledger. Contribute to Presale: Visit the official presale portal at xp.finance/presale , copy the presale deposit address, and send your XRP. Set Up Trustline: Add the XPF trustline to your wallet to automatically receive your tokens upon completion of the presale. The XRP DeFi Boom Begins Here With over 20,000 XRP already locked into the presale within hours, excitement and FOMO among investors are growing quickly. XpFinance is uniquely positioned to become the centerpiece of XRPL‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem, potentially triggering a wave of decentralized finance adoption that could lift the XRP ecosystem to unprecedented heights.

The government has already rolled out aid for auto and chip firms after Washington announced 25% duties on Korean goods. Acting Finance Minister Kim Beom-seok said on Wednesday that the new package will ‚Äúprepare in advance for item-specific tariffs, such as pharmaceutical products and semiconductors, and strengthen support for ‚ÄòU-turn‚Äô investments.‚Äù Officials added that extra measures for biopharmaceutical businesses will follow once the United States clarifies the details of the tariffs on the pharma sector. Pressure from the White House has grown since early May, when President Trump signed an executive order to speed up approval of drug-manufacturing plants at home. That step fits a broader push to boost domestic production, after probes into foreign pharmaceutical imports were launched. Pharmaceuticals are a strategic but small slice of South Korea‚Äôs trade. Shipments were $9.59 billion in 2024, only 1.4% of total exports, yet 16% of those medicines went to the United States, the sector‚Äôs largest market. Industry leaders in South Korea are weighing a response Seo Jung-jin, chairman of Celltrion, said last week the firm would delay a decision on U.S. contract-manufacturing plans by six months. ‚ÄúIt is still unclear whether entering the U.S. is the right answer,‚Äù he noted, pointing to high costs in a country where Celltrion earns nearly 30% of its revenue. Regulators are also on the move. U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors landed at Samsung Biologics‚Äô plant in Incheon on May 19 for a routine visit that ends on May 27. Samsung Biologics said the trip is not linked to the surprise checks conducted by the Trump administration at some overseas factories. Investors reacted swiftly. Samsung Biologics shares climbed more than 7% on Wednesday, lifting the benchmark KOSPI index by 1.1% in early trade. Celltrion gained 0.5%. Samsung Biologics shares. Source: Google Finance Seoul signaled that more support measures could follow. Authorities have already assembled 28.6 trillion won ($20.6 billion) worth of measures to prevent liquidity problems, widen export markets, and fund companies that want to bring operations back home. Additional steps will be added if necessary to shore up sectors such as automobiles, the finance ministry said. Seoul is trying to negotiate a tariff deal by the July 8 deadline Most of the U.S. tariffs are set to begin on July 8, after a 90-day grace period. Following two rounds of ministerial talks, Korean and U.S. officials are holding technical sessions this week as Seoul tries to craft a deal and win exemptions by early July. Trade and Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said Friday that Seoul would try to negotiate a tariff deal by the deadline. However, he warned that domestic politics could result in a slip. After months of political unrest, South Korea is holding a snap presidential election on June 3. A separate caution came Wednesday from Minister for Trade Cheong In-kyo, who told lawmakers that exports to the United States and China will likely fall in May under the weight of the tariffs. In the first 20 days of May, Korean exports dropped 2.4% year on year, with U.S.-bound shipments down 14.6%. The slide, driven by autos, parts, and steel, follows an unexpected rise in April when strong semiconductor demand briefly lifted overall sales. With less than 7 weeks until the tariffs take effect, South Korea is racing to shield its export-led economy from a fresh shock while it searches for a political compromise in Washington.

In these months, the network has made some huge progress, including breaking into the top 20 crypto post-launch. Trending across social media platforms and boasting over 60 million users. Moving forward, Pi price appeared to be more secure with an increase in real-world adoption along with more exchange listings. However, the PI price has remained highly volatile, while heavy token unlocks have made it too risky to deal with. Now that the bearish flags have been fluttering over the Pi price rally, will the bulls prevent excessive price drain? After the rebound from the support below $0.7, the PI price appeared to have triggered a fine reversal. Meanwhile, a close observation suggests diverse price action. The token experienced two major spikes followed by liquidations, with a clear bearish setup leading to a decline of over 52%. In the long term, the outlook remains bearish with a target near $0.3, representing about an 80% potential downfall. In a wider perspective, the PI price has remained under massive bearish influence, which portrays the Gaussian Channel. The price is trading much below the resistance of the channel. which is currently bearish. Besides, the CMF has triggered a bearish divergence while in an attempt to trigger a recovery. Moreover, the volume has dropped significantly, signalling a drop in trading activity. With this, the PI price seems to be preparing for another pullback, which may drag the price down by another 10% to 15%. Will the PI price remain stuck within a bearish trend? The PI price may undergo minor price variations in the short term, which could keep the token consolidated above the crucial support in the long term. Besides, the upcoming unlocks are expected to increase the volatility, which could, in turn, have a positive impact on the rally. However, to do so, the PI price is required to breach above $1 and sustain for a long time without undergoing a correction.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 13:07:50

With levies on US-bound goods set to deepen later this year, analysts warn that unless Tokyo persuades Washington to roll back duties, the headwinds could intensify. Shipments from Japan to the US fell for the first time in four months According to Ministry of Finance figures, total exports climbed just 2% in April compared with a year earlier, matching market expectations but decelerating from March‚Äôs 4% gain. In contrast, shipments to the US, Japan‚Äôs largest export market, fell 1.8% year-on-year, marking the first contraction in four months. Declining demand for cars, steel and ships largely drove that downturn. Automotive exports to the US contracted by 4.8% in value, struck by a stronger yen and lower volumes of premium models. ‚ÄúUp until March, automakers appeared to front-load US deliveries ahead of the tariff increase. Now that the duties are effective, the trend has reversed.‚Äù Yutaro Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Securities. While exports to the broader Asian region rose 6%, shipments to China slipped 0.6% amid softer orders for vehicles and electronic components. At the same time, imports fell 2.2% in April, less severe than the 4.5% drop analysts had forecast, resulting in a trade deficit of ¬•115.8 billion ($803 million), rather than the anticipated surplus of ¬•227.1 billion ($1.6 billion). Ironically, Japan‚Äôs goods trade surplus with the United States widened 14.3% year-on-year to ¬•780.6 billion ($5.4 billion), the fourth consecutive monthly increase, as American purchases of Japanese products eased. That growing bilateral surplus may attract further scrutiny from Washington, which has long admonished Tokyo for currency and trade practices it believes give Japan‚Äôs exporters an edge. Against this backdrop, Japan‚Äôs chief trade negotiator , Ryosei Akazawa, is slated to hold a third round of discussions in Washington later this week. Yet few observers expect a breakthrough on auto tariffs, which are set to rise to 24% in July unless a deal is struck. Trump‚Äôs administration has already imposed 10% tariffs on a wide range of imports, including Japanese steel and aluminum, and 25% duties on cars, rattling an economy heavily reliant on auto exports to North America. ‚ÄúTariffs will exert both direct and indirect downward pressure on exports,‚Äù said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. He added that even if bilateral talks yield some tariff relief, Japan cannot escape the spillover effects of a weakening global economy. Companies in Japan may hold capital spending until the situation improves The administration‚Äôs trade measures may also cause Japanese firms to postpone capital spending, exacerbating the pain for an economy that recorded a contraction in the January‚ÄìMarch quarter. ‚ÄúWith manufacturers so deeply integrated into worldwide supply chains, abrupt policy shifts risk a ‚Äòwhiplash‚Äô effect that could reverberate through the entire economy.‚Äù Stefan Angrick of Moody‚Äôs Analytics. Currency policy is another flashpoint. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato is expected to meet his US counterpart, Treasury official Scott Bessent, on the sidelines of a G7 finance ministers‚Äô meeting in Canada this week, where dollar-yen policy is likely to feature prominently. Trump has accused Japan of deliberately keeping the yen weak to bolster its exports, and a sustained yen appreciation in recent months has already dented the competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers. The deteriorating outlook has also complicated the Bank of Japan‚Äôs plans for monetary tightening. On May 1, the BOJ sharply downgraded its growth and inflation forecasts, citing escalating US tariffs among the key risks to its belief that a moderate recovery was underway. Capital Economics economist Abhijit Surya now expects net exports to subtract from second-quarter GDP growth and has pushed back his forecast for the BOJ‚Äôs next rate hike from July to October. With an unstable tariff landscape and domestic growth teetering, Japanese policymakers face difficult choices. Already, businesses are feeling the heat with companies saying the US tariff will erode profitability by tens of billions of dollars. The Japanese companies project that they could suffer as much as $28 billion based on company guidance during the current full-year earnings period.

This unexpected price surge comes at a time when most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), are trading sideways with minimal volatility. The $TRUMP token has climbed nearly 9% within 24 hours, signalling renewed interest and liquidity among investors eager to capitalise on the political and media frenzy surrounding the token. Adding to the momentum, trading volume for the memecoin has jumped 120% to reach $1.45 billion, highlighting a dramatic increase in short-term demand and speculative activity. The gala dinner at Trump‚Äôs Virginia golf club The highly anticipated exclusive gala dinner set to take place at Trump‚Äôs Virginia golf club on March 22 is seen as the main catalyst for the TRUMP price surge. Notably, only the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP token will gain access to this private event, with the top 25 holders granted entry to a special VIP reception. Interestingly, one of those elite guests is Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, who confirmed this week that he is the top holder of the TRUMP token. H.E. Justin Sun üçå @justinsuntron ¬∑ Follow Honored to support @POTUS and grateful for the invitation from @GetTrumpMemes to attend President Trump‚Äôs Gala Dinner as his TOP fan!As the top holder of $TRUMP , I‚Äôm excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry. üá∫üá∏ 9:30 am ¬∑ 20 May 2025 832 Reply Copy link Read 174 replies Sun currently holds $18.6 million worth of the memecoin and expressed excitement about discussing the future of the crypto industry with Trump and other key figures. Sun had also revealed that Tron DAO had previously invested $75 million into World Liberty Financial, a Trump-affiliated crypto platform that redirects 75% of its revenue to Trump-owned entities. Altogether, Sun‚Äôs total investment in Trump‚Äôs crypto ecosystem now exceeds $93 million, raising eyebrows among watchdog groups and political analysts alike. Questions around the Gala dinner As TRUMP memecoin makes waves, the US SEC has acknowledged that meme coins like TRUMP are generally considered collectables, not securities, which currently shields the token from enforcement actions. Nonetheless, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins faced intense questioning in Congress regarding the legality and ethics of the gala dinner and the wider implications of foreign investors gaining intimate access to a former US president. The highly anticipated dinner event has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and nonprofit watchdogs, who allege that it paves the way for foreign influence and unregulated political fundraising. Accountable.US, a government watchdog, described the situation as ‚Äúcorruption unfolding in real time,‚Äù pointing to the opaque mechanisms that allow massive investments to translate directly into personal access. Despite the controversy, the $TRUMP token has continued to surge, with its price climbing to $14.31 and its market cap approaching $2.9 billion. The token now ranks among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, outperforming many established assets in recent days. However, concerns remain about the centralisation of supply, as nearly 80% of the TRUMP token is reportedly controlled by the Trump Organisation and its affiliates. This high concentration of ownership, combined with Sun‚Äôs substantial stake, raises potential risks of price manipulation and insider influence. At the same time, the meme coin‚Äôs lack of underlying utility or technical innovation continues to draw scepticism from traditional investors. Even so, the blend of political spectacle, celebrity appeal, and digital finance has created a unique narrative that seems to defy conventional market behaviour.

Bonk ( BONK ) was trading at $0.00002053 on Wednesday, down 20% from its monthly high. Data from Nansen and Santiment shows that both smart money investors and whales have trimmed their Bonk holdings, a potential signal that they expect a reversal in price. Bonk holders with between 1 million and 10 million coins have offloaded 500 million tokens since December.

Bonk price technical analysis Bonk price chart | Source: crypto.news The four-hour chart shows that Bonk peaked at $0.00002577 this month before forming a double-top pattern. The token then dropped to a low of $0.00001815, which coincided with an ascending trendline connecting the lowest swings since April 7. Bonk has since formed a bearish pennant pattern, made up of a sharp downward move followed by a symmetrical triangle. The two trendlines of this pattern are nearing a confluence, which could lead to a bearish breakdown. The initial target for this move is $0.00001815, the lowest swing this month.

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66‚Äì32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.

However, after some changes were made to the GENIUS law, it is expected to be voted on again in the Senate and the law is expected to pass. At this point, while it is thought that the progress and passage of the GENIUS law will have a positive impact on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said that the groundbreaking stablecoin legislation could pave the way for a crypto bull market that will last for many years. Last week, the 16 Democratic senators who had voted to reject the bill reversed their decision. The GENIUS bill, which is moving forward with the approval process, was voted 66-32 with bipartisan support. The crypto industry hailed the vote as a historic victory that could help ‚Äúsecure the dominance of the US dollar,‚Äù while Bitwise CEO said it paved the way for a bull season that will continue for years to come. ‚ÄúPoliticians in Washington did the right thing. I don't want to make a prediction without having clear data, but I think by summer we will have our first full-fledged crypto legislation in the US.‚Äù These Altcoins Will Benefit the Most! The passage of the GENIUS Act marks another milestone for the crypto market, as spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January 2024. ‚ÄúI believe this law paves the way for a long-term, sustainable rally in crypto assets beyond Bitcoin. The biggest beneficiaries will be Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and various decentralized finance (DeFi) altcoins like Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE).‚Äù The Bitwise CIO also added that the status of stablecoins, which have been in the gray zone for many years, will be clarified and will allow major banks to issue stablecoins and merchants to accept them. ‚ÄúI predict that the stablecoin market will quickly become a $2.5 trillion market once the legislation is passed.

The token trading platform achieved volumes of $2B on May 20, setting a new all-time record. Binance Alpha 2.0 achieved daily volumes of $2B as of May 20, setting a new price record. The activity on BNB Smart Chain and Binance Wallet increased, incentivized by token airdrops and trading competitions. Binance Wallet reflected the growing demand for alpha points farming and DEX swaps for the hottest tokens. | Source: Dune Analytics Binance Alpha once again became the main source of volumes for the Binance Web3 wallet, which has set daily records for the past week. In the past week, Binance Alpha increased its volumes by 223%, tapping both centralized and decentralized users. Binance Alpha 2.0 boosted by airdrop hunters The main goal of Binance Alpha 2.0 was to consolidate Web3 activity and connect it to Binance‚Äôs centralized trader user base. The launch led to special incentives for Binance Wallet users, in turn expanding volumes and transactions. Initially, the platform saw limited usage until traders noticed multiple incentives for valuable airdrops. This, in turn, increased the farming of alpha points, especially after the initial valuable airdrops. The early users of Binance Wallet and the Alpha feature gained access to ZORA, DOOD, SIGN, and other valuable assets. Binance Alpha had relatively low requirements for its first clients. Currently, there is a longer checklist for airdrop hunters, including a balance on the centralized exchange and in the Binance Web3 wallet. The other requirement is active trading of all the newly offered tokens through the Binance Alpha program. The inflow of users into Binance Alpha follows the increasing value of alpha points. The points balance will become one of the main criteria for future airdrops and token sales through Pancake Swap. BNB Smart Chain saw 365 IDO and ICO events in the year to date, based on Cryptorank data. Despite the relatively low number, PancakeSwap IDOs have the second-highest profitability. The exposure and potential listings on Binance raise demand for those events, further drawing in users to Binance Alpha. BNB Chain regains its lead BNB Chain returned as a leader in EVM-compatible networks. PancakeSwap now carries over 41.9% of DEX volumes, surpassing Base and even Uniswap on Ethereum. PancakeSwap now produces over $2M in daily fees, retaining a higher baseline in May. The native BNB token once again flipped Solana (SOL), rising to $653.73. Binance Smart Chain competes with Solana as the go-to chain for memes and token activity. The airdrop incentives are generating additional traffic, though not all of the swaps are organic. In 2025, Binance continues its deliberate efforts to increase traffic, grow value locked and become the go-to hub for Web3 activity. The chain increased its DEX volumes and saw higher demand, as PancakeSwap solved the issue of sandwich attacks. At the same time, Solana activity depends on the appeal of meme tokens, leading to a mix of hype and slower periods. Solana retains the leadership as the main network for bots, while BSC hosts only 1.2% of all bot traffic. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams announced a digital advisory council to explore blockchain use in public services. In contrast, South Korea is enacting stricter rules for nonprofit crypto sales and exchange operations, including tighter listing standards and mandatory real-name accounts, ahead of broader institutional participation in its crypto market. NFT Royalties Likely Not Securities United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce clarified that many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), particularly those programmed to pay royalties to artists and creators, likely do not fall under federal securities regulations. In a recent address, Peirce pointed out that the functionality of NFTs allowing for resale royalties is more similar to the compensation models used in the music and film industries. Hester Peirce She explained that just as streaming platforms reward creators every time their work is played, NFTs can make it possible for artists to earn from the appreciation of their work on secondary markets‚Äîwithout necessarily qualifying as securities. Peirce did add that these royalty features do not give NFT holders ownership in a business or rights to any profits in the traditional sense associated with securities. Her remarks were largely welcomed in the crypto community but were reportedly misrepresented by some media outlets. Oscar Franklin Tan , chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, believes that the idea of NFTs paying resale royalties has never been controversial or considered to fall in the SEC‚Äôs jurisdiction. According to Tan, compensating a creator through resale royalties is considered business income, not investment income, and thus falls outside the scope of securities law. He added that the legal framework never prohibited creators from earning royalties from the resale of their works, whether via traditional contracts or smart contracts on blockchain networks. However, he acknowledged that legal complexities can arise if NFT structures begin to promise royalty shares to holders beyond the original creator, which may resemble profit-sharing schemes. In a case like this, regulators might be more inclined to classify them under securities law. Still, Tan urged regulators to apply traditional legal principles logically, asking, ‚ÄúIf this were done on paper instead of blockchain, would it be a legal issue?‚Äù On a related note, NFT marketplace OpenSea recently emerged from a regulatory challenge involving the SEC. In August of 2024, OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC suggesting that NFTs on the platform might be considered unregistered securities. But on Feb. 22, 2025, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer confirmed that the SEC officially closed its investigation into the platform. The move was seen by many in the industry as a positive outcome. After this resolution, OpenSea‚Äôs legal team wrote a letter to Commissioner Peirce in April, arguing that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea should not be classified as brokers or exchanges under current US securities law. The lawyers contended that these platforms do not facilitate transactions directly or serve as intermediaries and asked the SEC to formally clarify that NFT marketplaces are not exchanges. While royalty mechanisms for artists seem safe from classification as securities, broader questions about the structure and function of NFT trading venues are still on the table. Eric Adams Vows to Make NYC the Crypto Capital Crypto regulation is also making strides in The Big Apple. New York City Mayor Eric Adams once again said that he is committed to making the city a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation, and announced plans to form a digital advisory council that is aimed at attracting jobs and investment. At the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams explained that the initiative was not about following fads but about embracing technologies that can enhance government services and economic development. While he did not share the full composition of the upcoming advisory group, Adams said a chair and formal policy recommendations will be unveiled in the coming weeks. The mayor also placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of crypto and blockchain technologies in creating a more efficient and inclusive city infrastructure. He pointed to tokenization, fintech, and blockchain applications as tools that could enhance how the city manages sensitive records and delivers public services. Specifically, Adams said the city will explore the use of crypto for paying taxes and other services, as well as implementing blockchain technology to secure documents like birth and death certificates. To support these efforts, the city already enlisted the help of financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale, who will contribute to shaping New York's crypto strategy. Adams said these partnerships will help the city stay ahead of emerging digital trends and build a stronger, more inclusive tech sector. New York State lawmakers are also pushing forward with their own digital asset legislation. Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill in April to allow state agencies to accept cryptocurrency as payment, while state Senator James Sanders Jr proposed the Blockchain Study Act in February to examine the broader impact of crypto in New York. Although the latter has not yet passed the House, the state‚Äôs legislative activity reflects a growing interest in digital assets. Mayor Adams attracted national attention after opting to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin when he took office in January of 2022, and continues to champion digital assets despite past controversies. He was previously indicted on allegations of accepting illegal campaign donations from the Turkish government, but the case was dismissed with prejudice by federal authorities. South Korea Tightens Crypto Rules On the other hand, South Korea is set to implement stricter regulations for digital asset transactions in June as it prepares to open its crypto market to institutional investors. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced the finalized measures during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting on May 20, and introduced new rules for nonprofit crypto sales and digital asset exchange operations. Under the new guidelines, nonprofit organizations will be allowed to accept and sell crypto donations, but only if they have at least five years of audited financial records and establish internal committees to review each donation and liquidation plan. All transactions must go through verified Korean won accounts, with banks and exchanges sharing verification responsibilities. To reduce speculative risks, nonprofits can only handle cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges, and liquidation must occur immediately upon receipt. Exchanges, meanwhile, will be permitted to liquidate user-paid crypto fees solely for operational costs, with strict daily limits and restrictions to the top 20 tokens by market cap. Exchanges are also barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest. The FSC is also tightening token listing standards, requiring minimum circulating supply before a token can be traded and temporarily banning market orders after new listings. Tokens with low volume, limited market cap, or no clear utility‚Äîlike meme coins‚Äîwill face more scrutiny and may be delisted if they fail to meet liquidity or engagement benchmarks. From June, nonprofits and exchanges can apply for real-name accounts, with plans to expand the system later this year to listed firms and professional investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 13:28:20

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XYZVerse sparks massive presale buzz as investors eye it as the next 50x memecoin ahead of the 2025 supercycle. Table of Contents XYZVerse ignites hype: Could this be the next 50x memecoin? Dogecoin¬†fluctuates Conclusion Some early cryptocurrency investors have seen their fortunes multiply beyond imagination. Dogecoin made millionaires out of everyday people. Now, the focus shifts to XYZVerse, a new digital asset with enormous potential. With predictions of a meme coin supercycle in 2025, XYZVerse could be the opportunity that creates billionaires. Is this the next big chance for unprecedented wealth? XYZVerse ignites hype: Could this be the next 50x memecoin? The excitement surrounding XYZVerse is heating up fast. Positioned to break records in the memecoin space, XYZVerse is aiming for an explosive 50x growth from its launch price, and the momentum is real. Currently in presale, XYZ tokens are being offered at a fraction of the projected listing price, giving early buyers a chance to lock in major gains before the broader market catches on. Already listed on CoinMarketCap, XYZVerse has received overwhelming support from the community. Over 95% of voters are bullish on XYZ, expecting major growth. Adding to the buzz, well-known crypto influencer DanjoCapitalMaster, with nearly 800,000 followers, has publicly called XYZVerse a ‚Äúmoonshot opportunity,‚Äù drawing even more attention to the project. XYZVerse isn‚Äôt just another copy-paste memecoin. It‚Äôs creating a new blueprint by merging the thrill of sports culture with the viral energy of meme communities. The result? A rapidly growing fanbase and surging presale numbers. Starting at just $0.0001, the XYZ token has climbed to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with more than 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. With a final presale price target of $0.1, the upside for early buyers is attracting serious attention. XYZVerse isn‚Äôt built on hype alone. Its tokenomics model is designed for long-term viability: 15% is allocated for liquidity to ensure strong market support. 10% is reserved for community rewards and airdrops. 17.13% will be burned, helping reduce supply and support future price appreciation. XYZVerse is putting its community at the center. The Ambassador Program rewards loyal supporters with free tokens, while behind the scenes, the team is in talks with major sports figures to amplify the brand. The recent partnership with Bookmaker, a decentralized sportsbook, marks a critical step in bringing real-world utility to the token. It‚Äôs not just a coin, it‚Äôs a movement with growing use cases. Backed by a surging presale, an engaged community, and a bold vision, XYZVerse is quickly gaining traction as one of the hottest memecoin contenders. While crypto markets remain unpredictable, early investors are eyeing this project as a rare chance to get in before liftoff. With the presale already moving fast, timing could be everything.

In the past week, its price dipped by 2.87%. Over the last month, however, it surged by 42.68%. Looking back six months, DOGE has dropped by 40.83%. This mix of gains and losses shows a volatile market for the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 49.14, indicating a neutral market. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.23, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.22. This suggests a minor upward trend. The MACD level is 0.0009963, hinting at potential bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is $0.28, while support is at $0.19. If DOGE breaks above the $0.28 resistance, it could reach the next resistance at $0.31, marking a potential gain of around 24%. On the downside, falling below the $0.19 support might lead to testing the $0.15 support level, a possible drop of about 30%. The substantial monthly gain indicates growth potential, but the recent weekly dip urges caution. Monitoring these key levels will be crucial for anticipating DOGE‚Äôs next move. Conclusion Coins like DOGE have shown great potential, but XYZVerse unites sports fans for unprecedented growth in the 2025 bull run.

The platform's unique social trading features and multi-asset offerings provide a competitive edge over peers like Robinhood, attracting both novice and sophisticated investors. Recent U.S. crypto regulation changes and eToro's Nasdaq listing open significant growth opportunities in North America, despite some regulatory and competitive risks. While risks remain, eToro's current valuation and business model suggest substantial upside potential compared to sector peers, making ETOR stock attractive. Israeli online trading company eToro Group Ltd ( ETOR ) went public last week on Wednesday, raising $310 million via an initial public offering. The IPO was priced at $52.00 per share, valuing the company at $4.2 billion. eToro shares opened trading on Nasdaq at $69.69 per share, 34% above the IPO price. Even though the stock price has pulled back slightly to about $66.00 per share, the company is still valued about 27% above its IPO valuation. It is also significantly higher than the $3.5 billion the online brokerage platform reported in the $300 million venture funding announced in 2023. However, at the current market cap of about $5.4 billion, eToro‚Äôs current market value is just above half the $10.4 billion valuation the company sought when it first planned to go public via a SPAC in 2021. eToro's value proposition eToro‚Äôs 2024 total commission income rose 45.6% last year to $931 million, according to the company‚Äôs pre-IPO filings. The fourth quarter brought in $303 million, mainly driven the Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $100,000 following Trump‚Äôs election. Overall, crypto-related commissions accounted for 38% of the total for the year, again with the fourth quarter a major contributor. This is even though eToro had agreed to delist multiple cryptocurrencies from its trading platform in September, following its settlement with the SEC. However, things have taken a turn for the better in the U.S. overall, with the securities regulatory agency seemingly retreating on oversight after withdrawing or pausing cases against Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood‚Äôs crypto unit. Earlier this year, the Trump administration reclassified several digital asset types as collectibles rather than securities, paving the way for a potential relisting on crypto exchanges and other trading platforms in the U.S., where they had been previously delisted amid the SEC‚Äôs wrath on crypto companies. Although bitcoin is by far the biggest contributor to daily crypto trading volume, listing products like meme coins can help attract new traders to a platform, thus potentially increasing commission revenue. Reuters reported that eToro CEO, Yoni Assia, shares the sentiment that ‚Äúspeculation on meme coins generally brings more people into the market.‚Äù If U.S. traders are able to trade more tokens than the three that are currently allowed on eToro, it creates an avenue for more people to begin using the platform. This, in turn, translates to higher commission revenue. The current shift in the U.S. crypto regulatory environment, coupled with eToro‚Äôs public listing, will also likely draw more institutional investors to the platform. eToro established itself as one of the leading retail trading platforms before expanding to crypto assets in 2013. More recently, the company expanded its digital assets offerings to include ‚Äúexperimental crypto assets‚Äù, which it described as a class of digital assets that include meme coins, initial coin offerings and token sales, innovative products, and decentralized finance ((DEFI)) strategies. Memecoins played a big part in the Solana blockchain‚Äôs rapid growth over the past two years, helping it recover from the impact of the FTX collapse. Their role in eToro‚Äôs growth might be different, but like Assia said, they could still onboard more traders to the market. eToro‚Äôs value proposition eToro has established itself as a leading social trading platform, driven by the community. Although a majority of its 3.5 million funded accounts are in Europe and the UK, its listing on the Nasdaq opens up an opportunity to fully grow its footprint in North America. The eToro social trading platform also offers more features than most of its publicly listed competitors, including the ability to follow and copy the trades of expert traders. Tzahi Kanza, CEO of Syndika , a Web3 venture studio and a founders syndicate, also believes eToro has positioned itself strategically at the intersection of retail investing, social trading, and cryptocurrency access. ‚ÄúUnlike traditional brokers, eToro integrates a social feed where users can copy the strategies of top-performing investors, blending education with execution,‚Äù Kanza said in a May 16 Q&A interview emailed to me exclusively for this Seeking Alpha article. ‚ÄúMoreover, eToro offers direct exposure to crypto assets alongside equities, ETFs, and commodities, making it one of the few platforms where retail users can build a multi-asset portfolio with a Web3 edge.‚Äù For this reason, Kanza also believes eToro‚Äôs model is difficult to replicate at scale. Its approach to crypto is now being mirrored by multi-billion dollar companies like Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ), which has rapidly expanded its asset offerings to include cryptocurrencies. This approach ‚Äî of traditional banks and neobanks/fintech companies integrating crypto services, is gaining traction within the crypto community at a faster rate than when native crypto companies try to integrate traditional financial services. This is primarily because of the strong foundations that mainstream finance companies are built on traditionally, and Hong Yea, co-founder and CEO of GRVT , a licensed on-chain exchange, thinks this could be yet another strong value proposition for eToro, especially now it has gone public. On May 16, in an emailed Q&A interview exclusive for this Seeking Alpha article, Yea said, ‚ÄúAs a non-crypto native, Gen Z-focused brand that has progressively and intuitively moved deeper into the crypto ecosystem, eToro has precisely caught the wave of the recent on-chain finance narrative, which is gaining huge momentum, making its IPO particularly attractive.‚Äù However, Hong Yea thinks it is still too early to predict whether or not eToro will become one of the main crypto trading companies, offering caution about what happened in the dot-com bubble. ‚ÄúMany companies went public with IPOs [in the dot-com bubble] only to burst afterwards,‚Äù Yea added. However, Syndika‚Äôs Tzahi Kanza offers a different perspective, one that I happen to share. Last year, crypto became eToro‚Äôs biggest revenue contributor with 38% of the total commissions. eToro‚Äôs top line has been on a steady rise over the past three years, increasing to $639 million in 2023, up from $632 million in 2022, before spiking to $931 million last year. This is still below the company's $1.23 billion revenue reported in 2021 at the height of the previous crypto boom, which makes a realistic target for 2025 if the current crypto rally continues. Kanza believes the growing impact of crypto on eToro‚Äôs revenue is more structural than a one-time anomaly caused by the massive surge in crypto trading activity in the final quarter of the year. ‚ÄúWith the cryptocurrency sector expected to outperform other asset classes, I believe its contribution to eToro‚Äôs revenue will continue to grow. While competition from pure crypto exchanges will remain intense, many of them lack the multi-asset exposure, social trading layer, and compliance credentials that eToro offers,‚Äù Kanza said. If eToro's revenue can hit the 2021 highs this year, that implies a 32% growth. This could be a catalyst for an ETOR price rally, potentially pushing it closer to $90 per share. The stock has already traded above $74 per share since going public last week, again, which means a high $80s valuation is not beyond the realms of reality. As of December 31, 2021, when eToro reported annual revenue of $1.23 billion, the company had 2.4 million funded accounts. The latest filings say it has 3.5 million funded accounts, which is about 45.8% more. The company's assets under administration are also up significantly, rising to $16.6 billion ($12.15 billion crypto), up from $10.7 billion in 2021, approximately 55.7% growth. This again supports the case for higher revenues if trader activity hits 2021 highs. If the current crypto boom generates a similar trading activity in 2021, the 55.7% increase in assets under administration should be able to boost revenue further to about $1.9 billion. That's more than 100% growth potential in top-line overall, which, based on the current ETOR stock valuation of about $5.4 billion on revenue of $931 million, would make a $10.8 billion eToro market cap realistic. eToro‚Äôs closest publicly listed peer is Robinhood Markets, which saw its revenue increase by 58% (YoY) to $2.95 billion in 2024. Based on Robinhood‚Äôs current valuation of $57.28 billion, the company's market cap is more than 10x eToro's $5.4 billion, yet its 2024 revenue is about 3x eToro's. That leaves a lot of room for the eToro stock price to catch up, thus making a $10 billion market cap realistically achievable. Risks eToro‚Äôs revenue last year was hugely impacted by the late surge in crypto trading activity, which was driven by Trump‚Äôs election and the hopes that the 45th and 47th President of the United States would usher in a better market for digital assets companies in the U.S. Since then, Trump has appointed a leadership team, widely viewed as ‚Äòcrypto-centric‚Äô. However, that team, starting with the new SEC chair Paul Atkins, is already being questioned about questionable crypto projects (the TRUMP meme coin) and ties to certain crypto people (Tron blockchain‚Äôs Justin Sun). The Crypto and AI task force will have to stand firm and implement Trump‚Äôs digital assets vision for the companies trooping into the U.S. crypto market to enjoy success. Furthermore, while the likes of Robinhood, Kraken, and Coinbase have had the SEC withdraw or pause its lawsuits against them, it remains to be seen whether there will be retrospective applications to companies whose cases had already been settled with the securities regulator. Will U.S. traders be allowed to trade more tokens in eToro? Also, unlike Robinhood, which is headquartered in the U.S., it remains to be seen whether eToro will be able to wrestle a significant chunk of the U.S. crypto trading market as a foreign company, even if it is eventually allowed to list more cryptocurrencies. Conclusion eToro‚Äôs social trading platform offers a unique approach to crypto trading, enabling even new traders to easily start trading without worrying about the technical terminologies that confuse most novices.

The SEC claimed that they made false and misleading statements about their tokens and raised over $100 million from investors. Unicoin Accused of Violating Securities Laws in Raising Over $100 Million In a complaint filed in the Southern District of New York on May 20, the SEC accused Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, former board chair Maria Moschini, senior vice president and general counsel Richard Devlin and former chief investment officer Alejandro Dominguez of misleading over 5,000 investors about so-called ‚Äúrights certificates‚Äù that conveyed rights to receive Unicoin tokens and stock. ‚ÄúWe allege that Unicoin and its executives exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises that its tokens, when issued, would be backed by real-world assets including an international portfolio of valuable real estate holdings,‚Äù Mark Cave, associate director in the SEC‚Äôs Division of Enforcement, said in a statement . ‚ÄúBut as we allege, the real estate assets were worth a mere fraction of what the company claimed.‚Äù The SEC argued that Unicoin never actually owned the real estate properties it told investors it had purchased, and that those properties‚Äô values were greatly exaggerated. Unicoin allegedly placed ads in airports, taxis, office building elevator screens, and on television programs to lure investors, touting the offerings as the ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù secure investments. The complaint further alleges that Unicoin falsely claimed its tokens were registered with the SEC and that it had made $3 billion in sales by June 2024, when it sold just over $110 million in its rights certificates. According to court documents, the SEC is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties against all named defendants, as well as officer-and-director prohibitions for the three senior executives. Devlin agreed to pay a $37,500 civil penalty, without admitting or denying the charges. The lawsuit comes as the SEC, under the new Trump-Vance administration, has dismissed several high-profile crypto enforcement cases, including recent cases against Coinbase , Ripple , Robinhood , and Consensys.

But in 2025, something unusual is happening‚ÄîDOGE holders are leaving behind the world of memes and moving toward purpose-driven crypto assets. Their top pick? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äîa DeFi lending protocol that is rapidly gaining attention with real-world use cases and long-term earning potential. With a price surge to $0.025 in Phase 4, over 10,900 holders, and $8.9 million+ raised, Mutuum Finance is no longer a hidden gem. Analysts now believe MUTM could deliver a 10x return before the year ends, and investors are racing to join before prices rise in the next phase. From memes to meaning: why DOGE holders are switching to utility In the past, DOGE delivered incredible gains‚Äîbut much of its value was built on internet jokes and speculative trading. With market conditions changing, many investors are now seeking real utility and sustainable growth. Mutuum Finance offers exactly that. It is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets through both pool-based (P2C) and direct peer-to-peer (P2P) models. It stands out in the DeFi space by providing flexible interest rates, a wide variety of supported tokens, and non-custodial control of funds. Unlike meme coins that rely on hype, MUTM holders are rewarded with real passive income, staking opportunities, and exposure to a rapidly growing lending ecosystem. Analyst forecast: MUTM may deliver 10x growth in 2025 Industry experts are feeling confident about the future of Mutuum Finance‚Äîand for good reason. The price has already climbed from $0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.025 in Phase 4. That means early investors are already sitting on a 150% return, and the momentum doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down. That‚Äôs already a 2.5x return, and we‚Äôre only in Phase 4. With seven more phases ahead, each increasing in price by $0.005, the final presale price will be $0.06. That‚Äôs a 500% increase from the Phase 1 price‚Äîand once the token hits public exchanges, experts believe the price could climb 10x or more due to growing demand for DeFi lending. For DOGE holders used to unpredictable swings, MUTM offers something far more stable‚Äîand potentially more profitable. Utility-Driven Value: What Makes MUTM So Powerful? MUTM isn‚Äôt just another token‚Äîit powers the entire Mutuum Finance ecosystem. Here‚Äôs how MUTM tokens provide real value to users: Mutuum redistributes a portion of its protocol revenue by buying MUTM tokens on the open market and sending them to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This ensures that holders not only benefit from price appreciation but also receive regular token rewards as long-term contributors. When you deposit ETH, DAI, or another asset into Mutuum, you receive mtTokens, which represent your share in the lending pool. These tokens automatically accrue value as borrowers pay interest‚Äîso you earn passively without having to trade or manage your position daily. For example, if you deposit $1,000 in ETH and the pool‚Äôs utilization stays high, you could generate 8%‚Äì12% annually in passive income‚Äîmuch more than just holding a meme coin. By staking mtTokens, you help secure the protocol and unlock dividend rewards. As more users lend and borrow assets on the Mutuum platform, the demand for MUTM tokens rises‚Äîcreating a natural price appreciation fueled by real utility. Why the fear of missing out is real right now The fear of missing out on Mutuum Finance is very real right now‚Äîand here‚Äôs why. Early backers who joined in Phase 1 are already up by 150%, with the token now priced at $0.025. As Phase 5 approaches with a price of $0.03, each new round narrows the window for bigger gains. Experts are projecting a potential 10x return once the project goes completely public. With over 10,900 holders already on board and a rapidly growing community, the momentum is undeniable to ignore. Every new phase means paying more for the same number of tokens. If you‚Äôre thinking of joining, now is the time‚Äîbefore the lower entry points disappear and early rewards are gone. Meme coins like Dogecoin served their purpose‚Äîthey brought millions into crypto. But now, the trend is shifting. Investors are demanding value, purpose, and performance. Mutuum Finance checks all the boxes. With an active lending protocol, passive income mechanisms, a growing user base, and built-in demand for its native token, MUTM is positioned as one of the most promising DeFi tokens of 2025. Dogecoin holders are known for taking bold bets‚Äîbut this time, they‚Äôre betting on utility, not memes. With MUTM currently priced at $0.025 and expected to rise to $0.06 in the presale alone, every day of waiting could mean less profit. Whether you‚Äôre seeking passive income, real use cases, or simply a smarter long-term play, Mutuum Finance is leading the way. Don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs on every headline. Get in now‚Äîwhile it‚Äôs still early.

According to Remi , this exponential growth could see the price of XRP skyrocket to $1,700 per coin between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. His analysis, deeply rooted in historical market behavior, particularly the 2017‚Äì2018 cycle, has sparked renewed interest and debate about the long-term potential of XRP as both a digital asset and a critical component of global financial infrastructure. Told everyone months ago‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre following the 2017-2108 breakout and to expect a 64,000% increase in XRP to a $1700 XRP Q4/Q1 Told everyone conservatively $1200 EOY Overall I‚Äôm expecting 80,000%-150,000% increase in XRP this run (if not more) Now you‚Äôre seeing it from a‚Ä¶ https://t.co/2klSFT1Efm ‚Äî The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 20, 2025 Historical Patterns and Market Outlook The Real Remi Relief draws a compelling parallel between the current XRP price action and its historic breakout during the 2017‚Äì2018 bull run. At that time, XRP defied expectations by rising from mere fractions of a dollar to a peak near $3.84‚Äîan astronomical gain that positioned it temporarily as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Remi believes XRP is now following a similar trajectory, only with even more dramatic implications due to broader adoption, legal clarity, and a maturing crypto market. Based on this historical framework, Remi sets a conservative price expectation of $1,200 by the end of 2025. However, he remains confident that XRP could ultimately exceed this target and reach between $1,700 and beyond during the next market expansion phase. This translates to an unprecedented price appreciation of between 80,000% to 150,000%, which he describes as both historic and transformative. Legal Clarity and Ripple‚Äôs Strategic Positioning One key driver behind Remi‚Äôs optimistic forecast is the increasing legal clarity surrounding XRP and its issuer, Ripple Labs. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a landmark ruling in the ongoing SEC v. Ripple case, declaring that XRP is not a security when sold on public exchanges. This judgment was widely celebrated as a legal breakthrough for Ripple and a turning point in the broader regulatory landscape for digital assets. Since then, Ripple has aggressively expanded its presence in the global payments ecosystem. With strategic partnerships spanning financial institutions, central banks, and payment corridors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Ripple is poised to serve as a foundational layer in the future of cross-border settlements. The XRPL‚Äôs rapid development‚Äîincluding its native decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT support, and the recent EVM sidechain innovations by Peersyst Technology‚Äîfurther strengthens the case for XRP‚Äôs utility and long-term value. Macroeconomic Trends and Institutional Demand Beyond the internal XRP ecosystem, macroeconomic forces and growing institutional interest in blockchain-based solutions contribute to Remi‚Äôs bullish thesis. As global economies seek faster, cheaper, and more transparent payment infrastructures, blockchain networks like RippleNet offer a viable alternative to the legacy SWIFT system . Moreover, as central banks continue exploring digital currencies (CBDCs), Ripple‚Äôs CBDC platform, built on the XRP Ledger, positions it as a top contender for technological collaboration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional investors are also warming up to the crypto sector, driven by the proliferation of regulated financial instruments like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. While XRP has not yet received similar investment vehicles, the recent legal developments and increasing enterprise usage could change that. Remi suggests that once institutions recognize XRP‚Äôs potential as a neutral, bridge asset for global liquidity, demand could surge dramatically, fueling the kind of price explosion he anticipates. Community Reactions and Market Sentiment Remi‚Äôs forecast has sparked both excitement and skepticism across the crypto community. While some users dismiss such projections as overly ambitious, others point to past examples, like Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise from under $1,000 to $69,000, as evidence that such parabolic moves are not only possible but integral to crypto‚Äôs speculative cycles. What sets The Real Remi Relief apart is its detailed comparison of market cycles and unwavering conviction. His call, while extraordinary, echoes a broader sentiment gaining traction among XRP holders: that the asset is significantly undervalued relative to its use case and future potential. As he stated, ‚ÄúHistory will be made,‚Äù capturing the belief that XRP is on the verge of a historic revaluation. The Real Remi Relief‚Äôs 64,000% XRP forecast may seem extreme at first glance, but it is underpinned by a confluence of historical data, technological advancements, and improving regulatory clarity. While such predictions should be approached with cautious optimism, they reflect a growing narrative that XRP could play a central role in the next era of digital finance. With market cycles heating up and institutional capital flowing into the space, XRP‚Äôs journey toward $1,200‚Äîor even $1,700‚Äîmay no longer be a distant fantasy, but a bold possibility rooted in the convergence of history, technology, and belief.

According to a new report from local news publication MyLondon , Jacob Irwin-Cline from Portland, Oregon, was on a two-day layover when he requested an Uber after leaving The Roxy, a nightclub in Soho, around 1:30 AM on May 9. The 30-year-old former software developer and crypto investor said he was intercepted by a driver who appeared to match the profile displayed in the app and who called out the alias he had saved as his name in the Uber account. Having reportedly later asked the nightclub for CCTV footage of the incident, Irwin-Cline said it was a ‚Äúdark sedan‚Äù that pulled up, and not the Toyota Prius that was listed on his Uber app. ‚ÄúThe guy seemed super chill, super nice,‚Äù Irwin-Cline narrated. The techie said he accepted a cigarette from the driver and started feeling disoriented shortly afterwards. He believes the cigarette may have been laced with scopolamine, also known as ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Breath,‚Äù a powerful sedative known for causing blackouts while keeping victims conscious. While in a semi-conscious state, Irwin-Cline inadvertently handed over his phone‚Äôs passcode and access to his crypto accounts before he was abandoned in a London suburb as the fake taxi driver fled with his phone. ‚ÄúLess Than 1% Chance‚Äù Of Recovering Lost Funds After returning to his hostel with the help of a stranger, he discovered his laptop had been wiped remotely, and he was locked out of his digital accounts. He later regained access but realized that roughly $123,000 in crypto had been withdrawn from his wallet, including around $73,000 in XRP tokens and $50,000 in Bitcoin. He reportedly shared screenshots with MyLondon revealing his XRP holdings dropped from $73,000 to under $1,000 and his BTC from $50,000 to less than $10 on that fateful night.

The announcement officially introduced Pi Network Ventures , a Silicon Valley-style investment initiative that will fund startups building within or integrating with the Pi ecosystem. While the fund represents a bold and strategic pivot towards broader adoption, it was not well received by investors. This can be considered a classic ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù event as the Pi token dropped sharply after the reveal. The fund will prioritize blockchain startups along with those in sectors like fintech, generative AI, e-commerce, and social platforms. The initiative isn‚Äôt just about investment capital; it‚Äôs about integrating Pi into everyday use cases. According to the Foundation, the fund is designed to deliver strategic value and a long-term impact while favoring businesses that can extend Pi‚Äôs reach beyond its core crypto community. Still, not all reactions have been positive. For traders, the lack of immediate token impact was a letdown, as Pi‚Äôs price erased much of its early-May rally. However, from a development perspective, the initiative suggests Pi Network is playing the long game by positioning itself to back builders. In an ecosystem increasingly saturated with short-term hype, this signals a deeper commitment to sustainable growth. To better understand what Pi Network Ventures means for developers, users, and the broader community, crypto.news interviewed a Pi Network spokesperson to explore how the fund will be structured, what kinds of projects are likely to be backed, and how the community will play a role in shaping the next chapter of Pi Network‚Äôs evolution. You might also like: 4 catalysts that could revive Pi Network after $13b market cap crash crypto.news: Can you explain where the $100 million worth of funds are coming from and how is it structured? Pi: The Pi earmarked for the initiative comes from the 10% of tokens that are specifically allocated for foundation reserves (more information on Pi supply and tokenomics is available here ). CN: Will the funding be provided in fiat, stablecoins, Pi tokens, other cryptos, or a mix of all? Pi: The initiative is held in Pi and USD. While the investments will generally be denominated in US dollar terms, Pi Network Ventures will seek to make the majority of its investments directly in the form of Pi. This means that companies who join the ecosystem will receive investments in the very currency that their businesses [transact in and] will help to strengthen and grow. CN: Who will be making the investment decisions for Pi Network Ventures and what role or titles will the Pi Core Team hold? Pi: Pi Network Ventures is an investment pool established through Pi Foundation, an ownerless organization created to guide the long-term development of the Pi ecosystem and ensure the sustainability and greater good of the network for generations to come. CN: How will Pi Network Ventures deploy the $100 million? Is there an investment timeline or cap per deal, or is it a more flexible, rolling deployment that will be allocated as opportunities arise? Pi: Pi Network Ventures‚Äô investments are intended to provide both capital and strategic value over a broader timeframe to those companies believed to be best positioned to create value in the world and seeks to help companies provide additional ways to use Pi worldwide. Pi Network Ventures may make investments over time and from time to time, and may discontinue investing at any point in time. CN: If Pi Foundation is taking a VC approach to its investing, how will it differ from traditional venture capital? Pi: Companies that Pi Network Ventures may invest in will gain something incredibly rare in crypto and in traditional venture capital: the funds come with access to the market‚Äîpotentially addressing two of the essential components of building startups. Portfolio companies will have the opportunity to access a sizable, active, and KYC-verified userbase with tens of millions of users of Pi Network across 200+ countries and regions, with over 19 million already identity-verified through Pi KYC. CN: What are the criteria and process for selecting startups to receive Pi Network Ventures funding? Does a project have to be built exclusively on the Pi blockchain or is simply integrating Pi in some way (i.e accepting Pi as payment) sufficient? Pi: More details on criteria and process will be released later. But the initial factor to be considered is whether a startup or business is innovative and creates value for the world or not, and whether there is a strong team to make that happen. Thereafter, Pi Network Ventures will evaluate whether the business can help expand Pi‚Äôs utility and contribute to the ecosystem. Specific requirements will be included in future announcements. CN: What expertise or safeguards are in place to make sure $100M is allocated wisely and not just to well-intentioned but unviable projects? Pi: Pi Network Ventures‚Äô investment processes will seek to mirror common practices utilized by traditional Silicon Valley venture capital firms, in sourcing, selection, vetting processes and more, designed to identify and support high-impact and disruptive startups and businesses. Note that Pi Network Ventures‚Äô investments are intended to provide both capital and strategic value over a broader timeframe to those believed to be best positioned to create value in the world and help provide additional ways to use Pi worldwide. Pi Foundation is not obligated to invest the entire $100M, based on the quality of applicants and number of startups accepted into the initiative. Pi Network Ventures may make investments over time and from time to time, and may discontinue investing at any point in time. CN: Are there any particular sectors or use cases you are prioritizing for investment? Pi: While blockchain-native startups will certainly be part of the portfolio, Pi Network Ventures‚Äô investments will also focus heavily on general technology sectors, including generative AI and AI applications, FinTech, embedded payments, ecommerce platforms, marketplaces, social networks and real-world consumer and enterprise applications. From a global ecommerce platform that accepts Pi, to an AI-enabled service that leverages Pi for access or credits, to a traditional business integrating Pi into its loyalty program‚Äîif a company can drive real-world utility and ecosystem progress, the Pi Foundation plans to explore investment opportunities to support it. CN: Pi Network Ventures has the objective to ‚Äúboost Pi utility‚Äù. How do you see that happening in practice? Pi: As more businesses accept Pi and integrate it into real-world applications‚Äîproducts, services, transactions, and experiences‚Äîusers will be able to use Pi in more diverse ways. When businesses adopt Pi, they introduce it to new users and use cases. This creates natural growth while keeping usage aligned with real activity and utility, which creates a stronger ecosystem. A stronger ecosystem means more opportunities for Pi users to participate‚Äîas users, builders, workers, and entrepreneurs. Will you be providing mentorship, networking, etc? Pi: Mentorship and developer support programs have continued from the Enclosed Network period to present ‚Äì see earlier answer. Pi Network Ventures is part of Pi‚Äôs diverse strategies to boost utility and empower the Pi ecosystem: high-signal investment and incubation working in parallel with grass-roots utility and ecosystem movements. While high-signal investment and incubation typically target and support a limited number of high-quality startups and businesses based on selective criteria, grass-roots movements can leverage the existing community of Pi and potentially generate a larger quantity of attempts for utility at scale. Pi employs both strategies. Pi Network Ventures belongs to the former strategy, while measures like hackathons and any other platform that scales utility building are under the latter strategy. CN: What role will the Pi community have in Pi Network Ventures? For example, would you consider incorporating community feedback in selecting which products get funded, or perhaps allow users to beta test products from these startups? Pi: Pi Network has always had decentralized input in developer and project selection in the past. This has occurred in the Pi app called Brainstorm which is accessible through Pi Browser where Pioneers provide their input on projects through multiple blind reviews or evaluations in the app, which help remove noises and surface better projects. Their review results led to candidates of many hackathon winners in the past. As for more specific integration of community feedback in the selection process for Pi Network Ventures, stay tuned for future details. CN: How does Pi Network Ventures fit into Pi Network‚Äôs long-term vision?

Both $ETH and $SUI are analysed. $ETH breaks out of falling wedge Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $ETH displays the big surge out from the 5-month long descending trendline. Once the local high was made at $2,700, the price action started to form a descending wedge, which is a bullish pattern. Having just broken out of this wedge, the price is currently consolidating, and may just head down to confirm the top of the wedge again, and the very strong support at $2,500, before heading higher. $ETH ready to break upwards from critical $2,500 horizontal support Source: TradingView The weekly time frame gives more of a clear-cut view of the situation for $ETH. The $2,500 could be about to become that extremely strong support level that $ETH bulls can use as a base for the next surge higher. The last swing high at $4,100 is the target. Failure to get above this would mean a failed rally, therefore making $2,500 into critical support is an absolute must. $SUI about to break out of second successive bull flag Source: TradingView Since breaking beyond its own major descending trendline, the $SUI price is now in its second bull flag. A breakout of this current bull flag would likely provide the impetus to also break through the $4.10 horizontal resistance level. $SUI $4.10 resistance key to all-time high Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame, the significance of the $4.10 resistance can be really appreciated. A break through this level, and consolidation above, would leave the path open for the bulls to make an assault on the $5.36 all-time high. The current bull flag could help the bulls to get halfway there with a measured move to around $4.67. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The project is built on the Binance Smart Chain, boasting fast transactions and zero trading fees. Over 9000+ members have joined the endeavor, working steadily towards the development team‚Äôs set goal of 10,000 members. According to official reports , the first phase is intended to attract and reward early adopters, with elements in place to encourage user participation. $25 Buy-In Leads to Shareable Referral Code In a bid to encourage wider use, the project has embraced a $25 buy-in entry point. Upon spending this minimum to buy $KOPS tokens, an automatic referral code is generated. Any future purchase with that referral code will reward the first member. Referral mechanism is the foundation for KOPS‚Äô viral expansion plan and brings natural value to initial community members. The team has mentioned that this model is a means to reward activity without resorting to such measures as normal advertisement. The scheme also indicates that the team is keen on not letting bot activity get in the way, so all interactions are real. This anti-spam approach is supported by a closed-access policy. Participants must join the official Telegram community to access essential elements, including referral tools and contest entry requirements. UGC Contest Offers 85M KOPS of Incentives To once more boost engagement , the team has launched an 85 million $KOPS valued user-generated content (UGC) contest. Users can post memes, videos, or thread-based content to compete for various tiers of rewards. The top content creator will receive 20 million $KOPS, the second and third creators will receive 10 million and 5 million, respectively. In addition to this, 30 million tokens will also be distributed among 20 up-and-coming creators. Another 5 million will be awarded through community voting, and 15 million tokens are reserved for unique, funny, or viral entries. This format encourages creative freedom, and one quality submission could result in a substantial token reward. However, every contestant must first complete an official entry form before submitting content. All valid submissions must be posted under the designated UGC Contest Topic within the Telegram group. Any entries posted elsewhere will not be considered. After submitting the entry form, each participant receives a KOPS Profile Card delivered to their provided Telegram username. Early Participation Aligned with Platform Development Strategy The contest will run for 30 days, and early participants are encouraged to make strategic submissions. This move is aligned with an overall strategy by the development team to organically grow and gain momentum in a competitive memecoin market. Despite overall market tough times, the $KOPS project continues to grow, with an identified target user and community development in progress. UGC contest and referral system each support the other to give multiple points of interaction. Overall, users sign up and invite their friends, or post for the contest, and the community develops through direct interaction. Meanwhile, the fact that tools are only accessible by being part of the official Telegram community keeps the users involved and informed throughout. With the community already having well over 9000+ members, only 1000 more are required to reach the team‚Äôs 10,000-user high. These structured participation methods are the lifeblood of building the platform‚Äôs foundation. Every referral and piece of content created during this time counts towards user growth and token payout, directly associating effort with the potential for reward. How to Participate in The ICO? The Kingdom has officially launched the ICO , and you can start accumulating the $KOPS. Many experts suggest that after the listing, the token has the potential to explode by 1000x. Participating in the massive ICO event could help you make a fortune for life. Follow the steps provided on the official site and make KOPS yours. To know more about the Pigdom.

(Pi Network Price Prediction),https://cryptonews.com/news/pi-coin-is-down-now-but-could-this-be-the-setup-for-a-100-moonshot-pi-network-price-prediction/,"The Pi Network price has jumped by 9% in the past 24 hours, climbing to $0.798 as the crypto market as a whole falls by 1% today. Despite this rally, PI remains down by 33% in a week, although it holds on to a 37.5% increase in a fortnight and a 25% gain in a month. Today has also witnessed a lift in its trading volume, but what‚Äôs particularly bullish about PI at the moment is that its indicators have begun bouncing from a bottom. And when combined with attempts to improve Pi Network‚Äôs utility, this could be the foundation of big moves for the altcoin . Pi Network Price Prediction ‚Äì Where is PI Heading Next? Pi Network (PI) is once again flashing strong bullish potential, with its 4-hour chart pointing to a structured path toward a major breakout ‚Äî and a long-term target that could stretch well beyond $50. Following its breakout from a descending wedge earlier this month, PI has retested and stabilized above previous resistance, now turning that level into solid support. The RSI has climbed back above 56, signaling rising bullish momentum. Meanwhile, volume remains elevated ‚Äî reinforcing the conviction behind this move. The RSI is trending upward around 56, suggesting that buying pressure is returning. Volume also remains relatively strong, indicating renewed interest from traders following the recent dip. Immediate resistance sits around $1.70, followed by the psychological $3.00 level ‚Äî both of which acted as key zones during the last spike. A clean break above these levels would likely confirm a fresh uptrend, setting the stage for a more aggressive rally. If momentum continues building and market sentiment remains favorable, the path toward a long-term target between $50 and $100 could begin to take shape in the coming weeks. All signs point to a high-conviction setup with parabolic potential. Notably, some analysts are now also arguing that the Pi Network price has begun a bullish reversal. $PI reversal mode on Next stop 1$ later 1.5 and 2$, #picoin community is too strong and price cheap like this won't last long #PiNetwork2025 $BTC $ETH $SOL #AltcoinSeason pic.twitter.com/XSqpo3pUaF ‚Äî GEM HUNTER (@TrueGemHunter) May 21, 2025 Of course, in the medium- and long-term, the Pi Network price will depend on various factors, including the coin‚Äôs fundamentals and its ability to attract listings on the top exchanges. It has already gone some way to improving its utility in the past week or so, having announced the Pi Network Ventures fund , which has $100 million to spend on new projects building within the PI ecosystem. As for big exchange listings, the Pi community remains hopeful that Binance is nearing the point where it will list the token, with some members even suggesting that the exchange is dropping hints of an incoming listing. Hold up Did you noticed the same. Did Binance just drop a clue? Their latest Facebook post is packed with #Pi symbols coincidence or something BIG brewing? With more than 86% of voters pushing for $PI to be listed on Binance, the community is loud and clear. Could this‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/J2BhQgYsgr ‚Äî Justin Wu œÄ (@hackapreneur) May 15, 2025 If PI does receive listings from Binance (not to mention Coinbase, Kraken and other big platforms), then there‚Äôs no doubt that the Pi Network price will surge. Assuming that the ongoing tariff situation has simmered down by such a point, PI could easily hit $3 or $4 in a matter of weeks after any such listing. Breakout Potential? This New Presale Altcoin Could Steal the Spotlight This Summer As promising as PI could be if the above does happen, it may not do much if Binance and other exchanges continue to refuse it a listing. In such a scenario, traders may be better off diversifying into newer alts, including into some of the more promising presale coins. One of the most interesting presale tokens right now is MIND of Pepe (MIND) , an AI crypto that has now raised $9.7 million in its ICO, which will end in ten days. Last chance to buy $MIND https://t.co/Co2K02Tpkb pic.twitter.com/DDNkhkf0B6 ‚Äî MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 16, 2025 Running on the Ethereum blockchain, MIND of Pepe has won over investors because of its plans to launch an autonomous AI agent that will interact with the crypto market and produce market advice. It will scan masses of data to provide MIND holders with actionable analysis, while it will also use its insight into prevailing trends to generate its own coins. These coins could become highly successful, and investors can gain early access to them ‚Äì before they list ‚Äì by holding MIND. This means that MIND could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up over time. While its sale has only a week and half to go, you can still join it at the MIND of Pepe website , where MIND costs $0.0037515. This is its final presale price, but based on its popularity (e.g. on social media), it could rise far beyond this price once it lists.

What happened to Jacob Irwin-Cline sounds like a Black Mirror meets Web3 episode. The 30-year-old ex-software dev from Portland built a small fortune investing in Bitcoin as a teenager. On a short layover in London before visiting his parents in Spain, he went out for drinks in The Roxy nightclub in Soho. He called an Uber around 1:30 AM on May 9 to return to his hostel. Outside, a driver flagged him down, knowing his name, and matched the photo shown in the app. So he got in, but the car didn‚Äôt match the app, which was supposed to be the first red flag. Fake Uber driver drains tourist‚Äôs crypto wallets As per a report, the driver offered him a cigarette. At first, Jacob said no, but relented, ‚ÄúSure, if you want to bond over a cigarette.‚Äù It is believed that the cigarette was laced with scopolamine, a drug so dangerous that even Vice once called it ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs scariest.‚Äù Jacob started fading in and out, and the driver asked for his phone ‚Äúfor directions.‚Äù He got confused and gave it along with the passcodes. He vaguely recalls the driver scrolling through apps. By the time he realized what was happening, it was already too late. The driver accessed his crypto apps, including Revolut and reportedly drained everything. He woke up in a random London suburb where a stranger called him a cab back to his hostel. He finally grabbed his laptop to find out that it had been remotely wiped. Jacob said, ‚ÄúThey took the majority of my wealth,‚Äù and believes there‚Äôs ‚Äúless than a 1% chance‚Äù of recovery. Authorities confirmed the attacker accessed his wallets through Revolut , using a forced login. Jacob‚Äôs losses included $72,000 in XRP, around $50,000 in Bitcoin, and a handful of smaller altcoin positions. Altogether, $123,000 vanished, his life savings, built from teenage Bitcoin investments, drained in minutes. London crypto heist The attack fits the definition of a ‚Äúwrench attack,‚Äù where no hacking is needed. Just physical coercion, social engineering, and in this case, a sedative. Jacob doesn‚Äôt believe he was targeted for his wealth. He thinks the thief got lucky. Jacob says he has a good idea where the stolen crypto ended up‚Äîbut without insurance, and with most of it in cold wallets, recovery is ‚Äúvirtually impossible.‚Äù He‚Äôs now working with the FBI‚Äôs Virtual Assets Unit. Jacob is an early crypto investor. ‚ÄúI was investing in crypto before anyone. I was really into it in high school before Bitcoin was $1,000,‚Äù he added. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $106,576 with a trading volume of $54 billion. BTC knocked off its all-time high (ATH) of above $109K on January 20, 2025. It holds a market cap of around $2.11 trillion. On the other hand, XRP price has seen its biggest rally after Ripple bagged a partial win in the legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP is trading at an average price of $2.34 as of press time.

At $167, SOL is now down by 6.5% in a week, but the alt remains up by 13% in a fortnight and by 20% in a month. And while yesterday‚Äôs news may come as a disappointment for some holders, for others it wasn‚Äôt surprising, with the SEC still having a final deadline in October for most of the ETFs. Given Solana‚Äôs stature as the second-biggest layer-one after Ethereum, it has every chance of witnessing ETF approvals later in the year, something which could send its long-term price prediction sky high. Solana Price Prediction: ETF Delays Raise Red Flags ‚Äì Is a Drop Below $100 Coming? It‚Äôs not the first time that the SEC has delayed making a decision on spot-based Solana ETFs, with the regulator doing the same back in March . This is why yesterday‚Äôs delay has not had a particularly negative impact on Solana‚Äôs price, which is actually more than 40% up where it was on March 11, when the SEC delayed decisions on the 21Shares, Canary and VanEck Solana ETFs. SEC just delayed ALL Solana ETF applications from Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary, citing market manipulation concerns. They're ""instituting proceedings"" to review if the SOL ETFs meet Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) standards for investor protection. pic.twitter.com/IxGPjWfC0a ‚Äî NeomaVentures (@NeomaVentures) May 20, 2025 This time, the SEC has added the Bitwise Solana ETF to the above list of re-delays, following last week‚Äôs delay for the Grayscale SOL ETF . It‚Äôs entirely arguable that such delays are routine, given that the regulator dragged its feet for years on Bitcoin ETFs, before approving the first batch last year. As such, Solana holders needn‚Äôt be too concerned, with the coin‚Äôs chart today showing that the coin remains on an upwards curve. Its relative strength index (purple) has been climbing since early April, and given how long it was below 50, it still has time to remain in an elevated, bullish position. Source: TradingView Indeed, SOL‚Äôs 30-day average (orange) also points to ongoing gains, seeing as how it‚Äôs about to climb over the 20-day (blue) and form a golden cross. We could therefore see several more weeks of sustained rallies for the Solana price, despite the SEC delaying over ETFs. This is partly because the market as a whole is recovering in the face of an improved tariff situation, but also because Solana remains one of the strongest alts in the market in terms of fundamentals. It boasts a total value locked of $9.2 billion , making it the second-biggest layer-one network in the crypto ecosystem. The Solana price could therefore reach $200 in the next few weeks, before topping $300 by Q4. A New Solana-Based Token for Big Gains Solana has also been the home of several hugely successful meme tokens in the past year or so, yet there‚Äôs one new Solana-based token that will bring rock-solid fundamentals when it launches in the next month. This is Solaxy (SOLX) , which has the distinction of being Solana‚Äôs first layer-two network. SOLX has raised $38.5 million in its presale, which will now end in 26 days. We‚Äôre going interstellar! 38M Raised! pic.twitter.com/udfUBJ0GBC ‚Äî SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 20, 2025 This figure makes Solaxy‚Äôs sale one of the biggest of the past few years, while another sign of its popularity comes from its follower count on X , which now numbers over 75,000. This suggests that Solaxy has plenty of momentum behind it, with the platform promising to provide ultra-low transaction fees and ultra-fast confirmation times once it launches. It will enable traders to avoid the delays and congestion that can still affect Solana, even after recent upgrades. It will also provide instant bridging between itself and Solana, making for a seamless experience for traders and DeFi users alike. Holders of SOLX will also be able to stake the token for passive income, and given that you will need SOLX to pay for Solaxy‚Äôs transaction fees, demand for the token could be very high. You can still buy it as part of its presale at the Solaxy website , where it now costs $0.00173. As noted above, the sale will end in 26 days, at which point the token will list on exchanges, and potentially rally.

According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy‚Äôs crypto decisioning tools and ‚Äúleverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.‚Äù The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. ‚ÄúAddress poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,‚Äù said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa. Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and Webacy Crypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target‚Äôs real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker‚Äôs address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds. The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million. Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them? Web2 security in a Web3 world Trugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O‚ÄôConnor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they‚Äôve been ‚Äúapplying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.‚Äù The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added: ‚ÄúMost existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.‚Äú The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O‚ÄôConnor highlighted that what sets their system apart is ‚Äúits emphasis on context and pattern recognition.‚Äù Isogawa explained that ‚ÄúAI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.‚Äù Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacks The machine learning approach O‚ÄôConnor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output. In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction. O‚ÄôConnor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. ‚ÄúTo top it off, we‚Äôve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.‚Äú Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-21 14:00:55

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said he did not like Bitcoin but understood that customers deserve the right to choose which assets they invest in. The remarks by Dimon come at a JPMorgan investor day event, which aims to promote the bank and champion its progress. JPMorgan has a market cap of $740 billion, making it the largest bank in the world. JPMorgan manages over $4 trillion in assets, adding to its reputation and pride when dealing with investment preferences. Dimon has a history of disparaging Bitcoin, calling it a fraud , and during a Senate hearing with Elizabeth Warren, saying that he would close it down if he were in charge . Such statements, however, could not stop the tide of history, with many investors demanding that JPMorgan let them buy Bitcoin. Despite its CEO disparaging Bitcoin, JPMorgan will release a managed fund for Bitcoin investors. JPMorgan will actively manage the fund, but will not maintain custody of a Bitcoin wallet. The mega bank seems to be the least likely institution to embrace Bitcoin, given the comments made by its CEO. The new Bitcoin fund will be released this summer. The custody of cryptocurrencies will be outsourced to NYDIG, a crypto company. JPMorgan will actively manage the Bitcoin fund, a new development because many fund managers like Pantera Capital allow clients to invest in Bitcoin without handling it themselves. Dimon has been very vocal about his criticism of Bitcoin, even going so far as to say that he would fire any JPMorgan employee who traded the digital asset. He said that the act of trading Bitcoin was ‚Äústupid‚Äù and noted that Bitcoin has no ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù, which most likely refers to the fact that Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt have cash flows. However, Bitcoin is an unprecedented financial innovation. Dimon also said that criminals use Bitcoin. However, fiat currency is still the preferred medium for crime. JPMorgan, meanwhile, is investing in blockchain technology, executing its first transaction on a public blockchain last week. Dimon, meanwhile, is more concerned about the economy. He says that the risk of stagflation is most likely two times the amount factored in by the market. Dimon believes that stagflation will cause many problems for banks and companies. Dimon has both positive and negative things to say about Trump‚Äôs administration. He praises regulatory efforts and states that there is a clear motive to fix problems in that area. But he also points out that JPMorgan has lost a lot of business due to Trump‚Äôs tariff war. Dimon seems to flip-flop on his attitude towards Bitcoin. The JPMorgan CEO said he thinks blockchain is overrated and less important than people think. This recent statement during his speech this week contrasts with his previous comments about blockchain, where he has treated blockchain innovation separately from Bitcoin and even supported practical blockchain projects. Regardless of Dimon‚Äôs remarks, JPMorgan ran its first transaction on a public blockchain last week and has its own blockchain-based JPM coin.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|JPMorgan,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 14:00:59

A US tourist has claimed a fake Uber driver stole $123,000 worth of cryptocurrency from him after he was spotted out in London. An American tourist claimed he was kidnapped and drugged by a fake Uber driver in London and then had $123,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP stolen, local news agency MyLondon reported. According to the report, an American tourist who was partying at a nightclub in London booked an Uber to return home but got into the car of a fake Uber driver instead of the one shown on the Uber app. Afterwards, the American tourist claimed that the fake Uber driver gave him a cigarette after getting into the car, that the cigarette contained drugs, that he was drugged and kidnapped with the cigarette, and that he stole BTC and XRP from his account. According to Turist, the fake Uber driver stole $72,000 worth of XRP and $50,000 worth of Bitcoin from his crypto account. The incident was reported to the police, but no one has been caught yet. This incident serves as a reminder to everyone to keep their cryptocurrencies safe, as crypto crimes are on the rise worldwide. *This is not investment advice.

Key technical signals point to strong bullish momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the verge of making history again as it approaches a new all-time high. After months of bearish structure defined by the 21 EMA, a major shift has taken place. A recent breakout above this level flipped market sentiment, creating a strong foundation for higher prices. With the price structure now showing clear signs of strength, a new ATH could be just around the corner, potentially within the week. Key technical points 21 EMA Flip: The 21 exponential moving average, which previously acted as resistance, is now confirmed support. Bullish Market Structure: Bitcoin has formed consistent higher highs and higher lows. Key Support Level: $102,790 is the critical support to maintain current bullish momentum. BTCUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Following the previous all-time high, Bitcoin entered a corrective phase, where price action was consistently rejected at the 21 EMA. This moving average defined the bearish structure, acting as dynamic resistance and leading to repeated pullbacks. However, once the swing low was established at $74,448, a significant surge in volume triggered a strong bullish reaction. This breakout was marked by bullish engulfing candles and a clear flip of the 21 EMA into support, a technical event that signaled the end of the bearish trend. Since then, Bitcoin has continued to respect the 21 EMA, bouncing off it to form new higher highs and higher lows, the textbook definition of a bullish market structure. The shift in momentum has also been supported by an uptick in trading volume and positive funding rates across major derivatives exchanges. These metrics reflect growing confidence among market participants, suggesting that institutional and retail investors alike are positioning for further upside as Bitcoin approaches price discovery territory. You might also like: Bonk price could slump soon as whales, smart money dump tokens The current key level to monitor is $102,790. As long as Bitcoin holds above this support, the upward trend remains intact. The consistency in structure and momentum suggests that a new ATH is not just possible but likely, especially with only 3% separating price from its previous peak. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin maintains support at $102,790, a breakout to new all-time highs could occur as early as this week. The strong bullish market structure and momentum-driven rally suggest that buyers are in control, and the stage is set for continued upside.

Wall Street‚Äôs biggest regulator said in Tuesday filings that it had extended its review period for the 21Shares Core XRP Trust, the Grayscale XRP Trust, and the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. The SEC suspended the original May 21-22 decision deadlines to further examine whether the proposals satisfy Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) requirements for preventing fraud and protecting investors. Cboe and NYSE, where the 21Shares and Grayscale funds would be listed, respectively, submitted their requests for rule changes earlier this year. The 21Shares Core XRP Trust plans to track the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, with Coinbase Custody providing storage for the assets. Grayscale‚Äôs Dogecoin Trust would track CoinDesk‚Äôs Dogecoin Price Index, while its XRP Trust would follow CoinDesk‚Äôs XRP Price Index. Dogecoin is the world‚Äôs oldest and largest memecoin, with a market capitalization of around $33.7 billion as of May 21, according to data from CoinGecko. XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger blockchain network. It has a market capitalization of approximately $138 billion, CoinGecko data shows. ‚ÄúInstitution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change,‚Äù the SEC wrote. Delays Are Expected The SEC has postponed decisions on a bevy of crypto ETF proposals in recent months as it mulls dozens of proposals, despite the Commission under the Trump administration adopting a friendlier approach to digital assets. Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the SEC has dismissed several enforcement cases against crypto firms, and the commission‚Äôs crypto task force has met with reps of several companies in recent months as part of efforts to explore potential changes to digital asset regulation. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, SEC delays on spot crypto ETFs are to be expected. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets ‚Äî I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see them until late June or early July at the absolute earliest. More likely to be in early Q4,‚Äù Seyffart wrote in a May 20 post on X. Seyffart pointed out that the SEC usually takes advantage of the full time allotted to respond, no matter who is in charge at the SEC. ‚ÄúAlmost all of these filings have final due dates in October.

The company disclosed the scope of the attack in a filing with the Maine Attorney General‚Äôs Office on Tuesday, weeks after confirming that cybercriminals demanded a $20 million ransom to prevent the stolen data from being released on the dark web. The hack reportedly affected less than 1% of the company‚Äôs global user base, but has triggered multiple federal investigations and multiple lawsuits over how it handled the attack. Bribery and social engineering led to the breach According to the company and individuals familiar with the matter, attackers employed social engineering techniques to infiltrate Coinbase‚Äôs internal systems. The perpetrators targeted people working for the crypto exchange, specifically customer service agents working outside the United States, instead of exploiting technical vulnerabilities. Coinbase alleged that the representatives, based in India, were bribed with cash in exchange for access to internal tools and client information. The compromised data includes names, addresses, nationalities, government-issued ID numbers, birth dates, and banking information. The attackers also accessed account creation dates, user balances, and other know-your-customer (KYC) details . Coinbase did confirm that passwords, private keys, and user funds were not affected, but cybersecurity sleuths and users are worried they might use the information in identity theft and impersonation. Rebuked ransom demand and regulatory response Coinbase reported that it first received a ransom demand via anonymous email on May 11, several months after the data was initially exfiltrated, on December 26. The criminals threatened the crypto exchange that they would publish the stolen information on the dark web unless the company paid $20 million. In its public filing, Coinbase disclosed that the attackers had already begun collecting user data by exploiting foreign-based support agents in the months leading up to the ransom note. All personnel implicated in the breach have since been terminated. Washington, DC, authorities are looking into the hack as part of a criminal probe that the US Department of Justice initiated. Coinbase has maintained its stance of full cooperation with all relevant domestic and foreign law enforcement authorities. Criticism over delayed disclosure On Tuesday, American investor and founder of TechCrunch Michael Arrington denounced the company‚Äôs delay in informing the public. On social media platform X, Arrington told his followers that the human cost that could follow such a leak of personal data is ‚Äúdenominated in misery.‚Äù ‚Äú It probably has already caused harm ,‚Äù Arrington explained. ‚Äú The human cost is much larger than the $400 million or so they think it will actually cost the company to reimburse people .‚Äù Arrington used the incident to criticize the existing KYC regulations, calling them both ineffective and dangerous. He argued that these laws, when coupled with corporate cost-cutting and lenient penalties for data breaches, create conditions ripe for abuse. ‚ÄúBoth governments and corporations need to step up to stop this. The cost can only be measured in human suffering,‚Äù he concluded. I am a long time investor in and champion of @coinbase . Something that has to be said though ‚Äì this hack ‚Äì which includes home addresses and account balances ‚Äì will lead to people dying. It probably has already.

Monero ( XMR ) has rallied for seven consecutive weeks as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins stalled. It jumped to a high of $367.67 this week, its highest level since May 17, up by 265% from its lowest level in 2024. Monero gained momentum following the Tornado Cash ( TORN ) court ruling and the eventual lifting of U.S. government sanctions , which drove investors back to privacy coins. One hope is that centralized exchanges that previously delisted it, like Binance and Coinbase, will relist it this year. Additionally, the Donald Trump administration is composed of pro-crypto officials, including Paul Atkins, the head of the SEC.

A falling hash rate indicates reduced mining activity in the network. XMR price technical analysis XMR price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the XMR price has been in a strong bullish trend over the past few weeks. This rebound followed a prolonged period in which the coin remained between the support and resistance levels at $134.42 and $186.18 for over two years. This consolidation was likely part of the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. It has now moved into the markup phase, which is characterized by higher demand than supply. Monero has moved above all moving averages. Additionally, the Average Directional Index has risen to 25, a sign that the trend is strengthening. The Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have both reached overbought territory. Therefore, the coin will likely keep soaring as bulls target the all-time high of $515, which is about 40% above the current level. An alternative scenario is that it drops to retest the support at $200 before resuming the uptrend.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $108,010 during the ongoing session before dropping to its current level of $106,488. BTC‚Äôs price jump has seen it break out of its consolidation phase, during which it traded between $100,000 and $105,000. Strive Looking To Acquire 75,000 Bitcoin From Mt. Gox Claims Vivek Ramaswamy‚Äôs Strive plans to build its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing distressed Bitcoin claims at a significant discount. The firm plans to purchase 75,000 Bitcoin from claims tied to the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. In a May 20 regulatory filing, Strive stated that it has partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target claims to Bitcoin that have received definitive legal rulings but are awaiting distribution. According to company representatives, buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities. The firm has not disclosed any Bitcoin holdings but claims it faces fewer restrictions on purchasing Bitcoin than companies going public through Special Purpose Acquisition Company mergers. Strive also stated it requires shareholder approval to pursue Mt. Gox claims and plans to lodge a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to outline the complete terms of the proposed transaction. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig, Beautiful‚Äù Bill Could Be Bullish For Bitcoin President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbig beautiful‚Äù bill is set to become law, extending the 2017 tax cuts, while introducing new tax measures, including a $1,000 tax credit for all children born in the country and an exemption for tips. The bill also raises the estate tax exemption to $15 million. The bill could be bullish for Bitcoin and other altcoins for several reasons. First, it is expected to increase the US public debt and deficit. According to estimates by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the bill could raise the public debt by $3.3 trillion over the next ten years and push the debt-to-GDP ratio from 100% to 125%. Rising risks of a government default are viewed as bullish for Bitcoin , which has enhanced its reputation as a safe-haven asset. Standard Chartered Predicts $500,000 Milestone For Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $108,000 as Standard Chartered‚Äôs Geoffrey Kendrick reaffirmed the bank‚Äôs prediction that the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $500,000 by 2029, citing government and institutional exposure. Kendrick highlighted the spike in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Q1 13F data, which indicated a rise in government and institutional exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúThe quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 target level.‚Äù Kendrick pointed out that ETF exposure among these institutions declined in Q1 as companies began gaining exposure to Bitcoin through Strategy shares. ‚ÄúWe believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings.‚Äù The growing interest in Bitcoin can be attributed to declining confidence in government bonds thanks to macroeconomic factors. A research note by KKR & Co stated, ‚ÄúDuring risk-off days, government bonds are no longer fulfilling their role as the 'shock-absorbers' in a traditional portfolio.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) shrugged off a slow start to the week to register a strong recovery on Tuesday, briefly crossing $107,313 before settling at $106,855. The flagship cryptocurrency also crossed $108,000 during the ongoing session before declining to current levels. BTC‚Äôs jump above $105,000 has been fueled by several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Investors have lost confidence in traditional financial systems, while cooling trade war tensions and tariff concerns have fueled a risk-on sentiment, pushing investors towards risk assets. Persistent inflation has eroded purchasing power, while the Federal Reserve‚Äôs cautious stance has kept real yields on the higher side. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also registered steady inflows, indicating a resurgence in institutional interest. BTC started the previous week in the red after encountering selling pressure and volatility. Sellers ultimately pushed the price down over 1% to $102,728. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123. BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, registering a drop of 0.53% to $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified.

Kaanch one of the Best Crypto to Buy,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/powells-stablecoin-warning-is-a-wake-up-call-for-the-crypto-industry/,"The post Jerome Powell‚Äôs Push for Digital Dollar Sparks Stablecoin Surge. Kaanch one of the Best Crypto to Buy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently reignited the digital dollar debate, signaling a deeper commitment to regulating stablecoins and exploring a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) . As this announcement spreads across financial headlines, one effect is already crystal clear‚Äîdemand for regulation-ready crypto infrastructure is surging. This is not a retail moment. This is an institutional one. And for builders and investors watching closely, one blockchain stands out for all the right reasons. Kaanch Network , a next-generation Layer 1 designed specifically for real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation and compliance, is gaining momentum as the best crypto to buy now before regulatory frameworks fully land. Join the live presale here Powell‚Äôs Stablecoin Warning Is a Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Industry During his testimony, Powell stressed that stablecoins must be subject to robust federal oversight . He emphasized the Fed‚Äôs ongoing work in evaluating the role of CBDCs and stated that the ‚Äúneed for a digital dollar hinges on regulatory outcomes.‚Äù That statement has two implications. First, that compliance-ready infrastructure will be non-negotiable . Second, that blockchains capable of supporting identity, auditing, and regulated financial products will be critical. Kaanch Network is built precisely for that moment. It is not retrofitting for regulation ‚Äî it was designed from day one to power digital asset systems in both public and institutional markets. Why Kaanch Network Checks Every Regulatory and RWA Box Kaanch is not another general-purpose smart contract chain. It is purpose-built for compliant on-chain finance. That includes the infrastructure for tokenized real estate, bonds, and even digital identity systems that tie directly into on-chain transactions. Its technical stack includes: 1.4 Million Transactions Per Second to process asset flows, stablecoin payments, and trading volume at scale 0.8 Second Finality for instant, verifiable transactions 3600 Active Validators offering decentralization, auditability, and resilience .knch Domains to provide on-chain identity solutions and verifiable naming RWA Tokenization Layer with smart contract templates for real estate, bonds, and certified documents Cross-Chain Bridges to interact seamlessly with Ethereum, Solana, and BNB DAO Governance with public voting and treasury control Staking Live Now with up to 119% APY for early investors Explore the staking dashboard at Kaanch Presale Stablecoin Legislation Aligns with Kaanch‚Äôs Architecture As stablecoin bills like the Stablecoin TRUST Act move closer to becoming law, one key requirement is becoming universal: any issuer must use blockchains that offer full traceability, secure identity tagging, and consistent on-chain monitoring. This means the chains that will win in the regulated era are not those promising anonymity. They are the ones that offer high speed, identity-native features, and transparent governance. Kaanch is not only fast and scalable, but its .knch identity system allows wallet names and entities to be verifiable across use cases, including financial services, DeFi, or government-integrated smart contracts. This is the infrastructure layer regulators want ‚Äî and investors are starting to notice. Why Investors Are Loading Up on Kaanch Early-stage infrastructure is where long-term value lives. Kaanch is currently in Stage 5 of its public presale at a price of $0.16 per token . The next pricing stage will raise that to $0.32 , effectively doubling the cost of entry. Already, over $1.12 million has been raised from early supporters who understand where the market is heading. Presale highlights: Token Price: 0.16 USD Next Price: 0.32 USD Payment Options: ETH, SOL, BNB, USDT, or credit card Staking Yield: Up to 119% APY Public Team and TOKEN2049 Dubai Presence Ecosystem spans DeFi, AI, RWA, and digital identity Secure your tokens here before the next price jump Kaanch Is Built for Global Finance, Not Speculation What makes Kaanch unique is that it was designed for the intersection of real-world institutions and blockchain . While other chains chase hype cycles, Kaanch delivers tools that governments, banks, fintech companies, and compliant dApps will need to succeed in a regulated future. As global interest in tokenized assets surges, from UAE digital bonds to EU MiCA frameworks , Kaanch is already running in parallel ‚Äî offering what those markets require. Final Word Kaanch Network is delivering what the next generation of blockchain applications require. It brings speed, scalability, identity, interoperability, and governance into a single system that is ready for global use. Whether you are an investor seeking early exposure or a builder looking for long-term infrastructure, Kaanch is the top crypto to watch now . Presale is live. Infrastructure is functional.

Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan‚Äôs SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $4.96 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is under bearish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. Moreover, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price decreased to $0.803 shedding 1.37% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.31 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2030. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts‚Äô price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don‚Äôt expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.69, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.69 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token‚Äôs price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range.

With a full-blown bull run just around the corner, the Shiba Inu coin, the Cardano coin and Unilabs (UNIL) are three low-cap coins that whales are betting on. SHIB, the leading ETH memecoin, is expected to surpass the previous cycle‚Äôs peak‚Äîone of the best cryptos to buy. Another altcoin below $1 on whales‚Äô radars is ADA, a leading Layer-1 coin with significant upside. UNIL, the world‚Äôs first AI-backed DeFi asset manager, is another favorite. Currently in presale and with staggering upside as a low-cap coin, it is among the best AI coins to buy now. Unilabs (UNIL): Why it is Among the Best AI Cryptos to Invest In As the world‚Äôs first AI-backed DeFi asset manager, Unilabs (UNIL) outlook is promising. As of Q2 2025, it has over $30 million in AUM (assets under management), poised to overtake conventional asset management platforms. With whales doubling down on the ongoing UNIL presale amid talks of its potential outperformance of the Shiba Inu coin and Cardano coin, early funding has surpassed $670,000. Earlier, it was mentioned how this fund has over $30 million in AUM. These assets are securely held in cold storage for optimal safety; the protocol‚Äôs AUM also reflects disciplined capital allocation across 4 flagship funds: BTC Fund, RWA Fund, Mining Fund and AI Fund. This approach targets diversified exposure within the DeFi scene, assisting retail traders to maximize returns in the volatile digital asset landscape. With the token price expected to hit $0.0062 in the third stage, whales have been buying at a discount at $0.0051 in the second ICO round. As a low-cap coin, UNIL‚Äôs growth prospects likely rival top crypto coins. That isn‚Äôt all. Its blend of DeFi and TradFi‚Äîa decentralized hedge fund manager powered by AI‚Äîadds to its bullish outlook. Shiba Inu (SHIB): 18% Uptick On the Monthly Chart Retailing above $0.000014, the Shiba Inu coin soared past the 30-EMA and 30-SMA. It registered a monthly gain of 18%, suggesting a shift in market structure. With further upswings on the cards amid an overall market rally and rising adoption of Shibarium, its Layer-2 network, the SHIB price is poised to explode. Meanwhile, Satoshi_Coin, a crypto analyst on X, identifies a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, targeting $0.00016 and $0.000018. Another optimistic Shiba Inu coin price prediction is by LucieSHIB‚Äîa potential rally toward $0.000081. While the above points to Shiba Inu (SHIB) being a top crypto to buy, it might not be the best DeFi token to invest in. With a deep AI integration, not to mention its intersection with traditional finance, Unilabs is fundamentally solid and boasts higher upside. Cardano (ADA): Analysts Eye $4 While down over 70% from its 2021 all-time high of $3.10, the Cardano coin could register a new peak this cycle. It changes hands around $0.74 following a 15% jump in price on the monthly chart, trading alongside the broader crypto market. At the same time, technical indicators like the 9-HMA and Bull Bear Power add to its bullish outlook. Also worth mentioning are the bold Cardano coin price predictions making the rounds, boosting investor confidence. Michael Heckert, a top analyst and trader, hints at ADA hitting $2 this cycle‚Äîa good crypto to buy. Icewallowcrypto, another leading expert on X, sees the Cardano coin price hitting $4, which many believe to be modest. Nevertheless, as a large-cap token‚Äîa top 10 cryptocurrency‚Äîits substantial market size leaves little room to run. In contrast, Unilabs, a novel AI-backed DeFi asset manager, has staggering upside as a new DeFi project. Unilabs (UNIL): Undervalued Crypto Pick Alongside Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Without breaking the bank, pocket-friendly altcoins below $1 to bet on, which whales are also accumulating, are Unilabs, ADA and SHIB. This new AI coin, UNIL, is a top pick for its small market size and upside potential, tipped to flip the Cardano price and SHIB price.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold. Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is ‚Äúnow back in an unrealized profit,‚Äù according to Glassnode. Ethereum trades above its cost basis Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether‚Äôs ( ETH ) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade . This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher . ETH holders returning to profit after unrealized losses ‚Äúprovides meaningful financial relief for many holders, signaling a bullish outlook,‚Äù Glassnode explained in its latest report. Historically, during the early phase of a rally, holders in profit provided upward momentum by holding firm and attracting new investors. Further analysis of the cost basis of active market participants indicated the ‚Äústrength of this upward move‚Äù as the price moved above its True Market Mean, or the Active-Investor Price, at $2,400. This indicates fresh capital inflows into the market at higher prices. As Cointelegraph reported , holding above $2,400 was crucial to ensure a potential $3,000 retest. Ethereum: Key pricing levels. Source: Glassnode Despite Ether‚Äôs recent outperformance, Glassnode analysts noted that the Active Realized Price still sits overhead around $2,900 and remains a key level that must be ‚Äúdecisively reclaimed to support continued improvement in investor confidence‚Äù in the altcoin. The market intelligence firm added: ‚ÄúThe $2,400‚Äì$2,900 range remains a crucial area for Ethereum, acting as both a resistance zone and a potential breakout level essential for maintaining upward momentum.‚Äù Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades also said that ETH price must ‚Äúconvincingly break‚Äù out of the $2,400-$2,600 range before rising higher to confront high-timeframe resistance between $2,800 and $2,850. ‚ÄúNot looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range. ETH/USD four-hour chart. Source: Daan Crypto Trades 2.27 million ETH at $2,800 could trigger a sell-off According to Ether‚Äôs cost basis distribution data , investors hold approximately 2.27 million ETH at an average cost basis of $2,767, creating a potential resistance zone. This concentration suggests many investors may sell at break-even, potentially stalling Ether‚Äôs upward momentum. Ethereum cost basis distribution chart. Source: Glassnode From a technical perspective, ETH must flip the $3,000 resistance level into support to target higher highs above $4,000. But first, the ETH/USD pair must close above the $2,600-$2,800 range, where the 100-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) currently sit. ETH price dropped below this level in February, driven by risk-off sentiment following Trump‚Äôs tariff measures . ETH/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView ‚Äã‚ÄãOne positive catalyst for the bulls could be continued demand from spot Ethereum ETFs. Ether ETFs registered $100.7 million in net inflows in the last three days, per Farside Investors‚Äô data. Meanwhile, the bears will attempt to keep the $2,600 resistance in place to increase the likelihood of pulling the price lower. The immediate target is below the $2,400 level, or the 200-day SMA. Below $2,400, the next key area of interest remains between $2,200 and the psychological level at $2,000. Reaching $1,800 would erase all the gains made after the Pectra upgrade .

According to insights shared by digital asset commentator Amelie on X, citing a report from Whale Insider, the XRPL is witnessing a sharp rise in institutional activity, with the surge being driven further by a series of impactful partnerships and acquisitions. A newly published report by crypto intelligence firm Messari reinforces this outlook, signaling that the XRPL is at a pivotal inflection point in its evolution from a fast payment protocol to a full-scale, institutionally backed financial infrastructure. WOW! #XRP LEDGER PRIMED FOR FURTHER GROWTH IN Q2 AS INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION INCREASES! pic.twitter.com/tbl5jitTld ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 20, 2025 Institutional Adoption Driving XRPL‚Äôs Core Growth The most striking takeaway from the Messari report is the notable acceleration in institutional onboarding across the XRP Ledger ecosystem . Ripple‚Äôs longstanding focus on compliance, interoperability, and enterprise utility is now translating into tangible growth in financial sector integrations. Institutions across North America, Asia, and Europe are increasingly turning to XRPL for its low transaction costs, rapid settlement speeds, and energy-efficient consensus mechanism. With RippleNet‚Äôs global footprint continuing to expand, banks and payment firms are capitalizing on the XRPL‚Äôs ability to facilitate near-instant cross-border settlements. Notably, many pilot programs initiated in 2024, particularly those focused on real-time gross settlement, stablecoin issuance, and tokenized treasury solutions, have now transitioned into full-scale implementations. Messari‚Äôs report points to a 37% quarter-over-quarter increase in institutional transactions across the ledger, suggesting a clear shift in enterprise behavior as blockchain adoption matures. The introduction of a Ripple-native stablecoin is expected to enhance liquidity within the XRPL, especially in corridors where fiat onramps are limited or inefficient, further attracting banks and fintechs seeking predictable, scalable solutions for digital asset settlements. Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions Strengthen Ecosystem Infrastructure Alongside institutional interest, strategic corporate actions are strengthening the XRPL‚Äôs technological and operational base. Messari highlights several key developments that are already reshaping the ledger‚Äôs value proposition. Chief among them is Ripple‚Äôs acquisition of Metaco, a Switzerland-based institutional digital asset custody firm. Since the acquisition in 2023, Metaco‚Äôs secure custody services have been integrated into Ripple‚Äôs suite of offerings, enabling banks, asset managers, and other financial institutions to manage tokenized assets with full regulatory assurance. Moreover, Ripple‚Äôs expanding global partnerships are enhancing the interoperability of the XRPL. A recent collaboration with Axelar has unlocked cross-chain communication capabilities, allowing value and data to move seamlessly between XRPL and major networks like Ethereum and Cosmos. These cross-chain bridges are critical as financial institutions begin to explore multi-chain deployment strategies, ensuring that the XRPL remains compatible with emerging standards in tokenized finance. Another key highlight is the progress of the XRPL EVM sidechain, developed by Peersyst Technology. Nearing mainnet deployment, this sidechain will provide full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts, allowing developers to build on XRPL using Solidity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Messari‚Äôs report identifies this as a major inflection point for attracting decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, NFT platforms, and real-world asset tokenization ventures that have previously built exclusively on EVM-compatible chains. Developer Ecosystem and Global Footprint Expand Fueling XRPL‚Äôs growth narrative is a flourishing developer ecosystem supported by RippleX‚Äôs grant programs, hackathons, and open-source initiatives. Messari notes a surge in new XRPL-based projects emerging from regions including Southeast Asia , Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äîmarkets that are increasingly seen as hotbeds for financial innovation. Over 1,200 project proposals have been submitted through the XRPL Grants Program since Q1, with a sharp uptick in real-world use cases ranging from decentralized identity solutions to blockchain-based agricultural finance systems. As more developers gain access to XRPL‚Äôs robust and well-documented APIs, as well as advanced features like the XLS-20 NFT standard and the Hooks amendment for custom on-ledger logic, the network‚Äôs utility is broadening far beyond payments. This steady influx of developer activity is not only increasing on-chain transaction volume but also fostering a more vibrant and diverse application ecosystem. Legal Clarity and Market Confidence Continue to Grow One of the most enduring advantages of the XRP Ledger in 2025 is the regulatory clarity surrounding its native asset, XRP. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on secondary markets‚Äîa precedent-setting decision that effectively cleared a major hurdle for Ripple and the wider XRPL ecosystem. That clarity has emboldened U.S.-based firms to integrate XRP and XRPL into their operations without fear of regulatory reprisals, a privilege few other blockchains currently enjoy. Messari‚Äôs report confirms that legal certainty has translated into market confidence. Institutional investors, particularly in the United States, are gradually shifting allocations toward digital assets with a cleaner compliance profile. This trend is reflected in a 52% increase in institutional XRP holdings across regulated platforms over the past two quarters, alongside a growing list of fintech startups building natively on XRPL. A Defining Quarter Ahead for the XRPL All indicators suggest that Q2 2025 will be a defining chapter for the XRP Ledger. With institutional adoption rising, strategic acquisitions bolstering infrastructure, cross-chain interoperability unlocking new capabilities, and legal clarity attracting cautious capital, the XRPL is emerging as a foundational layer for the future of digital finance. As Amelie emphasized in her post, the latest Messari report does more than forecast growth‚Äîit affirms that the XRPL is no longer just an alternative blockchain, but a central player in the global conversation about blockchain utility, compliance, and scalability. For XRP holders, developers, and institutional adopters alike, the months ahead promise continued momentum‚Äîand potentially, a new era of enterprise-grade blockchain adoption.

The heightened positive correlation during market volatility implies that bitcoin is exhibiting equity-like behavior. Higher positive correlations are frequently observed during periods of market stress. By Dr. Mark Shore At a Glance The correlation between bitcoin and equities has evolved from non-correlated to a positive correlation since 2020 The heightened positive correlation during market volatility implies that bitcoin is exhibiting equity-like behavior In its early years, bitcoin was considered a diversifier in a portfolio, often compared to digital gold and even thought of as an inflation hedge. Even so, bitcoin did not have any meaningful ties with equities. In 2020, a significant shift occurred. The relationship between bitcoin and equities turned positive and has remained so over the past five years. What has changed? Daily returns data from January 2014 to April 2025 reveal a correlation of 0.2 between bitcoin and major equity indices. However, when examined in smaller time frames, the relationship becomes more pronounced. In 2020, the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indices shifted from being non-correlated to a positive relationship, with rolling correlations jumping to about 0.5. The positive correlation is not limited to a single index. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 show very similar patterns, indicating that the trend is widespread across the equities market. This suggests that bitcoin's performance is now more closely tied to the broader economic and market conditions. Higher positive correlations are frequently observed during periods of market stress. For example, from February to March 2020 ‚Äì during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic ‚Äì and again in 2022, from July to October 2023 and from January to early April 2025. These periods of market uncertainty have seen bitcoin and equities move in the same direction, reflecting a risk-off sentiment that is common to both asset classes. Box and Whisker plots from 2017 to 2019 show medians near zero, indicating a lack of correlation between bitcoin and equities. However, from 2020 to 2022, the medians range just above 0.4, highlighting the significant shift in the relationship. There are five seemingly common factors between equities and bitcoin that may be contributing to this positive correlation. Institutional Acceptance: The growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by institutions and the financial community has been a key driver. This has led to a continuous momentum of future allocations to digital assets, making bitcoin a more mainstream investment. Portfolio Integration: As more users integrate crypto into their portfolios, they often do so alongside traditional investments. This dual investment strategy can lead to similar market movements, especially during times of economic uncertainty. High Volatility: Bitcoin's daily standard deviation is roughly three to five times higher than that of equities. This high volatility suggests that bitcoin may now serve as a beta extension of a portfolio's equity exposure, amplifying market movements. Supply and Holding Patterns: The reduction in bitcoin supply held at exchanges, as more and the concurrent rise in supply held by other entities, such as institutional investors and long-term holders, indicates a maturing market. This shift in supply dynamics can influence price movements and correlations. Increased Access: The rise of ETFs, futures and options has made it easier for investors to access and trade cryptocurrencies. The growth in open interest and trading volume in crypto derivatives is evidence of increased acceptance and integration into the broader financial ecosystem.

Despite a minor 2.6% dip in the past 24 hours, Kaspa has gained approximately 32% over the last two weeks. The uptick coincides with a marked increase in network activity, drawing fresh attention from its community. According to CoinMarketCap‚Äôs Crypto Community Sentiment indicator, Kaspa ranks as the fourth most bullish cryptocurrency among the top 100, with over 93% of users expressing positive sentiment.

Over the last three months, the number of addresses in the top 25% of $KAS holders has increased by around 6,000, reaching approximately 179,000. Kaspa Price Prediction: Can $KAS Break $0.12 and Target the $0.14‚Äì$0.16 Range? Kaspa ($KAS/$USDT) is showing signs of a potential bullish reversal following a prolonged downtrend that began in late 2024. The asset is currently trading at $0.1112 and is attempting to break through a key resistance zone formed by the Fibonacci fan levels. A potential double bottom pattern is visible on the chart, formed by two rounded lows in March and April near $0.065. After breaking above the neckline at around $0.085, the token has gained strength and is challenging multiple resistance levels. The Fibonacci fan lines , which had previously acted as dynamic resistance during the downtrend, are now being tested from above. A decisive move beyond the grey and orange fans around the $0.115‚Äì$0.12 level could open the door for a further rally toward $0.14 and potentially $0.16 if the momentum continues. Supporting the bullish outlook, the MACD indicator has crossed into positive territory. The MACD line (blue) is above the indicator line (orange), while the histogram prints green bars, suggesting a continuation of upward momentum.

With ERC-20 tokens gathering momentum, the Shiba Inu coin and Unilabs (UNIL) are altcoins to watch out for. Tipped to outperform top-10 altcoins like the Cardano coin, these are top DeFi tokens worth betting on. For SHIB, the leading ETH memecoin, it appeals to retailers and whales. On the other hand, UNIL is both fundamentally solid and promising: a novel AI-backed DeFi asset manager and a low-cap coin. The ongoing UNIL presale has become the talk of the crypto community, offering an opportunity to invest in the future of finance. Unilabs (UNIL): A More Bullish Option Than the Cardano Coin? Taking a bold approach, Unilabs (UNIL) will be the world‚Äôs first AI-backed DeFi asset management platform. With over $30 million in AUM (assets under management) spread across AI Fund, RWA Fund, BTC Fund and Mining Fund, UNIL is a new DeFi protocol on track to reshape finance. While its native utility token is yet to debut, the ERC-20 token checks several boxes and has been listed among the best AI coins to buy now. The project‚Äôs clear roadmap is also one of its many attractions, divided into four phases: building, market expansion, mainstream rollout and Zerg Rush. In addition to being the utility coin, other key use cases will include governance and staking. At stage 2 of the presale, a token costs only $0.0051 and will hit $0.0062 in the next round. Significantly discounted, it has been selling out fast, surpassing $740,000 in funding. Given its upside potential‚Äîits market cap is a fraction of the Cardano coin and Shiba Inu coin‚ÄîUNIL is a good DeFi crypto to buy this year. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Can it Flip $0.00008 and Register a New ATH? The Shiba Inu coin has been among this month‚Äôs top performers, recording a high of $0.000017. While there has been a slight decline, it maintains the 20-day EMA and 20-SMA, trading above $0.000014. With Ethereum leading this bull run, a Shiba Inu coin outperformance isn‚Äôt out of the question. This sentiment is echoed by top analysts, fueling bold Shiba Inu coin price predictions within the crypto community. Leading experts on X, BanklessTimes, foresee significant growth for the Shiba Inu coin in the upcoming months, attributing this to increased activity on its Layer-2 network, Shibarium. Similarly optimistic, Army_Shiba forecasts a potential rise in the SHIB price to $0.000081 this year. However, considering previous rallies and SHIB‚Äôs significant growth, seasoned investors favor new coins like Unilabs‚Äîa low-cap coin with higher upside. Cardano (ADA): On the Rise The Cardano coin is gathering momentum on the daily chart as of press time, aiming for a breakout above $0.7. With almost a 20% gain in the past month, it regains lost price levels, with further upswings on the cards. Vito24all, a top analyst on X (formerly Twitter), highlights oversold signals, hinting at a bounce in the Cardano price. Meanwhile, CryptostarExpert is optimistic about a breakout above $0.83, which could ignite a big leap. Moreover, moving averages suggest now might be a great time to buy, notably the 9-HMA. Despite this, growing interest in narratives like memes and AI means demand for Cardano (ADA) isn‚Äôt the same. UNIL, a new AI-DeFi coin, fits into the current meta, adding to its bullish outlook. Unilabs (UNIL): A Low-Cap and Promising Gem Compared to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) Unilabs is both fundamentally solid and boasts staggering upside potential; it is perhaps a more compelling alternative than the Shiba Inu coin and Cardano coin. As a low-cap AI coin, experts are optimistic about its outperformance, contributing to the presale selling out fast.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC‚Äôs market reflects the same ‚Äúheat‚Äù that was present after President Trump‚Äôs post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin‚Äôs price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.com As illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the ""Acceleration"" Phase, it could trigger BTC‚Äôs next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúpower curve,‚Äù the analyst noted that BTC‚Äôs position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity‚Äôs Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective.

In an X post, the analyst explained, ‚ÄúThe data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).‚Äù However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement. Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises. Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo‚Äôs concerns about trading volume. On May 21, retail investor demand for Bitcoin, defined as wallets buying/selling between $0 and $10,000, remained low at just 3.2% over 30 days, despite BTC trading within $2,000 of its all-time high.

While flashier projects chased hype cycles, Cardano focused on building slowly, methodically and with purpose. Now, after months of quiet accumulation, the whales are back and the charts are whispering what long-time holders have waited to hear: $1.50 may finally be in sight. But ADA isn‚Äôt the only one catching the attention of deep-pocketed investors. Remittix (RTX) , a rising $0.0781 crypto in the PayFi space, is showing eerily similar accumulation patterns, except it‚Äôs doing so during its presale. With over $15.1 million raised and a real-world use case centered around instant crypto-to-fiat transfers, some are wondering if RTX is Cardano 2.0 in its early, high-upside days. As the smart money circles both projects, the big question isn‚Äôt just about ADA‚Äôs breakout; it‚Äôs whether Remittix is quietly preparing one of its own. Whales are circling as Cardano eyes $1.50 breakout Cardano‚Äôs never been the fastest mover in the crypto world, but it‚Äôs often one of the most deliberate. While others rush to market with half-baked promises, Cardano keeps building brick by brick. That patience may finally be paying off, as Cardano‚Äôs price targets $1.50, powered by a quiet surge in whale accumulation and solid network fundamentals. ADA monthly price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap As seen in the chart above, over the past month, ADA‚Äôs price action has been anything but boring. Starting at $0.6245 in late April, it climbed steadily, peaking near $0.85 on May 10, a 36% rally, before correcting to $0.74. While some see the drop as weakness, others see consolidation and preparation for the next leg up. Supporting this optimism is Cardano‚Äôs growing ecosystem. From Hydra, its Layer-2 scaling solution, to Mithril, a stake-based innovation for faster data verification, the tech under the hood is catching up to the platform‚Äôs ambitions. DeFi and NFTs continue to gain traction, adding real use cases to the chain. If Bitcoin approaches its $150K forecast, analysts believe altcoins like Cardano could ride the wave, and for ADA, that means a realistic push toward $1.50. The Cardano price may move slowly, but when it rallies, it tends to do so with conviction. Whales don‚Äôt swim, they wire. Why Remittix is their next big splash In a market flooded with hype and half-measures, whales are moving with precision and they‚Äôre moving toward Remittix. Why? Because Remittix isn‚Äôt just another crypto project. It‚Äôs a direct shot at the inefficiencies of traditional finance, bridging a $183 trillion banking sector with blockchain in a way that‚Äôs fast, cheap and built for the world, not just the privileged few. Source: Youtube While Stripe, Wise and Coinbase dabble in fiat and crypto, Remittix goes all-in on crypto-to-fiat remittances, integrating directly with local payment networks. That means instant or near-instant transactions, no middlemen and transparent fees that put banks to shame. For high-net-worth investors, that‚Äôs not just innovative, it‚Äôs irresistible. Then there‚Äôs the VIP Program. With annual staking rewards as high as 18%, platinum debit cards, and personal account managers, Remittix rewards conviction. The higher your investment, the greater your influence, literally. VIPs gain enhanced governance rights and insider access, making them architects of the ecosystem, not just passengers. Add in the Remittix Wallet; secure, non-custodial and sleekly designed and you‚Äôve got a platform where whales don‚Äôt just park capital; they grow it. In a landscape where privacy, speed and control matter more than ever, Remittix is the smart money‚Äôs next move. Conclusion Cardano‚Äôs path to $1.50 is paved with strong fundamentals and growing whale appetite. Remittix is attracting the same kind of early interest from deep-pocketed investors, thanks to its bold vision for crypto-to-fiat remittances. With a real-world use case, a rewards-rich VIP program and growing momentum, RTX may be carving out a parallel success story. If ADA is the legacy builder, Remittix could be its high-speed, modern counterpart in the making.

The radical shift in monetary policy‚Äîa reserve supply of bitcoin‚Äîdramatically changes how the U.S. approaches financial negotiations. This all comes after President Donald Trump's Executive Order of March 6, which established the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. His order put a freeze on any further sales of the U.S. 's bitcoin‚Äîa move some feel could ensure the U.S. becoming the dominant force in the worldwide cryptocurrency market. Our comprehensive analysis goes back to the origins of the U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve: we examine the economic rationale for the reserve and its potential implications. We also explore the legislative framework, its funding mechanisms, and the macroeconomic impact of the U.S.‚Äôs groundbreaking bitcoin initiative. There‚Äôs also some key concerns the reserve raises, and it has some limitations to consider. Let‚Äôs go! The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Origins and Legislative Framework Legislative efforts beginning back in mid-2024, mark both the origins of the bitcoin strategic reserve, and an incredibly significant shift in how the U.S. government views and handles digital assets. Unlike current traditional monetary policies, the bitcoin initiative represents a deliberate attempt to integrate cryptocurrency into the national financial strategy. The BITCOIN Act of 2024 and its core provisions Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming introduced The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act in 2024, establishing the foundation for the U.S.‚Äôs national bitcoin policy. Her legislation aims to create a comprehensive framework for management of government bitcoin holdings by authorizing multiple key provisions: Establishment of a decentralized network of secure bitcoin storage facilities spread across multiple U.S. locations Implementation of purchasing program to purchase 200,000 over five years, totaling 1 million Acquisition of approximately 5% of the world‚Äôs total bitcoin supply‚Äîa goal mirroring U.S. gold reserves‚Äô percentile Funding by diversifying existing resources already within the Federal Reserve System Protection of the rights of bitcoin holders to self-custody their asset without a third party Additionally, the legislation mandated that quarterly reports via an auditing practice known as ""proof of reserves"" are maintained, which is to ensure transparency and accountability of government-held bitcoin‚Äôs management. Furthermore, the sale of bitcoin under federal control became prohibited by Trump‚Äôs March 6 executive order, requiring all bitcoin to be transferred to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve once legal title has been secured. President Trump's executive order and political motivations When Trump formalized the bitcoin strategic reserve via signature on the executive order titled ""Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,‚Äù the order directed the Treasury Department to establish an office to administer the reserve. Bitcoin seized through criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings and currently held by the government formed the strategic reserve‚Äôs initial capital. Trump‚Äôs executive order contained several key directives: Government-owned bitcoin would not be sold, but instead held as a reserve asset Both the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments were authorized to develop ""budget-neutral"" strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin without tax dollars All federal agencies were required to provide a complete accounting of digital assets in their possession within 30 days A separate ""Digital Asset Stockpile"" would be created for cryptocurrencies and digital assets other than bitcoin The initiative moves towards fulfillment of Trump‚Äôs various cryptocurrency-related campaign promises, including to make America ""the undisputed bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world."" According to Trump's digital assets advisor, aka ‚ÄúCrypto Czar David Sacks, previous government sales of approximately 195,000 bitcoin have cost taxpayers an estimated $17 billion in lost value. The reserve now represents an attempt to transform this perceived mismanagement into strategic advantage. Role of Senator Cynthia Lummis and state-level initiatives A years-long bitcoin advocate, Senator Cynthia Lummis emerged as the primary congressional spokesperson and champion of the bitcoin strategic reserve. She reintroduced the BITCOIN Act following Trump‚Äôs executive order to codify the initiative into permanent law. Lummis framed the reserve as addressing America's ""$36 trillion national debt"" and strengthening the country's ""economic foundation for generations."" State-level initiatives are also gaining momentum. By early 2025, twenty-eight states had proposed allocating public funds to bitcoin, with eighteen actively progressing through legislative channels 6. Notable examples include: Texas: Considering Senate Bill 21 to create a state-managed investment fund for Bitcoin and high market cap cryptocurrencies 7 Kentucky: Enacted legal protections for Bitcoin users, exempting node operators from money transmitter licensing 6 Arizona: Advanced its Bitcoin Reserve Bill through the House Committee 6 Oklahoma: Passed House Bill 1203 establishing a state Bitcoin reserve by a 77-15 vote 6 The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal, operating under the authority of the state Comptroller, would be financed through legislative appropriations, dedicated revenue sources, and private donations 7. This initiative reflects growing interest in cryptocurrency as a potential hedge against inflation and economic volatility at both federal and state levels. Economic Rationale Behind a Bitcoin Reserve Beyond politics, economic justification for the bitcoin strategic reserve rests on three main ideas: inflation protection, reserve diversification, and debt reduction. These aspects form the foundation of what proponents describe as a forward-thinking monetary strategy. Bitcoin as a deflationary hedge against inflation The core economic rationale behind the bitcoin strategic reserve lies in its inherent design as a deflationary asset. With a permanently capped supply of 21 million, bitcoin stands in stark contrast to traditional fiat currency, which gets printed indefinitely, causing inflation. This artificial digital scarcity gives bitcoin intrinsic value and positions it as a potential shield against price and dollar depreciation. The only potential caveat at the moment, is how long it takes Bitcoin to send and receive , with some estimators ranging from 1 to 1.5 hours. Bitcoin's deflationary mechanisms, including a fixed supply and halving events reducing its issuance totals, make it resistant to inflationary norms. Bitcoin is widely considered a viable store of value, just like gold. Being a digital asset with proven scarcity and this hard limit means bitcoin could increase its value as demand rises worldwide, a counterbalance to the declining purchasing power of fiat currencies. Bitcoin notably operates independently of geopolitical tension and the economic policies typically affecting traditional assets. This independence provides a unique security layer for national reserves during periods of inflation, economic uncertainty or currency debasement. Diversification of U.S. national reserves For the federal reserve, bitcoin represents the opportunity to extend its portfolio beyond traditional assets like gold and foreign currencies. Diversifying into bitcoin offers the nation enhanced economic resilience through exposure to different asset classes, each of course with varying risk profiles. Holding, or ‚Äúhodling,‚Äù bitcoin follows the same logic as maintaining national gold reserves, foreign currencies, and other assets. However, bitcoin offers many distinct advantages: 24/7 market liquidity, fast cross-border transactions, and lower transaction costs make bitcoin a highly flexible reserve asset 1. Despite its volatility, bitcoin's value has surged over 10,000% since inception, consistently outperforming every other traditional asset in existence. This growth potential makes bitcoin an attractive addition to the federal reserve bitcoin strategy, and some suggest it could be used to strengthen the dollar's role as the world‚Äôs reserve currency. Potential to reduce long-term federal debt burden Perhaps the most compelling reason for the reserve is bitcoin's potential impact on the U.S.‚Äôs national debt. Asset management firm VanEck projects that the U.S. establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve could cut the national debt by up to 35% by 2049. $42 trillion of the projected $119.3 trillion national debt in 2049 could be offset through this strategy, according to estimates from the firm. Optimistic assessments continue to come from Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) who believes a strategic bitcoin reserve could cut the national debt in half by 2045‚Äîa projection which aligns with analysis suggesting that if bitcoin growth continues to be strong, by 2045 the U.S. Treasury could reduce its federal debt by as much as $50.8 trillion. The mechanism for this debt reduction could involve innovative financial instruments like ""BitBonds,"" which would allow the government to finance debt for around 1% interest instead, opposed to the typical 4.5% for 10-year Treasury notes‚Äîa shift which would translate to roughly $70 billion in savings annually, or $700 billion in the first decade. The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents more than a technological initiative, but proof of a burgeoning economic paradigm shift. Bitcoin offers inflation protection, reserve diversification, plus a pathway toward addressing America's substantial debt‚Äîall without taxpayers footing the bill. Materials and Methods: Funding and Acquisition Strategy The bitcoin strategic reserve seeks out novel ways to acquire the asset without placing any further burden on the taxpayers. The U.S. government was previously said to be holding approximately 200,000 bitcoin, worth roughly $18.5 billion, primarily obtained through law enforcement seizures. A scheduled audit of the government‚Äôs holdings has to date failed to materialize, and the held bitcoin may have suffered mismanagement by various parties unfamiliar with the technology, but whatever remains of the existing stockpile forms the foundation for an ambitious expansion plan. Use of seized crypto assets by federal agencies Several federal agencies have historically auctioned off any seized cryptocurrency assets, placing the sales‚Äô proceeds into the Department of Justice‚Äôs Asset Forfeiture Fund. The establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has changed this approach dramatically, as the executive order mandates that all cryptocurrency seized through criminal or civil forfeiture proceedings must now be transferred to the Treasury Department instead of the general fund where it had normally been flowing to eventually. The U.S. Marshals Service previously managed the auctions of similarly forfeited assets in the past‚Äîlike artwork, vehicles, etc. This fragmented approach, however, led to several inefficiencies: The captured digital assets were scattered across multiple federal agencies among people who may not have been familiar with the new technology. The reserve‚Äôs new centralized management structure addresses these issues, originally by requiring agencies to provide a complete accounting of all of the varying digital assets each had in their possession within 30 days. To date however, the accounting of the nation‚Äôs bitcoin is still a grey area. Annual acquisition cap of 200,000 BTC The BITCOIN Act proposed by Senator Lummis calls for a ‚Äústructured acquisition program‚Äù targeting the purchase of 200,000 bitcoin per year over the next five years. This carefully calibrated approach aims to accumulate 1 million bitcoin in total. If successful, these acquisitions would leave the U.S. holding about 5% of all bitcoin that can ever exist. To implement the bitcoin reserve strategy, the Treasury Secretary is directed to ""establish a decentralized network of secure bitcoin storage facilities distributed across the U.S.‚Äù These facilities are said to be selected based on comprehensive risk assessments that prioritize geographic diversity, security, and accessibility. This structured approach could allow the government to add to its holdings without also disrupting markets. Reallocation of Federal Reserve surplus and gold certificates To fund the bitcoin strategic reserve, the government is turning to some innovative sources that do not require any additional taxation, including: Reduction of Federal Reserve banks' discretionary surplus funds from $6.83 billion to $2.40 billion Allocation of $6 billion from Federal Reserve annual net earnings for fiscal years 2025-2029 Revaluation of Federal Reserve gold certificates to reflect current market values By far, reevaluation of the gold certificates represents reserve‚Äôs the most substantial proposed funding source. Currently, the certificates are valued at their 1974 price of $42.22 per ounce; spot gold trades above $3,000 per ounce today however. Simply updating these certificates to reflect their current fair market value, the reserve could generate nearly $700 billion and not increase the national debt. Senator Lummis has emphasized that this approach is entirely ‚Äúbudget neutral‚Äù because it would not use any additional taxpayer funds to acquire bitcoin. Similarly, presidential advisor Bo Hines described the strategy as realizing unrealized gains on existing holdings, effectively just repurposing assets already on government balance sheets. Results and Discussion: Macroeconomic Implications Establishment of the bitcoin strategic reserve creates far-reaching consequences beyond mere asset accumulation, with effects rippling through domestic and international economic landscapes. Monetary policy dynamics and geopolitical relationships are being reshaped. Impact on U.S. dollar stability and inflation control Dollar stability could significantly be affected by the U.S. introduction of bitcoin as a reserve asset. Some proponents argue that a strategic bitcoin reserve would strengthen the dollar's position, but there are also critics suggesting that such bitcoin adoption might signal weakening confidence in traditional monetary systems in general. Indeed, such a reserve could lead to a broad depreciation and underperformance of U.S. financial assets on the global market. Moreover, the impact of bitcoin on inflation remains contested. Bitcoin's deflationary nature theoretically offers protection against excessive inflation, a weakening dollar could create inflationary pressure by raising imported goods costs. However, benchmark estimates suggest these effects may be relatively small. Geopolitical leverage and global digital leadership By establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the U.S. aims to position itself as the ""crypto capital of the world,‚Äù securing geopolitical advantages amid growing competition from China. This move represents a calibrated action that embraces cryptocurrency's future influence without undermining confidence in the dollar. Certainly, such leadership could enhance America's standing in global financial diplomacy, providing additional leverage over foreign adversaries. Furthermore, the initiative sends a clear message that the United States intends to lead in crypto innovation while maintaining the dollar's central role. Potential risks of de-dollarization and market manipulation Dangers of publicizing bitcoin must account for the fact that new payment systems, facilitating cross-border transactions and already without U.S. bank involvement, have been rapidly evolving, potentially undermining dollar hegemony. Despite having clear benefits, the bitcoin strategic reserve also faces substantial risks, among the most substantial, sparking global de-dollarization trends. This will no doubt accelerate the pace at which nations increasingly diversify away from the U.S.-engineered dollar-centric system. There are also legitimate concerns about market manipulation because government purchases or sales of bitcoin may have great psychological impact on bitcoin's already volatile price swings. Senator Warren has brought some questions about possible market manipulation, following price surges right after the reserve announcements. Finally, if the U.S. and a few other major powers accumulate significant amounts of bitcoin, they will effectively control the market, in contradiction of bitcoin's foundational principle: decentralization. Limitations and Criticisms of the Bitcoin Reserve Plan The bitcoin strategic reserve‚Äôs ambitious vision will never overcome its criticisms for some, unless ‚Äútime tells‚Äù them otherwise. Dissenting economists and financial experts fuel policymakers, who, new to bitcoin, question both the reserve‚Äôs economic viability and its overall governance structure. Volatility and lack of intrinsic value concerns Critics highlight that bitcoin's known price volatility is a‚Äîperhaps the‚Äîmost fundamental obstacle to accepting it as a reserve asset. Historically, bitcoin has experienced violent drops in price, sometimes seeing 50%+ drawbacks in short periods. Despite always recovering and rebounding even higher to date, many still call into question its reliability for a federal reserves fund. This volatility prompted the UK Treasury to reject a bitcoin reserve themselves. ""Bitcoin and other crypto assets have been historically volatile, relative to stable fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and commodities, such as gold,"" they stated. Beyond volatility, critics also challenge‚Äîor perhaps, misunderstand‚Äîbitcoin's fundamental value proposition, citing: Lack of intrinsic utility: Unlike the American Strategic Petroleum Reserve, bitcoin lacks any known ‚Äúutility‚Äù---a use or purpose‚Äîlikely to be found helpful in critical infrastructure, defense, or disaster response scenarios Speculative nature: Some financial experts characterize bitcoin as a ‚Äúhigh-beta‚Äù speculative asset, and not a true inflation hedge by any means No backing: Unlike dollars or gold certificates, bitcoin is not backed by physical assets or government guarantees, which inspire confidence in stores of value The Swiss National Bank, National Bank of Poland, and Singapore's central bank have all rejected the asset class for their own reserves. Singapore additionally stated that cryptocurrencies ""do not align with long-term investment strategies due to their speculative nature.‚Äù ==== Political conflicts of interest and transparency issues Senator Warren has raised continuous concerns about potential conflicts of interest in the strategic reserve's implementation, particularly regarding Trump and his administration officials with cryptocurrency investments and, in trump‚Äôs case, memecoins. The strategic reserve‚Äôs announcement triggered not-unexpected market volatility‚Äîinitially causing surges in trading value then sharp drops‚Äîleaving some asking questions about the obvious potential for market manipulation inherent. Bloomberg news once characterized the bitcoin reserve as an ""abysmally bad idea"" creating a ""ready-made vehicle for corruption."" Critics argue the reserve effectively functions as a wealth transfer mechanism, which will merely enrich current large bitcoin holders (aka ‚Äúwhales‚Äù) and at taxpayer expense. Transparency remains problematic; critics point to the Trump administration's close ties to the cryptocurrency industry. His businesses create undeniable conflicts when establishing regulations for the industry; his administration officials have their own clearly stated financial interests. The inclusion of cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin‚Äîa commodity, not a security‚Äî in the reserve has been described as wide open to influence by even more special interest influence groups. Conclusion A United States of America strategic bitcoin reserve represents a watershed moment in U.S. and world monetary policy, marking a bold sovereign step into federal management of digital assets. Through careful acquisition of up to 200,000 new bitcoin per year for five years, the U.S. initiative aims to strengthen its own national economic security and address its long-term national debt challenges as well. Despite stated objections, several other economic projections suggest significant potential benefits of the U.S. bitcoin reserve, especially to reduce national debt. VanEck research firm estimates a possible debt reduction of 35% by the year 2049, while new financial mechanisms, like BitBonds, could save another $70 billion annually. Bitcoin's deflationary nature is yet another compelling argument for the bitcoin national strategic reserve. Yet substantial challenges remain. Bitcoin's still-eyebrow-raising price volatility, transparency concerns, plus the political conflicts of interest outlined above demand scrutiny. Critics rightfully question whether cryptocurrency holdings align with traditional reserve asset requirements, particularly given their speculative nature and lack of intrinsic value, Ultimately success depends on the balanced addressing of these valid concerns, while not ignoring a focus on potential‚Äîsome say probable, others inevitable‚Äîlong-term economic benefits for the United States of going through with their strategic reserve plan, and fully funding their 1 million bitcoin target‚Äîa move which will reshape financial dynamics worldwide and for decades to come.

After temporarily halting decisions originally slated for May 21 and 22, the Commission is now seeking public comments on them. Ruling on XRP, DOGE ETFs The delay affects the 21Shares Core XRP Trust, Grayscale XRP Trust , and Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. All three aim to offer investors exposure to their respective digital assets via ETF shares backed exclusively by XRP or DOGE, with index tracking and custodial services provided by industry-standard partners such as Coinbase Custody and CoinDesk Indices. While the SEC has stated that this move does not suggest a leaning toward approval or denial, it is calling for public comments to assess better whether the proposals meet the standards of investor protection and market integrity outlined in the Exchange Act. In the filings, the agency explained, ‚ÄúInstitution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change. The institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change.‚Äù Besides, the agency also postponed a decision on Bitwise‚Äôs proposal to allow staking in its Ethereum ETF, continuing a trend of extended timelines as the SEC sifts through an increasing number of crypto-related filings. ETF Delays Are Routine, Not Surprising Industry observers, including Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, weighed in on the SEC‚Äôs latest delay and noted that such extensions are routine. According to Seyffart, while several XRP-related products have upcoming review dates, early approvals are unlikely. He added that the securities watchdog typically uses the full allotted time to evaluate 19b-4 filings, making October the more realistic window for final decisions. Seyffart also said that any approvals before late June or early July would be considered unusual, regardless of the SEC‚Äôs current stance toward crypto. In his view, early action, not delays, would be the real deviation from standard regulatory procedure. Seyffart even went on to say that Litecoin ETF has a ‚Äúhigher likelihood‚Äù of getting approved first before all the other crypto ETFs.

What MUTM‚Äôs Impressive Momentum Means for Investors in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-mutuum-finance-about-to-surprise-everyone-what-mutms-impressive-momentum-means-for-investors-in-2025/,"In a year already packed with surprises, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most unexpected contenders in the crypto market. What began as a quiet presale has now snowballed into serious market momentum, with analysts and early investors alike taking notice. With its unique approach to decentralized finance, low entry price, and rapidly growing community, Mutuum Finance is performing as one of the best cryptos to buy now for those looking to capitalize on breakout potential. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs presale surges past $9 million with over 11,000 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. MUTM could be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. As 2025 unfolds, and more eyes turn toward what crypto to invest in, Mutuum‚Äôs rise could become one of the defining stories of this bull cycle, possibly catching many off guard in the best way. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Mutuum Finance is rapidly generating buzz in the DeFi community with its game-changing lending solutions. Despite being in presale, it has already surpassed more than $9 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,000 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle, projections see the leap over $2. A Secure and Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem In order to bring stability, Mutuum Finance is launching a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins that are susceptible to volatility, this framework involves over-collateralization, which eliminates the chances of liquidation. With open and completely audited smart contracts, the platform roots investor trust while eliminating the vulnerabilities seen in other DeFi lending platforms. This uncompromising focus on security and sustainability makes Mutuum Finance a secure choice for long-term investment. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. There is also a referral program that encourages community development as it rewards clients for recruiting new investors. Early backers also receive VIP access to platform updates. All these incentives not only drive early usage but also ensure long-term hold among token holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction, over $9M raised and 11,000+ investors strong. Now in Phase 5 at $0.03, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035, with a launch price of $0.06 promising 100% gains out the gate. Analysts are eyeing $2‚Äì$5 targets in the next bull run. With its dual-lending model, strong tokenomics, and a $100K giveaway, MUTM is quickly becoming 2025‚Äôs breakout DeFi contender. Secure your spot now.

As more projects mix AI with blockchain tech, some are beginning to stand out for delivering real-world tools and benefits. For those following the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025, three names are drawing major attention, each offering a unique take on AI-powered blockchain systems. Unstaked grabs the spotlight with its community-based platform, while Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol continue to expand their influence through more technical applications. 1. Unstaked (UNSD): Built for Everyday Use and Strong Presale Gains Unlike platforms that only focus on backend features, Unstaked is preparing AI agents that help users manage online communities, interact on social platforms, and promote activity automatically. These agents aren‚Äôt live yet, they‚Äôll launch once the Unstaked presale wraps up and the main platform goes public. That‚Äôs when users will be able to launch and run AI-powered accounts that post and engage by themselves. Currently in presale stage 13, Unstaked has collected $6.5 million so far. Its coin is priced at $0.009267, and the listing price is expected to be $0.1819. The difference between UNSD‚Äôs starting price and launch price points to an ROI of up to 2700%. What also makes it one of the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 is its focus on giving users something they can use directly once it goes live. Adding to the momentum is Unstaked‚Äôs $1 million giveaway. Participants can earn UNSD worth $50,000 by completing simple tasks, referring others, or buying UNSD during presale. This links actual effort to real rewards, giving the project practical appeal. With 60% of the coin supply set aside for presale buyers and another $20 million allocated to liquidity, the platform aims for a fair, solid launch. 2. Fetch.ai (FET): AI Tools Designed for Complex Infrastructure Known for its focus on autonomous software and economic agents, Fetch.ai stands out for its deep tech applications. It helps with things like traffic optimization, energy use, and smart supply chains. It‚Äôs not really built for day-to-day users, but remains strong in developer circles. Its real strength is the goal of enabling machines to talk and trade with each other using blockchain and AI. But this vision means that most everyday users may not find direct value in holding FET. That said, thanks to major support from developers and real use cases in sectors like transport and smart infrastructure, Fetch.ai still plays a key role among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. The price of FET has stayed stable, and it‚Äôs still seen as a well-funded project. It appeals to people looking at the future mix of blockchain, AI, and IoT, even if it‚Äôs more suited to those with technical goals. 3. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN): Where Data Sharing Meets AI Ocean Protocol has built a name for itself by focusing on secure and fair data sharing. It gives people and companies a way to control and profit from their data without giving it away. In a world where AI depends on data, Ocean‚Äôs approach is both useful and forward-thinking. Its key feature is letting users tokenize and sell their data while keeping ownership. This helps data scientists and AI developers get quality information without breaking privacy rules. But just like Fetch.ai, Ocean is aimed more at technical users than casual ones. Those who believe in the future of AI and data in Web3 see Ocean as a logical choice. With a clear roadmap and solid early presence in this niche, it continues to be talked about when discussing the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. Final Thoughts! Choosing among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 depends on two things: how useful it is now and how much it can grow later. Unstaked has a clear edge with its easy-to-use AI tools, active reward system, and strong presale setup. Once live, its focus on real user benefits could make it stand out further. Fetch.ai offers a future-driven model for those who care about long-term use in automation and infrastructure. Ocean Protocol focuses on secure data use, which fits well with how AI is evolving. All three play different roles, but Unstaked currently looks most ready to deliver value from launch day.

Each brings something bold to the table. AVAX is heating up thanks to a wave of new token momentum and rising DeFi traction. LINK is powering deeper into the Web3 stack with its VRF automation fueling randomness for everything from gaming to NFTs. But Web3 ai is catching serious attention, racing ahead with $4.5 million raised and a potential 1,747% return for early buyers. While AVAX and LINK gain ground on ecosystem growth, Web3 ai is carving out its own lane, delivering a high-octane blend of AI-driven investor tools and real-time analytics. With a fast-moving presale and a utility-packed roadmap, Web3 ai is fast emerging as a top pick for anyone chasing the best crypto platform in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX) Token News Signals Breakout Potential The latest Avalanche (AVAX) token news has reignited bullish sentiment as the project sees rising demand across its subnets and DeFi protocols. Avalanche‚Äôs architecture, built to enable fast, low-latency applications, is attracting more developers and enterprise support by the day. AVAX is now trading at $22.14, sitting above key moving averages and flashing early breakout signals. Market analysts are watching a critical level at $50, suggesting a big leg up could be near as liquidity builds and usage surges. Charts are showing higher lows and narrowing volatility bands, a classic sign of a breakout setup. This renewed energy around Avalanche (AVAX) token news is pushing AVAX back into top-tier status. Its strong fundamentals and scalability continue to support its rise as a serious player in the conversation around the best crypto platform to watch. Chainlink VRF Automation Fuels Demand Across Web3 Use Cases Chainlink is turning heads again. Trading around $15.30, Chainlink (LINK) VRF automation is becoming one of the most widely used systems in Web3 development. This verifiable randomness function is essential for projects building fair and tamper-proof systems across gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. VRF guarantees randomness you can trust, which is why platforms using lotteries, loot boxes, and reward systems are relying heavily on LINK infrastructure. With usage growing across major blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain, Chainlink‚Äôs position as a Web3 utility backbone is getting stronger by the day. The growing demand for Chainlink (LINK) VRF automation keeps LINK relevant. It may not always follow hype cycles, but its infrastructure value keeps building. As automation and fairness become non-negotiables for developers, Chainlink remains a cornerstone in the foundation of the best crypto platform services. Web3 ai Rockets Past $4.5M in Presale AVAX and LINK might be making waves, but Web3 ai is pulling off something bigger. With over $4.5 million raised and a current presale price of $0.000365 in Stage 5, the platform is gearing up for a launch price of $0.005242, which translates to a projected 1,747% ROI. Web3 ai isn‚Äôt just about speculation. It‚Äôs packing real tools, twelve of them, all powered by artificial intelligence and designed to work across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and more.

Analyst Points Out Similarities,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-mirroring-the-2017-rally/,"Crypto analyst Galaxy has drawn similarities between the current XRP price action and the 2017 bull run, when the altcoin recorded significant gains. He predicts the altcoin could soon rally to double digits, mirroring the 2017 rally. XRP Price To Rally To Double Digits As It Mirrors 2017 Rally In an X post, Galaxy indicated that the XRP price could rally to double digits as it mirrors the 2017 rally. He stated that XRP is almost perfectly following the breakout pattern of 2017 after 6 years of consolidation. The analyst added that the longer the consolidation, the bigger the price move. Related Reading: XRP Reaching Oversold Levels As Net Flows Turn Negative, What‚Äôs Next? His accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could rally to almost $40 on this breakout. The analyst seems convinced that the altcoin could witness such a parabolic move, considering that XRP surged by 61,000% in 280 days in 2017. The chart also showed that the altcoin will likely reach this target sometime next year. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has also stated that he expects the XRP price to reach between $27 and $33 in this market cycle. He believes that a repeat of the 2017 historical performance makes these price targets achievable for the altcoin. The analyst has also alluded to factors such as the XRP ETFs and Ripple‚Äôs expansion as factors that could drive this price surge. Meanwhile, crypto veteran Raoul Pal also affirmed that the XRP price has enough room to rally to the upside from its current level. He highlighted a bull flag that had formed for the altcoin, following its consolidation phase after last year‚Äôs rally. The veteran expects XRP to witness a bullish continuation after this consolidation phase, possibly rallying to as high as $5. This would¬†mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the token. The Altcoin In A Bullish Phase Crypto analyst CobraVanguard asserted that the XRP price is in a bullish phase, while highlighting a falling wedge pattern that was forming for the altcoin. He remarked that this pattern indicates the altcoin‚Äôs potential to reach $3. However, the analyst warned that this setup could be invalidated if the wedge pattern is broken downwards with the strength of bearish candles. Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion To $5.9: Current Consolidation Won‚Äôt Stop XRP From Growing Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dark Defender noted that the XRP price is currently in Wave B of its Wave 2 corrective move. He predicts that the altcoin could rally to its current all-time high once the B and C waves are completed in this corrective wave. The analyst is also confident that the altcoin can rally to double digits in the long term. He once predicted that the altcoin could reach $18 based on his Elliott Wave Theory analysis. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.38, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

44911613,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67927,1747843456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst Says Shiba Inu (SHIB) Will Remain Bullish If This Happens, Sets Price Target",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-shiba-inu-shib-will-remain-bullish-if-this-happens-sets-price-target/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most popular memecoins in the crypto market, is once again drawing attention from analysts and investors alike. A recent technical breakdown from prominent crypto analyst Seyma suggests that SHIB may be poised to maintain its bullish trajectory if key structural conditions are met. The insight outlines a pivotal short-term setup that could fuel SHIB‚Äôs next major move. Bullish Structure Hinges on Critical Breakout Levels Seyma‚Äôs analysis, which focuses on the 4-hour chart (W-4h timeframe), reveals a finely balanced scenario. She explains that a weekly close above a critical resistance level‚Äîmarked by a red line‚Äîwill be the first indication of sustained bullish strength. However, that alone won‚Äôt be enough to confirm the continuation of the uptrend. #SHIB $SHIB | W-4h If the week closes above the red line and then breaks the purple line with a breakout candle, the bullish market structure will continue.. otherwise the grey box and the purple line below it are the demand zones. If all these positive expectations come true‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/4q4kpXWkdn ‚Äî ≈ûeyma (@traderseyma) May 18, 2025 The real test lies in SHIB‚Äôs ability to decisively break above the purple line immediately following that close. This line represents a dynamic resistance level, likely formed by a descending trendline or consolidation zone. According to Seyma, a clear breakout candle through this purple line will serve as the definitive signal of a bullish market structure. In such a case, momentum traders and bulls could re-enter the market with confidence, targeting higher price levels with renewed optimism. Should this breakout pattern unfold as predicted, Seyma projects a long-term price target of $0.030 on the weekly chart‚Äîa level that would mark a significant rally from current prices. Downside Risk: Demand Zones Await if Breakout Fails Despite the optimistic outlook, Seyma also highlights a scenario that would invalidate the bullish continuation. If SHIB fails to close above the red line or gets rejected at the purple resistance level without producing a breakout candle, downside pressure may return. In such a case, SHIB could retreat into the grey box and the lower purple line region, identified as demand zones where buying interest is historically concentrated. These demand zones represent strong accumulation areas that have previously supported SHIB‚Äôs price during downtrends. Should the bearish scenario play out, traders may look to these zones for potential re-entry or stabilization points. Broader Market Context and Community Sentiment Seyma‚Äôs forecast arrives at a time when the memecoin sector is experiencing renewed interest, driven by a broader rebound in crypto market sentiment. Shiba Inu, in particular, continues to stand out due to its large and dedicated community, ongoing ecosystem development, and integration into emerging technologies such as Shibarium, the project‚Äôs Layer-2 blockchain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On-chain metrics have shown a recent uptick in SHIB transaction volumes and wallet activity, further supporting the case for a potential upward move. Meanwhile, social media sentiment remains predominantly bullish, with many traders eagerly watching for confirmation of Seyma‚Äôs outlined conditions. While the road to $0.030 may seem ambitious, it‚Äôs not entirely out of reach if momentum continues to build and macro conditions remain favorable. The memecoin has surprised the market before, and with analysts like Seyma providing clear frameworks for technical validation, traders are more equipped than ever to navigate SHIB‚Äôs next major phase. As always, market participants are advised to combine technical analysis with risk management and macro awareness, especially in assets as volatile and sentiment-driven as Shiba Inu. In conclusion, SHIB‚Äôs short-term direction hinges on a confluence of technical events. If the red resistance level is breached and a breakout candle confirms the break above the purple line, Seyma‚Äôs bullish vision could begin to play out. If not, traders may need to watch the demand zones below for clues on the next move. Either way, all eyes are now on SHIB‚Äôs weekly close.

Crypto isn‚Äôt just surviving scrutiny‚Äîit‚Äôs steadily being woven into national agendas. While the United States has been the focal point of regulation and institutional involvement, other governments are no longer watching from the sidelines. The United Kingdom has now entered the conversation with clear intent. Far from a vague policy outline, the UK has announced concrete plans to regulate crypto firms by 2026, marking a pivotal shift in how the country approaches this asset class. This isn‚Äôt just about keeping pace‚Äîit‚Äôs about shaping rules that match the pace of adoption and ensuring oversight as public interest grows. About The UK‚Äôs 2026 Crypto Mandate The UK has set January 1, 2026 , as the official date when cryptocurrency firms will be required to comply with sweeping new data collection and reporting rules. These regulations are aligned with the OECD‚Äôs Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF), designed to standardize tax transparency on a global scale. The focus is clear‚Äîevery firm operating in or serving users from the UK must collect granular information on each customer, ranging from names and addresses to tax IDs and transaction logs. This move signals more than just data tracking. It marks a growing expectation that crypto firms adopt the same rigor applied in traditional finance. Personal details‚Äîsuch as a user‚Äôs country of residence, tax reference numbers, and full address‚Äîmust be gathered and verified. Business entities face an equally strict standard, including documentation of control structures in some cases. üìçüá¨üáßFrom 1 January 2026 if you provide cryptoasset services in the UK, you‚Äôll have new responsibilities for collecting data and reporting it to @HMRCgovuk .UK is introducing the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF), and extending it‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/xmarqR8L7I ‚Äî The British Blockchain Association (@Brit_blockchain) May 15, 2025 Firms that slip up could be penalized ¬£300 per user for inaccurate or incomplete submissions. That alone has triggered an early wave of preparation across the sector, with HMRC advising firms to shore up internal systems well in advance. The FCA has also been active, rejecting a large portion of crypto firm applications in recent years, suggesting that oversight is already tightening. The agency is now weighing restrictions on crypto purchases made with credit, reinforcing the broader regulatory tone. Interestingly, the UK‚Äôs approach deviates from the EU‚Äôs MiCA framework. There are no plans to impose volume limits on stablecoin use, and foreign stablecoin issuers may be allowed to operate without local registration‚Äîchoices that suggest the UK is pursuing a more flexible model. With public participation in crypto nearly doubling between 2022 and 2023, this regulatory overhaul is arriving at a time when more users than ever will be impacted. Best Crypto to Buy Now With Global Adoption Increasing SUBBD As more governments move toward stricter oversight of digital assets, platforms like SUBBD are positioned to thrive‚Äînot in defiance of regulation, but because they‚Äôre structured with accountability in mind. SUBBD is a creator-first crypto platform that gives influencers full autonomy over monetization while offering followers access to exclusive, token-gated content through the $SUBBD token. Its smart contract foundation is transparent and structured to track interactions and earnings precisely‚Äîsomething that aligns well with rising calls for crypto tax traceability and data transparency. The utility here is strong. For creators, SUBBD offers tools to launch premium content feeds, offer membership perks, and establish custom governance rules around community access. For fans, the token becomes more than a support badge‚Äîit‚Äôs a pass to meaningful experiences. This interaction layer is recorded on-chain, making it verifiable and structured in a way that lends itself well to the kind of compliance governments like the UK are now enforcing. As the UK aims to finalize crypto rules by 2026, projects that offer clear ownership trails, accurate user-level data, and real value exchange may fit more easily within that framework. SUBBD‚Äôs ecosystem already leans in this direction, and if broader adoption continues‚Äîespecially among online creators migrating away from Web2 monetization platforms‚Äîit may very well stand to benefit from both user growth and regulatory readiness. BTC Bull BTC Bull builds on the original vision of Bitcoin but as a project created to support its growth. Built as a tribute to Bitcoin‚Äôs foundational ideals, the project introduces a memecoin with a community-first ethos and a staking system that rewards commitment. The project‚Äôs offering is simple‚Äîit offers airdrops to the holders every time Bitcoin reaches a price milestone. Its primary purpose is to incentivize long-term holding while celebrating Bitcoin‚Äôs cultural and financial influence. The staking model is one of the clearest expressions of its utility. Users are rewarded based on the amount and duration of their holdings, creating an ecosystem where participation becomes more valuable over time. This isn‚Äôt yield farming with unnecessary complexity‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to be verifiable, predictable, and secure. Projects with such clear, well-documented smart contract logic could be in a stronger position as the UK‚Äôs new mandates around data integrity and transaction tracking come into force. It is one of the most covered crypto presales too, on various social media platforms, with top content creators like ClayBro and many others also featuring and endorsing its potential in dedicated videos on their channels. Another reason BTC Bull fits this regulatory moment is its audit-backed foundation. At a time when tax authorities are tightening the grip on crypto transactions and user data, trustless systems backed by external reviews become harder to ignore. As adoption grows globally and policy frameworks expand, BTC Bull offers a case study in how memecoins can evolve‚Äînot just as viral assets, but as structured projects with well-defined value mechanics and transparent user participation. That shift matters more now than ever, especially as markets like the UK move toward clear regulatory enforcement. MIND of Pepe The speculative energy around memecoins hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere, but MIND of Pepe takes the concept a step further, turning it into something structurally smarter. At the core of this project is an AI agent designed to interact with social media trends, gauge audience sentiment, and relay that data back to token holders. In an environment where countries like the UK are beginning to mandate exact user data and transactional clarity, a token with built-in insight mechanisms becomes far more than a novelty. MIND of Pepe allows holders to access sentiment-driven signals gathered from major platforms like X. The AI behind it processes public chatter, aggregates mood shifts, and surfaces information that can help investors make smarter decisions. While that might sound playful at first, it‚Äôs built with serious infrastructure, including a secure token allocation, real-time analysis tools, and future plans to let users influence how the AI evolves. This project‚Äôs AI-agent architecture could offer surprising alignment with the incoming regulatory mindset. As tax agencies and regulators begin demanding granular reporting on transactions and even intent, MIND of Pepe‚Äôs built-in sentiment tracking could eventually help users better document the rationale behind their moves‚Äîwhether for compliance purposes or smarter trading. It‚Äôs a rare thing when a meme project delivers utility that resonates beyond its humor. But in a crypto world being shaped by smart policy shifts and structured oversight, MIND of Pepe seems curiously well adapted for what comes next. Best Wallet Token With governments tightening their grip on digital asset reporting, the need for secure, multi-chain self-custody wallets is no longer optional‚Äîit‚Äôs foundational. Best Wallet, with its BEST presale , sits right in this emerging zone of necessity. It‚Äôs a decentralized, non-custodial crypto wallet supporting more than 60 blockchains, and it‚Äôs already equipped to handle the type of user-level transparency regulators are beginning to demand. Whether in the UK, which has set a clear date for enforcement, or elsewhere, platforms that proactively help users track, manage, and validate their activity will likely become essential tools. The utility here is dense. Best Wallet isn‚Äôt just a storage solution‚Äîit includes a native DEX, high-yield staking, portfolio tracking, presale discovery, and even in-app market intelligence. The $BEST token fuels this ecosystem, unlocking staking perks, early access features, and future governance participation. As regulators zero in on detailed transaction records and traceable crypto movement, Best Wallet‚Äôs real-time tracking and chain-level clarity are already a few steps ahead of the curve. What makes it particularly well-placed in this moment is its growing appeal among presale hunters and cross-chain investors‚Äîusers who now find themselves increasingly in need of accurate activity logs and decentralized access. If the UK‚Äôs planned regulations nudge more users to seek platforms that simplify compliance without giving up privacy, Best Wallet may become one of the few tools capable of meeting both needs at once. Solaxy Built to enable seamless activity across Ethereum and Solana ecosystems, Solaxy‚Äôs real strength lies in its technical infrastructure. This is a Layer 2 solution designed for faster throughput, cheaper transactions, and built-in staking rewards through its native token, SOLX. As jurisdictions like the UK move toward deeper scrutiny of cross-border crypto activity, platforms that simplify user interactions across chains while maintaining data accuracy are stepping into the spotlight. Solaxy‚Äôs cross-chain architecture may well align with what this next era of crypto adoption demands. Unlike most Layer 2 networks that serve only a single chain, Solaxy operates as a dual-ecosystem facilitator. This means users don‚Äôt have to worry about bridge risks or fragmented liquidity pools when operating between Ethereum and Solana‚Äîa key feature for traders, developers, and stakers alike. We‚Äôre going interstellar! üõ∏38M Raised! üî• pic.twitter.com/udfUBJ0GBC ‚Äî SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 20, 2025 Through SOLX, users can access yield programs, governance rights, and discounted network fees. And all interactions‚Äîstaking, transfers, liquidity provision‚Äîare logged and traceable. If regulators across countries begin to implement frameworks similar to the UK‚Äôs CARF-aligned policy, cross-chain transparency will become a major filter for viable projects. Solaxy‚Äôs built-in data visibility, paired with its staking and governance models, helps reduce the fragmentation that often complicates compliance. Its infrastructure isn‚Äôt just built for speed‚Äîit‚Äôs built with traceability and scalability in mind, quietly addressing the exact issues many governments are now raising. Conclusion With the UK locking in a regulatory deadline and more countries taking similar steps, crypto projects will likely face increasing scrutiny over structure, function, and transparency. Early-stage tokens that already align with these expectations‚Äîor are building toward them‚Äîmay have an advantage as compliance becomes non-negotiable. For investors, this shift highlights the importance of looking beyond hype and focusing on whether a project is built to operate within a more formalized system‚Äîwith some good examples being projects listed above in this article.

For instance, if you‚Äôre viewing Bitcoin on CoinMarketCap , you‚Äôll see questions like ‚Äò Why is $BTC‚Äôs price up? ‚Äô ‚Äò What could affect $BTC‚Äôs future price? ‚Äô or ‚Äò What are people saying about $BTC? ‚Äô All you need to do is click on one of these questions to get a detailed analysis. This is a prime example of how AI agents and tech are shaping real-world experiences. Keep reading to learn more about how this feature works and how it could simplify crypto investing for you. We‚Äôll also suggest a similar AI agent token ( MIND of Pepe ) you can invest in to make the most of the upcoming AI investment era. How Does CMC AI Work? The CMC AI interacts with a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI and feeds it a prompt that includes the latest price data of various tokens. When you click on the pre-generated questions, you‚Äôre essentially seeing the response generated by the LLM based on the prompt provided to it by CoinMarketCap. Simply put, CoinMarketCap asks the LLM questions about a given token, and the responses are linked in the CMC AI section on the token‚Äôs detail page. For major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the answers are updated every 30 minutes. For other tokens, however, updates will roll out if the price moves more than 2% in an hour. Our AI is purpose-built for crypto, trained on our extensive market data, and designed to surface insights when users need clarity about specific cryptocurrencies. ‚Äì David Salamon, Chief Product Officer at CoinMarketCap. The biggest benefit of CMC AI is that it reduces repeated search queries on these LLMs. For example, millions of investors would want to ask ChatGPT, ‚Äò Why is the bitcoin price going up? ‚Äô This leads to a lot of API calls and LLM running costs. With CMC AI, such repeated requests can be eliminated, resulting in large-scale cost savings. This is Just the Beginning It‚Äôs worth noting that CMC AI‚Äôs initial rollout is only the first phase of CoinMarketCap‚Äôs host of planned AI updates, which will gradually roll out throughout 2025. Upcoming features include trending market data on the CoinMarketCap homepage, custom question answers with conversational AI LLM tools, and personalized answers based on your watchlist, portfolio, and investment interests. This is only the beginning of how AI models and AI agents are going to change the future of cryptocurrency and the Web3 space. AI agents are rapidly finding new applications and making their way into real-world scenarios. The AI agent market cap today stands at $7.22B, but it‚Äôs expected to cross the $10B mark soon. If you want to make the most of this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, we‚Äôve got something perfect for you: MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . What is MIND of Pepe ($MIND)? Don‚Äôt mistake MIND of Pepe for just another AI assistant. It‚Äôs a never-before-seen intelligent AI agent built from the ground up to identify the next cryptos to explode , i.e., cheap presale tokens poised for growth. $MIND will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X. Unlike typical AI chatbots that feel sterile and boring to talk to, however, $MIND will serve up a user-friendly and context-aware tone, engaging crypto degens like never before. We were blown away when we found out that MIND of Pepe has also been programmed to understand crypto-native lingo, prevalent memes, and the overall mindset of the crypto trading community.

It‚Äôs worth noting that besides social sentiment, MIND of Pepe will also gather real-time on-chain activity and things like market data APIs to help it spot and connect everything relevant for the AI agent to offer good trading calls. Buy Some $MIND Now $MIND Will Also Be Self-Evolving In addition to being fully autonomous, MIND of Pepe will also be self-evolving. According to its whitepaper , $MIND will eventually even be able to create its own tokens. Seeing as $MIND will have access to CoinMarketCap, DexScreener, and Solana-specific metrics (like token creation, wallet activity, and early LP behavior), there‚Äôs really no arguing that $MIND‚Äôs own tokens could very well be in a pole position to become the next top trending cryptos . Buy the $MIND Presale to Ride the AI Agent‚Äôs Success The most significant piece of information we could give you today is that every single benefit related to MIND of Pepe will only be available to holders of the $MIND presale token. So, if you haven‚Äôt quite figured out meme coin investing ‚Äì or you‚Äôd like to diversify your portfolio with one of the best AI agent coins ‚Äì then become an early investor in $MIND .

As OKB and Avalanche Expand, Qubetics Solidifies Its Spot as the Best Crypto Under $1",https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-price-up-next-week-as-okb-and-avalanche-expand-qubetics-solidifies-its-spot-as-the-best-crypto-under-1/,"While Bitcoin ETFs continue to stagnate and major caps slow to a crawl, fresh capital and attention are funneling into under-$1 altcoins showing actual momentum. OKB, the native token of the OKX ecosystem, is experiencing notable market stirrings as trading volumes climb. Avalanche (AVAX) just launched its $100 million ‚ÄòFusion‚Äô initiative to build modular networks within its ecosystem, signaling bullish development-focused sentiment. But it‚Äôs Qubetics ($TICS)‚Äîa fully integrated Web3 aggregator with a non-custodial multi-chain wallet and $17.2 million raised‚Äîthat many are calling the best crypto under $1 for this phase of the market. Qubetics is gaining ground across technical and community circles not for hype, but for delivering blockchain infrastructure that meets immediate developer and enterprise needs. Its token presale structure, wallet utility, and upcoming mainnet launch are aligning just as large-cap liquidity begins rotating into scalable mid-cap opportunities. For early buyers, the window might be tight‚Äîanother 10% presale price increase is scheduled for Sunday at 12 a.m. sharp. Multi-Chain Wallet Utility That Makes Qubetics the Best Crypto Under $1 to Watch The non-custodial wallet space is no longer just about security‚Äîit‚Äôs about sovereignty, speed, and scale. Qubetics delivers all three by embedding its wallet into a full Web3 development stack that unifies access across 50+ blockchain networks. Through its Qubetics IDE and QubeQode, users can create, manage, and deploy smart contracts directly from the wallet interface, eliminating the need for fragmented tools or centralized dependencies. Let‚Äôs say a freelance designer in Toronto wants to distribute royalty-based NFT contracts across Ethereum and Arbitrum. With Qubetics, the contract can be generated and managed directly through the IDE, bridged instantly, and verified across chains‚Äîall without external plugins or KYC hurdles. A startup in Austin could spin up a liquidity pool across Avalanche, Polygon, and Base‚Äîall in a few clicks, with real-time tracking and fee-optimized deployment. This kind of wallet application isn‚Äôt theoretical‚Äîit‚Äôs functional and usable today. The ability to act as both a development console and a universal transaction layer gives Qubetics a very different proposition than traditional wallets or DeFi dashboards. That‚Äôs why analysts and builders are pointing to $TICS as the best crypto under $1 for both builders and everyday participants seeking a scalable, non-custodial hub for cross-chain access. Qubetics Presale Growth and ROI Forecasts Cement Its Spot as the Best Crypto Under $1 The Qubetics presale is now in Stage 35, with each week bringing a scheduled 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 a.m. The token price currently sits at $0.2785, and the presale has raised over $17.2 million from more than 26,800 unique participants. With over 513 million $TICS tokens sold, the protocol has cemented itself among the most watched presales in 2025. Here‚Äôs what a $100 allocation could turn into: If $TICS hits $1 post-presale: $358.95 ‚Äî a 258.95% ROI At $5: $1,794.74 ‚Äî or 1,694.74% ROI At $6: $2,053.68 At $10 after the mainnet launch: $3,489.47 If $TICS reaches $15: $5,284.21 ROI The structured progression makes the Qubetics presale unlike most token sales‚Äîit‚Äôs time-governed, not just volume-driven. This eliminates manipulation and encourages early commitment. And because every use case within the ecosystem (wallet, contract deployment, VPN access, token issuance) is tied to $TICS, utility isn‚Äôt abstract‚Äîit‚Äôs built-in. As presale visibility grows and prices increase weekly, this has all the elements of a best crypto pre sale, especially for participants who understand timing and traction matter more than speculation. This strategic rollout, coupled with actual development-ready infrastructure and a Q2 2025 mainnet, gives $TICS one of the most tangible upside models among altcoins currently under $1. That‚Äôs not hype‚Äîit‚Äôs math. OKB Gains Traction Amidst Quiet Market Rotation‚ÄîPrice Moves Driven by Ecosystem Confidence According to BlockchainReporter, OKB, the native utility token of the OKX exchange, is quietly generating renewed momentum as market focus rotates toward high-utility assets. The report ties OKB‚Äôs recent growth to the exchange‚Äôs ongoing expansion and platform-wide token integrations, particularly as it continues to solidify its global presence and trading volume leadership. The analysis notes that OKB‚Äôs uptick is not driven by a sudden catalyst, but rather sustained confidence in OKX‚Äôs growing role as a multi-functional trading and DeFi platform. With increased usage of OKB for fee reductions, launchpad access, and staking pools, the token is increasingly recognized for its embedded network value. The article also highlights that while many large-cap tokens are stagnating in price or retracing, OKB is one of the few showing resilience and low-volatility upward moves‚Äîsomething typically reserved for tokens with real demand backing their ecosystem. For participants looking beyond hype-driven moves, OKB‚Äôs performance signals a steady hand in volatile conditions, making it a strong parallel consideration alongside projects like Qubetics in the search for the best crypto under $1. Avalanche Launches $100M ‚ÄòFusion‚Äô Fund to Power Modular Blockchain Networks As reported by Cointelegraph, Avalanche has announced the creation of a $100 million ‚ÄòFusion‚Äô fund, a strategic initiative aimed at accelerating the growth of modular blockchain networks within its ecosystem. The goal? Streamline deployment of tailored blockchain environments that can interoperate through Avalanche‚Äôs fast finality consensus and low-latency subnets. Fusion will provide funding and infrastructure for developers looking to build networks optimized for gaming, DeFi, or enterprise use‚Äîfurther pushing Avalanche toward becoming the go-to layer for modular execution. The report cites the initiative as a clear move to gain ground against other modular blockchain platforms, particularly as narratives shift toward ecosystem specialization and app-specific chains. This funding round not only reinforces Avalanche‚Äôs long-term scalability plan, but also positions it as a key ecosystem benefactor in the evolving chain-of-chains structure. In tandem with the uptick in demand for modular tech, this expansion aligns Avalanche with forward-looking protocols that offer flexibility, throughput, and interoperability. While AVAX is priced well above $1, the structural momentum it offers could benefit complementary protocols‚Äîparticularly those like Qubetics that can interact cross-chain. And for early-stage buyers still deciding where real value flows next, Avalanche‚Äôs vision lends support to the broader narrative backing the best crypto under $1. OKB and Avalanche Expand Ecosystems‚ÄîBut Qubetics May Still Be the Best Crypto Under $1 Today All three projects bring something unique to the table: OKB is benefiting from exchange-level confidence and expanding utility, Avalanche is investing aggressively in modular network development, and Qubetics is building foundational Web3 architecture through real-time tools and non-custodial access. But only one of them is still trading under $1 while simultaneously offering a 5x‚Äì50x forecasted return via a structured presale. With another price increase looming this Sunday, and over $17.2 million already raised, Qubetics is now widely seen as the best crypto presale for participants who want early access to a protocol with working components, real use cases, and a future-proof model of chain-to-chain development. As market momentum shifts from speculation to application, these aren‚Äôt just narrative darlings‚Äîthey‚Äôre strategic plays.

Qubetics stands out for its utility-driven presale, wallet integration, and live cross-chain application layer, making it the most talked-about under-$1 token. How does the Qubetics presale work? Each stage lasts 7 days and ends with a 10% price hike every Sunday. It‚Äôs currently in Stage 35 at $0.2785 with over $17.2 million raised. Why is Avalanche‚Äôs Fusion Fund important? It allocates $100M to support modular blockchain networks, boosting Avalanche‚Äôs infrastructure expansion and long-term developer traction. The post Qubetics Price Up Next Week?

While institutional investors shift their focus to top-tier blockchains, retail investors are asking a different question: where is the next true ground floor opportunity? Enter Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), the project that might offer investors exactly that‚Äîa second shot at early-Bitcoin-style wealth. Solana‚Äôs Momentum, But Not Its Price Point Solana continues to dominate headlines, especially with ongoing talks of a Solana ETF. Its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs have made it a favorite among developers and traders alike. However, Solana‚Äôs success comes with a price‚Äîliterally. Many retail investors missed the early wave, and now, with institutions circling, the room for explosive growth may be limited for the average buyer. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is carving out a new path for wealth creation, one that‚Äôs open, accessible, and still incredibly early. The Rise of Bitcoin Solaris Bitcoin Solaris has entered the scene with powerfully efficient architecture, pairing Bitcoin‚Äôs legendary Proof-of-Work security with Delegated Proof-of-Stake to enable next-generation speed and scale. Key blockchain features: 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) 2-second finality 99.95% less energy consumption than Bitcoin Dual consensus (PoW + DPoS) This hybrid design solves the blockchain trilemma‚Äîachieving security, decentralization, and scalability in a single network. But the true magic of Bitcoin Solaris lies in its ability to empower everyday users, not just developers or institutions. ‚ÄòBitcoin Ground Floor‚Äô Potential ‚Äî In Your Pocket Imagine mining a next-generation crypto not with bulky rigs, but with a smartphone. Bitcoin Solaris is making that real. With its Solaris Nova App (currently in beta access for selected community members), users can mine BTC-S with: Smartphones (iOS/Android) Laptops and desktop PCs Traditional mining hardware (ASICs/GPUs) No technical knowledge? No problem. One-tap mining, cross-platform access, and a built-in wallet mean anyone, anywhere can join the network and begin earning. Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed And it doesn‚Äôt stop at mining. Bitcoin Solaris also offers liquid staking, letting users earn rewards while keeping their assets fully liquid. Users receive sBTC-S tokens (1:1) that can be used in lending, DeFi apps, or simply held for future value‚Äîno lockups, no limitations. Presale Phase 4 ‚Äì Last Call Before Liftoff Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% The BTC-S presale is in its fourth phase, with early momentum reaching new highs. Already over $1,000,000 has been raised and more than 8,900 unique users have joined the movement. This 90-day presale ends on July 31, 2025, leaving only a narrow window to enter what many are calling the next Bitcoin-style opportunity. With a potential return of 1,900%, this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market today. What the Crypto World Is Saying The buzz is real. Crypto influencers are paying attention‚Äîand for good reason. In a recent breakdown, Crypto Nitro explained why Bitcoin Solaris is one of the most promising projects in the space right now. With its combination of affordability, functionality, and accessibility, it‚Äôs quickly becoming the talk of multiple communities. Even platforms like Telegram and X are seeing surges in user activity as more investors begin to take notice. Audited and KYC-Verified Of course, safety and trust matter too. Bitcoin Solaris has been fully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and the team behind the project has also passed KYC verification . It‚Äôs the kind of transparency serious investors demand‚Äîand Bitcoin Solaris delivers it without compromise. Conclusion As Solana ETF buzz grows, smart investors are turning to Bitcoin Solaris for what‚Äôs next. With mobile mining, fast transactions, and clean energy, BTC-S offers a powerful all-in-one crypto experience. More importantly, it‚Äôs still early. While others chase overhyped tokens, BTC-S gives early adopters a rare ground-floor shot‚Äîbut with the presale phase ending soon, that window is closing fast.

After breaking through key resistance levels at $0.725 and $0.732, Cardano ( ADA ) is now testing the $0.76 zone, with bullish momentum supported by a MACD crossover and reclaiming of the 50-EMA, according to crypto.news data . Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to an all-time high , which could significantly drive Cardano‚Äôs price, especially with its recent integration of Bitcoin support through its Lace wallet. This move enables BTC storage and interaction on Cardano, marking a major step in the project‚Äôs multichain strategy and unlocking new DeFi use cases. Investor confidence is also reflected in the nearly $1 billion in ADA withdrawn from centralized exchanges since early 2025, a pattern reminiscent of the lead-up to ADA‚Äôs all-time high in 2021. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Cardano‚Äôs participation in GITEX Europe 2025 in Berlin highlights its commitment to global engagement and innovation in blockchain technology.

The major breakthrough seems to have been caused by a rise in adoption. With this, the star token has become a $2 trillion asset, as the first price discovery correction after the first price discovery uptrend seems to have completed. The BTC price has confirmed a breakout above the final resistance below the ATH, and hence, the current discovery phase is expected to prevail for a long time. In times when retail traders remain uncertain about the next Bitcoin move, the whales are extremely confident. As per some reports, the 40X BTC whale, James Wynn, has just increased his long position to $1 billion. The Wynn‚Äôs conviction looks fueled by record BTC ETF inflows, a wave of profitable holders and relentless bullish chatter. With this, the Open interest (OI) has marked a new ATH, rising by $13 billion on Binance. The rise in the open interest suggests a rise in the total number of outstanding Bitcoin futures or options contracts. This also indicates a rise in the liquidity and volatility within the markets. The BTC price underwent a V-shaped recovery and surged above the final resistance zone, which has pushed the price into the discovery phase. The BTC price just surged above the final resistance level while the 50/200-day MAs is heading towards a bullish crossover or Golden Cross. On the other hand, the +Di & -Di were heading for a bearish crossover, but the latest rise in the price has triggered a bullish divergence. This validates the beginning of a fresh ascending trend, which could keep the price within the discovery phase for a long time. The Bitcoin price has broken its all-time high after 121 days and has also set records in its market capitalization and realized cap.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $16,051 and $18,518, with an average expected price of $16,492. In 2031, ETH could trade between $48,883 and $58,524 with an average price of $50,590. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors‚Äô recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications.

The RSI is hovering near 74.77, indicating overbought conditions and a potential short-term pullback or consolidation. The Bollinger Bands are widening, pointing to an increased volatility and market activity. If ETH maintains above $2,500, it may test the upper resistance near $2,950. However, a drop below $2,300 could open the door for a retracement to the lower Bollinger Band support around $1,650. Market participants should watch for confirmation signals. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Ethereum (ETH) is exhibiting bullish tendencies, though momentum appears to be consolidating. Price action is hovering near the upper Bollinger Band at approximately $2,611, with ETH maintaining a position above its middle band ($2,501), reflecting strong short-term support. The MACD shows a positive crossover, with the MACD line above the signal line, supporting the bullish bias. However, the histogram bars are shortening, which may imply weakening momentum. The Balance of Power at 0.50 supports mild bullish dominance. If buying pressure continues, ETH could retest resistance above $2,600, while a break below $2,500 may trigger downside movement.

Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,559 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $38,876, maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum‚Äôs price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum‚Äôs shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $12,359 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,649. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $27,327. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $58,525 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $58,525 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

44914544,https://zycrypto.com/?p=106320,1747848293,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"BTC Price to Hit $600,000 in 90 Days: Analyst‚Äôs Wild Bitcoin Price Prediction Explained",https://zycrypto.com/btc-price-to-hit-600000-in-90-days-analysts-wild-bitcoin-price-prediction-explained/,"Crypto analyst Fred Krueger recently outlined a dramatic scenario in which Bitcoin‚Äôs price explodes from roughly $150,000 to $600,000 between July 21 and Oct. 19, 2025. He released this forecast on social media as a five-stage plan (dubbed ‚ÄúThe Last Rally‚Äù). In Krueger‚Äôs view, each phase involves major financial shocks‚Äîfrom a failed U.S. Treasury auction to a new Bretton Woods‚Äìstyle summit‚Äîthat together would drive a parabolic Bitcoin rally. Krueger‚Äôs outline breaks down into sequential ‚Äúphases,‚Äù each building toward the rally. In summary: Phase I: A $200 billion U.S. Treasury auction fails, prompting the Fed to signal ‚Äúextraordinary measures.‚Äù In this environment, Bitcoin briefly jumps (from $158k to $165k) and gold hits $4,200. Simultaneously, BRICS countries establish an independent payment network using gold and Bitcoin. Phase II: A major U.S. pension fund defaults on obligations. The Fed imposes yield curve control , capping 10-year yields at 6.5%, and the dollar weakens sharply. Under these conditions, Krueger projects Bitcoin at $215,000, oil around $122, and gold about $5,800. (He also notes Germany pledges to back the euro with new gold reserves.) Phase III: U.S. home prices plunge 35% and 10-year Treasury yields spike above 8.5%. Bitcoin surges to about $390,000 in this turmoil while gold reaches $8,900. Each of these phases is meant to stoke a flight to alternative assets. For example, in Phase I, Bitcoin and gold initially rise on the chaos, and by Phase III, soaring yields and housing losses further erode confidence in fiat. All dollar figures above are Krueger‚Äôs estimates for that stage. Corporate Moves and Currency Restructuring Krueger‚Äôs final phases bring in corporate buyers and a full currency reset: Phase IV: Major tech giants (Apple, Tesla, Google) ‚Äúconvert their balance sheets to Bitcoin.‚Äù Apple alone accumulates 200,000 BTC. Latin American governments also turn to crypto. Meanwhile, the IMF announces a new global reserve basket (50% Bitcoin, 30% gold, 10% yuan, 10% other) and the Bank of England issues Bitcoin-backed bonds. By this point, Bitcoin exceeds $525,000. Phase V: A ‚ÄúNew Bretton Woods‚Äù summit in Geneva restructures the U.S. dollar. The dollar gains 25% Bitcoin and 25% gold collateral , and the Fed launches a digital dollar (CBDC), expanding its balance sheet to $44 trillion. In this finale, Bitcoin reaches $600,000, gold $10,400, and oil $180 per barrel. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) drops to the high 60s. In other words, Krueger foresees an unprecedented reshuffling: global reserve currencies realign around BTC and gold. His scenario explicitly puts the dollar index around 68 and projects the S&P 500 roughly halving (a 50% drop from current levels). Krueger‚Äôs scenario is highly controversial. It depends on a chain of severe crises that have not occurred. The ‚Äú$600K prediction‚Äù is still viewed as speculative and even ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù. Nonetheless, it has sparked discussion online about what market or policy events could set off the proposed rally. Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Trajectory For context, Bitcoin price has indeed been rallying in mid-2025. After briefly dipping to just above $100,000 in mid-May, BTC quickly rebounded above $103,000. BTC/USDT Price Chart| Source: TradingView By May 21, it traded around $107‚Äì108K, a 14% gain since the start of May. In this rally, the total crypto market capitalization climbed past $3.36 trillion. Despite these gains, Bitcoin remains below its January 2025 all-time high ($109,000). Traders note that the uptrend has formed a bullish flag pattern, with key resistance in the $112k‚Äî$120k range. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is $108,352, having climbed 3% over the last 24 hours. It has a trading volume of $67 billion. The market is also digesting macro factors (Fed policy, tariffs, etc.) that could fuel or cap the rally. In short, Bitcoin‚Äôs current momentum is strong, but many analysts view further moves as contingent on traditional-market dynamics. PHASE V: THE RESET (Week 12‚Äì13) Monday, October 6 U.S. declares emergency ‚ÄúNew Bretton Woods‚Äù summit in Geneva.

Dogecoin (DOGE) performed strongly on Wednesday, continuing the May rally. The token rose to $0.2375, up 8% in the last 24 hours. This movement was driven by a combination of factors, including broader market momentum and bullish technical signals. For one, technicals flashed positive signals, with Dogecoin‚Äôs price forming a bullish flag pattern . Specifically, this is when a price rises sharply, following a consolidation near the top. This typically indicates that a breakout is coming. You might also like: Dogecoin price prediction: Head and shoulders breakout points to $0.30 target A potential driver of this bullish momentum was whale accumulation. Notably, holdings on addresses containing between 1 million and 10 million DOGE rose to 10.56 billion coins on May 20, up from 10.48 billion on May 10. Dogecoin sees strong month, is altcoin season coming? Dogecoin‚Äôs growth coincided with Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) all-time high of $109,487, which was a culmination of the May bullish market. Most other altcoins have seen strong growth in that period, including Dogecoin. Notably, in the last 30 days, Dogecoin was up 43.96%. What is more, most of that surge happened between May 7 and May 11. You might also like: Dogecoin price remains stuck as whale accumulation continues Still, despite strong performance among many altcoins, Bitcoin continues to dominate investor interest. The altcoin season index remains at just 26 out of 100, indicating that Bitcoin outperformed nearly three-quarters of the top 100 altcoins over the last 90 days. Moreover, the majority of the top 100 altcoins are still in the red over the past 90 days. This includes major tokens such as Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu, and even Dogecoin. Specifically, Dogecoin is still down 8.31% over the last three months. That said, momentum for altcoins appears to be growing. The total altcoin market cap rose from $1.07 trillion at the start of May to its current level of $1.27 trillion. This suggests a potentially positive outlook for Dogecoin as well.

""Hong Kong‚Äôs stablecoins are backed by fiat currency as underlying assets, and we welcome global enterprises and institutions interested in issuing stablecoins to apply in Hong Kong,"" legislative council member Johnny Ng said on X on Wednesday. Institutions are expected to be able to apply for a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority by the year-end. Hong Kong has been working on establishing a stablecoin regime since 2023. The nation had published a consultation paper on stablecoin guidelines towards the end of 2023 . It later introduced the Stablecoin Bill, which the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passed in its third reading, Ng's post said. The region has been looking to keep up with nations around the world that have been establishing their stablecoin regimes. The European Union started licensing stablecoin issuers last year after passing its wide-ranging bespoke crypto bill, called the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCa). Meanwhile, the U.S. has a stablecoin bill that is passing through Congress, and the U.K. has been gathering feedback on draft legislation that will also affect stablecoins . The stablecoin sector has become the hottest trend in recent years, with both crypto and TradFi firms ramping up their exposure to the industry. Ben Reynolds, BitGo's managing director of stablecoins, said at Consensus 2025 that large banks are increasingly taking notice of the industry, largely out of fear that they will lose market share to the digital dollars.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) have already proven that meme-driven coins can deliver returns, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is performing well as serious coin. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues as this high-growth altcoin sells at $0.03 and has collected $9 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM‚Äôs price to $0.035 while attracting more than 11,000 investors. This phase‚Äôs investors will receive a 100% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $5 in the near future. The door is wide open for exponential growth, potentially delivering a 2500% ROI or more in the current cycle. As bullish sentiment surges and traders search for the best altcoin to buy now, these three top cryptos are emerging as frontrunners for the next explosive rally. SHIB and PEPE: Low-Cost Meme Coins with High-Upside Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) continue to dominate the conversation around cheap altcoins with breakout potential, especially for investors chasing a 2500% ROI. SHIB, currently trading around $0.000025, has matured beyond its meme origins by launching its own layer-2 network, Shibarium, and integrating real DeFi utility‚Äîmaking it one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for long-term community-driven momentum. PEPE, priced near $0.000011, has captured the market with its fast-growing cult following and viral meme appeal, proving that even low-cap tokens can surge into multi-billion dollar territory almost overnight. As traders search for the top crypto to buy now, both SHIB and PEPE offer strong upside from their current levels‚Äîthough new contenders like Mutuum Finance may soon join them in the spotlight. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 11,000 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $9 million in total. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs price has currently reached $0.03 in Phase 5 even though investors anticipate a 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 which will generate considerable profit potential. Analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Over $9 million raised and 11,000+ investors already in, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction. Phase 5 tokens are live at $0.03, offering a 100% ROI at launch and targeting 2500% gains as forecasts eye a move past $5. SHIB and PEPE have hype, MUTM has real DeFi power. Phase 6 hits soon at $0.035. Lock in your spot now before the price climbs. This is the breakout altcoin of the cycle.

Shiba Inu Completes iH&S Pattern The structure took shape over three distinct troughs: a left shoulder that bottomed just above $0.00001082 in mid-March, a head that wicked to about $0.00001030 in early-April, and a right shoulder that found support near $0.00001230 in the opening days of May. That sequence carved out an arc lasting more than two months, culminating in a decisive surge from May 8 that vaulted price through the neckline with a long, full-bodied green candle. Momentum on that breakout carried SHIB as high as the $0.00001765 region‚Äîits loftiest print since early-February‚Äîbefore profit-taking invited a classic ‚Äúthrowback.‚Äù Over the past sessions the token has slid back into the neckline zone, where bid interest has so far absorbed supply, validating the level as a fresh support zone between $0.00001400 and $0.00001470. The successful retest is the final criterion many technicians require before calling the pattern complete. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marks Major Milestone Amid Market Rebound Toward $0.00002 Measured from the head‚Äôs extreme to the midpoint of the neckline, the vertical depth of the formation is roughly $0.0000037. Applying that distance to the breakout area confirms the local top at $0.00001765. Cantonese Cat summarised the setup succinctly: ‚ÄúSHIB daily ‚Äì inverted H&S brokeback pattern completed. Favors bullish continuation.‚Äù With the neckline now acting as a springboard, price action over the next few sessions will determine whether bulls can translate the technical victory into fresh upside follow-through or whether bears manage to drag the token back into the former trading range. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could Erupt 500%‚ÄîAnalyst Sounds The Alarm SHIB Price Targets Upside targets can be found with the help of Fibonacci retracement levels. Anchoring the grid to last summer‚Äôs $0.00004569 high and the March swing low at $0.00001030 produces a 23.6 percent retracement at $0.00001865 which forms the second technical waypoint, only after the 200-day EMA at $0.00001603. Should buyers reclaim both lines on a closing basis, the roadmap points toward $0.00002382 (38.2 percent) and the midpoint level at $0.00002799, an area that also coincides with the lower margin of last December‚Äôs congestion zone. Beyond it, the golden-ratio mark at $0.00003217 and the 78.6 percent retracement at $0.00003811 frame the penultimate obstacles before any renewed challenge of the macro peak. Conversely, failure to defend the neckline shelf near $0.00001430 would invalidate the bullish script and shift short-term risk back to the 50-day EMA around $0.00001399 and ultimately to the cycle floor at $0.00001030. Until that downside failsafe is breached, the Fibonacci grid argues that momentum remains skewed in favor of buyers pressing for a return into the high-teens and, potentially, the low-twenties in the weeks to follow.

A lawsuit has been filed by twelve U.S. states challenging Trump‚Äôs Liberation Day tariffs.

The president added that importing more than they export has harmed manufacturers in the U.S. Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China in February. The U.S. President also imposed a 10 percent across-the-board trade tariff on all imports in April this year, aimed at nations with which America had the largest trade deficits. Most of those nation-specific trade tariffs were halted a week later. Recently, the Trump administration temporarily decreased its trade tariffs on China after the two nations held discussions in Geneva, Switzerland. The two nations promised to work on a long-term deal. The twelve U.S. states argued that the trade deficit experienced by the country was not an emergency. The states added that the IEEPA was not allowed to authorize any trade tariffs at all. The same panel expected to hear the lawsuit this Wednesday also heard a similar case filed by five small businesses last week. The panel will deliver a decision in the next few weeks. California filed a separate lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco. Businesses and members of the Blackfeet Nation have also filed separate lawsuits to challenge Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Legal advocacy groups have also filed lawsuits challenging the president‚Äôs decision to impose tariffs on other nations. In support of the blue states, U.S. House Democrats recently submitted a brief requesting a federal court to reverse the trade tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The Democrats said the taxes on imports were beyond any import levies authorized by Congress. The brief was signed by 148 legislators, including several from Washington and Oregon. The Democrats filed the lawsuit on May 16 in New York in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The House Democrats revealed that Congress has set limits on the president‚Äôs power to declare tariffs. The Democrats argued that the current president has broken the limits. DoJ says the lawsuit should be dismissed Dan Rayfield, Oregon Attorney General, said the trade tariffs were skyrocketing the prices for families and businesses in the state. The attorney claimed the tariffs would cost the average Oregon family an extra $3,800 yearly. Rayfield said the president imposed the trade tariffs without input from the public and Congress. The Republican president claimed the U.S. courts could not review his decisions, which the Oregon Attorney General termed a misuse of emergency powers. The Department of Justice said the lawsuits filed by the twelve states should be dismissed. The DoJ claimed that the lawsuit claimed ‚Äòspeculative economic losses instead of providing concrete harms caused by the trade tariffs. The department added that only Congress could challenge an emergency declared by the U.S. president under IEEPA. The Department of Justice explained that the courts or states were not in a position to challenge a national emergency declared by the U.S. president. A DoJ spokesperson revealed that the department would continue to defend Trump‚Äôs agenda to challenge unfair trade practices.

Once strong players like Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) are now facing slow price movement and investor doubt. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is grabbing attention with a massive 150% surge in its presale, proving that smaller, utility-rich tokens may now offer better returns than well-known names. With more than 10,700 holders, over $8.7 million raised, and a current price of just $0.025 in Phase 4 of its presale, Mutuum Finance is leading what some call the ‚Äòchanging of the guard‚Äô in the altcoin world. Cardano and Polkadot: big Projects, small movement Both ADA and DOT launched with big visions‚ÄîCardano focused on a smart contract platform backed by academic research, and Polkadot offered an ecosystem of connected blockchains. But today, despite years of development, price growth has slowed. Investors have waited months, even years, without major gains. The platforms still lack strong use cases for regular users, and many early buyers are no longer seeing the returns they hoped for. Even new updates haven‚Äôt sparked major price increases. This has led investors to look elsewhere‚Äîand Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming the next stop. MUTM: 150% surge and real utility Since launching its presale at $0.01, Mutuum Finance has climbed 150% to $0.025 in just a few phases. More than $8.7 million has been raised, showing that investors are buying into real-world utility, not just hype. Unlike other tokens, MUTM offers income-generating features and clear reasons to hold the token long-term. How you earn with Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance allows users to lend and borrow crypto in two different ways: 1. P2C Lending (Peer-to-Contract) You deposit crypto like ETH or DAI into a shared liquidity pool. The pool lends that crypto to borrowers, and you earn interest that changes with market demand. If the pool is highly used, you can earn 8% to 10% APY or more. If usage drops, your returns may be lower, but the system adjusts in real time. 2. P2P Lending (Peer-to-Peer) You lend directly to other users, setting your own terms. This model can give higher rewards, but also comes with more risk, since you‚Äôre not sharing interest with a larger pool. Your final earnings depend on the strategy you choose, the asset you lend, and market conditions‚Äîbut either way, you‚Äôre in control. What are mtTokens? When you deposit crypto into Mutuum‚Äôs pool, you receive mtTokens in return. These tokens represent your deposit plus any earned interest. You can track how much you‚Äôre earning in real time. As long as your crypto is in the system, your mtTokens grow in value, giving you an easy way to hold, track, and even use your funds without pulling them out of the platform. Borrowing: keep your crypto, get liquidity Many people wonder: Why borrow when you already have crypto? In Mutuum Finance, borrowing means you don‚Äôt have to sell your assets. Let‚Äôs say you believe ETH will go up in price. Instead of selling it and missing that future gain, you deposit ETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins. You can use those stablecoins for anything‚Äîwithout giving up your ETH. This approach gives you several advantages: you can avoid triggering capital gains taxes since you‚Äôre not selling your assets. At the same time, you maintain exposure to your long-term holdings. The borrowed funds can be used for trading, covering personal expenses, or exploring new investment opportunities. Plus, it opens the door to advanced strategies like hedging or creating leveraged positions. You can repay the loan anytime, as long as your collateral covers what you owe. There‚Äôs no fixed end date, making it super flexible. How MUTM token holders earn The MUTM token offers a way to earn passive income directly from the platform‚Äôs revenue. Here‚Äôs how it works in simple terms: Mutuum uses part of the profits it makes to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to users who stake their mtTokens in the safety modules. So, by staking, you not only support the protocol but also become eligible for regular dividends whenever a buyback and distribution happens. It‚Äôs a smart way for long-term holders to benefit from the platform‚Äôs growth while earning extra MUTM rewards. So instead of just watching price charts, you‚Äôre earning real rewards while helping the platform grow. With Cardano and Polkadot slowing down, it‚Äôs clear that investors are moving toward fresh, high-utility platforms. Mutuum Finance offers real tools, like smart lending, borrowing, and staking‚Äîwhile also rewarding long-term holders. The presale is still ongoing at $0.025, but later phases will raise the price. If you‚Äôre looking for strong returns, clear utility, and steady passive income, this may be the right time to look into Mutuum Finance. As big-name coins lose steam, MUTM is proving that small, smart tokens with real-world use cases are leading the next wave of crypto growth. Don‚Äôt miss the shift‚ÄîMutuum Finance is just getting started.

Michael Saylor , whose company is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ), made the statement as the latest Bitcoin rally sent BTC to a new all-time high above $109,500. The spike also pushed 100% of Bitcoin-holding addresses into profit. But despite the rally to a record high for the benchmark digital asset, Saylor took to X to share his bullish take on BTC. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not buying bitcoin at the all-time high, you‚Äôre leaving money on the table,‚Äù the MicroStrategy founder posed via X. His remarks echo a previous statement, also shared via the platform, as Bitcoin approached its prior all-time high. You might also like: BREAKING: Bitcoin hits new all-time high at $109,400.68 The Strategy founder‚Äôs comments align with his recent prediction that BTC may soon become too expensive for investors who hesitate at current levels. In his view, this scenario is likely amid an impending wave of institutional investment into Bitcoin. Specifically, analysts suggest that banks and other financial institutions are on the verge of a major push into Bitcoin. When this happens, the price could skyrocket, and those who miss out, even at today‚Äôs record highs, may not be able to buy in later. ‚ÄúWhen banks finally bless Bitcoin and the experts agree it‚Äôs a good idea,everyone will want to buy it,no one will need to sell it,and you won‚Äôt be able to afford it,‚Äù Saylor said in late April.

The cryptocurrency traded around $109,369 on late trading, extending a rally that lifted prices about 6% in the past week. This move follows a breakthrough above $100,000 earlier in May, as investors responded to signs that President Trump‚Äôs global tariff offensive might be easing. Trade Truce Sparks Global Rally The immediate catalyst was a surprise 90-day ‚Äútariff truce‚Äù between the United States and China . On May 12, officials in Geneva announced a pause on new levies and sharp rollbacks of existing duties, slashing reciprocal tariffs by roughly 115 percentage points to about 10%. Global markets leaped on the news: stock futures and Asian equities jumped, and commodity prices rallied on hopes of a broad trade-war d√©tente. Bitcoin investors also took notice. Analysts note that the tariff pause removed the risk of ‚Äòsudden re‚Äëescalation‚Äô, which had been weighing on risk appetite. In other words, as the trade conflict eased, risk assets like Bitcoin rallied without the overhang of fresh tariffs. Liquidity Surge and Institutional Flows Broader macroeconomic conditions have added fuel to the crypto rally. Central banks worldwide are signaling easier policy. In the U.S., futures markets are now priced at multiple rate cuts this year, and a weaker dollar has coincided with renewed growth in global money supply. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has maintained an accommodative stance, and the Bank of Japan continues massive asset purchases, reinforcing the loose global liquidity backdrop. China‚Äôs central bank has also begun pumping cash into markets. Such ample liquidity typically lifts risk assets, and Bitcoin has benefited accordingly. At the same time, institutional investors have been pouring into crypto. Hedge funds and asset managers have funneled record sums into spot-Bitcoin ETFs and futures, betting on higher prices. Leading figures in the crypto industry have expressed firm bullish conviction. Former PayPal and Meta executive David Marcus tweeted , ‚Äú the bull case for Bitcoin has never been stronger,‚Äù citing easier custody solutions at banks and competition from sovereign and corporate buyers. Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance, echoed this optimism. Analysts even project Bitcoin could reach around $150,000 if regulatory conditions remain favorable. Bitcoin Market Outlook Looking ahead, analysts are divided on just how far Bitcoin can climb. Some have raised year-end targets above $130,000. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision warns that the relentless expansion of fiat money means Bitcoin ‚Äúmay push‚Ä¶above $132,000‚Äù by late 2025. Source: X Even major banks have revised their models: Standard Chartered‚Äôs crypto research team recently suggested that a $120,000 second-quarter price target might be ‚Äútoo low‚Äù. On the other hand, many caution that the rally could pause or correct if global liquidity peaks or regulators tighten. Bitcoin‚Äôs price historically follows four-year ‚Äúhalving‚Äù cycles tied to new coin issuance, and some forecasters see the current monetary easing lasting through 2025. Those forces could cool Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum if central banks eventually reverse course or inflation spikes. For now, however, the rare alignment of easing trade tensions and abundant liquidity, coupled with growing institutional adoption, has set the stage for one of crypto‚Äôs strongest rallies.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 17:45:31

Recent ETH weekly performance dropped around 6%, showcasing shifting momentum. Price swings highlight an asset capable of rapid upward moves alongside steep corrections, indicating a volatile landscape that has spurred significant short-term gains yet ultimately faced medium-term headwinds. Current price levels span from roughly $1469 to $2038, with immediate resistance near $2281 and a second barrier around $2850. Support is found at approximately $1142 and further down at $573. Indicator levels suggest bulls are in play but cautious amid correction phases. Trading ideas focus on bounce behavior between these lines until a clear trend emerges. Solana Price Swing: Short-Term Bounce Versus Long-Term Lows SOL showed a 21.28% rise over the past month while enduring a 34.92% decline over the last six months, with a weekly drop of 8.99% punctuating its volatile journey. The monthly surge contrasts with the ongoing downward pressure over the longer term, reflecting a market oscillating between brief rallies and sustained lows. SOL currently trades between $109 and $171.27 with key levels marked by support at $71.65 and resistance at $194.93. Bears have held sway in the short term, but the recent monthly lift hints at emerging buying interest. Watching the range carefully, consider trades that test support near $109 and profit near resistance at $194.93. Conclusion ETH is poised to reach $3,000, driven by strong demand and recent upgrades. SOL targets $200, reflecting increased interest and rapid adoption. Both are benefiting from broader market optimism. These tokens show solid growth potential for June.

With price now testing major resistance, consolidation could pave the way for a breakout toward higher targets. Cookie Coin ( COOKIE ) has shown remarkable strength, rising more than 27% following a precise bounce off a high-timeframe support level at $0.15. This wasn‚Äôt just any level, it marked the confluence of multiple technical indicators, including the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, the channel low of a bullish trading channel, and the 200-day moving average. The alignment of these indicators provided a high-confidence entry zone, which has now led to a powerful upside move. Currently, Cookie is trading at a key resistance area near $0.22, a level that demands attention from both bulls and bears. This resistance aligns with the upper boundary of the bullish trading channel, as well as a volume profile value-up resistance pulled from the all-time high. Despite testing this critical zone, Cookie remains structurally bullish. Key technical points Major Support Held: $0.15 support held strong, backed by 0.618 Fib, 200 MA, and channel support Current Resistance: Testing $0.22 zone, in confluence with HTF channel resistance and volume node Market Structure: Higher highs and higher lows remain intact Potential Next Target: Breakout above $0.22 could send price toward $0.26 COOKIEDAOUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView The recent move from $0.15 to $0.22 was not only sharp but also technically sound. The support zone at $0.15 acted as a stronghold of confluence, providing a solid launchpad for this breakout. As Cookie now tests the $0.22 resistance zone, it faces its next significant challenge. A clean break above this resistance may not occur immediately. Given the scale of the recent move, a consolidation phase would be a healthy development. Ideally, traders should look for the formation of a bullish pennant or a short-term ascending channel just below resistance. These structures often precede breakout moves, allowing the market to gather momentum. You might also like: BTC surges: Explore cloud mining with BTC to earn $20,000 a day While there‚Äôs always the possibility of a continued pump without consolidation, the more sustainable path would involve some sideways movement that builds pressure beneath the $0.22 level. If that occurs, it could act as a launchpad toward the next resistance at $0.26, a natural magnet for price continuation. What to expect in the coming price action If Cookie consolidates under $0.22 and maintains its bullish structure, a breakout toward $0.26 is highly probable. The overall trend remains strong, and technicals support continued movement to higher levels with a confirmed bullish setup.

However, within the past few days, another uptrend began, hinting at renewed investor confidence. Meanwhile, the Binance Coin price is showing upward movement in the weekly timeframe. While the broader market remains volatile, a project called Unilabs (UNIL) is breaking out from the shadows. Unilabs has raised $677,000 in funding, showing strong investor belief in its AI-powered, decentralized asset management model. Unilabs (UNIL): The AI-Powered DeFi Asset Manager Gaining Investor Momentum As top tokens like Binance Coin and Ethereum experience price dips, Unilabs (UNIL) is emerging as one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto space. With over $30 million in assets under management (AUM) and more than $677,000 raised in its ongoing presale, Unilabs is capturing investor attention for its unique value: AI-powered decentralized asset management. Unlike other platforms, Unilabs relies on AI to monitor thousands of crypto projects at the same time. With this, it helps users find promising investments before everyone else. There are four main funds on the platform: the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund, which are designed to meet the needs and tolerance for risk of different investors. At the heart of this ecosystem is the $UNIL token, which gives holders access to staking rewards, dividends, exclusive early-stage projects, and governance voting rights. With staking yields of up to 122% APY and a tiered reward system, users are incentivized to hold and grow with the platform. As the DeFi space grows beyond $120 billion in total value locked, Unilabs is positioning itself not just as a competitor but as a next-generation leader in AI-driven crypto investing. The UNIL token is currently trading at $0.0051 and could grow as the ecosystem expands, making it a good crypto to buy. Ethereum (ETH) Bulls Battle For Recovery In a recent post on X, Michael Van de Poppe, one of the top analysts in the market noted that the Ethereum price could fall to $2,400 in the coming days. Despite this, Michael advised his followers that this area is a good spot for investors to buy. The analyst believes that the price of Ethereum could reach $4,000. Crypto GEMS think that the Ethereum price will continue to increase. They believe that Ethereum could reach $3,000 if it manages to break free from its downtrend. Interestingly, the amount of Ethereum accumulation has risen. Ted mentioned that whales bought a total of $1.2 billion in ETH last month. Meanwhile, the altcoin shows signs of recovery. The ETH altcoin price is also up on the monthly chart with a gain of 57.4%. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index show that bulls are in control. Binance Coin (BNB) Could Rise By 50%, Per Analyst The Binance Coin price has been moving up and down the charts after meeting with resistance at $690. According to CoinMarketCap, the Binance Coin price has gone down by 1.4% over the last week. However, the Binance Coin price still has gains on the higher timeframes. Crypto Coasta notes that the Binance Coin price might rise by 50% before the year ends. Such an increase could push the value of the altcoin to $1,000. Crypto Bull, another analyst, has made the same Binance Coin price prediction. According to him, the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price may surge to $1,000 after a bullish flag formation. However, the Binance Coin price might fall if buying pressure does not increase in the market. TradingView data currently shows that investors are still optimistic. The Fear and Greed Index is in the Greed zone, favoring a potential Binance Coin price jump. Also, the relative strength index remains above the midline, signaling high buying pressure. Why Unilabs is the Top Crypto To Buy Now In a market clouded by uncertainty, Unilabs stands out as a symbol of innovation and profitability. While the Ethereum price stabilizes and Binance Coin searches for support, Unilabs is moving forward. Its low market cap and price also add to its appeal. With AI at its core and real use cases gaining the attention of investors, Unilabs might lead the next wave of altcoins in the upcoming altseason.

44915679,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner,1747850100,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump's memecoin dinner",https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin dinner on May 22. The event‚Äôs attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president. Since Trump‚Äôs memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills. ‚ÄúTrump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,‚Äù a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúCollecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.‚Äù Source: Public Citizen Crypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a ‚Äú[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.‚Äù Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto ventures Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to ‚Äúhold [Trump] accountable,‚Äù and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner. ‚ÄúAmericans cannot and will not accept President Trump‚Äôs view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,‚Äù Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúWe have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.‚Äù Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislation Some lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family‚Äôs involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump‚Äôs conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber. ‚ÄúMany senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family‚Äôs use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,‚Äù said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: ‚ÄúBut we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.‚Äù Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would ‚Äútry to get something from the president‚Äù in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to ‚Äúblock Trump‚Äôs memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.‚Äù As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for ‚ÄúVIP tour‚Äù and reception ‚Äî presumably at the White House ‚Äî with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.

While many saw this as the beginning of a massive momentum streak, others are skeptical, believing the surge is only momentary and are instead shifting investments to another altcoin, FloppyPepe (FPPE) . Let‚Äôs see why. Maple Finance (SYRUP) Loses Its Sweetness With Market Cap Dip Below $400M On May 6, 2025, Maple Finance (SYRUP) secured a listing on top crypto exchange Binance, leading to an over 50% surge for its native token SYRUP, which jumped to a high of $0.34. However, the surge was short-lived as Maple Finance (SYRUP) began to shed its gains, with its market cap falling below the $400 million mark. Meanwhile, along with the surge in SYRUP price, Maple Finance (SYRUP), an institutional-level lending protocol, also recorded a $1.3 billion peak in the total value locked on the network. However, all these significant milestones were not enough to help Maple Finance (SYRUP) maintain its bullish momentum. Data from CoinGecko shows that Maple Finance (SYRUP) has retraced to $0.32, and its market cap has slid below $350 million, prompting investors to seek more stable investments like FloppyPepe (FPPE). FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale- A Haven For Investors While the crypto market is currently battling bearish pressure, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is offering loss-ridden investors hope with its ongoing presale, which continues to gain added traction among institutional players. In this presale, everyone, including Maple Finance (SYRUP) investors, can purchase the meme coin at a pocket-friendly price of $0.0000002 per coin, presenting a low entry point. Interestingly, all who buy the meme coin now secure their chances for automatic profit when the coin increases in value to $0.00000035 in the next stage of the presale. Thus, smart money investors, including Maple Finance (SYRUP) investors, are hurrying to bag the meme coin, solidifying their chances for profit. However, there is more. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Reshapes Meme Creation With AI Agents Image Generated From FloppyAI Aside from automatic profit in presale, Maple Finance (SYRUP) investors, like other traders, are also interested in FloppyPepe‚Äôs (FPPE) unique approach to meme coins with AI technology. Unlike other meme coin projects, the network introduces two powerful AI agents that simplify meme creation and are available for use on Telegram. One of the AI agents is FloppyX, a video bot framework that assists content creators in generating high-quality, multi-platform-friendly video memes. Interestingly, FloppyX was designed to immediately react to recent developments in all fields, including news, sports, and the crypto market, making all memes generated on the platform trendy. The second is the Meme-o-Matic machine , an image meme creation tool powered by FloppyAI, an AI agent that allows everyone, including Maple Finance (SYRUP) investors, to create memes from texts. This simplicity makes it possible for even individuals without technical expertise to create viral meme images. FloppyNomics- A Token With Real-World Purpose FloppyPepe (FPPE) is powered by an ERC-20 token, FPPE, which serves as a utility and enables users to access its AI agents. However, aside from the automatic profit that will come to investors who purchase the meme coin in presale, the platform features a tiered reward system that recycles 1% of every transaction to long-term holders. In addition, another 1% is donated to support real-life endeavors like wildlife conservation efforts , empowering these agencies to protect endangered species from poachers and create a more conducive environment for them with forest restoration programs.

Analysts are buzzing with excitement, not just for Ethereum price potential breakout, but also for Solana (SOL), which is set to surge through to a new all-time high. However, the real surprise player is FloppyPepe (FPPE) , the meme coin turning heads with a presale price of just $0.00000002 and an 80% bonus for early adopters. With projections hinting at a staggering 5,760% surge in just two weeks, this meme coin is shaping up to be the wild card in the next crypto bull run. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Not Just A Meme: The AI-Powered Token Set To Explode 5,760% In 2 Weeks FloppyPepe (FPPE) is flipping the script on what it means to be a meme coin, blending virality with real value and cutting-edge AI tech, and it‚Äôs gearing up for a 5,760% surge in just two weeks.

Charting The Climb: Ethereum Price Battle At The Breakout Zone An analyst has highlighted a potential breakout scenario for the Ethereum price, pointing to a descending broadening wedge formation on its long-term chart, a pattern known to precede significant upside moves. Historically, the Ethereum price has bounced between converging trendlines. Currently trading around $2,533, the Ethereum price is showing bullish momentum after rebounding from lower trendline support. A breakout above resistance could trigger a strong rally, potentially pushing the Ethereum price toward $4,000. This would represent a staggering 61.29% increase from the current Ethereum price. Solana (SOL) On The Rise: Analyst Eyes Wallet Boom As Bullish Trigger Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, has highlighted a bullish trend emerging for Solana (SOL), as the number of addresses holding at least 0.1 Solana (SOL) has steadily climbed. This consistent rise in Solana (SOL) active holders suggests growing network engagement acting as a key ingredient, often seen before a major price move. Currently trading at approximately $173.43, Solana (SOL) is showing signs of renewed strength after a brief pullback, sparking speculation that it may be gearing up for a new all-time high. The combination of rising adoption and the price of Solana (SOL) momentum points to a potentially massive upside. From Meme To Moon: Why FloppyPepe‚Äôs (FPPE) Surge Could Be Just The Beginning FloppyPepe (FPPE) is rapidly making waves in the crypto scene, with analysts predicting a 5,760% surge in just two weeks. Fully audited by SolidProof, the project has established a strong foundation of trust, transparency, and investor protection. Endorsed by top voices in the space like Nass Crypto, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as a serious rival ready to outpace Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).

With a 3% transaction fee funneled into holder rewards, token burns, and charity contributions, every trade fuels both price momentum and meaningful causes. This sustainable framework is designed to build long-term value.

FloppyPepe (FPPE): Presale Surge and AI Utility Redefining Altcoin Value As the market reacts to Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining ground fast, with nearly 98% of Stage 1 tokens sold out at just $0.0000002 . Its momentum is driven by a blend of real utility, strong community engagement, and a deflationary Floppynomics model that includes a 1% burn, 1% redistribution to holders, and 1% toward wildlife conservation. Security isn‚Äôt an afterthought. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has passed a full SolidProof audit , placing it ahead of most altcoins in its category. On top of that, AI tools like Meme-o-Matic for meme generation, FloppyX for AI video creation, and FloppyAI for sentiment tracking are already proving that FloppyPepe (FPPE) is far more than just hype. Endorsements from key voices like Nass Crypto, who called FloppyPepe (FPPE) an AI gem to over 1 million YouTube subscribers, add more weight to the project. With a vibrant following on Telegram and X, the buzz is only growing. Those entering now can also claim a limited 80% bonus using the FLOPPY80 code, making the current price and rewards combo one of the best early-stage opportunities among altcoins. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Institutional Bridge Between TradFi and DeFi With its cutting-edge Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization technology, Ondo Finance (ONDO) is quickly establishing itself as a top altcoin. Priced around $0.9372, Ondo Finance (ONDO) is tapping into institutional demand by bringing products like U.S. Treasuries onto the blockchain. As Ethereum (ETH) improves its network post-Pectra upgrade, Ondo Finance (ONDO) drives real utility in parallel. Technical patterns further confirm the optimism. Crypto analyst, Crypto Winkle, notes that a major descending trendline break and ongoing retest suggest that Ondo Finance (ONDO) could be gearing up for a sustained rally. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Momentum Builds on Historical Gains While Ethereum (ETH) celebrates its technical leap with the Pectra upgrade, Pepe (PEPE) is riding a wave of bullish sentiment powered by community strength and technical setups. Recent whale activity has turned heads, with 2.21 trillion Pepe (PEPE) withdrawn from Binance. Technical indicators also paint a promising picture. A golden cross formation and a bullish breakout on the 12-hour chart suggest significant upward potential. Analyst Javon Marks sees a return to $0.00002649 as highly likely, representing an 88.8% surge from the current Pepe (PEPE) price. FloppyPepe (FPPE) And Its Bonus Lead the Altcoin Race While Ethereum (ETH) has made significant strides with its latest upgrade, investors are increasingly seeking bigger opportunities in faster-growing, more affordable altcoins. Against the backdrop of Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) Pectra upgrade, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , Ondo Finance (ONDO), and Pepe (PEPE) each offer compelling reasons to believe they will outperform Ethereum (ETH) in the coming cycle. Ondo Finance (ONDO) is capturing TradFi interest like no other altcoin, while Pepe (PEPE) is gearing up for a classic meme-driven surge powered by technical signals and whale accumulation. These projects represent a new risk-reward opportunity that Ethereum (ETH) no longer provides. However, FloppyPepe (FPPE) undoubtedly stands out from the crowd. With Stage 1 of its presale nearly sold out, its growth-focused floppynomics structure, and functional AI utility positions it as the rare, early-stage altcoin ready to explode. With the generous FLOPPY80 code providing an 80% token bonus and a low token price of $0.0000002 , this meme coin is set to greatly outshine the rest of the market.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Wall Street Ponke, a memecoin with AI tools aiming to redefine trader safety, raises $300k fast. Table of Contents Why Wall Street Ponke could outpace memecoin giants in 2025 Wall Street Ponke combines utility, timing, community at right price Wall Street Ponke raised 300k dollars just a few hours after launch. It is the first memecoin with an AI-powered platform made to protect crypto traders. It‚Äôs based on the original Ponke idea and already has big support from partners like Revolut. The Ponke community is strong and pushing the project forward with real energy. What makes Wall Street Ponke special is the smart tools it offers. The AI helps spot scams and gives traders better ways to invest safely. And right now, it‚Äôs still in presale, with each token priced at just $0.000261. That means early buyers have a chance to get in cheap before it goes big. With strong support, powerful tools, and a low price, Wall Street Ponke could even beat Trump and Pepe in this bull run. It might just be the next memecoin to grow 100 times or more. Why Wall Street Ponke could outpace memecoin giants in 2025 Memecoins are booming in the 2025 bull market. Coins like Trump ( TRUMP ) and Pepe ( PEPE ) have already made big moves. Trump now has a market cap of around $700 million, and Pepe is over $4 billion. These coins grew fast, but many experts believe they may not grow much more, maybe up to 10 times at most. Ponke also has a strong community and shows promise, but it may face the same limits as Trump and Pepe. That‚Äôs where¬†Wall Street Ponke¬†stands out. It‚Äôs still in presale, which means it‚Äôs early and full of potential. But more importantly, it‚Äôs not just about memes, it brings real value. Wall Street Ponke offers: AI tools to spot scam tokens An education platform to help traders learn A full crypto platform, not just a meme These features make it more than just hype. Wall Street Ponke is built to grow, gain trust, and bring in serious users. Early investors in memecoins like Pepe or Shiba saw life-changing gains. A $20,000 investment at the start turned into $5 million with Pepe or even $12 million with Shiba. Those gains didn‚Äôt come by luck, they came from getting in early. Wall Street Ponke is now in that early stage. With the right timing, this could be the next big moment in crypto. Wall Street Ponke combines utility, timing, community at right price Most presales are all hype with no real use. But Wall Street Ponke is different. It offers real tools that give it long-term value. The project includes: Its own exchange for easy and safe trading A smart bot that watches for scams and whale activity A learning platform with simple lessons to help traders get better It‚Äôs still early, the price is low, and the community is growing fast. Wall Street Ponke has the tools, the timing, and the support to become something big. Supported by the active and loyal Ponke community, this token has both vision and backing. And with WPONKE currently priced at just $0.000261, the timing couldn‚Äôt be better to get in before full-scale adoption kicks off. To buy WPONKE, users must visit the official website , connect their Trust Wallet or MetaMask, and pay with ETH, USDT, BNB, or card. Simple, secure, and early.

Two days in a row, the meetings have been disrupted by people shouting ‚ÄúFree Palestine.‚Äù The protests are part of a growing campaign called No Azure for Apartheid. It is targeting Microsoft‚Äôs cloud contracts with Israel‚Äôs Ministry of Defense. The group has been protesting for more than a year. The Azure cloud software was used by the Israeli Air Force‚Äôs Ofek Unit to keep track of databases of possible targets for deadly airstrikes and by Israelis to spy on Palestinians. +972 Magazine says that leaked papers also show that Microsoft has a ‚Äúfootprint in all major military infrastructures‚Äù in Israel. The three major disruptions in Microsoft‚Äôs meetings The first disruption was caused by Joe Lopez, a Microsoft hardware engineer who worked on parts of Azure, the company‚Äôs cloud-computing platform. Security quickly led him out of the Build conference after speaking out against the company‚Äôs chief executive, Satya Nadella. ‚ÄúSatya, how about you show how Microsoft is killing Palestinians,‚Äù Lopez yelled. ‚ÄúHow about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?‚Äù Afterward, Lopez sent an all-staff email explaining his decision to stage a protest. The email read, ‚ÄúAs one of the largest companies in the world, Microsoft has immeasurable power to do the right thing: demand an end to this senseless tragedy, or we will cease our technological support for Israel.‚Äù The second one happened as Microsoft‚Äôs head of CoreAI, Jay Parikh, was on stage discussing the company‚Äôs Azure AI Foundry efforts. A Palestinian tech worker interrupted his keynote to protest against the same issue. When Parikh went back to his keynote, he stumbled over his words. Then, one of his Microsoft coworkers came on stage to continue talking about the company‚Äôs work with AI developers. In addition, last month, two former Microsoft employees interrupted the company‚Äôs 50th anniversary event. One of them called Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft‚Äôs AI CEO, a ‚Äúwar profiteer‚Äù and told the company to ‚Äústop using AI for genocide in our region.‚Äù Microsoft looks into how its tech is being used in the war in Gaza This second protest comes soon after Microsoft said that it had recently done an internal study and hired an outside firm, but didn‚Äôt say what firm it was, to look into how its technology is being used in the war in Gaza. The company said that there is no evidence that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure and AI technologies, or any of their other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD has failed to comply with their terms of service or their AI Code of Conduct. Microsoft explained that its relationship with Israel‚Äôs Ministry of Defense (IMOD) is structured as a standard commercial relationship. However, Lopez didn‚Äôt buy it: ‚ÄúLeadership rejects our claims that Azure technology is being used to target or harm civilians in Gaza. Microsoft is set to host xAI, Meta Platforms, and others Microsoft announced it would host new AI models made by Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI, Meta Platforms, and European startups Mistral and Black Forest Labs in its data centers. The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, said that the new products from xAI, Meta, and others will have the same reliability promises as the OpenAI models that Microsoft hosts. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a game-changer in terms of how you think about models and model provisioning,‚Äù Nadella told conference attendees during a keynote address. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exciting for us as developers to be able to mix and match and use them all.‚Äù The company also showed off a new AI tool that can do software coding tasks by itself.

33767162,[object Object],1747850451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ripple Issues Stern Warning To Investors As CEO Celebrates New XRP Milestone,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-issues-stern-warning/,"XRP is about to start drawing a fresh wave of attention from institutional investors, following a major update that reflects the token‚Äôs growing relevance in the crypto market. The latest milestone involves the listing of XRP and Micro XRP futures on the CME Group, which marks a notable milestone for the cryptocurrency. Ripple‚Äôs CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, recently took to social media to share this exciting announcement, while Ripple issued a critical alert for crypto investors. Ripple CEO Hails Institutional Breakthrough For XRP Brad Garlinghouse took to the social media platform X to mark what he described as a key institutional milestone for XRP: the official launch of both XRP and Micro XRP futures contracts on CME Group, the largest derivatives marketplace in the world. Interestingly, the contracts were quick to become active, as Garlinghouse also confirmed that the first block trade on CME had already been executed by Hidden Road, a prominent institutional trading firm. This move introduces XRP to a regulated derivatives framework, which traditionally appeals to asset managers, hedge funds, and other large-scale investors. It places XRP in the same category as Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which saw improved investor confidence and deeper market activity after their own CME futures listings. As such, the launch of XRP and Micro XRP futures plays well into the current market dynamics for XRP, especially in terms of growing institutional interest. Furthermore, the presence of XRP futures on the CME marketplace shows that the cryptocurrency is maturing into a more structured financial asset, which could influence future decisions of the SEC around Spot XRP ETFs . CME Group XRP futures are available in both a micro-sized (2,500 XRP) and a larger-sized contract (50,000 XRP). According to Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME Group, more than $19 million in notional volume was traded on the first day of launch. Ripple Issues Major Alert To Investors Shortly after the announcement of the futures launch, Ripple‚Äôs official account posted a public service warning highlighting a rise in scams targeting the XRP community. The company urged users to stay alert, noting that no official Ripple representative would ever ask individuals to send XRP. The warning included a reminder to avoid suspicious links and noted the importance of verifying accounts before engaging. This alert is based on a pattern in the crypto space, as scam activity tends to rise when markets are bullish. One such example is the recent arrest of a Wellington-based man by the New Zealand Police in connection with a crime syndicate accused of stealing $450 million New Zealand dollars ($265 million). Crypto exchange Coinbase was also recently subjected to a phishing attac k that resulted in the leak of a small fraction of user data. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.35, down by 8.7% in a seven-day timeframe.",Ripple|bitcoin|Brad Garlinghouse|CME Group|coinbase|Ethereum|Giovanni Vicioso|Micro XRP Futures|ripple|ripple news|Spot XRP ETFs|US SEC|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-21 18:00:51

DOW Jones Industrial Average heat map | Source: TipRanks Investor focus is primarily on U.S. debt, as rising bond yields threaten to push the government deficit even higher. The latest $16 billion auction of 20-year Treasury bonds attracted little demand from investors, sending bond yields higher.

Still, this uncertain macroeconomic environment appears to be working in Bitcoin‚Äôs favor.

With price testing resistance, a potential pullback to strong support could trigger a move into all-time high territory. Strategy‚Äôs stock (MSTR) is currently trading in a bullish market structure, mirroring the recent price action of Bitcoin ( BTC ). With a history of aggressive BTC accumulation, MSTR has shown a strong correlation to Bitcoin‚Äôs movements, and this correlation may once again lead the stock into new all-time highs. As MSTR tests a key resistance level, the setup suggests either a direct breakout or a bullish correction that sets the stage for another leg up. Key technical points Major Support Zone: $362.50 ‚Äî confluence of value area low, 21 EMA, and 200 MA Market Structure: Higher highs and higher lows since the recent swing low Volume Behavior: Declining volume suggests imminent influx following consolidation Potential Target: Expansion into ATH price discovery if resistance breaks or holds post-correction MSTR (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The current price action on MSTR reflects a sustained bullish structure. Since establishing a swing low, the stock has consistently formed higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of trend continuation. It is now testing a significant resistance zone. If this resistance holds, a short-term correction could follow. This potential pullback may bring price back to the $362.50 support zone, an area with strong technical confluence. The value area low, 21-day exponential moving average, and 200-day moving average all converge at this level. A correction into this zone would likely establish a higher low and provide the structural base for the next upward move.

Importantly, a breakout above the current high without a correction would also signal strong bullish momentum. It would suggest continued buying pressure and increase the likelihood of price rotation into discovery mode and the formation of new all-time highs, similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs recent breakout. MSTR‚Äôs historical price action has often mirrored that of Bitcoin, and this technical alignment reinforces the bullish outlook. What to expect in the coming price action If MSTR holds above the $362.50 support region or breaks above current resistance directly, the probability of a move into all-time highs increases significantly. Traders should watch for either a structured pullback or a clean breakout, both scenarios support continued upside.

44916420,https://thecoinrise.com/canary-capital-rebrands-solana-etf-with-marinade-partnership/,1747851074,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/44916420.jpeg,Canary Capital Rebrands Solana ETF with Marinade Partnership,https://thecoinrise.com/canary-capital-rebrands-solana-etf-with-marinade-partnership/,"Canary Capital has taken a bold step forward in the race to launch a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. The asset manager recently submitted an updated Solana ETF application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crypto ETF now has a new name and a significant partnership. This move comes as the SEC has put several crypto ETF applications on hold, including Canary‚Äôs own. Canary‚Äôs Solana ETF Proposal Gets a DeFi Boost The fund is now called the Canary Marinade Solana ETF, which shows its new partnership with Marinade Finance, a popular Solana staking platform. This deal would allow the ETF to include SOL staking, making it different from other fund applications. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart confirmed the news in a recent statement. He asserted that the Solana ETF rebranding is linked to Canary‚Äôs partnership with Marinade. This shows a growing trend of companies adding decentralized finance (DeFi) features to regular investment products. Marinade Finance gave clues about the partnership earlier this week, creating excitement before the official news. SEC Delays Mount Across Crypto ETF Filings Despite Canary Capital‚Äôs fresh update, the SEC has delayed its decision on the fund. The next review date is now August 17. This delay is part of a broader slowdown, as the Commission also postponed decisions on Solana ETF applications from 21Shares and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Canada is on the verge of making history in cryptocurrency by becoming the first country to approve and launch spot Solana ETFs . Seyffart thinks the SEC will unlikely approve crypto ETFs like Solana or XRP before late June or early July. He believes a better chance for approval is in early Q4. This depends on market conditions and rules becoming more friendly to crypto-backed investment vehicles. SOL and XRP ETFs Still Lead in Approval Odds Even with the delays, the crypto community remains optimistic. According to Polymarket data, the XRP and Solana ETFs still have the most substantial chances of approval this year. Also, Pantera Capital is positive that Solana ETFs will be getting approval next. This follows recent delays in Grayscale‚Äôs Dogecoin and XRP ETF filings and 21Shares‚Äô XRP ETF filings. Although the timeline is still uncertain, Canary Capital‚Äôs new filing and Marinade partnership might give it an advantage in the competitive crypto ETF market. While the SEC is still deciding, the race to launch the first Solana ETF is getting more intense as Grayscale has also joined the growing list. At the same time, the market sentiment surrounding Solana (SOL) ‚Äòs value is positive. According to CoinMarketCap data , the digital coin is trading at $170,32, up by 2.50% in the last 24 hours.

As Bitcoin gains traction, three altcoins stand out with possible explosive growth ahead. For those keen on the next big opportunities in the crypto world, the following coins may be primed for remarkable advances. Avalanche's Volatile Journey and Key Price Levels AVAX price action shows a 14% advance in the last month paired with a stark 38% decline over the past six months and a recent weekly drop of roughly 13%. Past movements reveal swift reversals and recovery periods that highlight a fluctuating market history. Momentum has shifted rapidly, emphasizing the potential gains and risks traders faced during these phases. Currently, the coin trades between $16 and $24 with immediate resistance around $27.94 and support near $11.13. The absence of a clear trend creates mixed signals, as slight upward momentum competes with bearish pressures. Traders may consider short-term plays within this range, looking to test the $36.34 resistance if bullish energy builds further. Maker's Price Dynamics Amid Short-Term Volatility Maker exhibited notable short-term activity with a robust month-on-month gain of 26.49%, while its half-year progress remained modest at a 4.70% increase. Recent price swings underline active market participation with a one-week drop of 9.36%, reflecting dynamic fluctuations and a mix of buying and selling actions that shaped its performance over these intervals. Current trading levels reveal Maker oscillating between $1082 and $1836, with key support at $687 and resistance at $2195. Bulls appear to be trying to push higher, but bears have interjected, as seen in the recent decline and mixed momentum indicators. Traders may find opportunities by watching for potential reversals near support and breakout moves at resistance. IOTA Sees Strong Monthly Gains and Consistent Growth Over Six Months Past data shows a 33.84% price increase in the last month and a 28.09% gain over six months. IOTA has delivered notable short-term strength while maintaining moderate upward progress over a longer period. The overall performance indicates renewed market interest and a shift toward bullish sentiment, with investors reacting well to recent moves. The price now trades between $0.144 and $0.256 with immediate resistance at $0.30 and secondary resistance at $0.42, and support around $0.08. Technical indicators are mixed with a near-neutral RSI of 51.26. The market appears range-bound, suggesting traders could consider buying near support and watch for a breakout above resistance levels for potential gains. Conclusion Bitcoin's rise in value might signal that several other cryptocurrencies could see significant growth. AVAX , MKR , and IOTA are three coins that show potential. These altcoins could benefit from the increased interest and investment in the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues its upward trend, a ripple effect may occur, driving more attention to these promising altcoins. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Several altcoins have bounced off their respective support levels, signaling a positive sentiment. Analysts expect Bitcoin to maintain its positive momentum and surge above $200,000 by the end of the year. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose to a new all-time high on May 21 on easing macroeconomic fears and continued inflows into the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Analysts expect the momentum to continue and Bitcoin to surge to $200,000 by the end of the year. There are some murmurs among analysts about a bearish divergence, leading to a double-top pattern. However, private wealth manager Swissblock Technologies said in a post on X that its Bitcoin Fundamental Index is not showing any bearish divergence , and the onchain strength remains intact. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Bitcoin is on the verge of forming a ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù on the daily chart, which generally is followed by sharp rallies , barring a few instances when the pattern failed. Bitcoin‚Äôs strength is expected to improve sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector, pulling several altcoins higher. What are the possible target levels for Bitcoin? Could altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels? Let‚Äôs analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin rose above the $109,588 overhead resistance, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If the price closes above $109,588, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and skyrocket toward $130,000. The 20-day exponential moving average ($101,958) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological support of $100,000. Ether price prediction Buyers are trying to sustain Ether ( ETH ) above the $2,550 level but are facing significant resistance from the bears. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,334) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in control. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000. Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35). XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the BNB/USDT pair could skyrocket to the overhead resistance at $745. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price prediction Sellers failed to pull Solana ( SOL ) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to propel the price above the $185 overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220. If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145). That suggests a possible range-bound action between $120 and $180. Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has bounced off the breakout level of $0.21, indicating that buyers are active at lower levels. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($0.21) is trending up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, signaling that buyers are in command. The DOGE/USDT pair could rally to the $0.26 level, which could attract sellers. If the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance, the pair could form a narrow range between $0.26 and $0.21 for some time. Contrarily, a break and close above $0.26 signals the start of the next leg of the up move. The pair could then surge to $0.35. Cardano price prediction The bulls have kept Cardano ( ADA ) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern during the pullback. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.74) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the bulls have an edge. Buyers will have to thrust the price above $0.86 to signal the resumption of the uptrend. The ADA/USDT pair could then skyrocket to $1.01. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($0.69). That suggests the bulls are losing their grip, increasing the risk of a fall to $0.60. Related: Bitcoin enters ‚Äòacceleration phase‚Äô resembling BTC price gains seen after Trump election victory Sui price prediction Sui‚Äôs ( SUI ) pullback has taken support at the 20-day EMA ($3.73), indicating a positive sentiment. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. The SUI/USDT pair could reach the $4.25 obstacle, where the sellers are expected to step in. If buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, it increases the likelihood of a break above $4.25. The pair may then climb to $5. The 20-day EMA is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($3.04). Chainlink price prediction Buyers successfully defended the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern in Chainlink ( LINK ), indicating buying on dips. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls are trying to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the resistance line. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $18. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $18, but the rally could extend to $19.80 if the bulls prevail. Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 50-day SMA. The pair may then remain inside the channel for a few more days. Avalanche price prediction Avalanche ( AVAX ) took support at the 50-day SMA ($20.88), signaling that the bulls are trying to form a higher low. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Buyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the $23.50 resistance to gain the upper hand. The AVAX/USDT pair could then climb to $26.84, which may act as a hurdle. If buyers overcome the $26.84 barrier, the pair could ascend to $31.73 and subsequently to $36. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it suggests that the bulls have given up. The pair could then decline to $18.50.

As Bitcoin flirts with its all-time high, analysts are closely watching LTC for signs of a potential breakout or breakdown. The current price action shows consolidation near a crucial demand zone, which has historically served as a pivot for Litecoin‚Äôs major moves. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility ‚Äì High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key While bullish sentiment is building across the crypto market, not all analysts are convinced. Some warn that if Bitcoin fails to break into price discovery and the broader market stalls, Litecoin could face renewed selling pressure. However, top analyst Carl Runefelt remains optimistic, sharing a technical view that suggests Litecoin is forming a bullish flag pattern on the chart‚Äîa structure that often precedes strong upward continuation. Runefelt‚Äôs target points to a breakout above the current range, supported by healthy market structure and recent gains. Still, the coming days will determine whether LTC follows through with a rally or pulls back. For now, Litecoin stands at a technical crossroads, with both opportunity and risk on the table. Litecoin Eyes Breakout As Market Awaits BTC Confirmation Litecoin is currently trading at a pivotal level, caught in the middle of growing speculation about the market‚Äôs next major move. After a powerful 69% rally over the past month, LTC has entered a phase of consolidation, holding just above a crucial support level. The broader crypto market is in a similar position, with investors watching closely for a potential breakout in Bitcoin that could pull the rest of the market higher. As Bitcoin hovers just below its all-time high, Litecoin traders are holding their breath. Many believe that a breakout above the $109K mark for BTC could serve as a catalyst for altcoins, especially LTC. But not everyone agrees‚Äîsome analysts expect the market to cool down first, leading to a deeper correction before any renewed upside. Runefelt is firmly in the bullish camp. He recently shared a technical analysis highlighting a bullish flag pattern forming on Litecoin‚Äôs chart. According to Runefelt, Litecoin has already bounced from support, and this setup presents a high-probability breakout scenario. His price target for the move is $117.5, which would mark a significant push higher from current levels. Runefelt‚Äôs view aligns with the broader bullish sentiment that‚Äôs slowly rebuilding across the market. However, the confirmation remains dependent on both Litecoin‚Äôs ability to break above short-term resistance and Bitcoin‚Äôs performance near its all-time high. For now, LTC investors remain cautiously optimistic, aware that momentum could shift quickly depending on macro market developments. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades ‚Äì Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Technical Details: Key Levels To Watch Litecoin (LTC) is currently trading at $95.35, showing resilience after a brief pullback from its recent local high near $106. The chart highlights a period of consolidation, with LTC finding support just above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $93.82 and slightly below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $100.76. These two moving averages are now acting as a technical pivot zone, creating both resistance and support that could define LTC‚Äôs next move. After a strong rally from April lows around $66, Litecoin surged over 69% before facing resistance at the psychological $100 level. The price is now hovering in a tightening range, which could develop into a bullish continuation pattern‚Äîespecially if broader market sentiment remains positive and Bitcoin pushes above its all-time high. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal ‚Äì Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Volume has slightly decreased during the recent pullback, indicating a lack of strong selling pressure. This supports the bullish thesis that the current move is a healthy consolidation rather than the start of a reversal. A breakout above the $100.76 resistance would open the door toward the $117.50 target, as mentioned by analysts like Carl Runefelt.

On the other hand, a push above EMA20 trend line might trigger a retest of $0.26 level for the DOGE price. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.491 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE‚Äôs price decreased to $0.225 over the last 24 hours as bearish pressure rose around immediate resistance channels. Moreover, sellers are currently dominating the price action.

It‚Äôs expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin‚Äôs current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2029. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,849.48 DOGE in May; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future?

Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.414 on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.37 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin‚Äôs price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March‚Äôs bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February.

After hitting a record of $109,754, BTC quickly fell to about 3% to the $106,000 area. At press time, the top cryptocurrency was trading just above $107,000 according to CoinDesk‚Äôs Bitcoin Price Index , modestly lower over the past 24 hours. Other cryptocurrencies took a hit as well, with ether ETH and solana SOL also slightly lower over the last day despite the early Wednesday run higher. The reason behind the price action may be as simple as traders taking profits on the quick rise ‚Äî bitcoin was higher by nearly 50% since bottoming about five weeks ago. Likely contributing was the ripple effect of a U.S. treasury bond auction going awry and hitting risk assets. A sale of 20-Year bonds sold by the U.S. Treasury department saw weak demand, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury spiking to 5.07%, its highest level in more than two years. Time bomb The Nasdaq tumbled 1.5% in just an hour shortly after the news, while the S&P 500 declined 1.3%. ""This is a ticking time bomb, swept under the rug,‚Äù said Josh Mandell, a longtime fixed-income veteran turned bitcoin analyst, prior to this afternoon's poor bond sale. ‚ÄúWe used to talk about the disaster that would ensue if ever there was a ‚ÄòMISSED AUCTION‚Äô in 30-yr bonds,‚Äù Mandell said. ‚ÄúA missed auction means that there were not enough bids to cover the offering‚Ä¶ Were it not for the Fed, we would be experiencing a failure to roll over bonds right now which leads to default.‚Äù Kirill Kretov, trading automation expert at CoinPanel, said that liquidity from exchanges has been significantly removed since late 2024, ""making the market thinner and more reactive,"" leaving bitcoin's price vulnerable to wild swings. ""Structurally, there‚Äôs room for explosive upside,"" he said, but ""a sharp correction can happen at any moment."" The $110,000 level has emerged as a key battleground in the current market structure, well-followed crypto trader Skew noted in an X post , describing it as the critical zone between a local high and a potential breakout point. According to Skew, there's a noticeable concentration of supply around this level, with Binance perpetuals showing a skewed ask-side order book and a buildup of short positions.

Here‚Äôs why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-xrp-is-an-insane-opportunity-heres-why/,"XRP remains a key focus for crypto analysts who continue to emphasize its potential for significant price appreciation, even amid short-term market pullbacks. A recent assessment by a widely-followed market commentator, known as ‚ÄúThe Analyst,‚Äù identifies a technical pattern that could lead to a major upward movement in XRP‚Äôs price. Following a recent decline of nearly 14%, the token currently trades around $2.33. This correction comes after the cryptocurrency surged to $2.655, a level it had not reached since March, spurred by Bitcoin‚Äôs rise above the $100,000 threshold. However, the current downward adjustment has not diminished optimism among analysts who believe XRP is forming the basis for another strong rally. $XRP minimum target is 6.5$ Possibly up to 9.5$ This is an insane opportunity. pic.twitter.com/Xjoxh1gZwS ‚Äî The Analyst (@MMatters22596) May 18, 2025 XRP Poised for Further Upside, Analyst Claims According to The Analyst‚Äôs breakdown shared on May 18, XRP has completed a classic five-wave Elliott Wave structure on the daily chart. The initial wave began in November 2024 with a notable 500% price increase, and the fifth wave concluded in January 2025 at a high of $3.399. Since then, XRP has experienced a series of pullbacks but has consistently bounced from a key descending support line. One notable recovery occurred after the asset declined to the $1.614 level, which coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, often viewed as a significant technical support region. This alignment led to a renewed upward movement, reinforcing the view that the market structure remains bullish. The Analyst suggests that a successful retest of the $3.40 resistance, previously established during the January peak, could open the door for a move to the $6.50 mark, representing a potential gain of over 180% from current prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This target corresponds with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. The report further anticipates that $6.50 is merely a conservative estimate, with a higher range of up to $9.50 also in consideration, which would equate to a 313% increase from current trading levels. Broader Market Supports Bullish Outlook The Analyst is not the only voice projecting strong upside for XRP. Other notable market watchers, including ‚Äú The Modern Investor ‚Äù and ‚ÄúDK64Trades,‚Äù have similarly projected price targets above $9. One of them expects XRP to reach this level by September 2025, while another suggests that prices above $10 are achievable in the current cycle, referencing XRP‚Äôs previous performance in early 2018. Downside Risks Remain Despite the optimistic outlook, some analysts urge caution. Ali Martinez, another respected market expert, has pointed out a potentially bearish technical pattern forming on the hourly chart. Specifically, he highlighted a head-and-shoulders setup with $2.30 acting as the key support level. Should this support fail, Martinez warns that XRP could retreat toward the $2.00 range, its trading level earlier this month.

The firm‚Äôs latest research report reveals that public miners sold 115% of their bitcoin production in April ‚Äî meaning they sold more than they produced. That is the highest ratio since the tail end of the 2022 bear market. Even today, with bitcoin breaking to a new record high above $109,000, hashprice (what miners earn per unit of computational power) has failed to follow suit. It stands at just $55 per petahash per second (PH/s), well below the $63/PH/s level it briefly reached the last time bitcoin crossed $100,000 in December. Elevated network difficulty and weak transaction fees have kept revenues under pressure. Top players in the mining space are expanding regardless. CleanSpark‚Äôs (CLSK) hashrate surpassed 40 EH/s, and IREN (IREN), which recently overtook Riot Platforms (RIOT) as the third largest public miner in terms of realized hashrate, posted a 25% jump in hash power and is now targeting a total of 50 EH/s by June. Cango (CANG), meanwhile, is eyeing another 18 EH/s by July. MARA Holdings' (MARA) installed hashrate is still the highest at 57.3 EH/s, according to a Tuesday report by investment bank Jefferies. IREN had the highest implied uptime at around 97%, followed by HIVE Digital Technologies (HIVE) at about 96%, the report added. Meanwhile, a shift is taking place in how miners are securing new hardware. Several public firms have inked deals with Bitmain that allow them to pay for mining rigs in bitcoin while retaining the right to repurchase their coins at a predetermined price ‚Äî a hedge against further price rallies. Mining stocks, battered in the first quarter, have bounced back ‚Äî some by more than 60% in April alone ‚Äî though most remain down year-to-date.

Experienced commodity trader and economist Peter Brandt and cryptocurrency analyst il Capo of Crypto evaluated the rise from different perspectives. Peter Brandt, who has been following the Bitcoin markets for a long time, argued that the ATH level should not be exaggerated technically, and stated that the rise is a natural process. According to Brandt, new records should not be exaggerated from a technical perspective, because the definition of a bull market is that it constantly makes new highs. Brandt predicts that Bitcoin could rise to and peak in the $125,000 to $150,000 range by the end of August. Related News: BREAKING: Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Price Record - Celebration in the Air On the other hand, the analyst known in crypto markets as ‚Äúil Capo of Crypto‚Äù takes a more cautious approach. According to the analyst, the current rise is not strong enough to change the long-term trend and these levels may be a local peak. The analyst states that he has realized some of his profits and opened short positions in both Bitcoin and leading altcoins. He also plans to increase his altcoin shorts in case of further bearish signals regarding the direction of the market. il Capo stated that the recent BTC record did not change his views and that he believed the rise was a bull trap. *This is not investment advice.

The Graph ( GRT ) announced that this adoption of the Chainlink ( LINK ) interoperability standard will allow users to bridge GRT across multiple blockchains, including Solana, Arbitrum and Base. Tapping into Chainlink‚Äôs cross-chain interoperability protocol is a key step towards the expansion of GRT‚Äôs accessibility and utility, The Graph team noted in a blog post. GRT support for Solana is a major move that will boost not just the SOL ecosystem, but broader blockchain space. ‚ÄúExtending GRT‚Äôs availability to Solana paves the way for deeper collaboration with Solana‚Äôs developer and user communities,‚Äù the indexing protocol stated. CCIP integration will bring cross-chain functionality and features such as cross-chain staking, delegation, and query fee payments.

This is the latest attempt at kidnapping in the wave of crypto whale kidnappings. The founder of Mitroplus Labs, Festo Ivaibi, was kidnapped on May 17 near his home on Bunamwaya Road in Kampala, Uganda. According to Mitroplus‚Äôs Afro Token Project statement, the attackers were armed and dressed in military uniforms. They said they were ‚Äúsecurity operatives‚Äù of the Uganda People‚Äôs Defence Forces (UPDF). CRYPTO ABDUCTION IN UGANDA. On Saturday, May 17th 2025, our founder @IvaibiFesto was abducted by individuals posing as security agents( @MODVA_UPDF ) and forced under duress, to release his crypto assets. We thank God he is now safe, and all systems have been secured. This is‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/ipZkrwTv95 ‚Äî Afro Token (@AfroTokenSUN) May 19, 2025 Mitroplus Labs described the incident as more than just a personal attack. They said, ‚Äú What happened to our founder was not just an attack on one man, it was an attack on innovation, on education, and on the future of Africa‚Äôs digital economy.‚Äù Two Chinese citizens identified among the attackers Following the incident, Uganda‚Äôs revenue agency reportedly granted Ivaibi access to its police command center. This allowed him to review street camera footage in hopes of advancing the investigation. ‚ÄúPolice have dismissed these cases, citing unregulated cryptocurrency and individual risk. However, as Mitroplus Labs, we‚Äôve engaged with the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) on crypto taxation and participated in knowledge-sharing sessions on blockchain, AI, and cryptocurrencies. I‚Äôm registered as a cryptocurrency trader with the Revenue Authority, have filed tax returns, and faced penalties for late filings,‚Äù Ivaibi said. Mitroplus Labs said the attack is part of a coordinated pattern involving spies pretending to be crypto traders, law enforcement officers, and two Chinese citizens. The company also said that at least 48 similar attacks have been identified, with many cases being dismissed. The targeting of an African crypto entrepreneur comes just days after a failed attempt to abduct the daughter of the CEO of a crypto exchange in Paris, France. Before that, several crypto influencers and individuals known to hold millions of dollars in crypto were also targeted and lost funds to criminal gangs seemingly operating in France. The latest event finally pushed the French government to say it would take steps to protect crypto workers, their families, and the whole industry. In addition, David Balland, co-founder of the hardware wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped and cut up as part of a ransom demand earlier this year. A crypto broker broke both ankles in February while trying to get away from his kidnappers. This month, the father of a crypto entrepreneur was freed by cops after being held hostage and asked for a crypto ransom of almost $8 million. Also, as reported by Cryptopolitan, a young woman and her toddler were attacked in Paris over crypto assets. Crypto leaders are again faced with a critical problem. According to Michael Pearl, vice president of strategy at a blockchain security firm, security methods such as multi-factor authentication could help make ‚Äúforced transfers harder to execute without alerting others.‚Äù Afro Tokens drop after the attack A share of the funds came from Afro Token, a meme coin Mitroplus Labs had issued on the Tron blockchain using the SunPump platform. The attackers sold some Afro Tokens during the attack, which caused the token price to drop for a short time. The statement did say, though, that no community funds were hacked or touched during the attack. Other funds were reportedly sent to a wallet on Binance. On-chain data shows that the token‚Äôs value has dropped by about 16.7% since the attack day. Its market cap is now only about $1.6 million, down from over $7.3 million in December of last year.

With Circle currently managing over $61 billion in USDC, a successful takeover could significantly reshape Ripple‚Äôs position in the stablecoin landscape. Ripple‚Äôs Acquisition Strategy Ripple‚Äôs strategic focus this year has involved multiple acquisitions aimed at strengthening its infrastructure. After acquiring Hidden Road , a prime brokerage platform for digital assets, for $1.25 billion earlier this year, Ripple is now attempting to secure a much larger deal with Circle. The company initially made an offer in the $4‚Äì$5 billion range in April, which Circle turned down. Around the same time, Circle submitted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public under the ticker ‚ÄúCRCL‚Äù on the New York Stock Exchange, targeting a similar valuation. More recently, however, Circle has entered preliminary discussions with both Ripple and Coinbase regarding new offers reportedly ranging between $6 billion and $11 billion. If Ripple succeeds, the acquisition would give it oversight over two major stablecoins: its own RLUSD and the market-leading USDC. This consolidation could elevate Ripple‚Äôs influence over digital dollar transactions within the crypto ecosystem. Potential Implications for XRP In light of this development, two AI platforms, ChatGPT and Grok, were asked to provide forecasts for XRP‚Äôs price should Ripple finalize the Circle acquisition. ChatGPT‚Äôs Base and Optimistic Scenarios ChatGPT estimated that in a moderate scenario, assuming the acquisition closes within a $6‚Äì$8 billion range and integration proceeds smoothly, XRP could rise to between $3.50 and $4.50. The reasoning was that enhanced liquidity and network activity, driven by Ripple‚Äôs broader reach in stablecoin operations, would likely increase demand for XRP. In a more favourable outlook, ChatGPT projected that XRP could climb as high as $6 to $10. This scenario assumes Ripple successfully merges USDC with Ripple Payments, achieves wider adoption of its services globally, and experiences increased transaction volumes. The model noted that these outcomes depend on market-wide bullish trends and seamless integration of both RLUSD and USDC. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Grok‚Äôs Assessment of the Market Impact Similarly, Grok‚Äôs baseline forecast suggested XRP could appreciate to the $3.50‚Äì$4.50 range. It emphasized that while stablecoins do not directly determine XRP‚Äôs price, their successful integration into Ripple Payments could enhance XRP‚Äôs role as a settlement token, increasing its utility and relevance. Grok‚Äôs best-case analysis placed XRP in the $6 to $8 range. This projection rests on several assumptions, one of which is that if Ripple successfully absorbs Circle, Ripple Payments scales up to handle trillions in cross-border transactions annually, and XRP continues to be used as a bridge currency. It also factored in the possibility of a broad market uptrend, including Bitcoin reaching $150,000. Despite the positive projections, both AI systems noted that risks exist. Funding such a large transaction could strain Ripple‚Äôs financial resources and potentially require sales from its XRP reserves, which might impact price stability. In addition, unresolved regulatory issues, as well as competition from other potential buyers such as Coinbase, could complicate or delay the deal. Broader macroeconomic factors and shifts in investor sentiment will also play a crucial role in determining XRP‚Äôs future price movements. Currently, the crypto community is closely watching developments between Ripple and Circle, recognizing that the outcome could have significant implications for XRP‚Äôs valuation and Ripple‚Äôs role in the global payments infrastructure.

The strategy aims to improve cooperation between member states and remove barriers in areas such as finance, energy, and telecommunications. It also plans to assist small‚Äîand medium-sized businesses in growth and digitalization while reducing investment barriers. Created over three decades ago, the EU‚Äôs single market links 26 million companies with 450 million consumers and generates about ‚Ç¨18 trillion ($20.4 trillion) in yearly output. Yet officials say lingering rules and costs still hold back trade and investment inside the bloc. ‚ÄúThe current global context calls for the political will to tackle remaining barriers once and for all. It is time to make the European market work, it is time to choose Europe,‚Äù the Commission wrote in its strategy paper. At the heart of the proposal is a promise to strip away around ‚Ç¨400 million in administrative costs every year. Brussels wants local companies to ‚Äúbuy European‚Äù Brussels also wants to speed up work on shared standards for energy grids, 5G networks, and financial services so that companies can scale across borders with less delay. Trump‚Äôs administration has already imposed duties on steel, aluminium, and a range of other products. Those steps, combined with concern about American dominance in advanced technology, have fed calls in Europe for greater economic self-reliance. St√©phane S√©journ√©, the Commission‚Äôs executive vice-president for industry and the internal market, presented the plan on Wednesday. One key measure is a change to public procurement rules that would let national and local authorities ‚Äúbuy European‚Äù and shut out non-EU bidders on strategic contracts. S√©journ√© referred to the idea as a ‚ÄúBuy European Act‚Äù and said it would balance openness with realism. ‚ÄúThere is a will to remain a continent that is exporting internationally and at the same time to be lucid and less naive about strategic sectors,‚Äù S√©journ√© said. If EU governments back the proposal next year, they could refuse offers from overseas companies for public-sector projects ranging from road building to digital infrastructure. Today‚Äôs EU and World Trade Organization rules forbid favouring local suppliers, so the shift would mark a major break with the bloc‚Äôs free-trade stance. Supporters argue that excluding lower-priced rivals from China and elsewhere will safeguard key industries. Critics warn that other countries could retaliate by filing cases at the WTO. S√©journ√©, a former French foreign minister and close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, has long pressed for Europe to be more autonomous. He described the procurement change as a ‚Äúfirst step,‚Äù adding that officials will later examine private-sector transactions ‚Äúwith arguments around safety and economic security‚Äù to decide where extra safeguards may be needed. Digital independence is another focal point for EU European regulators are drafting separate rules for the cloud-computing market, now dominated by US groups Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The new legislation is expected to include ‚Äúbuy European‚Äù elements similar to those in Wednesday‚Äôs package. S√©journ√© did not list target industries but signalled urgency wherever the bloc relies on a single foreign source. ‚ÄúIn tech, we‚Äôre very, very dependent on the Americans. In raw materials, we‚Äôre 100 per cent dependent on the Chinese. These are sectors, in the current geopolitical context, we don‚Äôt want future generations blaming us for not having acted,‚Äù he said. Despite the challenges, S√©journ√© sees openings. The EU economy has struggled since the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy shock that followed Russia‚Äôs 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Companies complain that stringent climate rules raise costs, cheap Chinese imports undercut prices, and US tariffs squeeze margins. Yet S√©journ√© argued that Europe is in an ‚Äúalmost ideal‚Äù position because ‚Äúthe Americans remain our partners and the Chinese want to strengthen the partnership.‚Äù With careful negotiation, S√©journ√© believes the bloc can ‚Äúmake progress on many big difficulties with the Chinese in many sectors.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

During these three months, XRP rose from $0.50 in early November to a peak of $3.40 in January, representing a cumulative increase of 580%. This movement marked one of XRP‚Äôs most significant rallies in recent years and positioned the asset as one of the top performers during that cycle. The rally began shortly after the results of the U.S. presidential election , which led to renewed investor confidence and a bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency sector. XRP, which had faced downward pressure throughout much of 2024, rebounded sharply in November with a 283% monthly gain. It continued its upward trend with more modest increases in December before reaching its local high in January 2025. Price Movement Since the Rally and Market Sentiment Since reaching the $3.40 mark, XRP has experienced a correction and currently trades below $3. However, it continues to hold key support around the $2 level. Although the broader market has cooled significantly since the early 2025 rally, XRP has managed to retain a relatively strong position compared to other assets in its class. This price stability has led to renewed bullish projections. Some analysts believe XRP is well-positioned for another significant run, particularly if favourable market conditions return. According to Rob Cunningham , a well-known community researcher, XRP could realistically climb into the $5 to $15 range within the short term. Another market analyst, who specializes in Elliott Wave theory, recently projected a breakout toward the $10 mark. What Would a Repeat of the 580% Surge Look Like? The idea of XRP repeating its previous 580% rise has become a topic of interest among market participants. At the time of writing, the token trades around $2.33. If the asset were to increase by 580% from this level, it would reach approximately $15.90. This figure aligns closely with earlier forecasts from both Cunningham and other analysts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical projections also support the possibility of XRP reaching these levels. In October 2024, just before the initial rally, analysts such as Lud predicted XRP could hit $16, referencing historical trends. Similarly, analyst EGRAG Crypto cited statistical modeling to suggest XRP could target $9.30 and even $16 in a bullish scenario. Long-Term Forecasts Remain Mixed While some short-term projections are optimistic, long-term forecasts vary. Analysts at Changelly , a cryptocurrency exchange platform, estimate that XRP may not reach the $16 mark until 2029. In contrast, researchers at Telegaon suggest a more accelerated timeline, predicting that the $16 price point could be achieved as early as 2027. XRP has demonstrated the ability to produce substantial gains within a short timeframe, as seen in its previous 580% rally. Although current market conditions are more restrained, several analysts remain confident that the token could approach or exceed its prior highs if another bullish cycle takes hold.

According to the filing submitted by legal firm Latham and Watkins LLP, 69,461Coinbase users were compromised by the breach, 217 of whom are residents of the US state of Maine. The document also indicates the breach occurred on Dec. 26, 2024, but was only discovered on May 11, 2025 ‚Äî nearly six months following the cybersecurity incident. Coinbase now faces a flurry of lawsuits from affected clients, who argue that the exchange failed to notify victims of the security breach in a timely manner. The attack caused $400 million in losses through social engineering scams and remediation costs, Coinbase has said. Cointelegraph contacted Coinbase for comment, but had not received a response at time of publication. Coinbase data breach incident details. Source: Maine Attorney General The data breach sparked debate about the ethics of Know Your Customer (KYC) data collection, which some argue adds risks to crypto holders. The incident also reflects the growing number of cybersecurity incidents plaguing the industry. Related: Coinbase faces lawsuit over alleged breaches of Illinois biometric privacy law The Coinbase data breach sends shockwaves through the crypto world Coinbase became the target of a ransom attempt after scammers convinced several Coinbase customer service representatives to hand over limited user information , including client names, contact information, and physical addresses. The scammers then attempted to extort the company into paying a ransom of $20 million in exchange for not leaking the data. However, Coinbase refused to negotiate with the threat actors. The crypto exchange fired the contractors who collaborated with the scammers to hand over the user data and also promised remediation or reimbursements for any impacted clients. Despite the remediation efforts, shares of Coinbase slid by 7% following news of the data breach and the subsequent extortion attempt. Later reports revealed that Roelof Botha, a partner at venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, was also a victim of the data leak , suggesting that the incident also impacted other individuals or entities tied to the VC firm. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) opened a probe into the leak ; it hadn‚Äôt published updates on the incident or the extortion attempt as of May 21. Industry executives, investors, and legal experts have warned that such data leaks threaten the physical safety of crypto investors by making them the targets of extortion attempts, kidnapping, and armed robbery.

The number of addresses with up to 0.1 or more SOL hit a new all-time high. This falls within the range of small retail wallets showing strong optimism over two quarters. Most retail interests can be linked to growing DeFi activities, suggesting a sustained price surge. DeFi Sparks Fresh Demand On-chain data shows that 11.6 million wallets have at least $0.1 SOL, signaling systemic adoption growth. The soaring retail holders are a major shift from other networks that have seen whales swallow small holder positions. For Solana, retail adopters are spiking for various reasons, including an imminent price rally and an influx of DeFi services on the network. In December 2024, the figure reached 9 million, with analysts projecting a bullish year marked with favourable macro factors. Despite a weak start due to extended trade wars, Solana‚Äôs network activity grew, drawing institutional attention. At the time of writing, total value locked (TVL) on the ecosystem surged past $10.9 billion. The network‚Äôs TVL has surpassed Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum and is positioned to attract more users in the coming months. Solana‚Äôs decentralized application (DApp) revenue also hit the highest point in three months due to a spike in staking interest. Furthermore, the frenzy around Solana meme coins placed adoption in top gear. Last year, top Solana meme coins tapped new highs amid a spike in crypto adoption. Official Trump ranks highest with a $2.6 billion market capitalization, while daily trading volumes are near $1 billion. The token exchanges hands at $14.22, a 6% upswing today. Meanwhile, BONK, Fartcoin, and dogwifhat are next with rising community support. Institutional Funds: A Necessity For Solana Solana‚Äôs uphill price climb cannot solely be sustained with retail demand reaching an all-time high. The network saw a similar spike in institutional activity in the same period. Data from CoinShares shows consecutive weekly inflows to Solana funds. In addition to on-chain factors, these inflows heightened bull pressure in Q4 2024, setting the benchmark this year. The clamor for spot Solana ETFs in the United States fueled optimism for a mega price rally ahead. SOL is expected to notch huge inflows after approval as an institutional favorite asset.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|ARB|BONK,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 19:54:37

In a new video update on YouTube, Gromen, founder of investment firm Forest For The Trees (FFTT), says that the current trade war between the US and China is most likely unsustainable for the West unless capital controls are eventually implemented. Says Gromen, ‚ÄúWhat is crystal clear to me ‚Äì while I don‚Äôt know how and where and when ‚Äì but what is crystal clear is that you can‚Äôt have a trade war with the world‚Äôs factory, China, and the world‚Äôs biggest creditor, China, who has significant capital controls, China, you can‚Äôt have a very long trade war until you have to start putting in capital controls yourself, your opponents need to start putting in capital controls. It could start in Europe, that‚Äôs probably where it would, but America would have to do it, too. And I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll be explicit if we let it go that long, but it would be things like ‚Äòhey, to maintain the tax-deferred status of your pension or your 401K or your IRA, etc., you now need to hold 30% of the assets in 30-year Treasuries, have a good day‚Äô. Because if they don‚Äôt do those kinds of things, the longer the trade war drags on, once shortages start to erupt, those with open capital accounts will be a source of funds for those with more closed capital accounts.‚Äù The investor says that such a situation would require Western governments to enact capital controls, including restricting certain investments, taxing certain transactions, or blocking the flow of capital in and out of the country. Gromen says holding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold may be an effective way to weather such an environment. ‚ÄúSo then that‚Äôs when you‚Äôd have to see capital controls, and once one starts, they‚Äôre all going to have to do it relatively quickly. What does this mean? My read of it is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather be years early owning decent little chunks of gold and Bitcoin than one day late. Because when you‚Äôre one day late, too late.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This landmark stablecoin regulation bill advanced with a 66-32 majority in a preliminary vote on Monday, and was passed with broad support in this morning‚Äôs vote of 69-31. With the bill now moving into the formal debate phase, the difficult process of amendments begins. Republican and Democratic senators are lining up to add various additions to the bill. The proposed changes include ethics regulations regarding the Trump family‚Äôs crypto connections, Texas Senator Ted Cruz‚Äôs proposed ban on the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and some language improvements regarding combating money laundering. Related News: 50-year Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt Reveals What He Expects After Bitcoin's Record: He Gives a Price and Date for the Peak The most notable move came from Kansas Senator Roger Marshall, who introduced an amendment to add the entire ‚ÄúCredit Card Competition Act‚Äù (CCCA), which was introduced in 2023 and aims to increase competition in the credit card market by requiring major banks to support at least two payment networks, to the GENIUS bill. The bill, which previously failed to pass on its own, is now attempting to be ‚Äúglued‚Äù to the higher-priority stablecoin bill. However, there are objections to this move. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis has made it clear that he will withdraw his support if the CCCA is added to the bill. On the other hand, the American Bankers Association (ABA) is also reacting strongly. The association‚Äôs CEO Rob Nichols called the change a ‚Äútoxic bill,‚Äù arguing that it will result in consumers losing their card rewards and increase the risk of fraud. Nichols called out crypto advocates and urged them to side with banks against this addition.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch The current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives. Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rally For comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets. During the January bull run, Bitcoin‚Äôs price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out‚Äîa sign of a healthier market. Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph While excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally. Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.

Source: Laevitas.ch On May 21, Bitcoin options markets showed a slight increase in demand for put (sell) options, but nothing unusual. For comparison, the put-to-call ratio at Deribit dropped to 0.4x during the previous bull run on Jan. 20, reflecting lower confidence due to reduced volumes in call (buy) options. Bitcoin‚Äôs upward movement may have been limited by macroeconomic factors, especially as the tariff war continues. Still, the potential for the price to reach $110,000 and higher is partly based on the weak position of the US Federal Reserve. Injecting liquidity could ease recession concerns, but it also reduces the appeal of government bonds, which favors risk-on assets like Bitcoin.

While giants like Solana (SOL) continue to dominate headlines, a new contender is quietly building steam, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Investors swiftly completed the fourth phase of Mutuum Finance‚Äôs (MUTM) presale before progressing into the fifth stage. The project has drawn increasing interest from rational, long-term investors after raising $9 million and securing over 11,000 token holders. In Phase 5, MUTM tokens are available at $0.03. With the official launch price set at $0.06, current participants are positioned for a 2x return on investment. Dubbed by some as a potential Solana rival, this cheap altcoin is currently priced under $0.05, yet analysts believe it could deliver a 100x return by year‚Äôs end. For investors wondering what crypto to buy now to turn a small stake into life-changing gains, Mutuum Finance may be the dark horse of 2025. With innovative tech, growing community traction, and bullish sentiment, this could be the top new crypto that turns $300 into $30,000 before the next cycle peak. Surging Interest in the MUTM Presale In phase 5 of the MUTM presale investors have been rapidly increasing their contributions through 11,000 accounts which have deposited $9 million so far. Investors can access MUTM tokens during presale time before launch which grants them two benefits of increased value at $0.06 purchase price. Experts expect Mutuum Finance tokens to exceed $6 after its listing date and upcoming exchange launch will strengthen their investment value. Expanding the Mutuum Finance Ecosystem The design approach of Mutuum Finance brings together features for innovative expansion and sustainable growth through its secure and scalable architectural components and expansion possibilities. Smart contracts enable efficient lending operations on the platform. Mutuum Finance is set to launch a stablecoin on the Ethereum chain. The stablecoin will be USD-pegged to mitigate the risks of its algorithmic rivals which are known to be risky. Mutuum Finance has strengthened its position as a premier DeFi investment platform through expanded liquidity operations before its market listing. Exclusive Perks for Early Investors Mutuum Finance is set to distribute $100,000 MUTM tokens through a giveaway during its presale and provide $10,000 tokens to 10 participants. Users benefit from the referral network on the platform because new members gain extra advantages on their rewards through it. Mutuum Finance provides leading decentralized lending services by combining adjustable functionality with optimum operational performance through their dual-lending model design. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) technology empowers both lenders and borrowers through improving capital access and automatic interest rate management to gain enhanced benefits. Within the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model users establish their own individual loan agreements through its direct operating system. Mutuum Finance stands out as the leading DeFi lending service in the market through its dual-lending system. Over $9 million raised and 11,000+ investors locked in, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly proving it is more than just hype. At $0.03 in Phase 5 and launching at $0.06, investors are staring down a 2x ROI before listing even hits. Analysts now predict a 100x run by the next bull cycle peak‚Äîturning just $300 into $30,000. The next price jump to $0.035 is coming fast. Act now or miss what could be the most explosive DeFi play of 2025.

The companies also took advantage of the chance to diversify their funding sources, as uncertainty over President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs triggered big market swings. With the ECB rates at 2.25% and the Fed holding steady at 4.25% to 4.5%, data compiled by Bloomberg showed that yield spreads of 0.018% to 0.2% made borrowing in Euros significantly cheaper for U.S. firms. Notably, European interest rates were held artificially low, so it made sense for U.S. corporations to borrow where it was cheaper as long as the Euro did not appreciate too much against the U.S. dollar. The average yield on an index of U.S. corporate bonds was quoted at 5.3%, and the European equivalent was 3.18%, with the difference last month being the widest in three years. Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet Inc., raised ‚Ç¨6.75B the day after raising $5B in the United States. It will pay a coupon of 3.375% for its Euro bond maturing in 2037 and 4.5% for its U.S. dollar 2035 maturity. Financial Research data reveals corporate borrowing shift to Europe Source: Bloomberg Large U.S. companies increasingly borrow from Europe. Financial research data confirmed that corporate America was hedging across the Atlantic like never before as Pfizer (PFE), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), and others issued record Euro debt of over ‚Ç¨83B in 2025 (+35% compared to 2024)‚Äînearly 14% of overall euro corporate issuance. Anxiety from Trump‚Äôs tariff chaos, Moody‚Äôs U.S. downgrade, and U.S. dollar volatility drove them to seek alternative European financing routes in case their domestic market froze. According to the Founder of Tolou Capital Management, Spencer Hakimian, American companies were going to Europe to raise capital in Euros because it was apparently more stable, easier, and cheaper to borrow in Frankfurt than in New York. ‚ÄúYou cannot be faulted as a chief financial officer or treasurer to be accessing euros right now‚Ä¶It‚Äôs an attractive relative cost, with low coupons in a stable environment versus risking the unknown in the U.S.‚Äù ‚Äì Fabianna Del Canto , Co-head of EMEA capital markets at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. The President of International for Bank of America, Bernard Mensah, also pointed out that Europe was an incredibly wealthy region, yet much of this capital was exported largely to the USA rather than being reinvested efficiently within the EU. He added that while this opportunity still existed, the EU had yet to fully seize it. Shannon prefers reverse Yankees to U.S. dollar-denominated bonds Portfolio Manager at TwentyFour Asset Management Gordon Shannon said he preferred to reverse Yankees to U.S. dollar-denominated bonds because he would rather own German Bunds than US Treasuries . Kaspar Hense, a Fixed Income Portfolio Manager at RBC BlueBay, echoed Shannon‚Äôs sentiment by also claiming that continuously high Treasury yields driven by high U.S. debt and deficits meant high borrowing costs for U.S. households and companies. The ECB‚Äôs deposit rate was currently 1.75% lower than the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs, making borrowing in Euros much cheaper. Companies that did not need to convert their debt into U.S. dollars saved even more. Even those who made the conversion could still find advantages, such as lower costs. Investors expect the ECB to cut rates at least three more times this year after lowering them in January to 2.75%. Meanwhile, inflation in the U.S. pushed back expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, with traders now predicting just one small reduction by the end of 2025.

Chart patterns and key signals hint at a bullish movement for these tokens. Readers will discover signs that could indicate an upward trend for these cryptocurrencies. Dive in to uncover which digital assets might surge soon. Cardano Price Analysis: Monthly Gains and Current Market Dynamics Cardano experienced a 19% surge over the last month yet showed a 10% decline over the past six months, with a recent weekly drop of nearly 11% suggesting short-term bearish pressure. Price movements reflect mixed sentiment as quick gains are accompanied by corrective dips. The evolving momentum during these periods indicates intermittent optimism balanced by market caution, highlighting shifts in investor behavior. Currently, the price ranges between approximately $0.55 and $0.78, with support near $0.41 and resistance around $0.88. The market lacks a strong bullish push or clear directional force. Monitoring price action within these levels can present trading opportunities, as a breakout above $0.88 could lead to further highs, while a drop below support may signal caution for traders. XRP: Recent Surge and Technical Levels in Focus XRP showed notable upward movement over the past month, gaining 12.36%, and an impressive 86.99% increase over the last six months. A recent one-week drop of 9.59% reflects short-term volatility amid strong longer-term growth. Price advances have pushed historical trends higher, highlighting XRP‚Äôs dynamic momentum and market recognition during this period. Current pricing centers around a range of $1.75 to $2.50. The nearest resistance is at $2.80, while support is anchored around $1.31, with second resistance and support levels at $3.55 and $0.56, respectively. Bulls and bears appear balanced, showing no clear trend. Traders may consider buying near support and selling as the price approaches resistance levels. Conclusion ADA is maintaining its recent breakout level, showing stability and strength. XRP is gathering momentum just below a key resistance. Both coins exhibit technical signals hinting at a potential upward move. The market shows promising signs for ADA and XRP, suggesting room for gains if positive factors align.

The company said its strategy aims to buy BTC exposure at lower prices than the market, which could increase the asset‚Äôs price per share. This would also support its long-term goal of performing better than the flagship cryptocurrency. To move forward with the transaction, Strive intends to submit a full filing with the SEC outlining the terms of the proposal. Asset Entities (ASST), a social media marketing firm that will soon merge with the company, will then distribute a proxy statement and prospectus to stakeholders for approval. Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, handled about 70% of global BTC transactions before its collapse in 2014 due to several security breaches that led to the theft of approximately 750,000 BTC. This resulted in the platform filing for bankruptcy, which ended in a lengthy rehabilitation process to compensate creditors. Since the Japan-based exchange is scheduled to complete repayments by October 31, Strive must secure shareholder approval before then. Merger Details Earlier this month, Strive announced its upcoming merger with Asset Entities. If approved, the deal would create the first publicly-traded asset management firm focused on BTC. The new entity will operate under the ASST brand with plans to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Strive also said it will use tax-efficient methods to increase Bitcoin exposure per share. This includes giving investors the option to trade it for stock under Section 351 of the U.S. tax code to reduce tax costs. The firm plans to raise up to $1 billion through equity and debt offerings, which will be used to buy the digital asset in ways that reduce shareholder dilution. The investment company aims to use reverse mergers, discounted purchases, and hedging strategies to support shareholder value. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive, will lead the combined enterprise. The latest development comes as other firms continue expanding their Bitcoin reserves. Strategy recently disclosed a purchase of 7,390 BTC for $764.9 million, bringing its total to 576,230 BTC. Japan-based Metaplanet also added 1,004 BTC, increasing its holdings to 7,800 BTC. The post Strive Asset Management Eyes $8B in Bitcoin from Mt.

According to market analyst Trading Heights, ‚ÄúBTC is brewing within this converging triangle with decreasing volume, which is a common indicator of potential for a breakout.‚Äù Source: Trading Heights Based on this analysis, Bitcoin finds itself inside a converging triangle, which might trigger the bullish momentum needed for the apex cryptocurrency to skyrocket to $116,000. If approved, Bitcoin will shatter its current all-time high of $108,786 and set a new historic high. According to CoinGecko data, BTC was up by 24.4% in the past month to hit $108,593 at the time of writing. Will Interest Rate Cuts Boost Bitcoin‚Äôs Chances of a New All-Time High? President Donald Trump continues to make calls about interest rate cuts. Taking on X, formerly Twitter, President Trump pointed out that the Fed ought to cut interest rates sooner rather than later. Source: Twitter This would be a welcome move in the crypto market because lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper. The money supply would increase in the process since investors and consumers could take more loans and spend more freely. As a result, more liquidity usually finds its way into riskier assets, such as stocks and Bitcoin. Therefore, interest rate cuts will enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs chances of hitting new historic highs, thanks to heightened demand. Meanwhile, Bitcoin enjoys a remarkable hodl culture, given that whales recently offloaded more than 17,000 BTC in just a week. Furthermore, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has acquired an additional 1,004 BTC for $104.3 million, bringing its total holdings to 7,800 BTC.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 20:11:52
