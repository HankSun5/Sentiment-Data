CZ said he never met President Donald Trump, never discussed any deal with him, and did not have financial ties with any member of Trump’s family. The Binance founder said the pardon surprised him because there was no hint of timing or progress during the petition process. He said his lawyers filed the request in April, but he never received updates before the decision came down. When asked about Trump saying he didn’t know him , CZ said Trump meant they didn’t have a personal relationship. “We have never met. We have never talked,” CZ said. Trump also said, “I don’t know who he is,” when asked why he pardoned him. Trump added that his sons “are into it,” referring to crypto, and said they run businesses and are not involved in government. CZ said the closest he came to meeting anyone from the Trump family was speaking briefly with Eric Trump at a Bitcoin Mina conference in Abu Dhabi. He emphasized that this single meeting did not involve business, planning, or legal discussion. Charges, guilty plea, and prison time explained The Department of Justice previously said CZ made Binance the largest crypto exchange by encouraging U.S. customer activity while refusing to follow U.S. laws. The DOJ said he violated anti-money laundering rules and sanctions rules that they believed protected the U.S. financial system. In November 2023, CZ pleaded guilty. He said he chose to plead guilty because he wanted to handle the situation directly. “I think it’s the best way to confront the problem and solve it head on,” he said. He voluntarily flew to the United States from a non-extradition country to face the case. He said he did not dispute the charges or the plea. “I do not have anything to debate,” he said. He also noted he became the first known first-time offender in U.S. history to receive prison time for a single non-fraud offense of this type. When speaking about how the pardon happened, CZ said he did not know whether it would be granted. “I don’t know when or if it’s going to happen,” he said. He said he understood why some people questioned the timing, but insisted there was nothing exchanged. “There is no deal,” said CZ. “There has never been any discussions.” He rejected reports claiming his representatives tried to negotiate with Trump allies before the election. He also rejected claims that Binance discussed arrangements with World Liberty Financial, a company tied to Trump’s sons. “There’s no business relationship between me and Binance and World Liberty Finance,” he said. Trump’s stance on crypto and regulatory clarity During recent remarks, Trump said he ended what he called the Biden administration’s “war on crypto,” and said he wanted the United States to become the “Bitcoin superpower” and the “crypto capital of the world.” CZ said he is grateful for the pardon and wants to support clearer regulation in the industry. He said he now sees more regulatory clarity in the United States than he did during the period when he was charged. He referenced the Genius Act, saying more structure benefits the entire industry, although he noted he is not a lawyer and does not know every detail. Near the end of the interview, he said he believes his name is already clear now that the legal process and pardon are complete. He said he wants to focus on new work and positive activities going forward. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

While this may suggest the predominance of a bearish sentiment among its investors, a recent on-chain evaluation has surfaced, explaining why the Bitcoin price might soon experience a major reversal. Binance Sees Increased STH Activity; Triggers Liquidation Cascade In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, on-chain analyst Amr Taha reveals a sudden shift in Bitcoin retail activity on the Binance network. Taha’s report dwells on the ‘[Bitcoin] LTH/STH Buy/Sell Binance’ metric, which tracks buying and selling activity on Binance, distinguishing between Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). Taha points out that as of the 3rd and 5th of November, Binance recorded a significant increase in the selling activity of Bitcoin’s STHs, especially from holders known as “clown wallets”. About 251 BTC flowed into Binance on the 3rd of November, while an even greater amount of BTC, approximately 517, was sent to Binance on the 5th of this month. Owing to these STHs’ usual inclination to panic, their positions often serve as liquidity to the cryptocurrency’s long-term holders who grab the chance of accumulation amid a fear-driven retail market. On another hand, the analyst highlights results from the BTC: Binance Liquidation Delta, a metric that measures the difference between long and short liquidations on Binance, thereby revealing if more long or short positions are being forcefully closed. According to Taha, most of the recent liquidations appear to be long positions that were both entered too late into the Bitcoin cycle, and with high leverage. These positions were forcefully closed within the $107,000-$100,500 range, triggering what is commonly known as a long squeeze. For context, a long squeeze is a series of sales that follows after traders with overleveraged long positions are threatened, or have been wiped out. Although a long squeeze typically causes the price to drop swiftly, it poses no significant issue to a cryptocurrency’s long-term investors. As a result, Bitcoin’s long-term holders have historically seen these events as accumulation chances, thereby standing as a soft cushion against the sharp nosedive the cryptocurrency’s price may be seeing. If historical trends were to recur, BTC may soon reach its price bottom, after which an accumulation and possible price expansion may ensue. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $103,500. The cryptocurrency has seen a 24-hour growth of more than 2%, per data from CoinMarketCap.",Bitcoin|binance|bitcoin|Bitcoin long squeeze|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin retailers panic sell|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-08 21:00:43

Wall Street’s love affair with artificial intelligence faces a brutal reality check as major AI stocks plummet, sending shockwaves through tech markets and raising urgent questions about the sustainability of the AI investment boom. Why Wall Street’s AI Bet Is Facing Unprecedented Pressure The Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its worst week since April, dropping 3% as Wall Street sentiment toward artificial intelligence stocks turned sharply negative. This dramatic shift comes despite massive continued investment from tech giants, creating a puzzling disconnect between corporate spending and market confidence. The AI Stocks Bloodbath: Who’s Hurting Most? Leading AI companies experienced significant declines that shook investor confidence across the sector: Palantir: 11% drop this week Oracle: 9% decline Nvidia: 7% loss Meta and Microsoft: Both down approximately 4% What’s Driving the Nasdaq Decline in AI Stocks? Several factors are contributing to the erosion of investor confidence in artificial intelligence companies: Factor Impact Stretched Valuations AI stocks had reached unsustainable price levels Economic Headwinds Government shutdown, consumer sentiment decline High Expectations Good news no longer moves stock prices significantly Widespread Layoffs Broader economic concerns affecting tech sector Expert Analysis: Wall Street’s Changing Perspective Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital summarized the sentiment perfectly: “Valuations are stretched. Just the slightest bit of bad news gets exaggerated… and good news is just not enough to move the needle because expectations are already pretty high.” This highlights how fragile investor confidence has become in the AI sector. Comparing Market Performance: AI vs Traditional Stocks The Nasdaq decline significantly outpaced other major indices, suggesting this is specifically an AI and tech stocks problem rather than a broader market issue: Nasdaq Composite: -3.0% S&P 500: -1.6% Dow Jones Industrial Average: -1.2% Actionable Insights for AI Investors For those monitoring Wall Street movements and AI stocks, consider these strategies: Diversify beyond pure AI plays Focus on companies with proven revenue streams Monitor earnings reports for spending sustainability Watch for signs of renewed investor confidence FAQs: Understanding the AI Market Shift Which companies were most affected by the Nasdaq decline? Major AI players including Palantir , Oracle , and Nvidia saw significant drops. What did Jack Ablin say about the situation? Cresset Capital’s Chief Investment Officer warned about stretched valuations and high expectations. How does this compare to other market indices? The tech-heavy Nasdaq decline was nearly double that of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones, indicating specific AI stocks pressure. Are Microsoft and Meta still investing in AI? Yes, both Microsoft and Meta indicated continued heavy AI spending despite the market reaction. The Bottom Line: Temporary Setback or Major Shift? The recent Wall Street retreat from AI stocks represents a crucial moment for investor confidence. While the long-term potential of artificial intelligence remains undeniable, the market is clearly signaling that unsustainable valuations and economic headwinds require a more cautious approach. The Nasdaq decline serves as a stark reminder that even the most promising technologies must eventually deliver tangible results to maintain market support.

The public company has made its name for its aggressive Ethereum (ETH) accumulation strategy, and the implication of sales would have raised questions about the health of its business and its liquidity levels. The wrong label had far-reaching effects According to the post shared by Lookonchain and based on data from Arkham, SharpLink had redeemed 5,284 ETH and deposited 4,364 ETH to the OKX exchange hours before. Historically, such moves usually precede entities offloading tokens on the market. All that attention translated into widespread speculation, with the consensus leaning towards SharpLink initiating a major ETH sell-off. It did not help matters that Ethereum’s price had been seeing volatility, and the unrealized losses on the company holdings kept mounting. What followed was short-term market jitters. However, all that ended after Sheffield implied in a tweet that the wallet does not belong to SharpLink and that it was incorrectly tagged on Arkham’s platform. In response to his post, Arkham revealed that the “label is a prediction from our AI model, not an Arkham-verified label. AI predicted labels are indicated by the purple outline and question mark.” The post continued by saying Arkham-verified SharpLink wallets appear under the SharpLink entity on Arkham and that the wallet in question is not one of those. Sheffield expressed appreciation for the clarification from Arkham while confirming that the wallet no longer reflects the SharpLink label. “Making predictions on wallet owners is an interesting problem,” he added . “Probabilistic assumptions are definitionally never going to be 100% accurate. But it’s generally an effective tagging algo from what I’ve seen. Big fan of the Arkham product.” The incident briefly put some sell pressure on ETH prices and the SBET stock, which dipped up to 8% on November 6. However, the market has since corrected as sentiments stabilize. SharpLink raised $76.5 million through a premium-priced stock deal SharpLink raised $76.5 million in a direct stock offering priced above market, according to a press release from the company last month. According to the release, it sold 4.5 million shares at $17 per share, a 12% premium over its $15.15 closing price on October 15. That price reflected a premium to the company’s net asset value of its 859K ETH holdings, reflecting what the company called “strong institutional confidence” in its strategy. Top 10 Ethereum holding entities. Source: Strategic ETH Reserve An unnamed institutional investor scooped up the shares and also got a 90-day option to buy another 4.5 million shares at $17.50. For now, the firm’s Ether holdings are second only to Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ), which currently has 3.40 million ETH in its treasury. It has achieved this by using equity issuances to fund purchases in a self-reinforcing cycle during bull markets. Even though the strategy has worked out so far, it continues to attract mixed reviews with critics grounding their argument in factors like over-leverage and volatility exposure.

54178783,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=27011,1762636556,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What are Trustless Agents on Ethereum?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/what-are-trustless-agents-on-ethereum/,"Trustless agents on Ethereum are autonomous software entities that can identify themselves, advertise their capabilities, and interact with users or other agents without requiring pre-existing trust, relying instead on on-chain registries for identity, reputation, and optional external verification to establish reliability and accountability. This framework aims to support an open, interoperable marketplace of agents built by different developers, allowing them to coordinate tasks and provide services across Web3 in a permissionless and transparent manner, potentially expanding Ethereum’s role from a financial settlement layer into a broader coordination network for distributed automation. What Capabilities Can Trustless Agents Bring to Ethereum? ERC-8004 , a recently proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal, introduces the concept of Trustless Agents on Ethereum. Trustless agents on Ethereum refer to autonomous or semi-autonomous software agents that can advertise their capabilities, interact with users or other agents, and perform tasks without requiring any pre-existing trust between participants. Instead of operating inside closed platforms or corporate ecosystems, these agents use on-chain registries to establish identity, reputation, and verifiable assurances about their behaviour. The aim is to enable an open marketplace of agents that can be discovered, selected, and coordinated based on transparent and composable trust signals, rather than institutional branding or platform control. This allows agents created by different developers or organisations to interoperate within the same network while maintaining verifiable security guarantees. The trust framework is organised around three registries deployed on Ethereum or its scaling networks. An Identity Registry assigns each agent a unique on-chain identifier that links to external metadata and service endpoints. A Reputation Registry allows users and other agents to submit feedback after interactions, supporting both simple on-chain scoring and more sophisticated off-chain analysis. A Validation Registry introduces structured verification, enabling independent auditors, stake-backed re-execution, zero-knowledge machine learning proofs (zkML), or trusted hardware attestations to confirm whether an agent performed a task correctly. Together, these components provide a shared infrastructure for discovery, evaluation, and trust formation across agents. This model could be significant for Ethereum and Web3 because it makes it possible to coordinate services and automation across organisational boundaries, without relying on centralised platforms. Instead of depending on a handful of dominant AI providers, users could choose from a diverse set of agents based on capability, cost, reputation, or cryptographic validation. Developers benefit from shared trust infrastructure rather than building siloed systems from scratch, making agent ecosystems more interoperable and extensible. In this context, Ethereum becomes not only a settlement layer for digital assets, but also a coordination network for AI agent-driven distributed services. Trustless agents offer the possibility of open agent economies, where both humans and autonomous systems can request work, negotiate terms, and establish trust in a permissionless manner. The protocol supports tasks ranging from everyday low-risk actions to high-stakes operations requiring stronger guarantees, by allowing the trust model to scale with the value at risk. If adopted widely, trustless agents could reduce dependency on centralised intermediaries, encourage competition and specialisation, and expand the scope of decentralised applications well beyond finance into automation, labour coordination, and shared computation. Key challenges ahead include designing robust reputation mechanisms, preventing manipulation, and establishing sustainable incentive structures that promote reliable long-term behaviour. What Could Web3 Look Like With an Agent Economy? A Web3 agent economy envisions a digital environment where autonomous software agents, acting on behalf of individuals, organisations, or other agents, can discover services, negotiate terms, and complete tasks without requiring intermediaries. Instead of users manually interacting with protocols, marketplaces, or DApps, agents could handle routine decisions such as searching for the best lending rate, comparing token swaps, updating security configurations, or coordinating payments. These agents would operate in a permissionless environment where identity, trust, and verification are handled through shared blockchain infrastructure rather than proprietary platforms. The result is a shift from user-driven interaction to goal-driven outcomes, where users specify intent and agents execute it across multiple systems. In such an economy, blockchain networks function as coordination layers rather than just settlement layers. Smart contracts define rules, incentives, and dispute processes, while registries allow agents to prove identity, advertise capabilities, and receive feedback. Trust models could vary by context: everyday tasks may rely on reputation scores, while high-value or high-risk actions could require cryptographic proofs, stake-backed guarantees, or trusted hardware attestations. Importantly, these trust mechanisms would be interoperable rather than siloed, allowing agents developed by different teams to interact reliably. This would encourage a competitive ecosystem where capabilities, not brand ownership, determine which agents are selected for tasks. For users, an agent-driven web3 could make interacting with decentralised systems more accessible. Instead of navigating complex wallets, protocols, and bridging operations, individuals could delegate actions to personal agents designed to optimise for cost, speed, risk tolerance, or ethical preferences. For businesses, the agent economy could streamline automated supply chains, audits, compliance checks, and data services, all coordinated through shared trust layers. Because these systems are open and composable, smaller developers and organisations could participate without the scaling disadvantages that exist in centralised markets. The impact could reshape digital labour and economic coordination. Agents could specialise in particular domains, financial routing, data analysis, logistics brokerage, content generation, and then coordinate with one another to complete complex workflows. Economies would no longer rely solely on large platforms to intermediate trust; instead, trust would emerge from cryptography, transparent feedback systems, and verifiable execution. The transition, however, would also introduce challenges, including ensuring fair reputation systems, preventing sybil manipulation, designing incentives that discourage malicious behaviour, and balancing automation with human oversight. If these issues are addressed, a Web3 agent economy could shift the internet from a platform-centric model to an open, interoperable environment defined by freely interacting autonomous services. How Soon Can We Expect Autonomous Agents in the Ethereum Ecosystem? The emergence of autonomous agents in the Ethereum ecosystem is already underway, though their widespread adoption will unfold gradually over the next several years. Early agent frameworks exist today in the form of bots, intent-based transaction systems, MEV searchers, automated trading strategies, and smart-contract–driven scheduling tools. However, these systems are narrowly scoped and lack general-purpose reasoning, discovery, and trust frameworks needed for agents to interact openly across applications. Recent developments in on-chain identity standards, agent registries, and AI model interfaces signal that the underlying foundation for more capable, interoperable agents is being actively built, but is still in its early stages. Short-term progress (over the next 12–24 months) is likely to focus on personal and organisational “helper agents” that execute routine tasks under explicit user permission. These agents may manage token transfers, monitor risk thresholds, rebalance liquidity positions, or negotiate trades across decentralised exchanges. Because the consequences are relatively contained and tasks are well-defined, these early agent systems do not require strong on-chain trust guarantees beyond signatures and auditability. Rather than fully autonomous behaviour, we will see semi-automated agents that augment user decision-making while preserving human oversight. More advanced agent economies, where agents discover, evaluate, and coordinate with other agents in untrusted environments, will depend on the establishment of shared trust frameworks. Proposed Ethereum standards for agent identity, reputation registries, and cryptoeconomic validation are attempting to address this gap by enabling agents built by different parties to verify each other’s performance history and reliability. The maturity of these systems will also depend on improvements in compute infrastructure, including zkML proofs, secure enclaves, and scalable rollups capable of hosting agent reasoning and inference workloads. Realistically, robust cross-organisational autonomous agent markets may take three to five years to meaningfully develop. The long-term transition is likely to be evolutionary rather than abrupt. As smart contract platforms become more modular, intent-based architectures become normalised, and AI inference becomes cheaper to verify, agents will shift from optional conveniences to default interaction patterns. Users may no longer sign every transaction manually; instead, they may set preference boundaries and allow agents to act on their behalf across DeFi, social applications, and coordination networks. The trajectory suggests that autonomous agents will not replace human decision-making, but will increasingly serve as intermediaries that translate human intent into complex, multi-step on-chain actions. In this sense, the question is less about “if” autonomous agents will become central to Ethereum, and more about how smoothly and securely this transition can be governed.

And when they have to pick between Bitcoin and gold, they don’t even blink. “Sovereigns buy gold. People like me? We buy Bitcoin,” Arthur said during a no‑bullshit interview with Coin Bureau, where he laid out why nation-states are doubling down on gold while individuals flee to crypto for one thing: freedom. Bitcoin is freedom‑proof, it runs without permission, can’t be seized, and lets you walk away with your wealth in your head. But gold is politics‑proof, it’s trusted, old, and has been traded between nations for thousands of years. Arthur said that’s why “you could lose your job if you bought Bitcoin and it tanked 75%. You won’t if you buy gold.” And the world’s governments don’t care about your freedom; they only care about their power. Every Bitcoin cycle begins with money printers Arthur broke down four major Bitcoin cycles and how every single one had its roots in credit expansion. The first came in 2009, right as Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve launched unlimited quantitative easing after a $700 billion bailout. Bitcoin was born at that moment. Then came China’s massive infrastructure stimulus between 2008 and 2011. “Both China and the U.S. were printing a shit ton of money,” Arthur said, and Bitcoin took off. By late 2013, things reversed. The Fed slowed liquidity, China pulled back on credit, and the first bubble popped at $1,300. Then came 2015, when a random Bitfinex wick liquidated 6,000 BTC. Arthur remembered it. So did the markets. China soon devalued its currency and fired up another stimulus wave. That led to the 2017 rally. “China did housing, infrastructure, all of it,” Arthur explained. But as the U.S. hiked rates, the party ended. Then came COVID. The U.S. handed out stimulus checks like candy. Arthur said people “bought Bitcoin, bought cars, bought whatever the fuck they wanted.” That’s what pushed Bitcoin to $69,000 in 2021. But once Jerome Powell hinted at rate hikes in March 2022, that was it. “That was the top,” Arthur said. The current cycle? It’s Janet Yellen’s doing. Arthur called her “Bad Girl Yellen” and said she drained $2.5 trillion from the reverse repo to juice markets while Powell pretended to fight inflation. Now, that facility is empty. Arthur said we’re at the edge of the next move, and “as long as politicians keep printing, we keep pumping.” He expects the rally to extend into 2027 or 2028, because “they’re all lying, and they’re not raising taxes. They’ll just print.” Sovereigns ditch treasuries and hoard gold Arthur said the gold story changed in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and the U.S. froze their reserves. “They stole Russia’s money, and that was a wake-up call,” he said. He pointed out that sovereign wealth managers saw how easy it is for the U.S. to seize assets if it doesn’t like your country or your politics. Since then, China, Singapore, and others have been “hoovering gold.” They’re dumping treasuries and stocking up on gold because, Arthur said, “if it can happen to Russia, it can happen to anyone.” The breaking point came when Israel bombed Qatar, the world’s largest gas exporter. Arthur said that exposed how little control the U.S. actually has over its own so-called allies. “If I’m selling oil in a currency that’s losing 8–9% a year and I’m still getting bombed, why the fuck am I doing this?” he asked. That’s why countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are signing new security deals, and why China and Saudi Arabia are now settling oil trades in yuan, not dollars. But Bitcoin? Still too risky for sovereigns. Arthur said it’s a credit story, tied to dollar liquidity, not politics. “Once banks tighten, Bitcoin reacts. That’s why it dropped 20%.” He pointed to the SOFR rates trading above Fed funds and said the Fed’s been injecting emergency cash again. “That’s why Bitcoin dipped. It’s not about ETFs or memes. It’s dollars.” Arthur owns both Bitcoin and gold. But he doesn’t mix them up. “Gold buys you oil and medicine. Bitcoin gets you out.” He also talked about altcoins, saying he sold Hype for two reasons: token unlocks and a down payment on a Ferrari Testarossa. “Everyone wants a Ferrari, bro, especially in Singapore.” Arthur said the unlocks will compress the multiple. He plans to buy back in, but only after the market reprices future earnings. “They say Jeff won’t sell. Yeah, right. Everyone sells.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $104,201, it will fuel a bullish rally to $111,048. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $98,723, beginning a bearish trend to $95,593. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as buyers failed to push the price above Fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , miners sent a total of 210K BTC to exchanges in October, while the past week saw 122,000 coins flow into Binance. Bitcoin price prediction November 2025 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $103K due to the market crash in October. However, it is now facing heavy accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around November 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction November 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-08 21:37:35

Privacy advocates are fighting back against what they believe is regulatory hostility toward privacy-enhancing crypto tools, rallying support to potentially escalate their lobby to the level of the White House. The Bitcoin community disapproves of the Samourai dev sentencing The Bitcoin Policy Institute and several well-known libertarian activists are gathering support after Samourai Wallet developer Keonne Rodriguez was sentenced to five years in prison for running an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The case is being viewed as part of a growing crackdown on financial anonymity. Angela McArdle, Chair of the Libertarian National Committee and a known Bitcoin advocate, posted on X. “The Samourai Wallet sentencing is terrible. I am working on it. I am working on a LOT of these cases. I need Bitcoiners to flex their influence right now. You need to make calls to the admin. We will not win this in woke courts. We can win in the White House.” Zack Shapiro, the co-founder of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a nonprofit that promotes Bitcoin-related research and advocacy, has also called for an organized outreach to lawmakers and the government administration, responding to McArdle’s post with support, writing on X: “For Bitcoiners who are upset about the Samourai Wallet outcome, this is our best shot going forward. @RealAngelaMc was one of the main driving forces behind the Ross pardon, so please reach out with any support you can give.” His message refers to the 2020 pardon campaign for Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road, which McArdle helped lead through a coalition of libertarian and Bitcoin activists. The Trump administration pardoned Ulbricht in January 2025, as reported by Cryptopolitan at the time. Crypto lobbyists mount frontier for privacy On November 6, 2025, Judge Denise L. Cote sentenced Rodriguez to 60 months in federal prison, ending a legal episode that started when Rodriguez and Lonergan Hill were arrested in April 2024. Both pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges on July 30, 2025. The Samourai Wallet, which was marketed as a “premium privacy service” for Bitcoin users. Prosecutors claimed that the wallet processed roughly $237 million in illicit transactions between 2015 and April 2024. Its website and social media promotions emphasized anonymity and ease of use, highlighting features like “no email address, no ID check, and no hassle.” Tornado Cash developers are facing similar charges for running an Ethereum-based mixer, and its resolution could depend on the efforts of these crypto privacy advocates. Critics argue that punishing open-source developers for the actions of users threatens innovation and civil liberties, while supporters of the ruling believe it reinforces accountability in the crypto industry.

Smart investors who rode that wave are now scanning the market for the next crypto to explode before the next major bull leg starts. While many altcoins are already overextended or trading near cycle highs, the spotlight is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi token priced at only $0.035 that is quickly building a reputation as the top crypto with asymmetric upside potential. Adding an element of greater urgency is that Stage 6 of the MUTM presale is almost completely sold out, with a staggering 85% already earmarked for purchase, a clear sign of stepped-up demand and growing FOMO in those that have so far invested. Those who recognized Solana’s breakout potential early didn’t wait for mainstream confirmation, they acted when the value was still hidden. The same pattern is emerging here: MUTM is still under $0.05, still pre-exchange, and still in accumulation territory, exactly the zone where life-changing gains are made for those who move before the masses. Solana Price Prediction Solana is displaying a sign of trying to recover after reverting from its rising trendline support, thus forming a possible short-term relief rally setup. Technical analysis indicates that SOL will likely target the $180 area, which meets several technical resistances, including its upper channel line, previous resistance points, as well as the 0.5-level of Fibonacci retracement of its recent drop. This area is most likely where bears will re-enter, thus forming a possible lower high (LH) formation. Failure of SOL to overshoot through the $180 barrier with good market volume will clearly show that a realistic switch to the $125-$135 area is likely, which matches its previous accumulation points as well as its lower channel line. On a short-term perspective, an oversold Stochastic RSI making a positive curl is a clear sign that new buying is already building in strength, thus supporting a possible short-term bounce before a deeper trend is determined. This is a situation that is attracting a lot of traders’ attention, although it also points towards why investors are looking at cheaper high-upside alternatives in the market, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerging as one of the most popular early market projects. a New Era of Decentralized Finance Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the most innovative and influential initiatives within DeFi. The current presale has been performing above estimates, attracting over 17,800 participants while securing a total of over 18.5 million in contributions. This is a clear reflection of increasing market confidence in investors, as Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the most attractive cryptos in the market today Essentially, Mutuum Finance brings in a new kind of decentralized lending and borrowing system based on transparency, stability, and fairness. It enables lenders to define conditions of repayment while granting borrowers flexible interest rates aligned with market trends. This balanced and flexible system provides a more efficient and trustworthy alternative to traditional DeFi lending platforms Defining a Future Standard of DeFi Platforms Through the creation of a system whereby lenders and borrowers conduct their business in an open and fair manner, Mutuum Finance is setting a precedent that will define the decentralized finance market of the future. Its strategy focuses on reliability, empowerment of the community, and economic functionality in a manner that makes it an exceptional coin in the changing DeFi market. Mutuum Finance has already managed to raise over $18.5 million and attract well over 17,800 presale participants at a stage where its presale Stage 6 is already over 85% sold out at a price of only $0.035. This is a clear sign of its popularity and an increasing recognition that it is likely to have a similar start to that of market successes such as Solana before it went mainstream. Mutuum Finance’s model that focuses on the future of DeFi, a growing presale stage success rate, and its overall undervaluation in relation to its plan make it have one of the most attractive asymmetric investment profiles in the market at present.

Chanos, who has been known for buying Bitcoin and shorting Strategy, confirmed the exit in a post on X , saying, “As we have gotten some inquiries, I can confirm that we have unwound our $MSTR/Bitcoin hedged trade as of yesterday’s open.” The decision marks the end of an 11-month bet that Strategy’s stock was overvalued relative to the Bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet. The pair trade, recommended in December 2024 at Chanos & Co.’s annual Bears in Hibernation conference, involved shorting Strategy shares against a long position in Bitcoin. At the time, Strategy traded at 2.5 times its market-adjusted net asset value (mNAV). Arbitrage thesis fulfilled The short bet proved exceptionally profitable. Strategy’s mNAV has now fallen to 1.23x, crossing Chanos’s pre-set cover threshold of 1.25x. “At today’s opening prices, MSTR (~$224) is down roughly 50% from its 2025 peak,” the firm said in an investor note shared alongside Chanos’s post. “The implied premium (MSTR EV less BTC holding value) is currently ~$15 billion, down from a peak of $80 billion in November 2024.” Chanos has been vocal in his criticism of Strategy’s premium and frequent equity issuance, reportedly calling it financial gibberish . “While we still believe there is more room for mNAV compression, the thesis has largely played out,” the firm wrote. “We recommend letting others chase the last leg of the trade as MSTR inevitably marches towards a 1.0x mNAV.” Strategy’s market capitalization has fallen by over 14% from last year, when it was valued at over $80.8 billion. The current decline in Bitcoin prices, currently trading around $102,000, is also impacting Strategy’s treasury and stock performance, given that its portfolio is heavily Bitcoin-focused. However, as of the time of writing, MSTR is trading at around $241, up by over 4.7%. A vote of confidence for Bitcoin? However, despite the decline, Strategy has still been championing more Bitcoin acquisition, calling for more people to invest in the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. James Van Straten , senior analyst at CoinDesk, while reacting to Chanos’ announcement on X, described the move as “a signal that value starts to step in here, as Bitcoin is considerably undervalued against USD, Mag 7 and gold.” Some analysts on X went further to say that Strategy is undervalued Moments after Chanos’s post, Michael Saylor , Strategy’s founder and chairman, took to X to write simply: “₿uy Now.” His two-word message was reminiscent of the same bullish sentiment that has long defined his approach to Bitcoin accumulation. Outlook for MSTR and Bitcoin Chanos did not rule out further mNAV compression as Strategy continues to issue new shares to buy more Bitcoin. With the ratio now approaching parity at 1.23x, he said it was “prudent to cover” and allow others to pursue the remaining downside. Bitcoin’s price reaction to the announcement was not impressive, as it’s still down by 1% from the previous day. Still, traders on X and crypto forums treated the closure as a psychological boost, framing it as a sign that institutional shorts like Chanos are losing conviction against Bitcoin-linked equities. However, some believe it is a loss of faith in Bitcoin itself and an investor taking his profits before a major bear phase hits the market. Saylor and Strategy continue to maintain a bullish posture, as the firm recently added more BTC to its treasury, bringing total holdings to 641,205 BTC .

Although the general digital asset market has faltered in recent weeks, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency has continued to ascend to new price highs. While the large-cap assets have been waxing and waning in terms of market value, the price of ZCash has been on a tear in the past week, breaking into the list of the top-20 largest cryptocurrencies in the sector. Now, the latest on-chain data suggests that euphoria is setting in the ZEC market. ZCash Puell Multiple Hits New All-Time High In a November 7 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson revealed that the ZCash market might be overheating after weeks of significant upward price movement. According to the on-chain expert, the sentiment surrounding the coin seems to have finally reached the euphoria stage. Related Reading: Most Dangerous Bitcoin Boom Yet? Ray Dalio Warns Of ‘Stimulus Into A Bubble’ Wedson noted that the group of network participants mostly behind this euphoria is the ZEC miners. This on-chain observation revolves around two primary metrics, including the Puell Multiple and the Hash Rate. For context, the Puell Multiple is a metric that correlates the issuance value of an asset to its 365-day moving average. This metric measures miners’ profitability on an annualized basis, signaling potential market tops or bottoms. According to the highlighted data from Alphractal, the ZCash Puell Multiple just hit an all-time high, indicating significantly high profitability for the miners. This on-chain signal also suggests that the ZEC price could still have more room for upside movement. Furthermore, Wedson revealed that the ZCash Hash Rate is on a rapid ascent, meaning that miners are devoting more computational resources to the privacy-focused network. As seen with the premier cryptocurrency, a rising Hash Rate often coincides with extended price rallies. Ultimately, the increasing Puell Multiple and rising Hash Rate signals strong network fundamentals for ZCash, which suggests that the price growth seen so far is not solely market speculation. What’s Next For ZEC Price? As of this writing, the price of ZCash stands at around $714, reflecting an over 30% jump in the past 24 hours. Price action data shows that the ZEC coin is having the second-strongest annual performance in its history, having soared roughly 1,500% in the past year. In an earlier post on X, Wedson projected an extreme upside of around $1,650 for the price of ZCash. While the current ZEC price already suggests elevated risk for investors, reaching as high as $1,650 would represent full-on market euphoria.

During the conference, Iran’s first international forum of this kind, members of the local crypto community suggested the Islamic Republic should even move beyond the basic recognition of decentralized digital assets and become a regional Bitcoin hub. Tehran sets crypto regulation as a priority at the international blockchain event The deBlock 2025 forum, Iran’s first international conference devoted to blockchain and cryptocurrencies, was held this week in the capital city. It brought together an array of participants, including people active in the crypto space, executives of exchanges, entrepreneurs, economists, regulators, and diplomats. Addressing attendees, government officials recognized the role crypto assets are going to play in the economy of the future, both in Iran and globally. In a message read by a representative, the Speaker of the Iranian parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, emphasized the need for a strategic approach to regulation in the crypto domain. Quoted by the English-language Tehran Times and the Mehr news agency, he described the development of a national roadmap for crypto assets as an “undeniable imperative.” The head of the Majlis referred to a target set in Iran’s latest National Development Plan to bring the share of the digital economy to 10%, noting the goal could not be achieved without embracing crypto. Ghalibaf urged the ministries of economy and industry, the central bank, and other government institutions to coordinate efforts to ensure regulated growth in the sector. Iran announces ambitions to become a regional crypto hub By implementing global crypto standards, “the Islamic Republic can become a successful model in the region and the world, and be recognized as a regional hub for crypto assets,” the high-ranking lawmaker elaborated. He also suggested avoiding a narrow view of the matter: “The perspective on crypto assets should not be limited solely to mining or buying and selling. To fully utilize the capacities of this industry, we need the comprehensive development of a crypto-based financial ecosystem.” This, he added, includes providing the legislative basis for operating secure and regulated trading platforms, using cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, and tokenizing real-world assets such as securities and commodities. Mohammad Ghalibaf was also quoted as stating: “Crypto-assets and blockchain technology are not merely an opportunity, but a necessity for the future of Iran’s and the world’s economy.” Shamseddin Hosseini, chairman of the parliamentary economic committee, also highlighted the shift in political attitudes in Tehran regarding decentralized digital money. “The first official encounter with virtual currencies occurred at the Anti-Money Laundering Headquarters, and they were banned. However, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace later countered this approach,” he reminded. In his speech, Hosseini took his turn to point to the government’s plan to significantly increase the size of the digital sector in the nation’s economy and agreed with Ghalibaf: “The digital economy’s share must reach 10% of the country’s total economy, and achieving this goal is impossible without crypto assets.” Local media put an emphasis on the signing of a memorandum of understanding between deBlock and Trescon Global, the Dubai-based organizer of tech events such as the World Blockchain Summit, which will allow the Iranian conference to be hosted in Dubai. Reza Soltani, deBlock’s executive director, commented: “Iran has the potential to become the regional hub for decentralized technologies. The collaboration with Trescon can attract foreign investment, enhance international credibility, and expand technological partnerships with BRICS countries.” Cryptocurrencies seen as tool to strengthen Iran’s financial independence Delegates from more than 15 countries attended the current edition of the forum in Tehran’s IRIB International Conference Center, on Nov. 6-7, including representatives of the BRICS group of emerging economies, of which Iran is a member, and of Central Asia . In his address earlier, the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament stressed that cooperation in formats like BRICS has created strategic opportunities for participating nations, including for financial diversification. “The use of shared cryptocurrencies within the framework of bilateral or multilateral monetary agreements, particularly in BRICS-Plus interactions, can help strengthen economic independence and facilitate international transactions,” Mohammad Ghalibaf explained.

According to court filings, the sentence aims to close a chapter that began with an indictment unsealed in April 2024. Pleas And Sentencing Dates According to court documents, Rodriguez pleaded guilty in mid-2025 to running an unlicensed money transmitting business. The plea did not encompass all counts within the original indictment but did result in the scheduling of a sentencing hearing. On November 6, 2025, a judge imposed the longest prison term of five years sought by prosecutors for that count. His co-founder, William Lonergan Hill, faces related proceedings after being arrested overseas; extradition efforts are underway. Defense: He lived in a $250,000 home in Harmony, PA unlike SBF. He’s an engineer. He’s a warm family man.Keonne Rodriguez: I agree with what my counsel said. My letter, I wanted it to be personal. I’ve been silent for 18 months. I wanted to bring my story to you — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) November 6, 2025 Samourai Wallet: Allegations And Figures According to the Department of Justice, Samourai Wallet and associated services processed approximately $2 billion in transactions that the government says included funds tied to illegal activity. Prosecutors say that more than $100 million of criminal proceeds were laundered through features allowing users to mix or route coins via extra hops. The tools at the center of the case — known as Whirlpool and Ricochet — were repeatedly mentioned in filings as methods that made tracing funds difficult. The government also said the founders marketed these features in ways they said appealed to bad actors. Records show the charge of unlicensed money-transmitting business carries up to five years in prison. The federal probation office had suggested a term below that, recommending about 42 months, but prosecutors asked the court to impose the full five-year sentence. Those figures were based on court documents and public statements by the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York. Charges Narrowed, Questions Remain Reports have identified that the defendants did not plead guilty to each of the counts in the original complaint, with the plea agreement leaving some counts unresolved. That has left defense lawyers and outside experts focusing on what the case means for software developers and privacy tools that operate in the cryptocurrency space. Legal filings reflect a complex combination of criminal allegations and regulatory questions, and in various hearings, both parties used technical and legal arguments. Legal And Community Reactions The sentence has drawn sharp takes from different corners. Privacy advocates warn that criminal penalties aimed at developers could chill open-source work and set new limits on tools used by ordinary people to protect their financial privacy.

Filecoin’s (FIL) price surge signals renewed accumulation after extended selling pressure, while the Bonk (BONK) price recovery underscores the strength of Solana’s community-driven ecosystem. These movements reflect growing confidence across both infrastructure and meme segments of the market. Amid this shift, BlockDAG is redefining presale credibility through its $435 million Value Era, focused on delivery, liquidity, and sustainability. Currently priced at $0.005 in Batch 32, the project has only 4.3 billion coins left to be sold and attracted 312,000+ holders, 20,000+ miners, and 3.5 million+ X1 users. Supported by an $86 million institutional allocation and a 40/60 vesting model, BlockDAG’s disciplined structure places it among the top crypto projects positioned for 2025’s expansion phase. Filecoin Strengthens as Network Utility Drives a 4% Surge Filecoin’s (FIL) price surge of 4 percent, reported by CoinDesk, reflects resilient demand for decentralized data storage solutions. After a brief market pullback, Filecoin rebounded as on-chain data showed rising network activity and steady storage adoption from enterprise users. The project’s long-standing focus on providing scalable, secure storage continues to differentiate it from other infrastructure-based cryptos.Analysts note that Filecoin has found technical support around recent lows, indicating strong buying interest from long-term holders. If network expansion continues at its current pace, FIL could attempt to break above key resistance zones in the coming weeks. Its rebound highlights the market’s preference for projects anchored in practical utility rather than speculation, a theme that echoes across 2025’s list of top crypto projects. Bonk Recovers 4.6% as Community Momentum Returns The latest Bonk (BONK) price updates show a 4.6 percent gain after periods of volatility, marking a solid recovery within the Solana ecosystem. According to CoinDesk, increased liquidity and ongoing community initiatives are helping Bonk regain visibility among retail investors. The token’s popularity is driven by its integration with Solana-based NFT projects and its active presence in social trading communities.This rebound reflects the importance of user engagement in maintaining momentum for emerging tokens. Bonk’s community-driven approach demonstrates that grassroots participation remains a powerful force within crypto. With rising activity and renewed confidence, Bonk is regaining traction as one of the market’s more resilient meme-based assets heading into the new year. BlockDAG Secures $86 Million Institutional Backing to Drive Scarcity The Value Era marks BlockDAG’s transition from its Power Era to a structured, transparent phase built around verified delivery and accountability. CEO Anthony Turner confirmed that all bonuses and promotional codes have been permanently removed to establish a fair distribution model. Under the new framework, coins follow a vesting schedule with 40 percent released upfront and 60 percent distributed evenly over three months. This approach protects liquidity and ensures market stability. Institutional confidence continues to anchor the project, led by an $86 million deal that reinforces long-term backing and scarcity. The presale, now in Batch 32 at $0.005, has raised $435 million, with 4.3 billion BDAG coins remaining. A total supply cap of 50 billion tokens further strengthens its scarcity-driven design. Dashboard V4 enhances transparency by offering real-time presale analytics, leaderboards, and wallet tracking. This upgrade gives participants live access to ecosystem performance, mirroring an exchange-like environment. Meanwhile, the Referral Program continues to expand the community through 25 percent rewards for referrers and 5 percent bonuses for invitees, encouraging organic network growth. With over 20,000 miners deployed and 3.5 million+ X1 users worldwide, BlockDAG’s Value Era positions the project among 2025’s top crypto leaders. It’s an ecosystem built on transparency, structure, and measurable progress. Key Takeaway! Filecoin’s (FIL) price surge and Bonk (BONK) price updates both signal renewed market stability, but neither matches the scale of progress seen in BlockDAG’s Value Era. With a price of $0.005, Batch 32 active, and $435 million raised, BlockDAG stands as a blueprint for how presales evolve into fully operational ecosystems. Through Dashboard V4 and its Referral Program, the project has merged technology, transparency, and community growth into a single cohesive framework. For traders searching the top crypto projects with verified utility and long-term viability, BlockDAG continues to set the benchmark for how a presale becomes a lasting network success.

According to Barron, major banks are developing their own stablecoins, creating isolated financial ecosystems that lack a shared infrastructure, a problem XRP was specifically designed to solve. Banks Launching Independent Stablecoin Projects In a recent post on X, Barron revealed that leading U.S. banks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are collaborating on a project to launch a U.S. Consortium stablecoin. The goal is to create a bank-backed digital currency that operates under regulated conditions. He added that this trend is not limited to the United States. Several major European institutions, including Deutsche Bank, ING, and UniCredit, are reportedly working on a euro-denominated stablecoin expected to go live by 2026. These initiatives show how rapidly traditional finance is moving toward tokenized systems. $XRP Plot twist: Is this what @bradgarlinghouse was working for all along? Every major bank is racing to launch its OWN stablecoin While SWIFT pitches ""neutral rails,"" the reality: JPM, BofA, Citi, Wells: U.S. consortium stablecoin ING, Deutsche, UniCredit + 6 others: Euro… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) November 1, 2025 Barron also cited a statement from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who confirmed that the bank intends to issue a stablecoin once the necessary regulatory frameworks are finalized. This comment reflects a broader industry trend, as banks compete to maintain control over their liquidity and digital payment systems rather than rely on neutral, shared networks. The Challenge of Financial Fragmentation Barron argued that while the move toward stablecoins represents progress in modernizing payments, it also creates a new challenge, fragmentation. Each institution is building its own closed ecosystem, resulting in what Barron described as “walled gardens”, isolated systems that cannot easily communicate or transfer value between one another. He questioned how these independent stablecoin networks would achieve interoperability, warning that such fragmentation could undermine the efficiency that digital assets are meant to provide. Without a universal bridge, cross-border transactions could become more complex rather than simpler. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Role in Addressing the Problem According to Barron, this is precisely where XRP fits into the global financial landscape. The cryptocurrency was created to act as a neutral bridge asset that facilitates seamless value transfer between otherwise incompatible financial systems. Because XRP is not issued or controlled by any government or corporation, it can serve as an intermediary that allows funds to move efficiently between different currencies and platforms. Its design enables fast, low-cost settlements and removes the need for banks to pre-fund accounts in foreign countries, freeing up liquidity for other uses. Barron further suggested that Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, who joined the company in 2015, likely foresaw the current race among banks to build their own digital currencies. Instead of competing directly with these projects, Garlinghouse and Ripple positioned XRP to complement them, functioning as a universal connector between closed financial systems. Barron concluded that as financial institutions continue to create private stablecoins, demand for a neutral, interoperable asset like XRP is expected to grow. He emphasized that XRP’s purpose is not to replace national currencies or stablecoins, but to bridge them, ensuring that the global financial ecosystem remains connected despite increasing decentralization and competition among banks.

Litecoin And LTCBTC Close Bullish, Setting Stage For Further Upside Presenting his technical outlook, CryptoWzrd highlighted a strong bullish performance from Litcoin, noting that both the LTC/USD and LTC/BTC pairs closed with impressive upward momentum. He explained that most of Litecoin’s strength came from a sharp spike in LTC/BTC. The synchronized move between the two pairs reflects renewed buying interest and suggests that bullish sentiment is building in the short term. Related Reading: Litecoin 2M Bollinger Band Width Hits New Lows, CMT-Certified Analyst Reveals What It Means According to CryptoWzrd, the next key step for LTC/BTC is to break out of its range high, a technical milestone that could unlock further upside for Litecoin. A successful breakout from this structure may serve as the trigger for a rally toward the $112 resistance level, or even higher if momentum accelerates. The analyst also underlined the importance of holding above the $96 support zone, making it a key level that sustains Litecoin’s bullish structure. Maintaining price stability above this mark would reinforce the positive outlook and prevent a return to bearish conditions. Losing this level, however, could signal weakness and limit the potential for a continued advance in the near term. Looking ahead, CryptoWzrd expects heightened volatility to persist. Thus, he revealed that his focus will shift to lower time frame chart formations in the upcoming sessions, where he plans to identify and execute quick scalp setups as price action develops. This approach reflects his tactical trading style, aiming to capitalize on short-term movements while keeping a close eye on broader breakout signals. Volatility Reigns As Litecoin Holds Bullish Tone On Intraday Charts In conclusion, CryptoWzrd noted that Litecoin’s intraday chart displayed strong bullish behavior accompanied by heightened volatility throughout the session. The rapid price swings reflected increased trader activity and growing market momentum, suggesting that LTC could be setting up for another significant short-term move. Related Reading: LTC Price Soars 11% to $129: Analysts Eye $135 Breakout as ETF Approval Buzz Grows He explained that while a brief pullback below the $101.50 support level is possible, such a dip may simply serve as a temporary correction within the broader bullish structure. A renewed breakout above this level would likely present fresh long opportunities, signaling a continuation of Litecoin’s upward momentum. CryptoWzrd also emphasized that Bitcoin’s price action will play a critical role in shaping Litecoin’s next direction. Since LTC often reacts to BTC’s broader market moves, strength or weakness in Bitcoin could directly influence whether Litecoin extends its rally or consolidates further.

The analyst further revealed how this could play out for BTC if it were to happen eventually. What Will Happen If The Bitcoin Price Mirrors Gold In an X post, Colin indicated that the Bitcoin price will record another uptrend as soon as next week if it were to follow gold’s move. He opined that it is unlikely the flagship crypto will not witness another significant move to the upside, given that gold and stocks saw meteoric rises to new all-time highs (ATHs) in recent months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Peak Indicators Says Hold Despite Crash Below $100,000, What’s Happening? Coilin further remarked that money will still flow toward crypto, with a delay, as he highlighted in the gold vs BTC chart. He added that the gold top would forecast a top for the Bitcoin price in January 2026 when shifted forward by 80 days. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could still rally to $175,000 if its bull market extends into January next year. Colin admitted that this could be wrong for the Bitcoin price, but noted that many other metrics were pointing toward more upward price action for BTC. Meanwhile, he also highlighted the fact that sentiment was getting bearish in the crypto market. The market is currently on a downtrend, with the BTC dropping below $100,000 on several occasions this week. This has raised concerns that the Bitcoin price may already be in a bear market. However, Colin has indicated that BTC could still rally to new all-time highs before this cycle ends. His prediction aligns with that of the likes of Standard Chartered, which has predicted that BTC could reach between $150,000 and $20,000 by year-end. Why The BTC Top May Not Be In In another X post, Colin also explained why the top might not be in for the Bitcoin price in this bull run. He noted that the intersection of the 1150-day SMA with previous bull run peak times the top of the next peak. This happened in both the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, which marked the top for BTC at the time. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price October Top Is Back With A New Prediction Now, the analyst said that this moving average hasn’t quite lined up with the $65,000 top from the previous cycle, indicating that BTC still has more room to rally to the upside in this market cycle. Colin added that this 1150-day SMA, if projected out, will indicate a top for the Bitcoin price around late December this year or January next year. He reiterated that all metrics collectively point to a top around late December or January next year. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $102,400, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, known for her bold projections for Bitcoin , said during an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box that she has revised her bullish Bitcoin price target downward by $300,000, citing the rapid rise of stablecoins as the main reason for the adjustment. Stablecoins Taking Over Part Of Bitcoin’s Role Wood explained that stablecoins are fulfilling a function she and her team initially believed Bitcoin would dominate, i.e., serving as a financial tool for emerging economies. She noted that stablecoins have become the preferred digital assets in many markets. According to her, this trend has expanded far more quickly than anyone expected, leading ARK Invest to trim its long-term bullish projection for Bitcoin by $300,000. This brings down the Bitcoin projection from $1.5 million by 2030 to about $1.2 million. Wood said the firm’s models now recognize that stablecoins are scaling faster than anticipated. In her words, “stablecoins are scaling here much faster than anyone,” and their growth is effectively taking a slice of the market Bitcoin was once expected to capture. Gold, Institutions, And The Bigger Picture When asked if gold is factored into her forecast, Wood explained that the $300,000 reduction assumes all other things being equal, and gold continues to grow the way it is. However, since gold has also doubled in value since ARK Invest’s initial Bitcoin forecast, the comparison has become more nuanced. She reiterated that Bitcoin’s investment case remains intact because it is both digital gold and a technological innovation forming the foundation of a global monetary system. Wood noted that Bitcoin is the “lead in a new asset class” while distinguishing stablecoins as digital cash equivalents. The relationship between gold, stablecoins, and Bitcoin represents what she described as a dynamic interplay of “puts and takes.” Despite trimming her price forecast, Wood stressed that ARK is fundamentally bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Even as ARK Invest moderates expectations, Wood highlighted that institutional interest in Bitcoin and blockchain-based payment systems is still at an early stage. She noted that large financial players are only beginning to test the waters, with early experiments in new payment rails and digital asset integration just beginning to take shape. For Wood, this early stage of institutional involvement is the first of a long runway for Bitcoin’s growth. Despite the current short-term market weakness and competition from stablecoins, she also maintained her belief in Bitcoin’s technological role as the lead in a new asset class. “We have just started,” she said, adding that there is still “a long way to go.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,413, up by 1% in the past 24 hours but down by 7% and 16% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively.

While the token’s market capitalization currently sits well below major global corporations, many in the crypto community speculate that it could one day rival or surpass companies like Visa, whose market value is around $600–700 billion. This analysis examines what XRP’s price would look like if it were to reach Visa’s valuation and the factors that could make such a scenario feasible. Estimating XRP’s Value at Visa’s Market Cap Visa currently holds a market capitalization of about $667 billion, while XRP’s market cap is around $136.44 billion with a circulating supply of approximately 59.91 billion tokens. Based on these figures, XRP would need to experience an increase of roughly 376% in market value to match Visa’s position. If XRP’s total market capitalization were to reach $700 billion, the corresponding token price would stand at approximately $11.68. This would push XRP into the double-digit price range for the first time in its history, a milestone that has become a key talking point among analysts and investors. Currently, XRP trades near $2.26 , making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and USDT. Surpassing Visa’s valuation would not only elevate XRP’s position in global rankings but would also represent a major shift in how digital assets compare to traditional financial entities. Can XRP Overtake Visa? The possibility of XRP reaching or exceeding Visa’s valuation depends on several interrelated factors, including regulatory developments, ETF approvals , and broader institutional adoption. In mid-2025, XRP briefly achieved a market cap of over $210 billion, surpassing major companies like Uber and Shell during that rally. Although the asset has since corrected, many analysts predict a potential recovery in late 2025, which could see XRP retest its all-time highs and possibly cross into double-digit price territory. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market observers argue that a combination of regulatory clarity in the United States, Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with global financial institutions, and increased investor participation could accelerate XRP’s growth trajectory. Analysts’ Forecasts and Key Growth Catalysts Crypto analyst Zach Rector has suggested that XRP’s next significant move may begin once ETFs linked to the asset receive approval. He believes that institutional participation through regulated investment vehicles could trigger a sustained demand surge. Meanwhile, long-term investor Pumpius identified several potential catalysts that could significantly boost XRP’s valuation. These include the approval of spot XRP ETFs , Ripple’s victory in its legal battle with the SEC, and the continued expansion of Ripple’s partnerships with international financial institutions. He also pointed to growing institutional demand, technical indicators suggesting a tightening market with reduced selling pressure, and Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road, a move expected to enable greater institutional capital inflows into XRP. Pumpius considers a $10–$20 range achievable in the near term, with $50 possible if market conditions align perfectly. However, other analysts remain cautious, arguing that a $50 valuation within months would require an unprecedented level of capital inflow and global adoption. The broader consensus in the XRP community is that the asset is positioned for a strong performance if upcoming catalysts align. Achieving Visa’s market cap would translate to an XRP price of around $11–$12, signaling a multi-fold increase from current levels. While such projections remain speculative, the underlying assumption is clear: sustained institutional adoption, ETF integration, and ongoing partnerships could propel XRP toward parity with traditional financial powerhouses.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.02. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $3.04 and $3.29, with an average value of $3.16. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.423 Market Cap $800.63M Trading Volume $123.75M Circulating Supply 1.89B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.4355 24-hour Low $0.4126 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 16.57% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.5513 14-Day RSI 46.23 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.7164 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP shows mild recovery momentum, trading at $0.423 after defending the $0.35 support level. Bullish signs appear on both the daily MACD crossover and the 4-hour Alligator alignment. Optimism 1-day price chart On the 1-day price chart for November 8, OP shows a mild rebound from the $0.35 support zone, currently trading near $0.4234 after gaining traction above the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.4170. The upper Bollinger Band at $0.4838 marks the immediate resistance, while the lower band at $0.3502 secures the nearest strong support. The MACD line has turned positive, suggesting a short-term momentum shift toward bullish sentiment. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI remains subdued at 45.59 but is recovering from the oversold region of 35.82, indicating early accumulation. If price holds above $0.4170 on a daily close, a move toward $0.45–$0.48 could follow, but rejection at $0.43 may trigger another retest of $0.38. For accumulation, a good buy-in zone lies between $0.40–$0.41, with potential take-profit levels at $0.45 and $0.48. A daily close below $0.40 would invalidate near-term bullishness and expose downside risk toward $0.37. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP sustains upward movement around $0.4231, supported by the Alligator lines aligning in bullish formation. The Balance of Power indicator at 0.52 leans in favor of buyers, reflecting moderate demand strength, while the Price Volume Trend (PVT) at 70.72M confirms steady inflows. Minor retracements are visible, but the price holding above $0.4140 suggests buyers are maintaining control. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A breakout above $0.43 could initiate a short-term rally toward $0.44–$0.45, while a dip below the green Alligator line at $0.4140 might weaken the structure and invite correction toward $0.40. Intraday traders can consider entering near $0.414–$0.416 with profit targets at $0.44–$0.45 and a tight stop-loss around $0.40. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4905 SELL SMA 5 $0.4378 SELL SMA 10 $0.4365 SELL SMA 21 $0.4406 SELL SMA 50 $0.5513 SELL SMA 100 $0.6454 SELL SMA 200 $0.7164 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4611 SELL EMA 5 $0.5180 SELL EMA 10 $0.5940 SELL EMA 21 $0.6545 SELL EMA 50 $0.6836 SELL EMA 100 $0.7049 SELL EMA 200 $0.8445 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Optimism (OP) is showing early bullish signs but remains in a fragile recovery phase. Sustaining above $0.417 will confirm momentum toward $0.45–$0.48 in the coming sessions, but failure to defend $0.40 could quickly revert the trend back to a consolidation zone near $0.37. Bulls are cautiously gaining ground. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being viewed as the best crypto to invest in for investors who are positioning early before the next market cycle. Many analysts also highlight that MUTM is emerging as the next crypto to hit $1 based on its current growth pace. And although Cardano is a legitimate project in terms of its long-term credibility, its gains at this stage will remain relatively restricted because of its large market cap and slow growth cycle, exactly why investors are shifting their funds to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now, the low market cap DeFi crypto that’s been earlier in its growth cycle and has immense returns if market trends continue, as it’s been seen that Mutuum Finance has already broken through over $18.5 million in its presale stage, with over 17,800 new investors acquiring its tokens. Mutuum Finance could be the one to soon breach through the $1 market barrier in 2025, positioning itself as the next crypto to hit $1. Cardano Holding the Line Cardano (ADA) is actually currently stabilizing around the current price of $0.5348 after a rather severe pullback, with technicals indicating that this current area is forming a solid accumulation region. In terms of market structure, it appears that Cardano is forming a definite bear trap pattern that could see it rebound from a projected pullback and proceed to a possible breakout rally that will restart its positive trends in 2026. In fact, ADA is likely to make its way back to the region of $1.00+ if market fundamentals continue to support its current price at this one specific region. Nonetheless, those investors who feel that it is a bit too slow are actually looking at one of the top DeFi projects at present, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is increasingly being recognized as the best crypto to invest in going into the next cycle. Mutuum Finance Presale Continues Rapid Climb Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also holding its place as one of the fastest-uprising decentralized finance initiatives as it enters 2025. Already, it has attracted more than 17,800 unique token holders and raised more than $18.5 million in its presale event. Having successfully sold out all five of its previous presale phases, it is currently well over 85% completed in Phase 6, in which tokens sell for a price of $0.035, up 250% from its previous price of $0.01 in Phase 1. In line with the project’s entering Phase 7, it is likely that its token value will appreciate by a further 20%, getting close to its projected exchange listing price of $0.06. Early Adopters could anticipate gains of as much as sixfold their investment price, solidifying Mutuum Finance’s status in the crypto market as one of the top investment opportunities and a leading DeFi project to keep an eye out for in 2025. Because of this momentum, more analysts are confidently calling MUTM the next crypto to hit $1 during the upcoming market cycle. A Growing and Engaged Global Community Mutuum Finance has broken the barrier of 17,800+ active members in its community, signifying immense support for its mission of revolutionizing DeFi and increasing awareness of DeFi accessibility. In a bid to encourage engagement and participation in the platform, a Top 50 Leaderboard has also been introduced that is aimed at encouraging loyal contributors in the community. Major Technical Milestones Looming in Sepolia Testnet Development of the platform is going smoothly as planned. It was further noted that the first version of the project’s lending and borrowing protocol has been moving as planned, and Sepolia testnet launch is set to take place in this current quarter. This testnet version will incorporate all basic DeFi functionality that identifies a utility-driven DeFi ecosystem, such as lending, borrowing, and yield creation. This testnet is an important milestone in realizing a fully-functional and self-sustainable decentralized finance system that will take Mutuum Finance one step closer to achieving its vision. This progress continues reinforcing Mutuum Finance as the best crypto to invest in and strategic analysts forecast that this momentum aligns with its path as the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance has raised over $18.5M with 17,800+ investors, and its presale is 85% sold out at a price of 0.035. Cardano’s market is steady, but its improvement is slower because of its large market cap. Act now to get MUTM at Phase 6 rates before a price increment.

However, traders remain cautious, as this rebound could also be a temporary bull trap. With key resistance looming around $105,000–$106,000, the market’s next move will be critical in determining whether BTC can sustain an upward trend or resume its downtrend. A Possible Bullish Reversal After Reclaiming $102,000 According to Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin is showing early signs of a potential bullish reversal. In the post on X, Snyder highlighted that BTC bounced from the recent lows and reclaimed the $102,000 level, signaling renewed buying interest. This recovery comes after a period of weakness, suggesting that the market may be attempting to stabilize before the next major move. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Crash Is Important If Wave 5 Corrects To $94,000 Snyder emphasized the importance of maintaining this momentum and establishing a higher low around $101,400, which would push the bullish scenario into a more sustained rally. Conversely, a failure to maintain support here could indicate lingering bearish pressure, so this level is critical for gauging market sentiment. In the meantime, the expert is closely monitoring lower time frame charts for potential scalp-long opportunities if a reversal occurs near $101,400. This tactical approach allows active traders to capitalize on short-term swings while waiting for confirmation of a broader bullish trend. Key resistance remains at $104,700, which will be a decisive level for determining the next leg of the move. A successful breakout above this resistance could open the path toward $107,500, signaling that bulls are regaining control. However, given that it’s the weekend, Snyder cautioned that traders should be prepared for sudden swings or false breakouts as liquidity tends to be lower during this period. Bitcoin Reclaims Momentum, But $105,000–$106,000 Holds The Key In his latest update, market expert and investor Ted Pillows noted that Bitcoin briefly dropped below the $100,000 mark before bouncing back. The short-lived dip highlights ongoing uncertainty and the tug-of-war between buyers and sellers at key psychological levels. Related Reading: CryptoQuant Head Reveals Reason Behind Bearish Bitcoin Trend However, Ted cautioned that this rebound feels like a potential bull trap. While the price recovered quickly, the underlying momentum may still favor the bears, suggesting that traders should remain vigilant before assuming a sustained upward trend. He emphasized that until Bitcoin can reclaim the $105,000–$106,000 zone, the probability of further downside remains higher. Without a confirmed break above this critical resistance area, the market could continue to support levels as low as $93,394, keeping the short-term outlook skewed toward a possible downtrend.

Bitcoin is trading at a discount on Coinbase, a leading US-based crypto exchange, compared to its prices on global platforms. The exchange’s spot pricing has slipped into a discount relative to major offshore platforms. Market Sentiment Softens Ahead Of Key Economic Data A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has highlighted on X that it’s not unusual for Bitcoin to trade at a discount on Coinbase, and this happens quite often during a larger market pullback. However, the current discount is not as substantial as it was in the previous cycle. The discount is fundamentally created when the market is oversupplied with spot selling pressure originating from the Coinbase platform, particularly from the ETFs, US investors, and institutional investors. Generally, this discount on Coinbase is not the strongest sign, but it points to downward momentum. As seen on the chart, the market rarely bottoms locally without first undergoing such a period of heavy selling, which generates the discount. Daan noted that this data is similar to tracking ETF flows, and the fact that BTC’s price on Coinbase is negative is not a bullish indicator. However, if the BTC price can sustain or start grinding higher after absorbing this period of heavy selling pressure, which is indicated by the discount, that could be a bullish sign for BTC. “Always compare the data to know how the price is moving,” the expert mentioned. Why This Cycle Might Last Longer Than Expected Crypto analyst Batman has highlighted a fascinating perspective from giants like Wintermute, which suggests that the concept of the Bitcoin four-year cycle is no longer relevant. However, Wintermute is now calling for a BTC supercycle. Offering his insights on the statement, Batman is supporting the idea using the BTC chart against the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) composite. According to the expert, risky assets like BTC historically flourish in a growing economy. When the economy shows signs of slowing down, as reflected by the ISM and PMI contracting, it usually coincides with the cycle top for BTC and ushers in a period of price slowdown. Despite BTC not maintaining an all-time high level, the ISM and PMI are literally just beginning to expand, making this cycle different. A prolonged debt cycle due to the global Covid-19 shutdown may also cause the delay of the BTC cycle, as shown by the ISM and PMI starting to turn around toward an upward direction.",Bitcoin News|Batman|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|coinbase|Covid|Daan Crypto Trades|ETFs|Institute for Supply Management|ISM|PMI|Purchasing Managers’ Index,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-09 01:30:58

Over $300 million worth of XRP has recently been moved from crypto exchanges, signaling a shift in investor sentiment. While such withdrawals often suggest accumulation, current on-chain data present a mixed picture, indicating both opportunity and caution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Breaking Point As It Tests Its Most Crucial Support Line—Analyst Over $300 Million XRP Exit Crypto Exchanges According to on-chain data from Glassnode, investors have withdrawn more than 140 million XRP, valued at approximately $309 million, from crypto exchanges. At the same time, XRP’s Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (LTH NUPL) chart has revealed a more complex backdrop. The recent exchange withdrawals indicate a potential accumulation trend, suggesting that investors have begun buying XRP and are likely moving it into their respective wallets. Given the earlier wave of selling by long and short-term holders, this renewed accumulation could serve as a brief respite from the downward pressure. Notably, the LTH NUPL indicator has declined and is now approaching critical levels around 0.5. This area has been identified as a historical threshold where market optimism tends to give way to weakness. In previous cycles, a drop below the 0.5 level has often led to XRP price corrections, as long-term holders began selling and securing profits. This cycle appears no different. The LTH NUPL decline indicates that many long-term investors may be entering a distribution phase. Despite the bullishness of large-scale withdrawals, the underlying market sentiment remains cautious. A major reason for this could be the widespread liquidation events that occurred in the crypto market over the past few weeks. Earlier, on October 10, the XRP price flash crashed below $1 but retraced back above $2 within 24 hours after $19 billion was wiped out from the market. On November 3, the crypto market experienced another bleed, with about $1.4 billion liquidated in a single day. As the market recovers slowly, so does XRP. Its price is currently up 4.78% after falling more than 16% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP Price Eyes $8 Target If Key Support Holds In a separate analysis, pseudonymous crypto analyst ‘Cantonese Cat’ has shared a bullish outlook using Fibonacci Extensions to project XRP’s next move and long-term trajectory. On the monthly chart, XRP is testing the 0.886 Fib level near $2.25—a critical support area that has previously served as a foundation for major upward moves. Cantonese Cat argues that as long as this level remains intact, XRP’s next impulse could target the 1.272 Fibonacci Extension around $8.29, representing a 260% increase from current levels above $2.3. Related Reading: ‘Sell Your House, Clothes And Buy XRP’ — Solana Exec’s Wild Advice Goes Viral The chart also shows earlier resistance near $3.31, aligning with the 1.0 Fib level. If XRP successfully reclaims this zone, it could confirm its bullish structure. The subsequent extensions, highlighted by the analyst at $13.38 (1.414 Fib) and $26.63 (1.618 Fib), represent potential long-term target zones if momentum continues.

BlockDAG (BDAG) , with its record-breaking $435+ million presale and Value Era phase, continues to outperform expectations, now priced at $0.005 in Batch 32 with only 10 batches remaining. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) price prediction models have softened during technical uncertainty, and Dogecoin (DOGE) price drop concerns weigh on meme-coin sentiment. Together, these dynamics illustrate a broader shift in buyer psychology, away from high-risk volatility and toward projects demonstrating verified growth, EVM integration, and real testnet functionality. For those seeking the best crypto to buy today, BlockDAG’s consistent milestones make it stand apart as a long-term project. Ethereum Price Prediction Softens Despite Stablecoin Dominance The Ethereum (ETH) price prediction for late 2025 has shifted to a more cautious outlook. Trading near $3,850, ETH continues to show resilience as the foundation of the stablecoin economy but struggles to regain strong market dominance. Analysts now believe Ethereum’s long-awaited $10,000 target may not arrive until 2030, citing slower-than-expected adoption growth and reduced on-chain activity. Despite this, Ethereum retains a key edge, hosting over 53% of the $307B stablecoin market, including USDT and USDC. Institutional adoption grows as JPMorgan accepts crypto collateral, Ripple invests $1B in stablecoin treasuries, and BlackRock manages $2.5B in tokenized funds. Technical indicators show ETH dominance stabilizing near 12–13%, a support zone that has repeatedly triggered rebounds since April. Analysts note that if this level holds, Ethereum could reclaim strength and head toward $8,000–$10,000 by early 2026, contingent on policy clarity and sustained demand. While Ethereum remains central to Web3 finance, its near-term track appears cautious, prompting traders to explore newer ecosystems, with many eyeing BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy today for early growth potential. Dogecoin Price Drop Tests Meme Market Confidence The Dogecoin (DOGE) price drop of 2025 has left even seasoned investors questioning its next move. The world’s original meme coin, now valued around $31 billion in market cap, has fallen 36% year-to-date, reflecting waning risk appetite in speculative assets. Two primary drivers explain this decline. First, Dogecoin’s limited network utility makes it vulnerable to sharp sentiment swings. As a community-driven token with minimal transactional use, DOGE’s value tends to move in sync with broader meme coin trends. Second, a market-wide shift to risk-off conditions has hurt speculative tokens, with Shiba Inu and Pepe both down roughly 50%. Still, Dogecoin’s loyal community and growing interest from the Dogecoin Foundation, which continues to explore new use cases, suggest potential for revival if broader market confidence returns. Analysts caution, however, that DOGE remains a high-risk, high-volatility asset, suited only for aggressive investors. With Bitcoin’s next halving approaching and altcoin volatility rising, traders are rebalancing portfolios toward tangible progress, leaving Dogecoin as more of a nostalgic hold than the best crypto to buy today. BlockDAG’s $0.005 Value Era Defines Measurable Progress The BlockDAG (BDAG) presale remains one of 2025’s most successful blockchain fundraising events. Now in Batch 32, the coin trades at $0.005, with the project having raised over $435 million in presale, only 4.3B coins remain to be claimed. Over 312,000 holders and 3.5 million X1 mobile miners form the backbone of its rapidly expanding ecosystem, while 20,000 X-series hardware miners are sold worldwide. This momentum underscores the strength of the Value Era, which replaced referral incentives with a transparent vesting schedule, 40% upfront, 60% released over three months, ensuring sustained liquidity and balanced market entry. BlockDAG’s competitive edge lies in its EVM compatibility, allowing developers to easily deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts on its hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG framework. This interoperability merges Ethereum’s vast dApp ecosystem with BlockDAG’s scalable infrastructure, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second. The ongoing Awakening Testnet demonstrates this performance in real time, showcasing functional dApp deployment, contract execution, and block visualization.

On the afternoon of Friday, November 7, the premier cryptocurrency briefly fell below the psychological $100,000 level for the second time in the past week. The struggles of the Bitcoin price in recent weeks have been attributed to a shift in the behavior of investors, especially a class known as the long-term holders (LTHs). A prominent crypto expert on X has come forward with more insights as to the impact of the LTH behavior on BTC price. BTC Apparent Demand Growth Turns Negative In his latest post on the X platform, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, acknowledged that the Bitcoin long-term holders have indeed been offloading their assets over the past few weeks. The crypto expert, however, noted that this increased selling activity by LTHs is not something new. According to Moreno, it is quite normal for Bitcoin long-term investors to shave off some of their holdings during the bull markets, as they look to take some profits while prices are high. What has been different this time around is that there has been no corresponding demand to mop up these offloads. To back this, Moreno shared a chart comprising the long-term holder spending and apparent demand growth in the past few years. For context, apparent demand growth measures the difference between how much of an asset (Bitcoin, in this case) is being acquired compared to the quantity being created (mined). The CryptoQuant Head of Research noted that the Bitcoin price had reached new all-time highs in the past during periods of increased long-term holders selling—albeit with positive apparent demand growth. As observed in the chart, this occurred during all-time-high rallies of January-March 2024 and November-December 2024. The highlighted chart also shows that the Bitcoin long-term holders have been selling since October, which is not particularly out of place. However, the apparent demand growth has been contracting, implying that there has been no buy pressure to absorb the LTH supply at higher prices. Ultimately, this on-chain observation suggests that less focus should be placed on the selling activity of the Bitcoin long-term holders. If there is to be a turnaround for the price of BTC over the coming weeks, a positive apparent demand growth would need to be in place first. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency has recovered back above $100,000 and is valued at around $103,700, reflecting an almost 3% jump in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Apparent Demand|Bitcoin Long-Term Holder|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-09 03:00:46

The move strengthens Sei’s network security and reliability while adding Binance’s operational scale and institutional-grade protection. For a blockchain designed for global finance, this partnership is more than symbolic, it’s a statement. The world’s largest crypto exchange is now a Sei Network validator. @Binance — the exchange securing $180B in assets for 200M+ users — now helps secure the fastest L1. Built for global finance. Secured by global enterprises. Markets Move Faster on Sei. ($/acc) pic.twitter.com/r4tOsiT7r3 — Sei (@SeiNetwork) November 6, 2025 Binance Steps Into the Sei Ecosystem The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, now helps secure the Sei blockchain. Binance, which safeguards $180 billion in assets for over 200 million users worldwide, brings unmatched infrastructure and operational expertise to the validator set. As a validator, Binance now participates directly in Sei’s consensus process, the core mechanism that verifies and finalizes transactions on the network. This means Binance is not only supporting Sei’s security but also helping shape its next major upgrade, Sei GIGA, focused on scaling and institutional-grade throughput. Sei’s validator set now includes one of the biggest players in the global crypto ecosystem, a milestone that pushes the network into a new phase of maturity. Sei’s Rapid Rise in Institutional Adoption Built from the ground up for global finance, Sei has been gaining serious traction. The network already supports: 70 million+ wallets 4.5 million daily transactions A peak TVL (Total Value Locked) of $680 million Those numbers show strong and growing adoption. But what truly sets Sei apart is who is building on it. Sei now powers tokenized funds from leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Apollo. These are not speculative DeFi experiments, they’re institutional-grade funds, actively using Sei as their settlement layer for on-chain financial operations. Backed by partnerships with Circle, MetaMask, and Securitize, Sei’s ecosystem is bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-native infrastructure. Binance’s Entry Signals Institutional Confidence When a platform like Binance, managing hundreds of billions in user assets, becomes a validator on Sei, it sends a strong signal of confidence. It’s not just another integration or marketing move. Binance is literally helping run the network. That’s validation, not just in the technical sense, but in the institutional one too. Binance joining the validator set means the exchange is placing trust in Sei’s architecture, scalability, and security standards. For Sei, it’s a confirmation that its institutional-grade design is resonating with the industry’s biggest players. A Blockchain Built for Global Markets Sei isn’t trying to be just another Layer-1, it’s built for settlement at financial scale. The blockchain’s design focuses on low latency, high throughput, and instant finality, making it ideal for trading environments and financial markets that demand speed and reliability. That’s why the network has become a magnet for tokenized assets, RWAs (real-world assets), and institutional fund deployments. Sei’s partnerships reflect this vision: Securitize and KAIO bring regulatory-compliant frameworks for RWAs. Circle ensures stablecoin liquidity and seamless settlement. MetaMask and Etherscan integrate accessibility for users and developers. Together, they make Sei not just a blockchain, but a financial infrastructure layer designed for the next generation of markets. The Institutional Ecosystem Is Already Live What’s happening on Sei isn’t theoretical. It’s live and growing. At least five tokenized funds are already operational on the network. These funds bring real capital and real assets into an on-chain environment. With the support of institutional giants like BlackRock and Brevan Howard, Sei has positioned itself as the preferred settlement layer for on-chain finance. And now, with Binance onboard as a validator, Sei gains not only additional security but also global visibility across Binance’s massive ecosystem. For many, this could be the moment that Sei enters mainstream awareness. Sei GIGA and What Comes Next Binance’s participation also aligns with Sei’s upcoming GIGA upgrade, a key milestone aimed at scaling transaction capacity and expanding validator diversity. As a validator, Binance will contribute directly to the security and performance of the new upgrade. This collaboration marks the beginning of Sei’s next expansion phase, where performance meets institutional reliability. The inclusion of Binance in this stage signals that Sei is ready for the next level of financial-grade infrastructure, global scale, verified security, and seamless performance. Confidence Through Collaboration The crypto market moves fast, and Sei’s motto, “Markets Move Faster on Sei”, is proving true. By combining Binance’s global infrastructure with Sei’s optimized Layer-1 architecture, the network now operates under one of the most secure and scalable validator sets in the industry. This collaboration reinforces Sei’s reputation as the fastest L1, purpose-built for institutions that demand more than speed, they demand trust, compliance, and execution. Global Finance Is Moving On-Chain The convergence between traditional institutions and blockchain ecosystems has been slow, until now. With tokenized funds already live, regulated partners in place, and now Binance securing the network, Sei is emerging as the on-chain foundation for global markets. This is what institutional-grade blockchain adoption looks like: Real funds. Verified validators. Scalable infrastructure. Transparent security. Sei isn’t just fast, it’s financially functional. @Binance becoming a validator on @SeiNetwork is a milestone that speaks volumes. The world’s largest crypto exchange, with 200 million+ users and $180 billion in assets secured, has chosen to help secure the fastest L1 for institutional finance. That’s not something anyone should overlook. It’s a clear signal that Sei’s infrastructure, reliability, and global vision have captured institutional trust. Built for global finance. Secured by global enterprises. Markets move faster on Sei. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

That popularity, though, has made it an attractive target for scammers who often impersonate the exchange’s support services to lure victims. Clients are advised always to verify information through official channels and remain skeptical of unsolicited messages. French and Italian Users are in Greater Danger Earlier this week, Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng, sounded the alarm about recent phishing scams on the messaging platform WhatsApp. He clarified that the company will never message users in groups regarding investments or funds. Seeing more phishing scams on WhatsApp lately. Please stay cautious – Binance will never message you in groups about investments or funds. If in doubt, verify first. — Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) November 7, 2025 Prior to that, the exchange issued a detailed warning on the matter. The team has identified a wave of WhatsApp scams where bad actors pretend to be Binance representatives, especially in regions like France and Italy, to deceive clients and request funds or offer fake investment advice. “Let’s be clear: Binance will never contact you on WhatsApp to offer investment opportunities, request payments, or ask for your personal information. Anyone claiming to represent Binance and reaching out to you this way is attempting to scam or defraud you,” the company stated. According to Binance, these impersonation scams have become increasingly sophisticated, noting that the perpetrators also use Telegram and other platforms to target victims. The firm’s team said knowledge about the threat is the most vigorous defense, urging users to spread the word about any potential scams and thus protect the community. “To stay protected, always verify information through Binance’s official channels — our website, verified social media accounts, or the Binance App. Staying alert, informed, and skeptical of unsolicited messages is the best way to keep your crypto secure. Together, we can build a safer crypto community for everyone,” the alert reads. Additional Security Measures Earlier this year, CEO Richard Teng advised all users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA), utilize the safety tools provided by Binance to their fullest extent, and remain vigilant for potential fraudulent schemes. His reminder came a few months after some of the exchange’s users were targeted in an SMS spoofing attack. Specifically, clients received text messages that appeared to come from the usual number used for sending verification codes. The SMS claimed their accounts had supposedly been accessed from North Korea, urging them to set up a specific wallet and transfer all their funds there. Needless to say, this was a scam, and those sending holdings to the dubious address suffered losses.

Traders and fund managers are watching November closely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Breaking Point As It Tests Its Most Crucial Support Line—Analyst According to speakers at the event, several timetabled moves could push more money into the token in the short term. Canary Capital ETF Timetable Canary Capital’s spot ETF is set to go live after an updated S-1 filing, with a possible automatic launch 20 days later on November 13. Reports from the stage cited Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, as confirming the update. That filing removed an amendment clause that would have given the SEC greater control over the product’s effective date. Based on reports, the timeline could still shift if the SEC returns questions or if government operations change, but for now November 13 stands out as a key date. Retail And Whale Activity Cool CryptoQuant charts show retail trading activity has cooled since the big sell-off on October 10, when about $19 billion was wiped out in a single day. Small investors have pulled back into a neutral zone, which some analysts read as cautious waiting rather than exit. At the same time, large on-chain moves to exchanges have dropped sharply — from roughly 49,000 on October 25 and 44,000 on October 11 to about 800 on a recent Friday. That fall in whale-to-exchange transactions suggests fewer big sellers are moving funds to exchanges right now. “The last half of November is going to be big for $XRP and @Ripple,” said @TeucriumETFs CEO @GilbertieSal during a recap of #RippleSwell Day 1. Head on a swivel ladies and gentlemen… Believe! ✨ pic.twitter.com/mw9VLuRUCB — rayfuentes (@RayFuentesIO) November 5, 2025 Institutional Signals Speakers at Swell pointed to increasing institutional interest. Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie told audiences that the last half of November could be very important for XRP, tying that view to broader trends in tokenization and institutional flows. Citibank projections cited at the event say tokenized assets could hit trillions within five years, and other panelists mentioned planned moves by traditional finance players. Based on reports, Circle also has plans to begin trading public equities in early December, which some see as another nudge toward more mainstream involvement. Advice From Market Players Gilbertie urged holders to focus on the long term. “Believe in it. Don’t worry about volatility. It will even out as adoption comes and more institutional money enters,” he said. That view was shared by other commentators who pointed out that ETF listings and institutional onboarding have historically changed how markets price assets.

For now, reports suggest a mix of wariness among retail traders and growing institution-level interest, with November 13 marked as a date many are watching.
