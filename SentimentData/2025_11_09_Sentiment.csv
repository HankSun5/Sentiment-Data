CZ said he never met President Donald Trump, never discussed any deal with him, and did not have financial ties with any member of Trump’s family. The Binance founder said the pardon surprised him because there was no hint of timing or progress during the petition process. He said his lawyers filed the request in April, but he never received updates before the decision came down. When asked about Trump saying he didn’t know him , CZ said Trump meant they didn’t have a personal relationship. “We have never met. We have never talked,” CZ said. Trump also said, “I don’t know who he is,” when asked why he pardoned him. Trump added that his sons “are into it,” referring to crypto, and said they run businesses and are not involved in government. CZ said the closest he came to meeting anyone from the Trump family was speaking briefly with Eric Trump at a Bitcoin Mina conference in Abu Dhabi. He emphasized that this single meeting did not involve business, planning, or legal discussion. Charges, guilty plea, and prison time explained The Department of Justice previously said CZ made Binance the largest crypto exchange by encouraging U.S. customer activity while refusing to follow U.S. laws. The DOJ said he violated anti-money laundering rules and sanctions rules that they believed protected the U.S. financial system. In November 2023, CZ pleaded guilty. He said he chose to plead guilty because he wanted to handle the situation directly. “I think it’s the best way to confront the problem and solve it head on,” he said. He voluntarily flew to the United States from a non-extradition country to face the case. He said he did not dispute the charges or the plea. “I do not have anything to debate,” he said. He also noted he became the first known first-time offender in U.S. history to receive prison time for a single non-fraud offense of this type. When speaking about how the pardon happened, CZ said he did not know whether it would be granted. “I don’t know when or if it’s going to happen,” he said. He said he understood why some people questioned the timing, but insisted there was nothing exchanged. “There is no deal,” said CZ. “There has never been any discussions.” He rejected reports claiming his representatives tried to negotiate with Trump allies before the election. He also rejected claims that Binance discussed arrangements with World Liberty Financial, a company tied to Trump’s sons. “There’s no business relationship between me and Binance and World Liberty Finance,” he said. Trump’s stance on crypto and regulatory clarity During recent remarks, Trump said he ended what he called the Biden administration’s “war on crypto,” and said he wanted the United States to become the “Bitcoin superpower” and the “crypto capital of the world.” CZ said he is grateful for the pardon and wants to support clearer regulation in the industry. He said he now sees more regulatory clarity in the United States than he did during the period when he was charged. He referenced the Genius Act, saying more structure benefits the entire industry, although he noted he is not a lawyer and does not know every detail. Near the end of the interview, he said he believes his name is already clear now that the legal process and pardon are complete. He said he wants to focus on new work and positive activities going forward. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

While this may suggest the predominance of a bearish sentiment among its investors, a recent on-chain evaluation has surfaced, explaining why the Bitcoin price might soon experience a major reversal. Binance Sees Increased STH Activity; Triggers Liquidation Cascade In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, on-chain analyst Amr Taha reveals a sudden shift in Bitcoin retail activity on the Binance network. Taha’s report dwells on the ‘[Bitcoin] LTH/STH Buy/Sell Binance’ metric, which tracks buying and selling activity on Binance, distinguishing between Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). Taha points out that as of the 3rd and 5th of November, Binance recorded a significant increase in the selling activity of Bitcoin’s STHs, especially from holders known as “clown wallets”. About 251 BTC flowed into Binance on the 3rd of November, while an even greater amount of BTC, approximately 517, was sent to Binance on the 5th of this month. Owing to these STHs’ usual inclination to panic, their positions often serve as liquidity to the cryptocurrency’s long-term holders who grab the chance of accumulation amid a fear-driven retail market. On another hand, the analyst highlights results from the BTC: Binance Liquidation Delta, a metric that measures the difference between long and short liquidations on Binance, thereby revealing if more long or short positions are being forcefully closed. According to Taha, most of the recent liquidations appear to be long positions that were both entered too late into the Bitcoin cycle, and with high leverage. These positions were forcefully closed within the $107,000-$100,500 range, triggering what is commonly known as a long squeeze. For context, a long squeeze is a series of sales that follows after traders with overleveraged long positions are threatened, or have been wiped out. Although a long squeeze typically causes the price to drop swiftly, it poses no significant issue to a cryptocurrency’s long-term investors. As a result, Bitcoin’s long-term holders have historically seen these events as accumulation chances, thereby standing as a soft cushion against the sharp nosedive the cryptocurrency’s price may be seeing. If historical trends were to recur, BTC may soon reach its price bottom, after which an accumulation and possible price expansion may ensue. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $103,500. The cryptocurrency has seen a 24-hour growth of more than 2%, per data from CoinMarketCap.",Bitcoin|binance|bitcoin|Bitcoin long squeeze|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin retailers panic sell|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-08 21:00:43

Wall Street’s love affair with artificial intelligence faces a brutal reality check as major AI stocks plummet, sending shockwaves through tech markets and raising urgent questions about the sustainability of the AI investment boom. Why Wall Street’s AI Bet Is Facing Unprecedented Pressure The Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its worst week since April, dropping 3% as Wall Street sentiment toward artificial intelligence stocks turned sharply negative. This dramatic shift comes despite massive continued investment from tech giants, creating a puzzling disconnect between corporate spending and market confidence. The AI Stocks Bloodbath: Who’s Hurting Most? Leading AI companies experienced significant declines that shook investor confidence across the sector: Palantir: 11% drop this week Oracle: 9% decline Nvidia: 7% loss Meta and Microsoft: Both down approximately 4% What’s Driving the Nasdaq Decline in AI Stocks? Several factors are contributing to the erosion of investor confidence in artificial intelligence companies: Factor Impact Stretched Valuations AI stocks had reached unsustainable price levels Economic Headwinds Government shutdown, consumer sentiment decline High Expectations Good news no longer moves stock prices significantly Widespread Layoffs Broader economic concerns affecting tech sector Expert Analysis: Wall Street’s Changing Perspective Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital summarized the sentiment perfectly: “Valuations are stretched. Just the slightest bit of bad news gets exaggerated… and good news is just not enough to move the needle because expectations are already pretty high.” This highlights how fragile investor confidence has become in the AI sector. Comparing Market Performance: AI vs Traditional Stocks The Nasdaq decline significantly outpaced other major indices, suggesting this is specifically an AI and tech stocks problem rather than a broader market issue: Nasdaq Composite: -3.0% S&P 500: -1.6% Dow Jones Industrial Average: -1.2% Actionable Insights for AI Investors For those monitoring Wall Street movements and AI stocks, consider these strategies: Diversify beyond pure AI plays Focus on companies with proven revenue streams Monitor earnings reports for spending sustainability Watch for signs of renewed investor confidence FAQs: Understanding the AI Market Shift Which companies were most affected by the Nasdaq decline? Major AI players including Palantir , Oracle , and Nvidia saw significant drops. What did Jack Ablin say about the situation? Cresset Capital’s Chief Investment Officer warned about stretched valuations and high expectations. How does this compare to other market indices? The tech-heavy Nasdaq decline was nearly double that of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones, indicating specific AI stocks pressure. Are Microsoft and Meta still investing in AI? Yes, both Microsoft and Meta indicated continued heavy AI spending despite the market reaction. The Bottom Line: Temporary Setback or Major Shift? The recent Wall Street retreat from AI stocks represents a crucial moment for investor confidence. While the long-term potential of artificial intelligence remains undeniable, the market is clearly signaling that unsustainable valuations and economic headwinds require a more cautious approach. The Nasdaq decline serves as a stark reminder that even the most promising technologies must eventually deliver tangible results to maintain market support.

The public company has made its name for its aggressive Ethereum (ETH) accumulation strategy, and the implication of sales would have raised questions about the health of its business and its liquidity levels. The wrong label had far-reaching effects According to the post shared by Lookonchain and based on data from Arkham, SharpLink had redeemed 5,284 ETH and deposited 4,364 ETH to the OKX exchange hours before. Historically, such moves usually precede entities offloading tokens on the market. All that attention translated into widespread speculation, with the consensus leaning towards SharpLink initiating a major ETH sell-off. It did not help matters that Ethereum’s price had been seeing volatility, and the unrealized losses on the company holdings kept mounting. What followed was short-term market jitters. However, all that ended after Sheffield implied in a tweet that the wallet does not belong to SharpLink and that it was incorrectly tagged on Arkham’s platform. In response to his post, Arkham revealed that the “label is a prediction from our AI model, not an Arkham-verified label. AI predicted labels are indicated by the purple outline and question mark.” The post continued by saying Arkham-verified SharpLink wallets appear under the SharpLink entity on Arkham and that the wallet in question is not one of those. Sheffield expressed appreciation for the clarification from Arkham while confirming that the wallet no longer reflects the SharpLink label. “Making predictions on wallet owners is an interesting problem,” he added . “Probabilistic assumptions are definitionally never going to be 100% accurate. But it’s generally an effective tagging algo from what I’ve seen. Big fan of the Arkham product.” The incident briefly put some sell pressure on ETH prices and the SBET stock, which dipped up to 8% on November 6. However, the market has since corrected as sentiments stabilize. SharpLink raised $76.5 million through a premium-priced stock deal SharpLink raised $76.5 million in a direct stock offering priced above market, according to a press release from the company last month. According to the release, it sold 4.5 million shares at $17 per share, a 12% premium over its $15.15 closing price on October 15. That price reflected a premium to the company’s net asset value of its 859K ETH holdings, reflecting what the company called “strong institutional confidence” in its strategy. Top 10 Ethereum holding entities. Source: Strategic ETH Reserve An unnamed institutional investor scooped up the shares and also got a 90-day option to buy another 4.5 million shares at $17.50. For now, the firm’s Ether holdings are second only to Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ), which currently has 3.40 million ETH in its treasury. It has achieved this by using equity issuances to fund purchases in a self-reinforcing cycle during bull markets. Even though the strategy has worked out so far, it continues to attract mixed reviews with critics grounding their argument in factors like over-leverage and volatility exposure.

54178783,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=27011,1762636556,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What are Trustless Agents on Ethereum?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/what-are-trustless-agents-on-ethereum/,"Trustless agents on Ethereum are autonomous software entities that can identify themselves, advertise their capabilities, and interact with users or other agents without requiring pre-existing trust, relying instead on on-chain registries for identity, reputation, and optional external verification to establish reliability and accountability. This framework aims to support an open, interoperable marketplace of agents built by different developers, allowing them to coordinate tasks and provide services across Web3 in a permissionless and transparent manner, potentially expanding Ethereum’s role from a financial settlement layer into a broader coordination network for distributed automation. What Capabilities Can Trustless Agents Bring to Ethereum? ERC-8004 , a recently proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal, introduces the concept of Trustless Agents on Ethereum. Trustless agents on Ethereum refer to autonomous or semi-autonomous software agents that can advertise their capabilities, interact with users or other agents, and perform tasks without requiring any pre-existing trust between participants. Instead of operating inside closed platforms or corporate ecosystems, these agents use on-chain registries to establish identity, reputation, and verifiable assurances about their behaviour. The aim is to enable an open marketplace of agents that can be discovered, selected, and coordinated based on transparent and composable trust signals, rather than institutional branding or platform control. This allows agents created by different developers or organisations to interoperate within the same network while maintaining verifiable security guarantees. The trust framework is organised around three registries deployed on Ethereum or its scaling networks. An Identity Registry assigns each agent a unique on-chain identifier that links to external metadata and service endpoints. A Reputation Registry allows users and other agents to submit feedback after interactions, supporting both simple on-chain scoring and more sophisticated off-chain analysis. A Validation Registry introduces structured verification, enabling independent auditors, stake-backed re-execution, zero-knowledge machine learning proofs (zkML), or trusted hardware attestations to confirm whether an agent performed a task correctly. Together, these components provide a shared infrastructure for discovery, evaluation, and trust formation across agents. This model could be significant for Ethereum and Web3 because it makes it possible to coordinate services and automation across organisational boundaries, without relying on centralised platforms. Instead of depending on a handful of dominant AI providers, users could choose from a diverse set of agents based on capability, cost, reputation, or cryptographic validation. Developers benefit from shared trust infrastructure rather than building siloed systems from scratch, making agent ecosystems more interoperable and extensible. In this context, Ethereum becomes not only a settlement layer for digital assets, but also a coordination network for AI agent-driven distributed services. Trustless agents offer the possibility of open agent economies, where both humans and autonomous systems can request work, negotiate terms, and establish trust in a permissionless manner. The protocol supports tasks ranging from everyday low-risk actions to high-stakes operations requiring stronger guarantees, by allowing the trust model to scale with the value at risk. If adopted widely, trustless agents could reduce dependency on centralised intermediaries, encourage competition and specialisation, and expand the scope of decentralised applications well beyond finance into automation, labour coordination, and shared computation. Key challenges ahead include designing robust reputation mechanisms, preventing manipulation, and establishing sustainable incentive structures that promote reliable long-term behaviour. What Could Web3 Look Like With an Agent Economy? A Web3 agent economy envisions a digital environment where autonomous software agents, acting on behalf of individuals, organisations, or other agents, can discover services, negotiate terms, and complete tasks without requiring intermediaries. Instead of users manually interacting with protocols, marketplaces, or DApps, agents could handle routine decisions such as searching for the best lending rate, comparing token swaps, updating security configurations, or coordinating payments. These agents would operate in a permissionless environment where identity, trust, and verification are handled through shared blockchain infrastructure rather than proprietary platforms. The result is a shift from user-driven interaction to goal-driven outcomes, where users specify intent and agents execute it across multiple systems. In such an economy, blockchain networks function as coordination layers rather than just settlement layers. Smart contracts define rules, incentives, and dispute processes, while registries allow agents to prove identity, advertise capabilities, and receive feedback. Trust models could vary by context: everyday tasks may rely on reputation scores, while high-value or high-risk actions could require cryptographic proofs, stake-backed guarantees, or trusted hardware attestations. Importantly, these trust mechanisms would be interoperable rather than siloed, allowing agents developed by different teams to interact reliably. This would encourage a competitive ecosystem where capabilities, not brand ownership, determine which agents are selected for tasks. For users, an agent-driven web3 could make interacting with decentralised systems more accessible. Instead of navigating complex wallets, protocols, and bridging operations, individuals could delegate actions to personal agents designed to optimise for cost, speed, risk tolerance, or ethical preferences. For businesses, the agent economy could streamline automated supply chains, audits, compliance checks, and data services, all coordinated through shared trust layers. Because these systems are open and composable, smaller developers and organisations could participate without the scaling disadvantages that exist in centralised markets. The impact could reshape digital labour and economic coordination. Agents could specialise in particular domains, financial routing, data analysis, logistics brokerage, content generation, and then coordinate with one another to complete complex workflows. Economies would no longer rely solely on large platforms to intermediate trust; instead, trust would emerge from cryptography, transparent feedback systems, and verifiable execution. The transition, however, would also introduce challenges, including ensuring fair reputation systems, preventing sybil manipulation, designing incentives that discourage malicious behaviour, and balancing automation with human oversight. If these issues are addressed, a Web3 agent economy could shift the internet from a platform-centric model to an open, interoperable environment defined by freely interacting autonomous services. How Soon Can We Expect Autonomous Agents in the Ethereum Ecosystem? The emergence of autonomous agents in the Ethereum ecosystem is already underway, though their widespread adoption will unfold gradually over the next several years. Early agent frameworks exist today in the form of bots, intent-based transaction systems, MEV searchers, automated trading strategies, and smart-contract–driven scheduling tools. However, these systems are narrowly scoped and lack general-purpose reasoning, discovery, and trust frameworks needed for agents to interact openly across applications. Recent developments in on-chain identity standards, agent registries, and AI model interfaces signal that the underlying foundation for more capable, interoperable agents is being actively built, but is still in its early stages. Short-term progress (over the next 12–24 months) is likely to focus on personal and organisational “helper agents” that execute routine tasks under explicit user permission. These agents may manage token transfers, monitor risk thresholds, rebalance liquidity positions, or negotiate trades across decentralised exchanges. Because the consequences are relatively contained and tasks are well-defined, these early agent systems do not require strong on-chain trust guarantees beyond signatures and auditability. Rather than fully autonomous behaviour, we will see semi-automated agents that augment user decision-making while preserving human oversight. More advanced agent economies, where agents discover, evaluate, and coordinate with other agents in untrusted environments, will depend on the establishment of shared trust frameworks. Proposed Ethereum standards for agent identity, reputation registries, and cryptoeconomic validation are attempting to address this gap by enabling agents built by different parties to verify each other’s performance history and reliability. The maturity of these systems will also depend on improvements in compute infrastructure, including zkML proofs, secure enclaves, and scalable rollups capable of hosting agent reasoning and inference workloads. Realistically, robust cross-organisational autonomous agent markets may take three to five years to meaningfully develop. The long-term transition is likely to be evolutionary rather than abrupt. As smart contract platforms become more modular, intent-based architectures become normalised, and AI inference becomes cheaper to verify, agents will shift from optional conveniences to default interaction patterns. Users may no longer sign every transaction manually; instead, they may set preference boundaries and allow agents to act on their behalf across DeFi, social applications, and coordination networks. The trajectory suggests that autonomous agents will not replace human decision-making, but will increasingly serve as intermediaries that translate human intent into complex, multi-step on-chain actions. In this sense, the question is less about “if” autonomous agents will become central to Ethereum, and more about how smoothly and securely this transition can be governed.

And when they have to pick between Bitcoin and gold, they don’t even blink. “Sovereigns buy gold. People like me? We buy Bitcoin,” Arthur said during a no‑bullshit interview with Coin Bureau, where he laid out why nation-states are doubling down on gold while individuals flee to crypto for one thing: freedom. Bitcoin is freedom‑proof, it runs without permission, can’t be seized, and lets you walk away with your wealth in your head. But gold is politics‑proof, it’s trusted, old, and has been traded between nations for thousands of years. Arthur said that’s why “you could lose your job if you bought Bitcoin and it tanked 75%. You won’t if you buy gold.” And the world’s governments don’t care about your freedom; they only care about their power. Every Bitcoin cycle begins with money printers Arthur broke down four major Bitcoin cycles and how every single one had its roots in credit expansion. The first came in 2009, right as Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve launched unlimited quantitative easing after a $700 billion bailout. Bitcoin was born at that moment. Then came China’s massive infrastructure stimulus between 2008 and 2011. “Both China and the U.S. were printing a shit ton of money,” Arthur said, and Bitcoin took off. By late 2013, things reversed. The Fed slowed liquidity, China pulled back on credit, and the first bubble popped at $1,300. Then came 2015, when a random Bitfinex wick liquidated 6,000 BTC. Arthur remembered it. So did the markets. China soon devalued its currency and fired up another stimulus wave. That led to the 2017 rally. “China did housing, infrastructure, all of it,” Arthur explained. But as the U.S. hiked rates, the party ended. Then came COVID. The U.S. handed out stimulus checks like candy. Arthur said people “bought Bitcoin, bought cars, bought whatever the fuck they wanted.” That’s what pushed Bitcoin to $69,000 in 2021. But once Jerome Powell hinted at rate hikes in March 2022, that was it. “That was the top,” Arthur said. The current cycle? It’s Janet Yellen’s doing. Arthur called her “Bad Girl Yellen” and said she drained $2.5 trillion from the reverse repo to juice markets while Powell pretended to fight inflation. Now, that facility is empty. Arthur said we’re at the edge of the next move, and “as long as politicians keep printing, we keep pumping.” He expects the rally to extend into 2027 or 2028, because “they’re all lying, and they’re not raising taxes. They’ll just print.” Sovereigns ditch treasuries and hoard gold Arthur said the gold story changed in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and the U.S. froze their reserves. “They stole Russia’s money, and that was a wake-up call,” he said. He pointed out that sovereign wealth managers saw how easy it is for the U.S. to seize assets if it doesn’t like your country or your politics. Since then, China, Singapore, and others have been “hoovering gold.” They’re dumping treasuries and stocking up on gold because, Arthur said, “if it can happen to Russia, it can happen to anyone.” The breaking point came when Israel bombed Qatar, the world’s largest gas exporter. Arthur said that exposed how little control the U.S. actually has over its own so-called allies. “If I’m selling oil in a currency that’s losing 8–9% a year and I’m still getting bombed, why the fuck am I doing this?” he asked. That’s why countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are signing new security deals, and why China and Saudi Arabia are now settling oil trades in yuan, not dollars. But Bitcoin? Still too risky for sovereigns. Arthur said it’s a credit story, tied to dollar liquidity, not politics. “Once banks tighten, Bitcoin reacts. That’s why it dropped 20%.” He pointed to the SOFR rates trading above Fed funds and said the Fed’s been injecting emergency cash again. “That’s why Bitcoin dipped. It’s not about ETFs or memes. It’s dollars.” Arthur owns both Bitcoin and gold. But he doesn’t mix them up. “Gold buys you oil and medicine. Bitcoin gets you out.” He also talked about altcoins, saying he sold Hype for two reasons: token unlocks and a down payment on a Ferrari Testarossa. “Everyone wants a Ferrari, bro, especially in Singapore.” Arthur said the unlocks will compress the multiple. He plans to buy back in, but only after the market reprices future earnings. “They say Jeff won’t sell. Yeah, right. Everyone sells.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $104,201, it will fuel a bullish rally to $111,048. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $98,723, beginning a bearish trend to $95,593. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as buyers failed to push the price above Fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , miners sent a total of 210K BTC to exchanges in October, while the past week saw 122,000 coins flow into Binance. Bitcoin price prediction November 2025 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $103K due to the market crash in October. However, it is now facing heavy accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around November 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction November 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-08 21:37:35

Privacy advocates are fighting back against what they believe is regulatory hostility toward privacy-enhancing crypto tools, rallying support to potentially escalate their lobby to the level of the White House. The Bitcoin community disapproves of the Samourai dev sentencing The Bitcoin Policy Institute and several well-known libertarian activists are gathering support after Samourai Wallet developer Keonne Rodriguez was sentenced to five years in prison for running an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The case is being viewed as part of a growing crackdown on financial anonymity. Angela McArdle, Chair of the Libertarian National Committee and a known Bitcoin advocate, posted on X. “The Samourai Wallet sentencing is terrible. I am working on it. I am working on a LOT of these cases. I need Bitcoiners to flex their influence right now. You need to make calls to the admin. We will not win this in woke courts. We can win in the White House.” Zack Shapiro, the co-founder of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a nonprofit that promotes Bitcoin-related research and advocacy, has also called for an organized outreach to lawmakers and the government administration, responding to McArdle’s post with support, writing on X: “For Bitcoiners who are upset about the Samourai Wallet outcome, this is our best shot going forward. @RealAngelaMc was one of the main driving forces behind the Ross pardon, so please reach out with any support you can give.” His message refers to the 2020 pardon campaign for Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road, which McArdle helped lead through a coalition of libertarian and Bitcoin activists. The Trump administration pardoned Ulbricht in January 2025, as reported by Cryptopolitan at the time. Crypto lobbyists mount frontier for privacy On November 6, 2025, Judge Denise L. Cote sentenced Rodriguez to 60 months in federal prison, ending a legal episode that started when Rodriguez and Lonergan Hill were arrested in April 2024. Both pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges on July 30, 2025. The Samourai Wallet, which was marketed as a “premium privacy service” for Bitcoin users. Prosecutors claimed that the wallet processed roughly $237 million in illicit transactions between 2015 and April 2024. Its website and social media promotions emphasized anonymity and ease of use, highlighting features like “no email address, no ID check, and no hassle.” Tornado Cash developers are facing similar charges for running an Ethereum-based mixer, and its resolution could depend on the efforts of these crypto privacy advocates. Critics argue that punishing open-source developers for the actions of users threatens innovation and civil liberties, while supporters of the ruling believe it reinforces accountability in the crypto industry.

Smart investors who rode that wave are now scanning the market for the next crypto to explode before the next major bull leg starts. While many altcoins are already overextended or trading near cycle highs, the spotlight is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi token priced at only $0.035 that is quickly building a reputation as the top crypto with asymmetric upside potential. Adding an element of greater urgency is that Stage 6 of the MUTM presale is almost completely sold out, with a staggering 85% already earmarked for purchase, a clear sign of stepped-up demand and growing FOMO in those that have so far invested. Those who recognized Solana’s breakout potential early didn’t wait for mainstream confirmation, they acted when the value was still hidden. The same pattern is emerging here: MUTM is still under $0.05, still pre-exchange, and still in accumulation territory, exactly the zone where life-changing gains are made for those who move before the masses. Solana Price Prediction Solana is displaying a sign of trying to recover after reverting from its rising trendline support, thus forming a possible short-term relief rally setup. Technical analysis indicates that SOL will likely target the $180 area, which meets several technical resistances, including its upper channel line, previous resistance points, as well as the 0.5-level of Fibonacci retracement of its recent drop. This area is most likely where bears will re-enter, thus forming a possible lower high (LH) formation. Failure of SOL to overshoot through the $180 barrier with good market volume will clearly show that a realistic switch to the $125-$135 area is likely, which matches its previous accumulation points as well as its lower channel line. On a short-term perspective, an oversold Stochastic RSI making a positive curl is a clear sign that new buying is already building in strength, thus supporting a possible short-term bounce before a deeper trend is determined. This is a situation that is attracting a lot of traders’ attention, although it also points towards why investors are looking at cheaper high-upside alternatives in the market, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerging as one of the most popular early market projects. a New Era of Decentralized Finance Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the most innovative and influential initiatives within DeFi. The current presale has been performing above estimates, attracting over 17,800 participants while securing a total of over 18.5 million in contributions. This is a clear reflection of increasing market confidence in investors, as Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the most attractive cryptos in the market today Essentially, Mutuum Finance brings in a new kind of decentralized lending and borrowing system based on transparency, stability, and fairness. It enables lenders to define conditions of repayment while granting borrowers flexible interest rates aligned with market trends. This balanced and flexible system provides a more efficient and trustworthy alternative to traditional DeFi lending platforms Defining a Future Standard of DeFi Platforms Through the creation of a system whereby lenders and borrowers conduct their business in an open and fair manner, Mutuum Finance is setting a precedent that will define the decentralized finance market of the future. Its strategy focuses on reliability, empowerment of the community, and economic functionality in a manner that makes it an exceptional coin in the changing DeFi market. Mutuum Finance has already managed to raise over $18.5 million and attract well over 17,800 presale participants at a stage where its presale Stage 6 is already over 85% sold out at a price of only $0.035. This is a clear sign of its popularity and an increasing recognition that it is likely to have a similar start to that of market successes such as Solana before it went mainstream. Mutuum Finance’s model that focuses on the future of DeFi, a growing presale stage success rate, and its overall undervaluation in relation to its plan make it have one of the most attractive asymmetric investment profiles in the market at present.

Chanos, who has been known for buying Bitcoin and shorting Strategy, confirmed the exit in a post on X , saying, “As we have gotten some inquiries, I can confirm that we have unwound our $MSTR/Bitcoin hedged trade as of yesterday’s open.” The decision marks the end of an 11-month bet that Strategy’s stock was overvalued relative to the Bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet. The pair trade, recommended in December 2024 at Chanos & Co.’s annual Bears in Hibernation conference, involved shorting Strategy shares against a long position in Bitcoin. At the time, Strategy traded at 2.5 times its market-adjusted net asset value (mNAV). Arbitrage thesis fulfilled The short bet proved exceptionally profitable. Strategy’s mNAV has now fallen to 1.23x, crossing Chanos’s pre-set cover threshold of 1.25x. “At today’s opening prices, MSTR (~$224) is down roughly 50% from its 2025 peak,” the firm said in an investor note shared alongside Chanos’s post. “The implied premium (MSTR EV less BTC holding value) is currently ~$15 billion, down from a peak of $80 billion in November 2024.” Chanos has been vocal in his criticism of Strategy’s premium and frequent equity issuance, reportedly calling it financial gibberish . “While we still believe there is more room for mNAV compression, the thesis has largely played out,” the firm wrote. “We recommend letting others chase the last leg of the trade as MSTR inevitably marches towards a 1.0x mNAV.” Strategy’s market capitalization has fallen by over 14% from last year, when it was valued at over $80.8 billion. The current decline in Bitcoin prices, currently trading around $102,000, is also impacting Strategy’s treasury and stock performance, given that its portfolio is heavily Bitcoin-focused. However, as of the time of writing, MSTR is trading at around $241, up by over 4.7%. A vote of confidence for Bitcoin? However, despite the decline, Strategy has still been championing more Bitcoin acquisition, calling for more people to invest in the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. James Van Straten , senior analyst at CoinDesk, while reacting to Chanos’ announcement on X, described the move as “a signal that value starts to step in here, as Bitcoin is considerably undervalued against USD, Mag 7 and gold.” Some analysts on X went further to say that Strategy is undervalued Moments after Chanos’s post, Michael Saylor , Strategy’s founder and chairman, took to X to write simply: “₿uy Now.” His two-word message was reminiscent of the same bullish sentiment that has long defined his approach to Bitcoin accumulation. Outlook for MSTR and Bitcoin Chanos did not rule out further mNAV compression as Strategy continues to issue new shares to buy more Bitcoin. With the ratio now approaching parity at 1.23x, he said it was “prudent to cover” and allow others to pursue the remaining downside. Bitcoin’s price reaction to the announcement was not impressive, as it’s still down by 1% from the previous day. Still, traders on X and crypto forums treated the closure as a psychological boost, framing it as a sign that institutional shorts like Chanos are losing conviction against Bitcoin-linked equities. However, some believe it is a loss of faith in Bitcoin itself and an investor taking his profits before a major bear phase hits the market. Saylor and Strategy continue to maintain a bullish posture, as the firm recently added more BTC to its treasury, bringing total holdings to 641,205 BTC .

Although the general digital asset market has faltered in recent weeks, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency has continued to ascend to new price highs. While the large-cap assets have been waxing and waning in terms of market value, the price of ZCash has been on a tear in the past week, breaking into the list of the top-20 largest cryptocurrencies in the sector. Now, the latest on-chain data suggests that euphoria is setting in the ZEC market. ZCash Puell Multiple Hits New All-Time High In a November 7 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson revealed that the ZCash market might be overheating after weeks of significant upward price movement. According to the on-chain expert, the sentiment surrounding the coin seems to have finally reached the euphoria stage. Related Reading: Most Dangerous Bitcoin Boom Yet? Ray Dalio Warns Of ‘Stimulus Into A Bubble’ Wedson noted that the group of network participants mostly behind this euphoria is the ZEC miners. This on-chain observation revolves around two primary metrics, including the Puell Multiple and the Hash Rate. For context, the Puell Multiple is a metric that correlates the issuance value of an asset to its 365-day moving average. This metric measures miners’ profitability on an annualized basis, signaling potential market tops or bottoms. According to the highlighted data from Alphractal, the ZCash Puell Multiple just hit an all-time high, indicating significantly high profitability for the miners. This on-chain signal also suggests that the ZEC price could still have more room for upside movement. Furthermore, Wedson revealed that the ZCash Hash Rate is on a rapid ascent, meaning that miners are devoting more computational resources to the privacy-focused network. As seen with the premier cryptocurrency, a rising Hash Rate often coincides with extended price rallies. Ultimately, the increasing Puell Multiple and rising Hash Rate signals strong network fundamentals for ZCash, which suggests that the price growth seen so far is not solely market speculation. What’s Next For ZEC Price? As of this writing, the price of ZCash stands at around $714, reflecting an over 30% jump in the past 24 hours. Price action data shows that the ZEC coin is having the second-strongest annual performance in its history, having soared roughly 1,500% in the past year. In an earlier post on X, Wedson projected an extreme upside of around $1,650 for the price of ZCash. While the current ZEC price already suggests elevated risk for investors, reaching as high as $1,650 would represent full-on market euphoria.

During the conference, Iran’s first international forum of this kind, members of the local crypto community suggested the Islamic Republic should even move beyond the basic recognition of decentralized digital assets and become a regional Bitcoin hub. Tehran sets crypto regulation as a priority at the international blockchain event The deBlock 2025 forum, Iran’s first international conference devoted to blockchain and cryptocurrencies, was held this week in the capital city. It brought together an array of participants, including people active in the crypto space, executives of exchanges, entrepreneurs, economists, regulators, and diplomats. Addressing attendees, government officials recognized the role crypto assets are going to play in the economy of the future, both in Iran and globally. In a message read by a representative, the Speaker of the Iranian parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, emphasized the need for a strategic approach to regulation in the crypto domain. Quoted by the English-language Tehran Times and the Mehr news agency, he described the development of a national roadmap for crypto assets as an “undeniable imperative.” The head of the Majlis referred to a target set in Iran’s latest National Development Plan to bring the share of the digital economy to 10%, noting the goal could not be achieved without embracing crypto. Ghalibaf urged the ministries of economy and industry, the central bank, and other government institutions to coordinate efforts to ensure regulated growth in the sector. Iran announces ambitions to become a regional crypto hub By implementing global crypto standards, “the Islamic Republic can become a successful model in the region and the world, and be recognized as a regional hub for crypto assets,” the high-ranking lawmaker elaborated. He also suggested avoiding a narrow view of the matter: “The perspective on crypto assets should not be limited solely to mining or buying and selling. To fully utilize the capacities of this industry, we need the comprehensive development of a crypto-based financial ecosystem.” This, he added, includes providing the legislative basis for operating secure and regulated trading platforms, using cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, and tokenizing real-world assets such as securities and commodities. Mohammad Ghalibaf was also quoted as stating: “Crypto-assets and blockchain technology are not merely an opportunity, but a necessity for the future of Iran’s and the world’s economy.” Shamseddin Hosseini, chairman of the parliamentary economic committee, also highlighted the shift in political attitudes in Tehran regarding decentralized digital money. “The first official encounter with virtual currencies occurred at the Anti-Money Laundering Headquarters, and they were banned. However, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace later countered this approach,” he reminded. In his speech, Hosseini took his turn to point to the government’s plan to significantly increase the size of the digital sector in the nation’s economy and agreed with Ghalibaf: “The digital economy’s share must reach 10% of the country’s total economy, and achieving this goal is impossible without crypto assets.” Local media put an emphasis on the signing of a memorandum of understanding between deBlock and Trescon Global, the Dubai-based organizer of tech events such as the World Blockchain Summit, which will allow the Iranian conference to be hosted in Dubai. Reza Soltani, deBlock’s executive director, commented: “Iran has the potential to become the regional hub for decentralized technologies. The collaboration with Trescon can attract foreign investment, enhance international credibility, and expand technological partnerships with BRICS countries.” Cryptocurrencies seen as tool to strengthen Iran’s financial independence Delegates from more than 15 countries attended the current edition of the forum in Tehran’s IRIB International Conference Center, on Nov. 6-7, including representatives of the BRICS group of emerging economies, of which Iran is a member, and of Central Asia . In his address earlier, the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament stressed that cooperation in formats like BRICS has created strategic opportunities for participating nations, including for financial diversification. “The use of shared cryptocurrencies within the framework of bilateral or multilateral monetary agreements, particularly in BRICS-Plus interactions, can help strengthen economic independence and facilitate international transactions,” Mohammad Ghalibaf explained.

According to court filings, the sentence aims to close a chapter that began with an indictment unsealed in April 2024. Pleas And Sentencing Dates According to court documents, Rodriguez pleaded guilty in mid-2025 to running an unlicensed money transmitting business. The plea did not encompass all counts within the original indictment but did result in the scheduling of a sentencing hearing. On November 6, 2025, a judge imposed the longest prison term of five years sought by prosecutors for that count. His co-founder, William Lonergan Hill, faces related proceedings after being arrested overseas; extradition efforts are underway. Defense: He lived in a $250,000 home in Harmony, PA unlike SBF. He’s an engineer. He’s a warm family man.Keonne Rodriguez: I agree with what my counsel said. My letter, I wanted it to be personal. I’ve been silent for 18 months. I wanted to bring my story to you — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) November 6, 2025 Samourai Wallet: Allegations And Figures According to the Department of Justice, Samourai Wallet and associated services processed approximately $2 billion in transactions that the government says included funds tied to illegal activity. Prosecutors say that more than $100 million of criminal proceeds were laundered through features allowing users to mix or route coins via extra hops. The tools at the center of the case — known as Whirlpool and Ricochet — were repeatedly mentioned in filings as methods that made tracing funds difficult. The government also said the founders marketed these features in ways they said appealed to bad actors. Records show the charge of unlicensed money-transmitting business carries up to five years in prison. The federal probation office had suggested a term below that, recommending about 42 months, but prosecutors asked the court to impose the full five-year sentence. Those figures were based on court documents and public statements by the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York. Charges Narrowed, Questions Remain Reports have identified that the defendants did not plead guilty to each of the counts in the original complaint, with the plea agreement leaving some counts unresolved. That has left defense lawyers and outside experts focusing on what the case means for software developers and privacy tools that operate in the cryptocurrency space. Legal filings reflect a complex combination of criminal allegations and regulatory questions, and in various hearings, both parties used technical and legal arguments. Legal And Community Reactions The sentence has drawn sharp takes from different corners. Privacy advocates warn that criminal penalties aimed at developers could chill open-source work and set new limits on tools used by ordinary people to protect their financial privacy.

Filecoin’s (FIL) price surge signals renewed accumulation after extended selling pressure, while the Bonk (BONK) price recovery underscores the strength of Solana’s community-driven ecosystem. These movements reflect growing confidence across both infrastructure and meme segments of the market. Amid this shift, BlockDAG is redefining presale credibility through its $435 million Value Era, focused on delivery, liquidity, and sustainability. Currently priced at $0.005 in Batch 32, the project has only 4.3 billion coins left to be sold and attracted 312,000+ holders, 20,000+ miners, and 3.5 million+ X1 users. Supported by an $86 million institutional allocation and a 40/60 vesting model, BlockDAG’s disciplined structure places it among the top crypto projects positioned for 2025’s expansion phase. Filecoin Strengthens as Network Utility Drives a 4% Surge Filecoin’s (FIL) price surge of 4 percent, reported by CoinDesk, reflects resilient demand for decentralized data storage solutions. After a brief market pullback, Filecoin rebounded as on-chain data showed rising network activity and steady storage adoption from enterprise users. The project’s long-standing focus on providing scalable, secure storage continues to differentiate it from other infrastructure-based cryptos.Analysts note that Filecoin has found technical support around recent lows, indicating strong buying interest from long-term holders. If network expansion continues at its current pace, FIL could attempt to break above key resistance zones in the coming weeks. Its rebound highlights the market’s preference for projects anchored in practical utility rather than speculation, a theme that echoes across 2025’s list of top crypto projects. Bonk Recovers 4.6% as Community Momentum Returns The latest Bonk (BONK) price updates show a 4.6 percent gain after periods of volatility, marking a solid recovery within the Solana ecosystem. According to CoinDesk, increased liquidity and ongoing community initiatives are helping Bonk regain visibility among retail investors. The token’s popularity is driven by its integration with Solana-based NFT projects and its active presence in social trading communities.This rebound reflects the importance of user engagement in maintaining momentum for emerging tokens. Bonk’s community-driven approach demonstrates that grassroots participation remains a powerful force within crypto. With rising activity and renewed confidence, Bonk is regaining traction as one of the market’s more resilient meme-based assets heading into the new year. BlockDAG Secures $86 Million Institutional Backing to Drive Scarcity The Value Era marks BlockDAG’s transition from its Power Era to a structured, transparent phase built around verified delivery and accountability. CEO Anthony Turner confirmed that all bonuses and promotional codes have been permanently removed to establish a fair distribution model. Under the new framework, coins follow a vesting schedule with 40 percent released upfront and 60 percent distributed evenly over three months. This approach protects liquidity and ensures market stability. Institutional confidence continues to anchor the project, led by an $86 million deal that reinforces long-term backing and scarcity. The presale, now in Batch 32 at $0.005, has raised $435 million, with 4.3 billion BDAG coins remaining. A total supply cap of 50 billion tokens further strengthens its scarcity-driven design. Dashboard V4 enhances transparency by offering real-time presale analytics, leaderboards, and wallet tracking. This upgrade gives participants live access to ecosystem performance, mirroring an exchange-like environment. Meanwhile, the Referral Program continues to expand the community through 25 percent rewards for referrers and 5 percent bonuses for invitees, encouraging organic network growth. With over 20,000 miners deployed and 3.5 million+ X1 users worldwide, BlockDAG’s Value Era positions the project among 2025’s top crypto leaders. It’s an ecosystem built on transparency, structure, and measurable progress. Key Takeaway! Filecoin’s (FIL) price surge and Bonk (BONK) price updates both signal renewed market stability, but neither matches the scale of progress seen in BlockDAG’s Value Era. With a price of $0.005, Batch 32 active, and $435 million raised, BlockDAG stands as a blueprint for how presales evolve into fully operational ecosystems. Through Dashboard V4 and its Referral Program, the project has merged technology, transparency, and community growth into a single cohesive framework. For traders searching the top crypto projects with verified utility and long-term viability, BlockDAG continues to set the benchmark for how a presale becomes a lasting network success.

According to Barron, major banks are developing their own stablecoins, creating isolated financial ecosystems that lack a shared infrastructure, a problem XRP was specifically designed to solve. Banks Launching Independent Stablecoin Projects In a recent post on X, Barron revealed that leading U.S. banks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are collaborating on a project to launch a U.S. Consortium stablecoin. The goal is to create a bank-backed digital currency that operates under regulated conditions. He added that this trend is not limited to the United States. Several major European institutions, including Deutsche Bank, ING, and UniCredit, are reportedly working on a euro-denominated stablecoin expected to go live by 2026. These initiatives show how rapidly traditional finance is moving toward tokenized systems. $XRP Plot twist: Is this what @bradgarlinghouse was working for all along? Every major bank is racing to launch its OWN stablecoin While SWIFT pitches ""neutral rails,"" the reality: JPM, BofA, Citi, Wells: U.S. consortium stablecoin ING, Deutsche, UniCredit + 6 others: Euro… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) November 1, 2025 Barron also cited a statement from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who confirmed that the bank intends to issue a stablecoin once the necessary regulatory frameworks are finalized. This comment reflects a broader industry trend, as banks compete to maintain control over their liquidity and digital payment systems rather than rely on neutral, shared networks. The Challenge of Financial Fragmentation Barron argued that while the move toward stablecoins represents progress in modernizing payments, it also creates a new challenge, fragmentation. Each institution is building its own closed ecosystem, resulting in what Barron described as “walled gardens”, isolated systems that cannot easily communicate or transfer value between one another. He questioned how these independent stablecoin networks would achieve interoperability, warning that such fragmentation could undermine the efficiency that digital assets are meant to provide. Without a universal bridge, cross-border transactions could become more complex rather than simpler. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Role in Addressing the Problem According to Barron, this is precisely where XRP fits into the global financial landscape. The cryptocurrency was created to act as a neutral bridge asset that facilitates seamless value transfer between otherwise incompatible financial systems. Because XRP is not issued or controlled by any government or corporation, it can serve as an intermediary that allows funds to move efficiently between different currencies and platforms. Its design enables fast, low-cost settlements and removes the need for banks to pre-fund accounts in foreign countries, freeing up liquidity for other uses. Barron further suggested that Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, who joined the company in 2015, likely foresaw the current race among banks to build their own digital currencies. Instead of competing directly with these projects, Garlinghouse and Ripple positioned XRP to complement them, functioning as a universal connector between closed financial systems. Barron concluded that as financial institutions continue to create private stablecoins, demand for a neutral, interoperable asset like XRP is expected to grow. He emphasized that XRP’s purpose is not to replace national currencies or stablecoins, but to bridge them, ensuring that the global financial ecosystem remains connected despite increasing decentralization and competition among banks.

Litecoin And LTCBTC Close Bullish, Setting Stage For Further Upside Presenting his technical outlook, CryptoWzrd highlighted a strong bullish performance from Litcoin, noting that both the LTC/USD and LTC/BTC pairs closed with impressive upward momentum. He explained that most of Litecoin’s strength came from a sharp spike in LTC/BTC. The synchronized move between the two pairs reflects renewed buying interest and suggests that bullish sentiment is building in the short term. Related Reading: Litecoin 2M Bollinger Band Width Hits New Lows, CMT-Certified Analyst Reveals What It Means According to CryptoWzrd, the next key step for LTC/BTC is to break out of its range high, a technical milestone that could unlock further upside for Litecoin. A successful breakout from this structure may serve as the trigger for a rally toward the $112 resistance level, or even higher if momentum accelerates. The analyst also underlined the importance of holding above the $96 support zone, making it a key level that sustains Litecoin’s bullish structure. Maintaining price stability above this mark would reinforce the positive outlook and prevent a return to bearish conditions. Losing this level, however, could signal weakness and limit the potential for a continued advance in the near term. Looking ahead, CryptoWzrd expects heightened volatility to persist. Thus, he revealed that his focus will shift to lower time frame chart formations in the upcoming sessions, where he plans to identify and execute quick scalp setups as price action develops. This approach reflects his tactical trading style, aiming to capitalize on short-term movements while keeping a close eye on broader breakout signals. Volatility Reigns As Litecoin Holds Bullish Tone On Intraday Charts In conclusion, CryptoWzrd noted that Litecoin’s intraday chart displayed strong bullish behavior accompanied by heightened volatility throughout the session. The rapid price swings reflected increased trader activity and growing market momentum, suggesting that LTC could be setting up for another significant short-term move. Related Reading: LTC Price Soars 11% to $129: Analysts Eye $135 Breakout as ETF Approval Buzz Grows He explained that while a brief pullback below the $101.50 support level is possible, such a dip may simply serve as a temporary correction within the broader bullish structure. A renewed breakout above this level would likely present fresh long opportunities, signaling a continuation of Litecoin’s upward momentum. CryptoWzrd also emphasized that Bitcoin’s price action will play a critical role in shaping Litecoin’s next direction. Since LTC often reacts to BTC’s broader market moves, strength or weakness in Bitcoin could directly influence whether Litecoin extends its rally or consolidates further.

The analyst further revealed how this could play out for BTC if it were to happen eventually. What Will Happen If The Bitcoin Price Mirrors Gold In an X post, Colin indicated that the Bitcoin price will record another uptrend as soon as next week if it were to follow gold’s move. He opined that it is unlikely the flagship crypto will not witness another significant move to the upside, given that gold and stocks saw meteoric rises to new all-time highs (ATHs) in recent months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Peak Indicators Says Hold Despite Crash Below $100,000, What’s Happening? Coilin further remarked that money will still flow toward crypto, with a delay, as he highlighted in the gold vs BTC chart. He added that the gold top would forecast a top for the Bitcoin price in January 2026 when shifted forward by 80 days. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could still rally to $175,000 if its bull market extends into January next year. Colin admitted that this could be wrong for the Bitcoin price, but noted that many other metrics were pointing toward more upward price action for BTC. Meanwhile, he also highlighted the fact that sentiment was getting bearish in the crypto market. The market is currently on a downtrend, with the BTC dropping below $100,000 on several occasions this week. This has raised concerns that the Bitcoin price may already be in a bear market. However, Colin has indicated that BTC could still rally to new all-time highs before this cycle ends. His prediction aligns with that of the likes of Standard Chartered, which has predicted that BTC could reach between $150,000 and $20,000 by year-end. Why The BTC Top May Not Be In In another X post, Colin also explained why the top might not be in for the Bitcoin price in this bull run. He noted that the intersection of the 1150-day SMA with previous bull run peak times the top of the next peak. This happened in both the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, which marked the top for BTC at the time. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price October Top Is Back With A New Prediction Now, the analyst said that this moving average hasn’t quite lined up with the $65,000 top from the previous cycle, indicating that BTC still has more room to rally to the upside in this market cycle. Colin added that this 1150-day SMA, if projected out, will indicate a top for the Bitcoin price around late December this year or January next year. He reiterated that all metrics collectively point to a top around late December or January next year. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $102,400, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, known for her bold projections for Bitcoin , said during an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box that she has revised her bullish Bitcoin price target downward by $300,000, citing the rapid rise of stablecoins as the main reason for the adjustment. Stablecoins Taking Over Part Of Bitcoin’s Role Wood explained that stablecoins are fulfilling a function she and her team initially believed Bitcoin would dominate, i.e., serving as a financial tool for emerging economies. She noted that stablecoins have become the preferred digital assets in many markets. According to her, this trend has expanded far more quickly than anyone expected, leading ARK Invest to trim its long-term bullish projection for Bitcoin by $300,000. This brings down the Bitcoin projection from $1.5 million by 2030 to about $1.2 million. Wood said the firm’s models now recognize that stablecoins are scaling faster than anticipated. In her words, “stablecoins are scaling here much faster than anyone,” and their growth is effectively taking a slice of the market Bitcoin was once expected to capture. Gold, Institutions, And The Bigger Picture When asked if gold is factored into her forecast, Wood explained that the $300,000 reduction assumes all other things being equal, and gold continues to grow the way it is. However, since gold has also doubled in value since ARK Invest’s initial Bitcoin forecast, the comparison has become more nuanced. She reiterated that Bitcoin’s investment case remains intact because it is both digital gold and a technological innovation forming the foundation of a global monetary system. Wood noted that Bitcoin is the “lead in a new asset class” while distinguishing stablecoins as digital cash equivalents. The relationship between gold, stablecoins, and Bitcoin represents what she described as a dynamic interplay of “puts and takes.” Despite trimming her price forecast, Wood stressed that ARK is fundamentally bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Even as ARK Invest moderates expectations, Wood highlighted that institutional interest in Bitcoin and blockchain-based payment systems is still at an early stage. She noted that large financial players are only beginning to test the waters, with early experiments in new payment rails and digital asset integration just beginning to take shape. For Wood, this early stage of institutional involvement is the first of a long runway for Bitcoin’s growth. Despite the current short-term market weakness and competition from stablecoins, she also maintained her belief in Bitcoin’s technological role as the lead in a new asset class. “We have just started,” she said, adding that there is still “a long way to go.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,413, up by 1% in the past 24 hours but down by 7% and 16% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively.

While the token’s market capitalization currently sits well below major global corporations, many in the crypto community speculate that it could one day rival or surpass companies like Visa, whose market value is around $600–700 billion. This analysis examines what XRP’s price would look like if it were to reach Visa’s valuation and the factors that could make such a scenario feasible. Estimating XRP’s Value at Visa’s Market Cap Visa currently holds a market capitalization of about $667 billion, while XRP’s market cap is around $136.44 billion with a circulating supply of approximately 59.91 billion tokens. Based on these figures, XRP would need to experience an increase of roughly 376% in market value to match Visa’s position. If XRP’s total market capitalization were to reach $700 billion, the corresponding token price would stand at approximately $11.68. This would push XRP into the double-digit price range for the first time in its history, a milestone that has become a key talking point among analysts and investors. Currently, XRP trades near $2.26 , making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and USDT. Surpassing Visa’s valuation would not only elevate XRP’s position in global rankings but would also represent a major shift in how digital assets compare to traditional financial entities. Can XRP Overtake Visa? The possibility of XRP reaching or exceeding Visa’s valuation depends on several interrelated factors, including regulatory developments, ETF approvals , and broader institutional adoption. In mid-2025, XRP briefly achieved a market cap of over $210 billion, surpassing major companies like Uber and Shell during that rally. Although the asset has since corrected, many analysts predict a potential recovery in late 2025, which could see XRP retest its all-time highs and possibly cross into double-digit price territory. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market observers argue that a combination of regulatory clarity in the United States, Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with global financial institutions, and increased investor participation could accelerate XRP’s growth trajectory. Analysts’ Forecasts and Key Growth Catalysts Crypto analyst Zach Rector has suggested that XRP’s next significant move may begin once ETFs linked to the asset receive approval. He believes that institutional participation through regulated investment vehicles could trigger a sustained demand surge. Meanwhile, long-term investor Pumpius identified several potential catalysts that could significantly boost XRP’s valuation. These include the approval of spot XRP ETFs , Ripple’s victory in its legal battle with the SEC, and the continued expansion of Ripple’s partnerships with international financial institutions. He also pointed to growing institutional demand, technical indicators suggesting a tightening market with reduced selling pressure, and Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road, a move expected to enable greater institutional capital inflows into XRP. Pumpius considers a $10–$20 range achievable in the near term, with $50 possible if market conditions align perfectly. However, other analysts remain cautious, arguing that a $50 valuation within months would require an unprecedented level of capital inflow and global adoption. The broader consensus in the XRP community is that the asset is positioned for a strong performance if upcoming catalysts align. Achieving Visa’s market cap would translate to an XRP price of around $11–$12, signaling a multi-fold increase from current levels. While such projections remain speculative, the underlying assumption is clear: sustained institutional adoption, ETF integration, and ongoing partnerships could propel XRP toward parity with traditional financial powerhouses.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.02. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $3.04 and $3.29, with an average value of $3.16. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.423 Market Cap $800.63M Trading Volume $123.75M Circulating Supply 1.89B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.4355 24-hour Low $0.4126 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 16.57% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.5513 14-Day RSI 46.23 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.7164 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP shows mild recovery momentum, trading at $0.423 after defending the $0.35 support level. Bullish signs appear on both the daily MACD crossover and the 4-hour Alligator alignment. Optimism 1-day price chart On the 1-day price chart for November 8, OP shows a mild rebound from the $0.35 support zone, currently trading near $0.4234 after gaining traction above the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.4170. The upper Bollinger Band at $0.4838 marks the immediate resistance, while the lower band at $0.3502 secures the nearest strong support. The MACD line has turned positive, suggesting a short-term momentum shift toward bullish sentiment. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI remains subdued at 45.59 but is recovering from the oversold region of 35.82, indicating early accumulation. If price holds above $0.4170 on a daily close, a move toward $0.45–$0.48 could follow, but rejection at $0.43 may trigger another retest of $0.38. For accumulation, a good buy-in zone lies between $0.40–$0.41, with potential take-profit levels at $0.45 and $0.48. A daily close below $0.40 would invalidate near-term bullishness and expose downside risk toward $0.37. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP sustains upward movement around $0.4231, supported by the Alligator lines aligning in bullish formation. The Balance of Power indicator at 0.52 leans in favor of buyers, reflecting moderate demand strength, while the Price Volume Trend (PVT) at 70.72M confirms steady inflows. Minor retracements are visible, but the price holding above $0.4140 suggests buyers are maintaining control. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A breakout above $0.43 could initiate a short-term rally toward $0.44–$0.45, while a dip below the green Alligator line at $0.4140 might weaken the structure and invite correction toward $0.40. Intraday traders can consider entering near $0.414–$0.416 with profit targets at $0.44–$0.45 and a tight stop-loss around $0.40. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4905 SELL SMA 5 $0.4378 SELL SMA 10 $0.4365 SELL SMA 21 $0.4406 SELL SMA 50 $0.5513 SELL SMA 100 $0.6454 SELL SMA 200 $0.7164 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4611 SELL EMA 5 $0.5180 SELL EMA 10 $0.5940 SELL EMA 21 $0.6545 SELL EMA 50 $0.6836 SELL EMA 100 $0.7049 SELL EMA 200 $0.8445 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Optimism (OP) is showing early bullish signs but remains in a fragile recovery phase. Sustaining above $0.417 will confirm momentum toward $0.45–$0.48 in the coming sessions, but failure to defend $0.40 could quickly revert the trend back to a consolidation zone near $0.37. Bulls are cautiously gaining ground. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being viewed as the best crypto to invest in for investors who are positioning early before the next market cycle. Many analysts also highlight that MUTM is emerging as the next crypto to hit $1 based on its current growth pace. And although Cardano is a legitimate project in terms of its long-term credibility, its gains at this stage will remain relatively restricted because of its large market cap and slow growth cycle, exactly why investors are shifting their funds to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now, the low market cap DeFi crypto that’s been earlier in its growth cycle and has immense returns if market trends continue, as it’s been seen that Mutuum Finance has already broken through over $18.5 million in its presale stage, with over 17,800 new investors acquiring its tokens. Mutuum Finance could be the one to soon breach through the $1 market barrier in 2025, positioning itself as the next crypto to hit $1. Cardano Holding the Line Cardano (ADA) is actually currently stabilizing around the current price of $0.5348 after a rather severe pullback, with technicals indicating that this current area is forming a solid accumulation region. In terms of market structure, it appears that Cardano is forming a definite bear trap pattern that could see it rebound from a projected pullback and proceed to a possible breakout rally that will restart its positive trends in 2026. In fact, ADA is likely to make its way back to the region of $1.00+ if market fundamentals continue to support its current price at this one specific region. Nonetheless, those investors who feel that it is a bit too slow are actually looking at one of the top DeFi projects at present, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is increasingly being recognized as the best crypto to invest in going into the next cycle. Mutuum Finance Presale Continues Rapid Climb Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also holding its place as one of the fastest-uprising decentralized finance initiatives as it enters 2025. Already, it has attracted more than 17,800 unique token holders and raised more than $18.5 million in its presale event. Having successfully sold out all five of its previous presale phases, it is currently well over 85% completed in Phase 6, in which tokens sell for a price of $0.035, up 250% from its previous price of $0.01 in Phase 1. In line with the project’s entering Phase 7, it is likely that its token value will appreciate by a further 20%, getting close to its projected exchange listing price of $0.06. Early Adopters could anticipate gains of as much as sixfold their investment price, solidifying Mutuum Finance’s status in the crypto market as one of the top investment opportunities and a leading DeFi project to keep an eye out for in 2025. Because of this momentum, more analysts are confidently calling MUTM the next crypto to hit $1 during the upcoming market cycle. A Growing and Engaged Global Community Mutuum Finance has broken the barrier of 17,800+ active members in its community, signifying immense support for its mission of revolutionizing DeFi and increasing awareness of DeFi accessibility. In a bid to encourage engagement and participation in the platform, a Top 50 Leaderboard has also been introduced that is aimed at encouraging loyal contributors in the community. Major Technical Milestones Looming in Sepolia Testnet Development of the platform is going smoothly as planned. It was further noted that the first version of the project’s lending and borrowing protocol has been moving as planned, and Sepolia testnet launch is set to take place in this current quarter. This testnet version will incorporate all basic DeFi functionality that identifies a utility-driven DeFi ecosystem, such as lending, borrowing, and yield creation. This testnet is an important milestone in realizing a fully-functional and self-sustainable decentralized finance system that will take Mutuum Finance one step closer to achieving its vision. This progress continues reinforcing Mutuum Finance as the best crypto to invest in and strategic analysts forecast that this momentum aligns with its path as the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance has raised over $18.5M with 17,800+ investors, and its presale is 85% sold out at a price of 0.035. Cardano’s market is steady, but its improvement is slower because of its large market cap. Act now to get MUTM at Phase 6 rates before a price increment.

54183772,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=851157,1762650016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54183772.jpeg,"Bitcoin Bounces From $100,000 — Bullish Reversal Or Another Trap?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bounces-from-100000/,"Bitcoin (BTC) recently bounced from the $100,000 level, sparking hopes of a bullish reversal. However, traders remain cautious, as this rebound could also be a temporary bull trap. With key resistance looming around $105,000–$106,000, the market’s next move will be critical in determining whether BTC can sustain an upward trend or resume its downtrend. A Possible Bullish Reversal After Reclaiming $102,000 According to Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin is showing early signs of a potential bullish reversal. In the post on X, Snyder highlighted that BTC bounced from the recent lows and reclaimed the $102,000 level, signaling renewed buying interest. This recovery comes after a period of weakness, suggesting that the market may be attempting to stabilize before the next major move. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Crash Is Important If Wave 5 Corrects To $94,000 Snyder emphasized the importance of maintaining this momentum and establishing a higher low around $101,400, which would push the bullish scenario into a more sustained rally. Conversely, a failure to maintain support here could indicate lingering bearish pressure, so this level is critical for gauging market sentiment. In the meantime, the expert is closely monitoring lower time frame charts for potential scalp-long opportunities if a reversal occurs near $101,400. This tactical approach allows active traders to capitalize on short-term swings while waiting for confirmation of a broader bullish trend. Key resistance remains at $104,700, which will be a decisive level for determining the next leg of the move. A successful breakout above this resistance could open the path toward $107,500, signaling that bulls are regaining control. However, given that it’s the weekend, Snyder cautioned that traders should be prepared for sudden swings or false breakouts as liquidity tends to be lower during this period. Bitcoin Reclaims Momentum, But $105,000–$106,000 Holds The Key In his latest update, market expert and investor Ted Pillows noted that Bitcoin briefly dropped below the $100,000 mark before bouncing back. The short-lived dip highlights ongoing uncertainty and the tug-of-war between buyers and sellers at key psychological levels. Related Reading: CryptoQuant Head Reveals Reason Behind Bearish Bitcoin Trend However, Ted cautioned that this rebound feels like a potential bull trap. While the price recovered quickly, the underlying momentum may still favor the bears, suggesting that traders should remain vigilant before assuming a sustained upward trend. He emphasized that until Bitcoin can reclaim the $105,000–$106,000 zone, the probability of further downside remains higher. Without a confirmed break above this critical resistance area, the market could continue to support levels as low as $93,394, keeping the short-term outlook skewed toward a possible downtrend.

Bitcoin is trading at a discount on Coinbase, a leading US-based crypto exchange, compared to its prices on global platforms. The exchange’s spot pricing has slipped into a discount relative to major offshore platforms. Market Sentiment Softens Ahead Of Key Economic Data A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has highlighted on X that it’s not unusual for Bitcoin to trade at a discount on Coinbase, and this happens quite often during a larger market pullback. However, the current discount is not as substantial as it was in the previous cycle. The discount is fundamentally created when the market is oversupplied with spot selling pressure originating from the Coinbase platform, particularly from the ETFs, US investors, and institutional investors. Generally, this discount on Coinbase is not the strongest sign, but it points to downward momentum. As seen on the chart, the market rarely bottoms locally without first undergoing such a period of heavy selling, which generates the discount. Daan noted that this data is similar to tracking ETF flows, and the fact that BTC’s price on Coinbase is negative is not a bullish indicator. However, if the BTC price can sustain or start grinding higher after absorbing this period of heavy selling pressure, which is indicated by the discount, that could be a bullish sign for BTC. “Always compare the data to know how the price is moving,” the expert mentioned. Why This Cycle Might Last Longer Than Expected Crypto analyst Batman has highlighted a fascinating perspective from giants like Wintermute, which suggests that the concept of the Bitcoin four-year cycle is no longer relevant. However, Wintermute is now calling for a BTC supercycle. Offering his insights on the statement, Batman is supporting the idea using the BTC chart against the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) composite. According to the expert, risky assets like BTC historically flourish in a growing economy. When the economy shows signs of slowing down, as reflected by the ISM and PMI contracting, it usually coincides with the cycle top for BTC and ushers in a period of price slowdown. Despite BTC not maintaining an all-time high level, the ISM and PMI are literally just beginning to expand, making this cycle different. A prolonged debt cycle due to the global Covid-19 shutdown may also cause the delay of the BTC cycle, as shown by the ISM and PMI starting to turn around toward an upward direction.",Bitcoin News|Batman|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|coinbase|Covid|Daan Crypto Trades|ETFs|Institute for Supply Management|ISM|PMI|Purchasing Managers’ Index,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-09 01:30:58

Over $300 million worth of XRP has recently been moved from crypto exchanges, signaling a shift in investor sentiment. While such withdrawals often suggest accumulation, current on-chain data present a mixed picture, indicating both opportunity and caution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Breaking Point As It Tests Its Most Crucial Support Line—Analyst Over $300 Million XRP Exit Crypto Exchanges According to on-chain data from Glassnode, investors have withdrawn more than 140 million XRP, valued at approximately $309 million, from crypto exchanges. At the same time, XRP’s Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (LTH NUPL) chart has revealed a more complex backdrop. The recent exchange withdrawals indicate a potential accumulation trend, suggesting that investors have begun buying XRP and are likely moving it into their respective wallets. Given the earlier wave of selling by long and short-term holders, this renewed accumulation could serve as a brief respite from the downward pressure. Notably, the LTH NUPL indicator has declined and is now approaching critical levels around 0.5. This area has been identified as a historical threshold where market optimism tends to give way to weakness. In previous cycles, a drop below the 0.5 level has often led to XRP price corrections, as long-term holders began selling and securing profits. This cycle appears no different. The LTH NUPL decline indicates that many long-term investors may be entering a distribution phase. Despite the bullishness of large-scale withdrawals, the underlying market sentiment remains cautious. A major reason for this could be the widespread liquidation events that occurred in the crypto market over the past few weeks. Earlier, on October 10, the XRP price flash crashed below $1 but retraced back above $2 within 24 hours after $19 billion was wiped out from the market. On November 3, the crypto market experienced another bleed, with about $1.4 billion liquidated in a single day. As the market recovers slowly, so does XRP. Its price is currently up 4.78% after falling more than 16% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP Price Eyes $8 Target If Key Support Holds In a separate analysis, pseudonymous crypto analyst ‘Cantonese Cat’ has shared a bullish outlook using Fibonacci Extensions to project XRP’s next move and long-term trajectory. On the monthly chart, XRP is testing the 0.886 Fib level near $2.25—a critical support area that has previously served as a foundation for major upward moves. Cantonese Cat argues that as long as this level remains intact, XRP’s next impulse could target the 1.272 Fibonacci Extension around $8.29, representing a 260% increase from current levels above $2.3. Related Reading: ‘Sell Your House, Clothes And Buy XRP’ — Solana Exec’s Wild Advice Goes Viral The chart also shows earlier resistance near $3.31, aligning with the 1.0 Fib level. If XRP successfully reclaims this zone, it could confirm its bullish structure. The subsequent extensions, highlighted by the analyst at $13.38 (1.414 Fib) and $26.63 (1.618 Fib), represent potential long-term target zones if momentum continues.

BlockDAG (BDAG) , with its record-breaking $435+ million presale and Value Era phase, continues to outperform expectations, now priced at $0.005 in Batch 32 with only 10 batches remaining. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) price prediction models have softened during technical uncertainty, and Dogecoin (DOGE) price drop concerns weigh on meme-coin sentiment. Together, these dynamics illustrate a broader shift in buyer psychology, away from high-risk volatility and toward projects demonstrating verified growth, EVM integration, and real testnet functionality. For those seeking the best crypto to buy today, BlockDAG’s consistent milestones make it stand apart as a long-term project. Ethereum Price Prediction Softens Despite Stablecoin Dominance The Ethereum (ETH) price prediction for late 2025 has shifted to a more cautious outlook. Trading near $3,850, ETH continues to show resilience as the foundation of the stablecoin economy but struggles to regain strong market dominance. Analysts now believe Ethereum’s long-awaited $10,000 target may not arrive until 2030, citing slower-than-expected adoption growth and reduced on-chain activity. Despite this, Ethereum retains a key edge, hosting over 53% of the $307B stablecoin market, including USDT and USDC. Institutional adoption grows as JPMorgan accepts crypto collateral, Ripple invests $1B in stablecoin treasuries, and BlackRock manages $2.5B in tokenized funds. Technical indicators show ETH dominance stabilizing near 12–13%, a support zone that has repeatedly triggered rebounds since April. Analysts note that if this level holds, Ethereum could reclaim strength and head toward $8,000–$10,000 by early 2026, contingent on policy clarity and sustained demand. While Ethereum remains central to Web3 finance, its near-term track appears cautious, prompting traders to explore newer ecosystems, with many eyeing BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy today for early growth potential. Dogecoin Price Drop Tests Meme Market Confidence The Dogecoin (DOGE) price drop of 2025 has left even seasoned investors questioning its next move. The world’s original meme coin, now valued around $31 billion in market cap, has fallen 36% year-to-date, reflecting waning risk appetite in speculative assets. Two primary drivers explain this decline. First, Dogecoin’s limited network utility makes it vulnerable to sharp sentiment swings. As a community-driven token with minimal transactional use, DOGE’s value tends to move in sync with broader meme coin trends. Second, a market-wide shift to risk-off conditions has hurt speculative tokens, with Shiba Inu and Pepe both down roughly 50%. Still, Dogecoin’s loyal community and growing interest from the Dogecoin Foundation, which continues to explore new use cases, suggest potential for revival if broader market confidence returns. Analysts caution, however, that DOGE remains a high-risk, high-volatility asset, suited only for aggressive investors. With Bitcoin’s next halving approaching and altcoin volatility rising, traders are rebalancing portfolios toward tangible progress, leaving Dogecoin as more of a nostalgic hold than the best crypto to buy today. BlockDAG’s $0.005 Value Era Defines Measurable Progress The BlockDAG (BDAG) presale remains one of 2025’s most successful blockchain fundraising events. Now in Batch 32, the coin trades at $0.005, with the project having raised over $435 million in presale, only 4.3B coins remain to be claimed. Over 312,000 holders and 3.5 million X1 mobile miners form the backbone of its rapidly expanding ecosystem, while 20,000 X-series hardware miners are sold worldwide. This momentum underscores the strength of the Value Era, which replaced referral incentives with a transparent vesting schedule, 40% upfront, 60% released over three months, ensuring sustained liquidity and balanced market entry. BlockDAG’s competitive edge lies in its EVM compatibility, allowing developers to easily deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts on its hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG framework. This interoperability merges Ethereum’s vast dApp ecosystem with BlockDAG’s scalable infrastructure, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second. The ongoing Awakening Testnet demonstrates this performance in real time, showcasing functional dApp deployment, contract execution, and block visualization. Developers have already begun experimenting with smart wallets, coin issuance, and network monitoring, all tied to EVM-compatible architecture. Analysts estimate BlockDAG’s post-listing price could reach $0.05, a projection that positions it among the best crypto to buy today.

On the afternoon of Friday, November 7, the premier cryptocurrency briefly fell below the psychological $100,000 level for the second time in the past week. The struggles of the Bitcoin price in recent weeks have been attributed to a shift in the behavior of investors, especially a class known as the long-term holders (LTHs). A prominent crypto expert on X has come forward with more insights as to the impact of the LTH behavior on BTC price. BTC Apparent Demand Growth Turns Negative In his latest post on the X platform, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, acknowledged that the Bitcoin long-term holders have indeed been offloading their assets over the past few weeks. The crypto expert, however, noted that this increased selling activity by LTHs is not something new. According to Moreno, it is quite normal for Bitcoin long-term investors to shave off some of their holdings during the bull markets, as they look to take some profits while prices are high. What has been different this time around is that there has been no corresponding demand to mop up these offloads. To back this, Moreno shared a chart comprising the long-term holder spending and apparent demand growth in the past few years. For context, apparent demand growth measures the difference between how much of an asset (Bitcoin, in this case) is being acquired compared to the quantity being created (mined). The CryptoQuant Head of Research noted that the Bitcoin price had reached new all-time highs in the past during periods of increased long-term holders selling—albeit with positive apparent demand growth. As observed in the chart, this occurred during all-time-high rallies of January-March 2024 and November-December 2024. The highlighted chart also shows that the Bitcoin long-term holders have been selling since October, which is not particularly out of place. However, the apparent demand growth has been contracting, implying that there has been no buy pressure to absorb the LTH supply at higher prices. Ultimately, this on-chain observation suggests that less focus should be placed on the selling activity of the Bitcoin long-term holders. If there is to be a turnaround for the price of BTC over the coming weeks, a positive apparent demand growth would need to be in place first. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency has recovered back above $100,000 and is valued at around $103,700, reflecting an almost 3% jump in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Apparent Demand|Bitcoin Long-Term Holder|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-09 03:00:46

The move strengthens Sei’s network security and reliability while adding Binance’s operational scale and institutional-grade protection. For a blockchain designed for global finance, this partnership is more than symbolic, it’s a statement. The world’s largest crypto exchange is now a Sei Network validator. @Binance — the exchange securing $180B in assets for 200M+ users — now helps secure the fastest L1. Built for global finance. Secured by global enterprises. Markets Move Faster on Sei. ($/acc) pic.twitter.com/r4tOsiT7r3 — Sei (@SeiNetwork) November 6, 2025 Binance Steps Into the Sei Ecosystem The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, now helps secure the Sei blockchain. Binance, which safeguards $180 billion in assets for over 200 million users worldwide, brings unmatched infrastructure and operational expertise to the validator set. As a validator, Binance now participates directly in Sei’s consensus process, the core mechanism that verifies and finalizes transactions on the network. This means Binance is not only supporting Sei’s security but also helping shape its next major upgrade, Sei GIGA, focused on scaling and institutional-grade throughput. Sei’s validator set now includes one of the biggest players in the global crypto ecosystem, a milestone that pushes the network into a new phase of maturity. Sei’s Rapid Rise in Institutional Adoption Built from the ground up for global finance, Sei has been gaining serious traction. The network already supports: 70 million+ wallets 4.5 million daily transactions A peak TVL (Total Value Locked) of $680 million Those numbers show strong and growing adoption. But what truly sets Sei apart is who is building on it. Sei now powers tokenized funds from leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Apollo. These are not speculative DeFi experiments, they’re institutional-grade funds, actively using Sei as their settlement layer for on-chain financial operations. Backed by partnerships with Circle, MetaMask, and Securitize, Sei’s ecosystem is bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-native infrastructure. Binance’s Entry Signals Institutional Confidence When a platform like Binance, managing hundreds of billions in user assets, becomes a validator on Sei, it sends a strong signal of confidence. It’s not just another integration or marketing move. Binance is literally helping run the network. That’s validation, not just in the technical sense, but in the institutional one too. Binance joining the validator set means the exchange is placing trust in Sei’s architecture, scalability, and security standards. For Sei, it’s a confirmation that its institutional-grade design is resonating with the industry’s biggest players. A Blockchain Built for Global Markets Sei isn’t trying to be just another Layer-1, it’s built for settlement at financial scale. The blockchain’s design focuses on low latency, high throughput, and instant finality, making it ideal for trading environments and financial markets that demand speed and reliability. That’s why the network has become a magnet for tokenized assets, RWAs (real-world assets), and institutional fund deployments. Sei’s partnerships reflect this vision: Securitize and KAIO bring regulatory-compliant frameworks for RWAs. Circle ensures stablecoin liquidity and seamless settlement. MetaMask and Etherscan integrate accessibility for users and developers. Together, they make Sei not just a blockchain, but a financial infrastructure layer designed for the next generation of markets. The Institutional Ecosystem Is Already Live What’s happening on Sei isn’t theoretical. It’s live and growing. At least five tokenized funds are already operational on the network. These funds bring real capital and real assets into an on-chain environment. With the support of institutional giants like BlackRock and Brevan Howard, Sei has positioned itself as the preferred settlement layer for on-chain finance. And now, with Binance onboard as a validator, Sei gains not only additional security but also global visibility across Binance’s massive ecosystem. For many, this could be the moment that Sei enters mainstream awareness. Sei GIGA and What Comes Next Binance’s participation also aligns with Sei’s upcoming GIGA upgrade, a key milestone aimed at scaling transaction capacity and expanding validator diversity. As a validator, Binance will contribute directly to the security and performance of the new upgrade. This collaboration marks the beginning of Sei’s next expansion phase, where performance meets institutional reliability. The inclusion of Binance in this stage signals that Sei is ready for the next level of financial-grade infrastructure, global scale, verified security, and seamless performance. Confidence Through Collaboration The crypto market moves fast, and Sei’s motto, “Markets Move Faster on Sei”, is proving true. By combining Binance’s global infrastructure with Sei’s optimized Layer-1 architecture, the network now operates under one of the most secure and scalable validator sets in the industry. This collaboration reinforces Sei’s reputation as the fastest L1, purpose-built for institutions that demand more than speed, they demand trust, compliance, and execution. Global Finance Is Moving On-Chain The convergence between traditional institutions and blockchain ecosystems has been slow, until now. With tokenized funds already live, regulated partners in place, and now Binance securing the network, Sei is emerging as the on-chain foundation for global markets. This is what institutional-grade blockchain adoption looks like: Real funds. Verified validators. Scalable infrastructure. Transparent security. Sei isn’t just fast, it’s financially functional. @Binance becoming a validator on @SeiNetwork is a milestone that speaks volumes. The world’s largest crypto exchange, with 200 million+ users and $180 billion in assets secured, has chosen to help secure the fastest L1 for institutional finance. That’s not something anyone should overlook. It’s a clear signal that Sei’s infrastructure, reliability, and global vision have captured institutional trust. Built for global finance. Secured by global enterprises. Markets move faster on Sei. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

The report confirms Binance holds: 606,356 BTC with a reserve ratio of 102.11% 4.09 million ETH at 100.00% 37.88 million BNB at 112.95% 34.73 billion USDT at 107.45% Each figure demonstrates that the exchange isn’t just meeting its obligations, it’s exceeding them. Our #Binance Proof of Reserves (PoR) mechanism allows anyone to check that our user assets are backed 1:1. Check out this month's PoR here https://t.co/nspWeaiiO1 pic.twitter.com/THe2b08qo6 — Binance (@binance) November 7, 2025 A Transparent Look Inside Binance’s Reserves Binance’s Proof of Reserves is one of the core systems that powers trust between the exchange and its users. It’s a public-facing verification process that lets anyone confirm, independently, that every user deposit on Binance is fully backed 1:1. In simple terms: for every Bitcoin, Ether, or stablecoin you hold on Binance, the company holds an equal (or greater) amount in reserve wallets. This system isn’t new, but it’s one that Binance continues to refine and expand. The November snapshot reaffirms that the exchange’s reserves remain healthy, secure, and publicly verifiable. How Proof of Reserves Works Binance’s Proof of Reserves is built around cryptographic verification and public transparency. Here’s the short version: 1. Merkle Tree Audits, Binance uses a Merkle Tree structure to map and record all user balances. Every individual account balance is a “leaf” on this tree. The Merkle Tree allows all balances to be organized, verified, and included in a single cryptographic proof without exposing private information. 2. Independent Verification, Each Binance user can verify their specific balance in the PoR system. Through their account dashboard, users can access a unique cryptographic record that links directly to the Merkle Tree. This makes it possible to independently confirm that their assets are included in Binance’s global reserves. 3. 1:1 Backing, Binance also makes public the wallet addresses holding its reserves. Each token’s reserve ratio shows how much the exchange holds compared to total user balances. A ratio above 100% means Binance holds more than necessary to cover all customer deposits. 4. Regular Updates, These snapshots are not one-offs. Binance updates its Proof of Reserves every month so users can see changes in real time and track ongoing transparency. Fully Backed, and Then Some Looking closer at the numbers, Binance’s latest data shows a strong surplus across most major assets. | Asset | Held in Reserve | Reserve Ratio | | :——- | :————– | :———— | | BTC | 606,356 | 102.11% | | ETH | 4.09 million | 100.00% | | BNB | 37.88 million | 112.95% | | USDT | 34.73 billion | 107.45% | The most overcollateralized of the group is BNB, with Binance holding nearly 13% more than user deposits. Bitcoin also sits comfortably above 100%, a reassuring sign for traders who rely on the world’s largest exchange for both spot and derivative liquidity. Even stablecoins like USDT, which often see rapid inflows and outflows, show an impressive 107% coverage. It’s a strong signal that Binance is operating with full transparency and financial prudence, maintaining liquidity well beyond the baseline requirement. A Tool for Transparency and Confidence The Proof of Reserves system is more than a technical feature, it’s a trust mechanism. After the industry shakeups of previous years, transparency has become non-negotiable. Users want proof that their funds are safe. Binance’s Merkle Tree verification gives them exactly that. The idea is simple: show, don’t tell. Rather than expecting users to take the exchange’s word for it, Binance gives them the tools to verify independently. Anyone can check their own holdings against the total reserves without compromising their privacy. This setup builds confidence not through promises, but through math and on-chain data. What Makes Binance’s Approach Different Many exchanges talk about transparency, but Binance’s PoR combines technical depth with open accessibility. The Merkle Tree system ensures privacy protection, while on-chain wallet disclosure offers public accountability. Together, they form a dual verification layer, internal proof and external validation. Moreover, the consistent monthly updates prevent the system from becoming static or outdated. Each snapshot reflects the current state of reserves, giving users a rolling window of financial health. It’s not just about one good report, it’s about continuous visibility. For the average trader, this might sound like background noise. But it’s a cornerstone of security. Without Proof of Reserves, users would have no way to confirm if exchanges truly hold what they claim. Binance’s system closes that gap entirely. By releasing these reports regularly, Binance reinforces a key principle: user funds must always be verifiable, recoverable, and protected. That’s the foundation of a healthy exchange ecosystem. As the crypto industry matures, systems like Binance’s PoR are setting new standards for exchange transparency. They’re not just accounting tools, they’re part of a shift toward on-chain verifiability. In the long term, this could evolve into an industry-wide baseline. Exchanges that can’t provide real-time proof of reserves may struggle to maintain user trust. Binance’s consistent updates position it ahead of that curve, proving that financial integrity and user confidence can coexist in a competitive environment. Verifiable Proof, Public Ledger The strength of this system is that it doesn’t rely on hidden audits or third-party statements. Every balance connects through cryptography to public wallet addresses. The math can be checked by anyone, anywhere, anytime. For users, that means no blind trust, only verifiable proof. And for the market, it means an ongoing commitment to transparency and accountability that’s visible on-chain. The November Proof of Reserves snapshot shows a simple truth: Binance holds more than enough to cover every user deposit. 102% coverage for BTC. Full 1:1 backing for ETH. Over 112% coverage for BNB. 107% coverage for USDT. In an industry built on trust and code, Binance is choosing to show both. For users, that means assurance. For the broader crypto ecosystem, it’s another sign that transparency is no longer optional, it’s the standard. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

54188752,https://nulltx.com/?p=152603,1762658523,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Kazakhstan to Launch $1B Crypto Fund, Partners With Nvidia in $2B Tech Push",https://nulltx.com/kazakhstan-to-launch-1b-crypto-fund-partners-with-nvidia-in-2b-tech-push/,"Kazakhstan is stepping firmly into the digital asset era, but in its own cautious way. According to Bloomberg, the Central Asian nation is creating a national cryptocurrency reserve fund valued between $500 million and $1 billion, aimed at positioning the country as a strategic player in the global blockchain economy. Unlike sovereign Bitcoin holders such as El Salvador, Kazakhstan’s new fund won’t hold tokens directly. Instead, it will invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and crypto-related companies, giving it exposure to the broader digital asset market while avoiding the volatility of individual coins. The reserve fund, expected to launch by early 2026, will be seeded with assets seized or repatriated from abroad, along with proceeds from state-backed crypto mining operations. “No Direct Exposure,” Says Central Bank Chief The Central Bank of Kazakhstan is being deliberate about how it enters the digital finance race. Governor Timur Suleimenov told Bloomberg the fund will be “very careful about direct exposure to cryptocurrencies,” emphasizing a preference for regulated and diversified investments. This means the fund’s portfolio will likely include equity in blockchain infrastructure firms, AI-driven financial technologies, and crypto-ETF products rather than direct Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings. That conservative stance may surprise observers, especially given Kazakhstan’s outsized role in global Bitcoin mining. The country ranks among the world’s top mining hubs, with its state-backed facilities responsible for a meaningful share of Bitcoin’s total hash power. But the approach signals something deeper: a shift toward financial stability and institutional credibility, not speculative hype. Seized Assets, Repatriated Wealth Power the Fund The seed capital for the crypto reserve fund won’t come from public taxes or national debt. Instead, it’s being sourced from assets seized in corruption cases and wealth repatriated from overseas, a growing theme in Kazakhstan’s post-reform financial policy. Over the past three years, the government has intensified efforts to recover billions in offshore assets, working closely with Western jurisdictions. Now, some of those funds will fuel a new generation of sovereign investment, one aimed at the blockchain economy. By using previously frozen or dormant capital, the government can test digital investment waters without adding fiscal pressure. The plan aligns with Kazakhstan’s broader financial modernization drive, which includes strengthening anti-money-laundering oversight and promoting state participation in regulated fintech innovation. Crypto Strategy: From Mining to Macro Kazakhstan’s crypto industry is already a pillar of its tech economy. After China’s mining ban in 2021, miners flocked to Kazakhstan for cheap power and open regulations. At its peak, the country accounted for more than 18% of global Bitcoin hash rate, trailing only the U.S. However, as energy demand soared, the government tightened oversight. Power rationing, tax revisions, and compliance rules pushed inefficient miners out, while the state began consolidating operations under its national energy and digital agencies. Now, through this new national crypto reserve, Kazakhstan appears ready to re-enter the global conversation, this time as a regulated investor, not just a miner. Partnership With Nvidia Signals Tech Ambition Kazakhstan isn’t doing this alone. In a parallel move, the government has signed a $2 billion memorandum of understanding with Nvidia, the U.S. chipmaker dominating AI and high-performance computing. The deal underscores Kazakhstan’s push to build domestic data-center capacity and AI-blockchain synergy, essential for scaling mining and fintech operations. Nvidia’s role could extend beyond hardware. Sources familiar with the agreement suggest collaboration on AI-driven risk management and blockchain infrastructure for financial institutions, areas where the crypto reserve fund may later invest. The partnership also positions Kazakhstan to benefit from the global AI-mining overlap, where GPU-based infrastructure can serve both crypto and machine-learning workloads. Balancing Risk and Innovation While Kazakhstan’s crypto reserve fund marks a major milestone, its cautious investment policy shows the fine line governments now walk between innovation and financial risk. By channeling money through ETFs and equity stakes, the fund minimizes exposure to market swings while retaining upside from the industry’s long-term growth. It’s a hybrid strategy, combining state prudence with tech optimism. For emerging markets, it’s also a potential model. Direct crypto holdings expose sovereign funds to volatility, custody risk, and political backlash. ETF and equity positions, meanwhile, provide exposure to regulated, audited, and globally liquid vehicles. If successful, Kazakhstan could set a precedent for “crypto-sovereign investing 2.0”, a framework that blends accountability, compliance, and digital innovation. Context: Global Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption Kazakhstan’s decision comes amid a global wave of institutional movement into digital assets. In the U.S., BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF now holds over 300,000 BTC. In Asia, sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and Hong Kong are exploring blockchain infrastructure investments. What’s notable is that Kazakhstan’s initiative bridges both worlds, it’s not buying Bitcoin like a retail trader, but it’s not avoiding the crypto sector either. It’s building a state-managed foothold in the ecosystem without triggering direct exposure risk. That kind of strategy could attract traditional investors wary of volatility but bullish on the industry’s long-term trajectory. Launch Timeline: Early 2026 The crypto reserve fund is slated for launch by early 2026, pending regulatory clearance and capital deployment. Preparations are already underway to define asset allocation rules, ETF screening criteria, and investment governance structures. Officials hint that the Central Bank and the Ministry of Digital Development will jointly oversee operations, ensuring both financial stability and technological oversight. With a funding base between $500 million and $1 billion, the reserve is expected to become one of the largest crypto-related sovereign initiatives globally, rivaling early investment vehicles seen in Singapore, the UAE, and Switzerland. Kazakhstan’s $1B crypto reserve fund marks the start of a new phase, one where nations enter crypto not by mining or trading, but by strategically investing. The fund’s design reflects realism: Bitcoin’s volatility remains high, but the ecosystem around it, from ETFs to infrastructure, has matured. By betting on that layer, Kazakhstan signals it wants to participate in crypto’s future, not gamble on its price. With assets reclaimed, partnerships secured, and regulations tightening, the country is quietly building a new financial instrument, one that could turn Kazakhstan from a mining hub into a sovereign blockchain investor.

The exchange announced that QCAD ($QCAD), Monad ($MON), and Aster ($ASTER) have been added to its official roadmap, a move signaling its continued expansion into new blockchain ecosystems and next-generation trading protocols. The additions mark a fresh wave of interest in projects that combine infrastructure scalability, localized stablecoins, and innovative DEX architecture. Coinbase’s roadmap update hints that listings or integrations could follow soon, as the exchange continues to diversify its offerings beyond mainstream tokens. Assets added to the roadmap today: Aster (ASTER) https://t.co/lyEugQo7Cv — Coinbase Markets (@CoinbaseMarkets) November 7, 2025 QCAD: Bringing the Canadian Dollar to the Blockchain Leading the trio is QCAD, a Canadian dollar–backed stablecoin issued by Stablecorp Inc. The project aims to digitize the Canadian dollar, enabling frictionless transfers and on-chain settlements for users and institutions within Canada’s financial ecosystem. Unlike other USD-denominated stablecoins that dominate global trading, QCAD is built for a regional market, designed to serve cross-border remittances, merchant payments, and DeFi integrations anchored to CAD value. Stablecorp, the issuer, has been positioning QCAD as a compliance-first, transparent digital asset. By leveraging audited reserves and established financial partnerships, QCAD bridges the gap between traditional finance and on-chain liquidity. Its inclusion on Coinbase’s roadmap signals growing recognition of non-USD stablecoins as viable liquidity instruments in DeFi. @coinbase adds @stablecorp $QCAD , @monad $MON and @Aster_DEX $ASTER to its roadmap #Coinbase has announced the addition of QCAD $QCAD , Monad $MON and Aster $ASTER to its roadmap.

Monad aims to provide Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility while dramatically improving throughput and latency. Its architecture blends parallel execution with deterministic finality, allowing developers to migrate existing Ethereum dApps without rewriting code, but with far greater performance. The protocol positions itself as a next-generation infrastructure layer, combining Ethereum’s proven development standards with optimizations inspired by modern high-performance systems. Industry observers view Monad’s inclusion on Coinbase’s roadmap as a sign of growing institutional curiosity around alternative EVM-compatible chains. With Ethereum layer-2s facing congestion and high bridging costs, new L1 contenders like Monad are pitching simpler, unified scaling paths. If listed, $MON could become one of the few early-stage infrastructure tokens with direct exposure to Coinbase’s retail and institutional user base, a major visibility boost ahead of mainnet deployment. Aster: The Rising DEX Challenger Coinbase’s roadmap also features Aster ($ASTER), the native token of Aster DEX, a next-generation decentralized exchange platform gaining traction in the derivatives market. Aster offers spot and perpetual trading with deep liquidity, tight spreads, and an expanding user base. Its model focuses on fee optimization and incentive alignment, areas where centralized exchanges have traditionally outperformed DEXs. The timing of Aster’s inclusion is notable. The DEX sector is heating up fast, with established platforms like Hyperliquid starting to lose ground. According to recent market data, Hyperliquid’s market share has fallen from over 70% to just above 30%, as new entrants such as Lighter and Aster gain speed. Many of these newer protocols are leveraging faster engines, better fee models, and community-driven incentives, creating a wave of competition across on-chain derivatives markets. Aster’s strong performance and ecosystem growth likely caught Coinbase’s attention, positioning it as one of the more promising DEX tokens to watch heading into 2026. Shifting DEX Market Dynamics Hyperliquid still leads in on-chain trading volume, but the shift in dominance highlights an evolving landscape. As newer players like Aster and Lighter bring improved fee structures and user incentives, traders are migrating toward platforms offering real-yield mechanisms and transparent liquidity pools. This competitive dynamic is pushing DEX innovation beyond traditional AMM models. Advanced order books, perpetual markets, and optimized gas handling are now baseline expectations. Aster’s ability to climb into the top ranks of DEXs underscores this shift, traders are valuing execution efficiency and ecosystem participation more than legacy brand familiarity. #Hyperliquid vẫn dẫn đầu trong các sàn giao dịch phi tập trung (DEX), tuy nhiên vị thế thống trị đang dần suy yếu.

The exchange continues to expand beyond established layer-1 tokens, exploring infrastructure, localized stablecoins, and emerging DEX ecosystems. For Coinbase, the roadmap process allows early engagement with projects that have high technical merit or strong community traction, without immediate listing commitments. But historically, roadmap inclusion often precedes a full listing, suggesting that all three tokens could debut on the exchange in the coming months. If so, this would mark another round of diversification within Coinbase’s global portfolio, connecting traditional finance, infrastructure scalability, and DeFi liquidity under one umbrella. As 2025 heads into its final quarter, Coinbase’s latest roadmap update underscores how quickly the crypto market is evolving. Stablecoins are becoming more regional and regulated. Layer-1s are being reimagined for performance. DEXs are racing to out-engineer each other. QCAD, Monad, and Aster each represent a different pillar of that transformation, fiat-on-chain liquidity, high-throughput infrastructure, and decentralized trading. Coinbase’s recognition of these themes signals where institutional and retail attention may shift next: toward assets that blend utility, speed, and economic realism over pure speculation. The roadmap additions are more than token news, they’re a snapshot of where crypto is heading: localized finance, scalable infrastructure, and smarter decentralized market.

Instead of printing new tokens, top protocols are using real revenue to buy back and burn supply. It’s a shift from inflationary emissions to deflationary economics, where sustainability and long-term holder value take priority. Over the past few weeks, major names like Aave, EtherFi, Aster, Maple Finance, Venus, and zkSync have all introduced new buyback or revenue allocation models. Together, these moves signal a broader trend: the age of “real yield” and token value capture is officially here. Aave Approves $50M Annual Buyback Program Leading lending protocol Aave has approved a $50 million per year buyback initiative, one of the largest ever seen in DeFi. The mandate routes a portion of Aave’s protocol revenue toward open-market purchases of $AAVE, effectively tightening circulating supply. For years, Aave relied on growth incentives to bootstrap liquidity. Now, it’s pivoting toward consolidation and value accrual for long-term holders. This marks a turning point for DeFi governance, where success is measured not just by total value locked (TVL), but by how much profit flows back to the token itself. EtherFi DAO Greenlights $50M ETHFI Buyback Staking protocol EtherFi DAO followed suit, approving a $50 million $ETHFI buyback to strengthen its token’s price floor and treasury balance sheet. The move comes as EtherFi continues to dominate the liquid staking market, with over $5B in total value locked and deep integrations across the Ethereum ecosystem. By redirecting protocol earnings into buybacks rather than emissions, EtherFi is reinforcing value capture through deflation, a model that’s quickly becoming the new standard among major DAOs. The DAO also aims to establish ETHFI staking mechanisms, allowing holders to earn yield directly from buyback revenues. Aster Allocates 70–80% of Fees to Buybacks Over on Aster, the tokenomics redesign is even more aggressive. The project has announced plans to route 70–80% of Season 3 (S3) protocol fees directly into $ASTER buybacks. This high allocation reflects a clear strategy, limit emissions, use real protocol earnings to support price stability, and reward long-term participation. The move has already boosted confidence among traders, pushing up trading volume and engagement across the platform. Aster’s team describes this approach as part of a “fee-to-value cycle,” ensuring that network activity translates into tangible benefits for token holders. Maple Finance Targets Sustainable Returns for $SYRUP Holders Institutional DeFi protocol Maple Finance is joining the movement with a tokenomics upgrade of its own. Maple will now allocate 25% of all protocol revenue to $SYRUP buybacks and $stSYRUP staking rewards. This two-layer model reinforces a long-term loop: buybacks reduce supply while staking redistributes yield to holders. The company’s aim is to balance growth incentives with sustainability, creating a “real-yield” economy driven by organic protocol revenue, not short-term liquidity mining. Venus Redirects 40% of Revenue to $XVS Holders On Binance Smart Chain, lending giant Venus Protocol is executing one of the most balanced revenue distribution strategies in DeFi. The protocol now routes 40% of total revenue to $XVS holders, split evenly between buybacks and incentives. 20% goes toward $XVS buybacks and holder distributions. 20% funds $PRIME rewards paid out in USDT and USDC. Latest Buyback Moves Across Protocols More projects are routing revenue toward supply reduction instead of emissions. The focus is shifting to mechanisms that strengthen the token’s economic base. • $AAVE approves a $50M/year buyback mandate • EtherFi DAO passes a $50M… pic.twitter.com/NqH1bczatl — Tokenomist (@Tokenomist_ai) November 8, 2025 This structure gives holders both direct yield and deflationary pressure on token supply, combining the best aspects of equity dividends and tokenomics innovation. By rewarding loyalty and long-term alignment, Venus is strengthening its treasury resilience while tightening the $XVS float. zkSync Founders Propose $ZK Buybacks and Staking Layer-2 scaling project zkSync is also exploring a buyback model. The founders have proposed a $ZK buyback and staking program to enhance long-term value capture and align incentives between network participants, validators, and token holders. While details are still being finalized, the proposal would mark zkSync’s first major step toward on-chain yield tied directly to network usage and fees. It also hints at a broader L2 shift, away from inflationary reward cycles and toward mechanisms that reinforce token scarcity and holder rewards. Why the Buyback Trend Matters DeFi’s early years were defined by emission-heavy tokenomics. Protocols paid users in newly minted tokens, creating growth on paper but long-term inflation in practice. Now, as the market matures, projects are turning to corporate-style financial discipline, spending revenue to buy back their own tokens or share profits with holders. The difference is structural: Emissions dilute holders over time. Buybacks consolidate ownership and reduce supply. As one analyst put it, “Emissions grow your user base. Buybacks grow your floor.” Market Impact: Real Yield Over Speculation The collective shift to buybacks also changes how investors evaluate DeFi tokens. Rather than betting on speculative growth or airdrops, the focus is now on protocol revenue and real yield, metrics that mirror traditional financial performance. According to on-chain data, protocols adopting structured buyback systems are already seeing stronger price resilience during volatility. Investors view these models as defensive tokenomics, designed to reward actual participation instead of pure speculation. The Bigger Picture: Toward Sustainable DeFi As the broader crypto market faces tightening liquidity and shifting regulations, sustainability has become the new currency of trust. Buybacks and revenue redistribution aren’t just financial tools, they’re signals of maturity. They show that DeFi can operate with accountability, profitability, and long-term design principles similar to traditional finance. With over $200 million in combined buybacks approved or executed this quarter, the trend is only accelerating. From Aave’s $50M mandate to Aster’s 80% fee burn and zkSync’s staking proposal, DeFi protocols are clearly rewriting the playbook, proving that growth and sustainability can coexist.

54188755,https://nulltx.com/?p=152612,1762659458,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,NEAR Protocol Closes Q3 Strong with $3.3B Market Cap and Rising Cross-Chain Volume,https://nulltx.com/near-protocol-closes-q3-strong-with-3-3b-market-cap-and-rising-cross-chain-volume/,"NEAR Protocol (NEAR) continues to cement its position as one of the most active blockchain ecosystems of 2025. The Layer-1 network closed Q3 with a $3.3 billion market cap, marking a 24.3% jump quarter-over-quarter, while NEAR Intents processed $234.9 million in transaction volume, a milestone that underscores its growing dominance in cross-chain infrastructure. For a network once seen as an underdog among Ethereum alternatives, NEAR’s quiet but steady expansion is now turning heads across DeFi, AI, and multi-chain development. Cross-Chain Ambitions Take Center Stage At the heart of NEAR’s growth lies its cross-chain transaction layer, NEAR Intents. The protocol allows users to perform seamless swaps and actions across different blockchains without directly bridging assets. In Q3, the Intents framework processed nearly a quarter billion dollars in volume, showing accelerating demand for abstracted, multi-chain operations. This plays directly into NEAR’s mission to become “the blockchain for AI and chain abstraction.” In plain terms: NEAR wants to make blockchains invisible. It’s building an architecture where users and developers no longer need to think about what chain they’re on, just what action they want to take. That abstraction layer, backed by NEAR Intents, is fast becoming the network’s most strategic advantage. Scalability Boost: NEAR Expands from 8 to 9 Shards To meet growing demand, NEAR executed a key scalability milestone in Q3: expanding its sharding structure from 8 to 9 shards. The move increased network throughput by 12.5%, boosting performance and ensuring that NEAR can handle higher transaction loads without compromising decentralization. This continuous sharding evolution has been NEAR’s core scaling strategy since launch. Instead of relying on Layer-2 solutions or sidechains, NEAR scales horizontally, splitting network load into shards that operate in parallel. By increasing the number of shards, NEAR is effectively expanding its transaction lanes, allowing for higher volume and faster execution across decentralized applications (dApps). In Q3, @NEARProtocol continued to make strides in positioning itself as a go-to player for cross-chain swaps powered by NEAR Intents. NEAR closed Q3 2025 with a $3.3B market cap, up 24.3% QoQ, and $234.9M in volume processed through NEAR Intents. As NEAR advances its vision of… https://t.co/JW29rcgwyu pic.twitter.com/myiMK1PVXa — Messari (@MessariCrypto) November 7, 2025 Ecosystem Expansion: From DeFi to AI Collaborations Beyond raw throughput, NEAR’s Q3 was defined by new partnerships and ecosystem integrations that broadened its footprint across DeFi, identity, and AI. Key collaborations included: @privy_io – enabling private, secure identity layers for NEAR users. @EverclearOrg – enhancing interoperability for multi-chain liquidity and asset movement. @shelbyserves – expanding consumer-facing services built on NEAR. @auroraisnear – reinforcing the connection between NEAR and its EVM-compatible layer for developers. @iqwiki – integrating decentralized knowledge-sharing capabilities. @PublicAI_ – pushing forward NEAR’s vision of user-owned, on-chain artificial intelligence. Each partnership underscores NEAR’s pivot toward real-world utility, especially around user-owned AI and decentralized data systems. In 2025, where AI dominance and data privacy are global debates, NEAR’s model of on-chain AI agents aligns perfectly with the trend toward open, verifiable intelligence. Technical Upgrades: Nearcore v2.7.0 and v2.8.0 On the protocol side, NEAR rolled out two major upgrades during Q3, Nearcore v2.7.0 and v2.8.0. These releases focused on network optimization, validator improvements, and developer tooling, ensuring that the expanding sharded network runs smoothly. While these updates may sound routine, they’re part of NEAR’s disciplined, consistent development cadence, one that has earned it a reputation for stability even amid crypto’s chaotic cycles. With each Nearcore release, the protocol is refining the core mechanics behind fast finality, low gas fees, and seamless developer integration. Market Metrics and Momentum According to Messari, NEAR’s Q3 performance reflects not only technical progress but also strong market positioning. Market Cap: $3.3 billion (up 24.3% QoQ) Volume via NEAR Intents: $234.9 million processed Shards: 9 (up from 8, +12.5% throughput) Ecosystem Growth: 6 new strategic partnerships These figures highlight a project quietly growing beneath the surface, avoiding the hype-driven cycles seen in other ecosystems while focusing on infrastructure that actually scales. Becoming the Blockchain for AI and Abstraction NEAR’s latest quarterly growth isn’t just about DeFi volume or market cap. It’s about positioning. As Ethereum continues to focus on Layer-2 expansion, NEAR is charting a different course: becoming the blockchain for AI-driven applications and seamless cross-chain intent execution. The integration of AI into blockchain logic, through projects like PublicAI, shows NEAR’s intent to bridge two of the decade’s defining technologies. In this model, users own their data, their identity, and even their AI agents, all anchored on-chain. This concept of “user-owned AI” turns NEAR from just another blockchain into what many are calling a Web3 operating system. Community sentiment remains bullish. Developers continue to praise NEAR’s SDKs and language-agnostic environment. Projects like Aurora are drawing more Solidity devs into NEAR’s orbit, while ecosystem grants and hackathons are sparking renewed interest in decentralized infrastructure. Meanwhile, NEAR’s decision to stay active in cross-chain liquidity, rather than compete head-on in the Layer-1 isolation race, is paying off. The strategy brings in users from other ecosystems instead of trying to replace them. As NEAR enters Q4, all signs point toward continued expansion. With new shards online, fresh partnerships in AI and DeFi, and consistent growth in cross-chain activity, the protocol is shaping up as one of 2025’s most strategically positioned Layer-1s. In a year where AI integration and multi-chain interoperability have become the new frontiers, NEAR stands at the intersection of both, building the rails for the next phase of Web3 usability.

That popularity, though, has made it an attractive target for scammers who often impersonate the exchange’s support services to lure victims. Clients are advised always to verify information through official channels and remain skeptical of unsolicited messages. French and Italian Users are in Greater Danger Earlier this week, Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng, sounded the alarm about recent phishing scams on the messaging platform WhatsApp. He clarified that the company will never message users in groups regarding investments or funds. Seeing more phishing scams on WhatsApp lately. Please stay cautious – Binance will never message you in groups about investments or funds. If in doubt, verify first. — Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) November 7, 2025 Prior to that, the exchange issued a detailed warning on the matter. The team has identified a wave of WhatsApp scams where bad actors pretend to be Binance representatives, especially in regions like France and Italy, to deceive clients and request funds or offer fake investment advice. “Let’s be clear: Binance will never contact you on WhatsApp to offer investment opportunities, request payments, or ask for your personal information. Anyone claiming to represent Binance and reaching out to you this way is attempting to scam or defraud you,” the company stated. According to Binance, these impersonation scams have become increasingly sophisticated, noting that the perpetrators also use Telegram and other platforms to target victims. The firm’s team said knowledge about the threat is the most vigorous defense, urging users to spread the word about any potential scams and thus protect the community. “To stay protected, always verify information through Binance’s official channels — our website, verified social media accounts, or the Binance App. Staying alert, informed, and skeptical of unsolicited messages is the best way to keep your crypto secure. Together, we can build a safer crypto community for everyone,” the alert reads. Additional Security Measures Earlier this year, CEO Richard Teng advised all users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA), utilize the safety tools provided by Binance to their fullest extent, and remain vigilant for potential fraudulent schemes. His reminder came a few months after some of the exchange’s users were targeted in an SMS spoofing attack. Specifically, clients received text messages that appeared to come from the usual number used for sending verification codes. The SMS claimed their accounts had supposedly been accessed from North Korea, urging them to set up a specific wallet and transfer all their funds there. Needless to say, this was a scam, and those sending holdings to the dubious address suffered losses.

Canary Capital ETF Timetable Canary Capital’s spot ETF is set to go live after an updated S-1 filing, with a possible automatic launch 20 days later on November 13. Reports from the stage cited Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, as confirming the update. That filing removed an amendment clause that would have given the SEC greater control over the product’s effective date. Based on reports, the timeline could still shift if the SEC returns questions or if government operations change, but for now November 13 stands out as a key date. Retail And Whale Activity Cool CryptoQuant charts show retail trading activity has cooled since the big sell-off on October 10, when about $19 billion was wiped out in a single day. Small investors have pulled back into a neutral zone, which some analysts read as cautious waiting rather than exit. At the same time, large on-chain moves to exchanges have dropped sharply — from roughly 49,000 on October 25 and 44,000 on October 11 to about 800 on a recent Friday. That fall in whale-to-exchange transactions suggests fewer big sellers are moving funds to exchanges right now. “The last half of November is going to be big for $XRP and @Ripple,” said @TeucriumETFs CEO @GilbertieSal during a recap of #RippleSwell Day 1.

Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie told audiences that the last half of November could be very important for XRP, tying that view to broader trends in tokenization and institutional flows. Citibank projections cited at the event say tokenized assets could hit trillions within five years, and other panelists mentioned planned moves by traditional finance players. Based on reports, Circle also has plans to begin trading public equities in early December, which some see as another nudge toward more mainstream involvement. Advice From Market Players Gilbertie urged holders to focus on the long term. “Believe in it. Don’t worry about volatility. It will even out as adoption comes and more institutional money enters,” he said. That view was shared by other commentators who pointed out that ETF listings and institutional onboarding have historically changed how markets price assets.

The suggested roadmap points toward expanded innovation, deeper institutional adoption, and a broader role for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the global financial sector. Ripple’s President Outlines Next Chapter For XRP At the Ripple Swell 2025 event, held on November 4-5, Long shared the company’s ambitious roadmap for XRP , giving the crypto community a glimpse of Ripple’s future ecosystem plans. Speaking with CoinDesk, she explained that Ripple’s vision extends well beyond payments, focusing on developing a robust infrastructure that promotes financial inclusion globally. According to the Ripple President, the crypto payments company now runs two main parts of its business. One division focuses on helping financial institutions adopt digital assets , while the other is dedicated to enhancing the XRP Ledger through continuous innovation. She also emphasized that the XRP Ledger has grown a lot in the past few years, with numerous updates enhancing its strength, speed, and reliability. Another big growth step the Ripple President mentioned for the ecosystem is a new lending protocol expected to expand how people and businesses interact and use XRP. Long added that Ripple is currently investing heavily in new use cases that show how its ledger can support more than just global digital asset payments. Long has reported that a significant part of Ripple’s roadmap involves bringing more institutions onto the crypto network by offering real, practical tools. She noted that stablecoins, for instance, enable companies to transfer value quickly and efficiently. By integrating stablecoins into the XRP Ledger , Ripple aims to enhance the cryptocurrency’s real-world utility and strengthen its liquidity. Commenting on the growth plans, prominent crypto analyst X Finance Bull noted that Ripple’s next big steps mark a shift away from speculation and toward global adoption. Long remarked that the crypto company’s development strategy reflects a “flywheel effect” between utility, trust, and liquidity. More Updates And Milestones Revealed At The Ripple Swell At the Swell 2025 event, Ripple also announced that it had recently closed a $500 million strategic investment round , valued at about $40 billion. The round was led by Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities, with participation from Panera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and others. Notably, the large-scale investment round highlights growing institutional confidence in Ripple’s leadership and business model after its most successful year to date. Additionally, Ripple highlighted recent milestones within its ecosystem. The company reported more than $95 billion in total payment volume across its global payments network and more than $1 billion in market capitalization for its RLUSD stablecoin .

Software engineer Vincent Van Code highlighted the significance of Long’s remarks, underscoring the need to understand the broader implications of these developments. The comments emphasize a growing sense of forward movement in Ripple’s operational and institutional direction, particularly regarding enterprise engagement and stablecoin settlement infrastructure. XRP Ripple must read, Monica Long is President of Ripple btw. https://t.co/qXYnnC6ZD7 — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) November 7, 2025 Corporate Investment and Strategic Positioning Monica Long’s post summarized multiple announcements that reflect the continued scaling of Ripple’s business model. One of the central points was the confirmation of a $500 million strategic investment round. The participating firms included Fortress, Citadel, Pantera, Galaxy, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace. Long described this as an affirmation of progress made and the long-term direction the organization intends to pursue. Beyond the investment figures, Long noted the significance of Ripple’s collaboration with Mastercard , WebBank, and Gemini. This effort focuses on using RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin , on the XRP Ledger to settle fiat credit card transactions on-chain. According to her outline, this would represent one of the first cases where a regulated financial institution settles standard card transactions using a regulated stablecoin on a public blockchain. The update implies a shift toward integrating blockchain settlement with existing consumer and enterprise payment models, moving beyond pilot phases into structured execution. Team Expansion and Infrastructure Integration Long also referenced a development relating to Palisade, whose co-founders have returned to Ripple’s team. She stated that Palisade’s infrastructure aligns with Ripple’s custody and payment solutions by supporting wallet-as-a-service capabilities. The integration of such infrastructure suggests an ongoing effort to strengthen Ripple’s service stack and raise operational scalability for institutional use. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In addition, Long said that RLUSD surpassed the $1 billion market capitalization benchmark. While this is one milestone among many planned, she framed it as an indicator of gradual but meaningful expansion in liquidity and utility across regulated environments. Community Commentary Vincent Van Code’s comment highlighted the relevance of Long’s statements for individuals following the organization’s trajectory. Another X user, Just Jerryl, expressed confidence in the Long-led direction, noting that the developments signal continued momentum. The announcements presented illustrate structural growth supported by investment, partnerships, and infrastructure development. The operational emphasis remains on regulated settlement, enterprise integration, and scaling of real-world utility.

Following this announcement, a report from Daily Times mentioned that Zafar Masud, President of the Pakistan Banks Association (PBA), pointed out the possibility of the country accessing a growth of about $20 to $25 billion related to cryptocurrency. Speaking at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Conference, Pakistan Banks Association (PBA) President Zafar Masud said: “If we delay regulation, we risk losing billions in potential investment and innovation,” Masud said, noting that Pakistan’s young population and growing digital economy present a “massive opportunity” for blockchain-based solutions. If successful, Pakistan could position itself as a regional leader in fintech and digital payments. Masud acknowledges the rapidly expanding global market for stablecoins When asked by reporters why the country had shifted its interest towards the stablecoin market , Masud acknowledged the rapidly expanding global market for stablecoins. Based on his argument, Pakistan is carefully evaluating the creation of a stablecoin backed by the rupee. Masud also noted that a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is important as it could enhance access to financial services and reduce remittance costs. Regarding his statement, Faisal Mazhar, Deputy Director of Payments at the State Bank of Pakistan, commented on the topic of discussion. Mazhar mentioned they have already begun developing a CBDC prototype with assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Moreover, the deputy director revealed plans to conduct a pilot phase before fully launching the prototype. In the meantime, it is worth noting that Pakistan’s project to develop its stablecoin comes shortly after a fintech startup, ZAR, announced its plan to offer dollar-backed stablecoins to the country’s everyday users. At the same time, other emerging markets secured $12.9 million in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Other investors backing this initiative include VanEck Ventures, Endeavour Catalyst, Coinbase Ventures and Dragonfly Capital. Still, ZAR aims to embrace its intention to assist 240 million individuals in Pakistan, where over 100 million adults do not have bank accounts, by offering access to stablecoins and improving financial inclusion. Pakistan aims to solidify its position as a leader in the crypto ecosystem A reliable source recently highlighted that Pakistan gained six positions to secure the third spot in Chainalysis’ Global Crypto Adoption Index for 2025. This ranking solidifies the country’s position as a rapidly expanding crypto market worldwide. Local experts estimate that citizens hold between $20 billion and $30 billion in digital assets, mostly through peer-to-peer and informal channels. Meanwhile, to strengthen its presence in the crypto market, Pakistan opened its doors to virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and international crypto exchanges in September this year. The country encouraged them to apply for licenses under a new federal regulatory system. On the other hand, the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA) urged leading firms to submit Expressions of Interest (EoIs) to support the nation’s growing digital asset industry. Established under the Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025, PVARA regulates, licenses, and oversees VASPs. The agency was assigned this role after a report from the local English news source Dawn mentioned that PVARA will carry out its operation as an independent regulator. Apart from the above role, PVARA was assigned the responsibility of making sure VASPs meet international standards and adhere to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines.

JPMorgan Held 5.2 Million IBIT At End Q3 In the latest 13-F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), JPMorgan disclosed its holding of 5,284,190 IBIT shares, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, as of September 30. This third-quarter figure represents a sharp 64% increase in the firm’s exposure to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. JPMorgan’s IBIT holdings, which were worth about $333 million as of September 30, are now valued at around $312 million. While the bank’s expanded position places it amongst one of the major institutional holders of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, it still sits behind other firms, like Goldman Sachs, with significantly larger holdings. Goldman Sachs disclosed that it held 30.8 million shares of IBIT in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, the filing with the SEC shows that JPMorgan held IBIT call options worth $68 million and put options worth $133 million as of September 30. The increased investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs is consistent with the bank’s price expectations for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a recent report, strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team shared that deleveraging in the crypto derivatives market, especially Bitcoin perpetual futures, appears to be mostly over. The JPMorgan analysts revealed that the recent rise in gold volatility has made BTC a more attractive investment option on a risk-adjusted basis. Using this gold-based model, the pundits argued that Bitcoin is fairly undervalued compared to gold and could see a significant upward movement to around $170,00 over the next 6 to 12 months. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $102,900, reflecting an over 1% jump in the past 24 hours. However, the premier cryptocurrency is still deep in the red on medium-term timeframes. According to data from CoinGecko, the BTC price is down by more than 6% in the last seven days. BlackRock’s IBIT Struggles In Recent Weeks BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has somewhat struggled over the past few weeks, registering significant withdrawals in the last two. According to data from SoSoValue, the exchange-traded fund posted a weekly net outflow of over $403 million in the previous week. Excluding its performance on Friday, November 7, BlackRock’s IBIT looks set to record a weekly net outflow of roughly $450 million. Nevertheless, the iShares Bitcoin Trust still ranks as the largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund with a net asset of $80.58 billion under management.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETF|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BlackRock Bitcoin ETF|BlackRock’s IBIT|goldman sachs|JPMorgan,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-09 06:00:13

Bloomberg senior analyst Mike McGlone issued a stark warning in his assessment of Bitcoin's current position. Analyst and fund manager James Lavish summarised the market mood, saying: Sentiment towards Bitcoin appears to be at an all-time low. Long-term investors have sold over 400,000 BTC in the last month alone. Despite this, the price is still above $100,000. Related News: Donald Trump's Son Eric Trump Makes Another Bitcoin Price Prediction - “A World-Class Asset” However, McGlone responded by saying that this level may not be maintained for long. According to the Bloomberg analyst, Bitcoin is losing critical technical levels: “In my opinion, Bitcoin won't stay above $100,000 for long. BTC opened below the 200-day moving average in the US morning hours on Monday, November 3rd. This level is now a strong resistance level around $110,000. Bitcoin could wake up below $100,000 on Monday, November 10th.” McGlone highlighted not just Bitcoin but the entire crypto market. He noted that Strategy crashed, while the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index is down 1 percent through 2025, the S&P 500 is up nearly 16 percent. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/top-investor-dont-sleep-on-xrp-100-price-will-happen-100-heres-why/,"Crypto investor 24HRSCRYPTO has reaffirmed a strong long-term outlook on XRP, stating that a $100 valuation remains, in his view, a realistic outcome. According to his recent message, the expectation is based on the role of liquidity in global value-transfer systems rather than a short-term price rally. He noted that individuals who understand liquidity mechanisms, particularly within institutional and cross-border settlement environments, would recognise that such a valuation would not be excessive under conditions of scaled utility. The investor maintained that the projection is not intended as mere speculation, but rather as a statement grounded in observed developments and network expansion. He encouraged market participants to evaluate structural and utility-driven factors rather than relying solely on sentiment-based market reactions. The below tweet aged really well, along with many others… Don’t sleep on XRP. $100 XRP will happen 100% – (this will age real well as well) Don’t hate, just research… if you’re smart enough to understand how liquidity works… you understand that a $100 XRP is actually… https://t.co/PVKCA3CQB7 — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) November 7, 2025 Reference to a Prior Observation To support the renewed statement, 24HRSCRYPTO highlighted an earlier comment he made on June 23, 2023. In that previous message, he emphasized the significance of long-term institutional relationship building that has occurred over more than a decade. He underscored that the company developing much of the infrastructure surrounding XRP has consistently worked with partners and institutions across a multi-year period. According to him, the length and consistency of that engagement create a foundation for scalability, operational reliability, and broader market trust. His position is that sustained institutional cooperation serves as a key indicator of potential future utility-driven demand. He pointed to the network of partnerships and formal integrations as evidence of ongoing groundwork that could support large-scale transaction volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Liquidity Considerations and Market Implications The core of 24HRSCRYPTO’s argument centers on liquidity. He indicated that once liquidity reaches levels necessary for significant institutional throughput, the nominal price adjusts to accommodate volume without impairing efficiency. In this view, price is not simply market speculation but a function of transactional depth and settlement requirements across corridors and platforms. This interpretation places long-term valuation within the context of system-level usage. It also frames XRP valuation as tied to infrastructure expansion, corridor activation, and continued institutional alignment, rather than retail speculative cycles alone. 24HRSCRYPTO’s message reiterates a stance that has remained consistent over time. The expectation of a higher price point is presented as linked to liquidity conditions and institutional integration rather than short-term market behavior. The investor maintains that prior observations have remained relevant, and that those evaluating XRP should consider how market value intersects with utility, settlement needs, and the scale of financial infrastructure built around the asset.

His commentary was accompanied by a set of monthly charts comparing past consolidation patterns and breakout structures. The argument was framed around recurring long-term formations and measured expansion phases that previously led to significant price appreciation. One of the crypto assets that will follow $ZEC is $XRP $8-$10 conservative price targets pic.twitter.com/eMy4a46H32 — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 7, 2025 Technical structure and projected targets The chart presented by Mikybull focuses on multi-year trend behavior. It highlights extended accumulation zones below descending resistance levels, followed by sharp upside breaks. The most recent price action is shown as a defined horizontal range just above prior resistance, which the analyst interprets as another consolidation period preparing for continuation. This pattern resembles earlier cycles displayed in the chart, in which sustained compression preceded large directional moves. Based on prior breakout magnitudes and structural similarities, Mikybull outlined $8 to $10 as a conservative valuation range for XRP if the current consolidation resolves decisively to the upside. The emphasis is placed on the monthly timeframe, suggesting that any potential breakout would likely unfold gradually rather than as a short-term spike. His thesis relies on the continuation of the historical breakout behavior visible on the chart, rather than changes in external catalysts. Comparison with ZEC’s current market movement Part of Mikybull’s assertion references the recent ZEC’s performance. Based on figures, ZEC is up approximately 16% over the past 24 hours and has gained roughly 60% over the past week, according to major market trackers. This rise has renewed attention toward assets that have previously shown extended periods of subdued movement before breaking upward. The comparison is therefore not based on utility or function, but on structural price formation and the historical tendency for long-range consolidations to resolve in upward price discovery phases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community reactions and differing viewpoints Reactions to the chart and price targets varied across the comment section. One participant opined that XRP lacks meaningful value and compared it unfavorably to other tokens, citing alternative projects as better positioned. Another commenter pointed to regulatory clarity as a factor that could support stronger institutional engagement. A third response expressed dissatisfaction with what was described as prolonged expectations and limited follow-through, contrasting the current sentiment surrounding XRP with the momentum seen in ZEC. The range of responses reflects the ongoing divide between those who rely primarily on technical analysis and those who evaluate tokens on fundamentals or perceived market execution. Mikybull’s projection is conditional upon XRP breaking above its current range and sustaining higher price levels. While the technical comparison to ZEC offers a clear chart-based rationale, realization of the stated targets depends on market continuation, liquidity behavior, and broader conditions in the digital asset sector.

What’s more worrying about its potential in the following weeks is the behavior of whales and long-term holders, as the latter cohort of investors has been showing a rather different approach than in previous cycles. Unlike previous profit realization waves that aligned with rallies, since late September, as XRP fell from $3.09 (~25%) to $2.30, profit realization volume (7D-SMA) surged by ~240%, from $65M/day to $220M/day. This divergence underscores distribution into weakness, not strength.… https://t.co/PUURD4knVZ pic.twitter.com/jMWj3mF0Td — glassnode (@glassnode) November 8, 2025 Glassnode has repeatedly indicated that XRP holders used to realize profits during rallies in the past, such as the run to the new all-time high in July this year or the surge to $3.40 in January. However, they have changed their tune now, and they have been disposing of substantial portions of their token holdings as the asset’s price has been on an evident decline since late September. This aligns with other reports informing that whales are selling en masse. The latest one came yesterday, which showed that 500,000 tokens had been offloaded in the span of just 48 hours. The timing now is quite intriguing and perhaps unexpected because of the developments on the ETF front. According to the latest news on the matter, numerous companies have updated their S-1 filings with the US SEC to remove “delayment amendments.” This change allows the ETF in question to launch directly after a 20-day period, unless the Commission objects. The first such product that has a chance is Canary Capital’s application, which could see the light of day as early as this week (November 13). Consequently, the behavior of whales and long-term holders could be a classic “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news” approach, in which they expect XRP’s price to dump after the ETFs finally launch.

The question moving across trading chat groups and brokerage screens is simple: Which company will the U.S. take a stake in next? The pattern has been clear since the administration began taking ownership stakes in public companies to secure control over critical industries, a move that breaks from what previous presidents did. Stocks tied to these announcements have seen sharp, rapid climbs after the news hits. This has pushed traders to try to think the same way Trump thinks when choosing strategic national assets, according to reporting from Bloomberg. Adam Giddens, a 31-year-old investor from Vancouver who works in capital markets and trades in his free time, said he has changed his strategy completely. He used to rely on screening tools and social-media alerts, but now he studies government procurement records and federal resource reports. Adam said the reason is simple: when the administration buys into a company, “the shares tend to jump,” and traders want to be in before that move happens. Investors move toward critical minerals and strategic materials Adam is currently watching Military Metals Corp., a firm working on sourcing antimony, a mineral used in explosives, infrared sensors, and nuclear weapons systems. Right now, China is the world’s biggest supplier of antimony, and Russia is also a major source. Adam said, “That combination of strategic importance and supply chain vulnerability caught my attention,” and he believes Military Metals could receive government attention because of the size and location of its reserves. He said he has been reviewing government filings and industry papers to confirm what he suspects: the administration wants to ensure the U.S. cannot be cut off from critical industrial inputs. This interest in minerals is part of a broader effort by the administration to secure control of semiconductor supply, battery metals, and rare-earth elements. There is also a new exchange-traded fund being developed by Roundhill Financial, designed to mirror industries connected to U.S. strategic investment priorities. Traders see this as confirmation that the administration is not slowing down and that more public companies will be involved. Adam has already seen profits from this strategy. He bought shares of MP Materials Corp. before the Pentagon acquired 15% of the company in July, which sparked a 95% gain in its stock. MP Materials produces rare-earth materials used in electric vehicles, robotics, and electronics. Aniket Shah, head of sustainability and transition strategy at Jefferies, said that investors need to consider how closely a company can work with the state. He said, “Part of this analysis of businesses going forward has to be this political relationship with the state.” After the MP Materials move, the government used commitments in the CHIPS Act to take nearly 10% of Intel in August. In September, the U.S. took 5% of Lithium Americas, followed by 10% of Trilogy Metals the next month. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said that defense contractors could be next. AI tools, graphite bets, seabed mining, and rising risks Cole Hansen, a Boston-based trader who works in shipping support, said he asked AI chatbots why the administration chose the companies it has backed so far. He said the chatbots pointed him toward graphite, which is heavily controlled by China. That led him to Novonix, which received a $755 million loan from the Department of Energy to build a synthetic graphite facility in the U.S. He bought shares in October, but the company’s stock has dropped about 40% since then. Brian Laks, partner at Old West Investment Management, said he expects seabed mining firms such as TMC The Metals Company and Odyssey Marine Exploration to be possible targets. Brian said Old West already held MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy before the government stakes because they expected U.S. backing for mineral independence. Some traders are profiting after government stakes are announced. Matthew Tuttle of Tuttle Capital Management wrote put options on Intel in October, betting investors would follow the government into the stock. Matthew closed out the trade for a gain on November 5, saying, “Somebody else is doing this too and someone with a whole lot deeper pockets and way broader reach.” Not everyone supports this strategy. Rand Paul called the Intel stake “a step toward socialism.” Analysts warn that companies favored by the government may become less efficient, or may face intense competition that weakens profits. There have also been cases where rumors led to spikes that collapsed within hours, such as Critical Metals, which climbed over 100% before losses hit when officials said no deal was planned. For now, the government continues to take positions. Matt Gertken of BCA Research said, “For now, there’s an impetus to make sure that some of these companies are protected and that some of these supply chains are resilient. At some future date, that could shift back because of inefficiencies, because of deficits, because of inflation. But for now, it’s important for investors to know which way the wind is blowing.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|Intel|Jefferies|Military Metals|MP Materials|Roundhill Financial|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-09 07:30:36

The US central bank has been bracing for one of the most important decisions of the year, but it lacks access to key economic data that it typically uses to guide its interest rate policy. The extended shutdown has left investors in the dark weeks ahead of a meeting where they will decide whether to raise borrowing costs. The government has already missed publishing two monthly employment reports . Now, the October consumer price index (CPI), due out this week, is also at risk. The Bureau of Labour Statistics has ceased in-person data collection. Officials and analysts say the agency may not release the October CPI at all. This compounds the uncertainty at an already deeply uncertain time of a sharply divided Fed. Some policymakers argue that the economy is slowing and requires additional support. Others fear another spike in inflation if interest rates are cut too quickly. Without timely statistics, those disagreements may be more difficult to resolve. Fed officials consider next rate move but say key data is missing The December meeting of the Fed was always likely to be contentious. The central bank lowered interest rates in October, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut was not a certainty. Before they could make their next decision, policymakers wanted fresh evidence on inflation and hiring trends —data they now may not receive in time. With that evidence now absent, private payroll reports and hiring numbers from companies such as ADP and Indeed are filling in the gaps in labour market information. However, other measures of inflation are narrower. October inflation could have cooled to about 3%, the same as September, according to a “nowcast” model by the Cleveland Fed. However, models are estimates, not comprehensive surveys. Economists warn that processing delays mean that even if the shutdown were to end quickly, both the October and November inflation reports may not be ready in time for the December vote. That would leave the Fed to decide its next move with no fresh federal economic data. Some analysts said that if the October CPI data had already been released, it might have bolstered the case for a rate cut. Without that information, officials concerned about inflation may prefer to hold off. Markets wait for clues as policymakers take to the stage Financial markets still have a December rate cut priced in, though that expectation is fading. Investors are watching remarks from key Fed officials—including New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic—for clues about how missing data is shaping in-house thinking. There are also broader shifts in the global policy context. In Canada, the central bank will provide a full explanation for why interest rates were “about the right level” following its last cut. New figures on industrial output and retail spending in China will be closely watched for any signs of a rebound. At the same time, the UK releases wage and growth data amid sluggish economic momentum. Japan and Sweden will also release minutes from recent policy meetings, which could offer clues on how global officials are balancing risks associated with inflation against those of slowing demand. However, in the United States, policymakers are operating without a clear understanding. The shutdown is not only bringing the flow of data to a standstill; it’s also disrupting data collection. And even once the government reopens, economists expect delays, revisions, and gaps. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Its trading volume dropped 50.80% to $712.43M in 24 hours, showing less trader conviction. SUI 1-day chart analysis SUIUSD chart by TradingView SUI has remained bearish since mid-August, having faced resistance at $4. Last month, it dipped below $2 following a tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump. It now threatens support at $1.95 as the market remained bearish. It now trades below major moving averages. SUI 4-hour chart analysis SUIUSD chart by TradingView SUI has turned neutral on this timeframe, as shown by the MACD histogram (0.0088). Its RSI value at 49.55 shows neutral sentiment. It is oversold when the value drops below 30. The William Alligator trendlines have converged, a telling sign of little volatility.

According to the technical indicators, SUI has recorded 14 bullish days in the last thirty, signalling a bearish market. The charts also show that it now trades along $2m but threatens $1.95 support. Its volatility and momentum are dropping on the shorter timeframes. Why is SUI down? SUI’s dip stems from crypto-wide risk aversion, technical breakdowns, and post-liquidation fragility – though strong token locks and institutional deals (e.g., Mill City Ventures’ $450M allocation) provide long-term ballast. Recent news Sui unlocked 43,960,000 SUI tokens on November 1st, constituting approximately 1.21% of the currently circulating supply. Will SUI reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SUI will reach $10 in 2027, with an average of $10.83 for the year. Will SUI reach $100? It remains unlikely that SUI will rise to $100 before 2031. Will SUI reach $1,000? It remains unlikely that SUI will rise to $1,000 before 2031. How high can Sui go? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SUI will rise as high as $8 before the end of 2025. Is SUI crypto a good investment? Should the market sentiment change, SUI will rise to its previous highs. SUI’s price predictions for 2031 are optimistic as the global adoption of decentralized applications rises.

Large investors, often called whales, are making significant moves, hinting at potential growth for other cryptocurrencies. This article explores the ripple effects and identifies which coins might be next in line for a bullish trend. Dogecoin Hovers in Uncertain Waters: What's Next for the Meme Coin? Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between about 17 and 21 cents, moving slowly upwards. It recently took a dip, dropping almost 4% in a week, and nearly 30% over a month. The next hurdle for Dogecoin is just over 22 cents. If it tackles this, it may reach almost 26 cents, which would be a jump of around 25% from its lower range. But watch out; the coin could also fall below 16 cents if it dip again. Its RSI is near 58, hinting at no strong momentum in either direction. Dogecoin might have a playful face, but its future seeks steady legs. Conclusion The rebound in the market saw DOGE taking the lead, driven by a sudden short squeeze. This surge of activity brought large holders into the fray once more. Such movements often indicate renewed interest and strategic plays by influential participants. Other coins can also show similar potential based on these market signals. The involvement of significant stakeholders serves as a clear indication of the coin's pivotal role in shaping near-term trends. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The rally came after a strong third-quarter earnings report dropped over the weekend, while the Nasdaq cratered 3%, its largest weekly fall since April. The renewed interest in Warren Buffett’s company came at a time when markets started worrying that AI plays are too expensive and the U.S. economy might be weakening. According to Barron’s, the rally in Berkshire’s stocks cut its underperformance versus the S&P 500 to 4.3 percentage points from 12.2 points as of October 29. Berkshire’s operating income surged by 34% to nearly $13.5 billion in Q3, driven mainly by a 200% increase in profit from insurance underwriting. Buffett holds the buyback, piles up record cash Despite the strong quarter, Warren didn’t greenlight any stock buybacks, meaning he still doesn’t see Berkshire Hathaway shares as cheap, even after months of trading well below their May highs. With no cash spent on repurchasing its own shares, and with the company selling off more stocks than it bought, Berkshire’s total cash balance reached $381.7 billion at the end of September. That’s a 10.9% increase from June, and when you subtract BNSF Railway’s cash and adjust for the timing of some Treasury bill purchases, the pile still sits at $354.3 billion, up 4.3% over the same stretch. Warren might also be preparing to step away. On Monday, November 10, the company is scheduled to release a press statement that will include a message from him about philanthropy, Berkshire, and “other matters that shareholders may find to be of interest.” That’s what the company told The Wall Street Journal and confirmed in a news release last week. No one’s calling it a farewell, but the writing’s there. If Warren exits now, he’d be leaving with the company flush with cash, outperforming again, and cutting its reliance on overhyped equities. Apple, BofA both trimmed as portfolio reshuffle continues Next Friday, investors will get a full breakdown of Berkshire’s Q3 portfolio, but there are already signs Warren and his team have been selling down major holdings. Last Saturday’s 10-Q filing showed a $1.2 billion drop in cost basis for the company’s consumer stock category, which includes Apple . Apple had a 24% rally during the quarter, making it a prime candidate to cash in profits. Despite still being Berkshire Hathaway’s largest equity holding, now worth $75.2 billion, the company has cut the Apple position by 69% over the past two years. Barron’s broke down the $1.2 billion decline, dividing it by Apple’s per-share cost basis of $35. That math points to a sale of about 35 million shares, which would’ve brought in around $8 billion, based on Apple’s average Q3 price of $230 per share. Apple wasn’t the only one getting cut. The rest of Apple’s reported $12.4 billion in Q3 equity sales leaves $4.4 billion possibly tied to another name: Bank of America. Warren has been unloading that too. Since the beginning of 2024, Berkshire has cut its Bank of America stake by 40%, though it remains the company’s third largest public equity holding at $32.2 billion. Berkshire’s publicly disclosed holdings in the U.S., Japan , and Hong Kong are still substantial. Two Japanese companies, Itochu and Mitsubishi, are exceptions. Those are based on data from March 17 and August 28, respectively, with Japanese share prices converted to U.S. dollars. Meanwhile, State Street is sticking with the AI trade, even as tech investors take profits. Anna Paglia, the company’s Chief Business Officer, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” last week that momentum isn’t dead. “How would you not want to participate in the growth of AI technology?” she said. “Everybody has been waiting for the cycle to change from growth to value. I don’t think it’s happening just yet because of the momentum.” Anna added that “the rebalancing trade is not going to happen until we see a signal from the market indicating a slowdown in these big trends.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|Bank of America|Berkshire Hathaway|HDK|Itochu|JPY|Mitsubishi|Nasdaq|State Street|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-09 08:00:05

Are You Mentally Prepared?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-worst-case-scenario-are-you-mentally-prepared/,"Crypto analyst STEPHISCRYPTO presented a chart depicting a structured worst-case scenario for XRP. The visual projection shows the possibility of a further decline before a substantial recovery phase that targets significantly higher price levels. The post focuses on preparing market participants for volatility rather than issuing a direct prediction, and it is framed as a scenario that traders should be ready to manage emotionally and strategically. $XRP Worst-Case Scenario. Are you mentally prepared? pic.twitter.com/Hw2PZ13r8Q — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 6, 2025 The Scenario Presented In the chart shared by STEPHISCRYPTO, XRP’s price action is consolidating before dipping toward a lower support range. The analyst then outlines a sharp reversal from that level, leading into an accelerated upward trend that eventually reaches a higher valuation point, shown near $4. This structured path suggests a temporary move lower is possible before a stronger recovery emerges. The analyst does not label the setup as inevitable, but rather as an example of how market conditions could unfold under stress before momentum returns. The post emphasizes mental preparedness. STEPHISCRYPTO suggests that the capacity to remain consistent during less favorable phases may determine whether holders are positioned for any later appreciation. Community Responses The post drew responses from other market watchers with differing perspectives. X user AltcoinsBitcoin expressed the view that developments from Ripple and broader future utility should be considered when evaluating potential price outcomes. AltcoinsBitcoin questioned whether $4 would be a reasonable ceiling, suggesting that either market participants are missing information or expectations remain understated. Another user, The Runaway Princess, conveyed a more optimistic stance. According to her, the worst-case outcome from her perspective is XRP reaching $5 within the year. This response reflects a subset of the community that continues to anticipate higher performance in the medium term, regardless of interim volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent Developments Supporting Broader Confidence Some market observers align potential future recoveries with ongoing corporate and network developments. Ripple recently reported continued expansion in payments volume, strategic acquisitions, and growth in the stablecoin market through RLUSD . Supporters frequently cite these developments as reinforcing the long-term case for increased adoption and transactional usage, which could support market value over time. While such developments do not guarantee price outcomes, they are frequently referenced when constructing medium- and long-term market expectations. The scenario from STEPHISCRYPTO is a preparatory model rather than a definitive forecast. It illustrates a potential drawdown followed by a significant upward recovery, emphasis on emotional readiness, and a disciplined approach during shifting market conditions. Community replies from AltcoinsBitcoin and The Runaway Princess highlight differing outlooks, yet all commentary converges on the importance of awareness, observation, and maintaining a structured perspective as the market progresses.

This significant milestone could herald a new era for AVAX, potentially positioning it for substantial growth. As adoption spreads, questions arise about which other cryptocurrencies are poised to benefit. The article delves into these developments, exploring the potential ripple effects in the crypto market. Avalanche (AVAX) Holds Steady, Eyes Potential Breakout Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading in the range of about $17.20 to $20.80. The coin has faced challenges recently, showing a hefty drop of over 38% over the past month. However, with its current price stability above its 10-day simple moving average of around $17.80 and the 100-day average at $16.70, AVAX shows potential for recovery. The nearest challenge for AVAX is breaking past the $22.70 level. If achieved, the next target is about $26.30, which would be a significant rise of roughly 27% from the lower end of its current range. With an RSI of just under 56, AVAX is on the verge of a potential upswing. Conclusion AVAX's recent collaboration marks a significant milestone. The integration of a state stablecoin shows strong potential for mainstream appeal. Such adoption could pave the way for broader usage and confidence. The crypto community will closely watch how this development impacts AVAX’s standing. This could herald a new phase in its journey. Promising steps forward seem evident for AVAX.

In 2028, it will range between $4.68 and $5.34, with an average price of $5.01. In 2031, it will range between $8.01 and $8.68, with an average price of $8.35. SNX is the native token for the Synthetix Network and is used for governance. It is listed on top exchanges like Binance, Uniswap, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit. Synthetic is a decentralized protocol that allows you to create and transact synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Is SNX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in five years? Let’s get into the SNX price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Synthetix Abbreviation SNX Current Price $0.826 (-2.71%) Market Cap $283M Trading Volume (24-hour) $26.73M Circulating Supply 343.46M SNX All-time High $28.77 (Feb 14, 2021) All-time Low $0.03258 (Jan 5, 2019) 24-hour High $0.857 24-hour Low $0.811 SNX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Variation) 27.29% 50-day SMA $1.16 200-day SMA $0.8313 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) Synthetix price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Synthetix coin price analysis confirmed a downtrend as the price decreased to $0.826. Cryptocurrency loses 2.71% of its value. SNX coin looks for support around $0.772. As of November 9, 2025, Synthetix price analysis reveals a decreasing trend, with bearish pressure present at the current price level. The altcoin’s price decreased to $0.826 over the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost 2.71% in value as it corrects again after yesterday’s correction. Selling pressure formed when the coin touched $0.902 yesterday, and today the coin is shedding value again. SNX/USD 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of the Synthetix coin confirmed a downward market trend following a series of corrections as sellers continue to suppress the price levels. The cryptocurrency price has decreased to $0.826 over the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify the presence of selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is decreasing but still wide, leading to high volatility at the moment. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating resistance, has shifted to $1.42. Meanwhile, its lower limit, serving as support, has moved to $0.685. SNX/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator curve is trending in the neutral area, currently at 38.10. This situation suggests that sellers are striving for control of the SNX price, and further instability in the market can be expected if the bears sustain their momentum. SNX/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Synthetix Coin signals buyers’ support for the coin at the current price level. The SNX/USD price slightly increased to $0.826 after going through a correction. However, the low volatility levels suggest a decreased probability of an upcoming reversal or further price oscillation. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.884, marking the resistance level. The lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.794, showing the support level. SNX/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Its value increased to 41.29 over the past four hours. The upward curve on the RSI graph reflects a balanced trading environment. The bulls have been dominating the price chart for the past few hours and are still trying to maintain their lead. This trend has also resulted in a relatively balanced trading setup for intraday traders.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows a downward trend regarding current market events. The coin’s price has decreased to $0.826 in the last 24 hours. If the bearish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest support at the $0.772 level. Conversely, if buying interest sparks, the altcoin may recover to the $0.910 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $7.57 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting negative sentiment as the SNX price decreased to $0.826, losing 2.71% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $2.00 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2028. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $6? Considering the future price movements, SNX will reach the $6 level by 2029. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like a far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $8.68, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $8.68 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment. However, one’s own research is advised.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The highest price of the SNX token was 2.27 in January, but it corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781, showing significant growth. From August to September, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65 to $0.67, and in October 2025, SNX was trading above $1, finally peaking at $2.58 on the 13th of the month.

Alex, who co-founded the company in 2003, said short sellers are trying to damage a business he claims is supporting both investors and U.S. government partners. He directed his criticism especially at Michael Burry, who recently revealed short positions against the company and Nvidia. In two separate interviews on CNBC, Alex accused short sellers of “market manipulation.” On Tuesday, he targeted Burry’s bearish position, and on Friday, he repeated the same stance while speaking to Sara Eisen. Alex said: “To get out of his position, he had to screw the whole economy by besmirching the best financials ever that are helping the average person as investors and on the battlefield.” He made it clear he believes the short bets are designed to create panic rather than evaluate financial performance. Karp challenges short bets in public Even though the stock dropped this week, Palantir is still up 135% in 2025 and has risen 25 times in value over the past three years. The market valuation now stands above $420 billion. But the sharp price increase pushed the forward earnings multiple to about 220 times, which places it near the valuation levels of Tesla. By contrast, Nvidia trades near 33 times future earnings and Meta trades near 22. Critics argue the company has outpaced its fundamental value, while the leadership argues revenue and profit growth justify investor interest. In August, Andrew Left of Citron Research said Palantir was “detached from fundamentals and analysis” and stated that the stock should be valued at $40. On Friday, the stock ended the day at $177.93 after moving higher late in the session. Earlier in the week, the company reported earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst forecasts, and its full-year outlook was also stronger than what Wall Street expected. Yet the stock still fell roughly 8% Monday and nearly 7% Thursday. During the interview with Eisen, Alex said, “We’re delivering venture results for retail investors.” The short interest ratio, which measures the percentage of outstanding shares sold short, was above 9% in September but is now a little over 2%. That is one of the lowest levels since the company went public in 2020. Alex has previously said that anyone who dislikes the stock price should “exit.” After a previous earnings-related share decline in May, he said, “You don’t have to buy our shares.” He followed that by saying the company would continue partnering with key institutions and “dominate.” Leadership, politics, and criticism remain present The company continues to face criticism for its work with U.S. agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Alex has said his pro-Israel position caused some employees to depart. He said the company will continue to support defense and government missions whether or not there is political backlash. He did not signal any change to those relationships. During Monday’s earnings call, Alex questioned how people who did not invest in Palantir feel now and told them to “get some popcorn.” On CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday, he again went after Burry’s position against the company and Nvidia. Alex said, “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird. The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats— crazy.” Alex said the short sellers are “dumb,” but he also said they motivate him to push harder. He added that his plan is to make them, in his words, “poorer.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Business|NVDA|Nvidia|Palantir|PLTR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-09 08:20:15

This performance is well below BTC's average November return of +42.49% since 2013. Data shows that November has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin. In eight of the last twelve years, Bitcoin has seen a November rally, while in only four years has it experienced a decline. The median November return during this period was calculated at +8.81%. In contrast, November 2025 performance remains in negative territory, deviating from the historical trend. Market analysts believe this weak performance is due to uncertainty surrounding the Fed's interest rate policy, the US government shutdown, and early-stage selling by some Bitcoin whales. Related News: Coinbase Releases Mysterious Message: Announcement Coming on November 10 - Here's What We Think It Could Be November 2024 was also quite strong, with Bitcoin returning +37.29%. The year before, in November 2023, a more moderate but still positive close was seen at +8.81%. Meanwhile, November 2022 closed with a -16.23% drop, November 2021 with a -7.11% drop, and November 2019 with a -17.27% drop. The sharpest November declines were recorded in 2018 with a -36.57% drop. There were also quieter years within this period. November 2016, November 2015, and November 2014, which finished with a +5.42% increase, +19.27%, and +12.82%, are among the examples where November performance was closer to the historical average. *This is not investment advice.

Median profits across the Russell 3000 surged by 11% year over year in the third quarter, up from 6% the previous quarter, according to Morgan Stanley. Out of the 11 main sectors that make up the S&P 500, six managed to pull off average earnings gains in the last three months through September. That’s a huge leap from the second quarter, when only financials and mega-cap tech were in the green. Deutsche Bank ran the numbers and confirmed that this sudden uptick was across multiple industries. Trump’s sweeping tariffs were expected to choke profits, wreck supply chains, and push up costs. But somehow, companies kept pushing. “Companies have found ways to absorb the tariff impact and consumers will keep spending so long as they have a job,” said Dec Mullarkey, managing director at SLC Management, which manages $300 billion. That corporate toughness is showing up all over the earnings sheets. Multiple sectors defy expectations in Q3 David Kostin, chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note this week that most S&P 500 companies have already reported Q3 results, and a massive portion beat analyst forecasts. “In our 25-year data history, this frequency of earnings surprises has been surpassed only during the Covid reopening period in 2020-2021,” said David. Meanwhile, expectations for Q4 profits are still rising. Analysts now project a 7.5% increase, based on numbers tracked by FactSet. Some of that optimism is thanks to the deal-making Trump pulled off with Japan and the European Union . And after Trump sat down with Xi Jinping, both leaders agreed to a one-year trade truce, which calmed market nerves across the board. Carmakers like Ford and General Motors said their expected tariff pain shrank thanks to Trump’s extension of import relief on car parts. In energy and transport, companies like NRG Energy benefited from more data center construction, and Southwest Airlines saw revenue jump as travel demand kept climbing. In banking, firms like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase posted high profits driven by renewed deal activity and stronger trading income as market volatility picked up. On the tech side, Alphabet and Microsoft blew past forecasts. Google’s ad business and Microsoft’s cloud both pulled heavy weight. Meta, on the other hand, rattled investors with its massive capital spending, but the broader Big Tech group still held up. Consumer strain and weak sentiment cloud outlook But this party isn’t for everyone. Businesses selling directly to consumers are feeling the sting. Miguel Patricio, CEO of Kraft Heinz, said holiday sentiment was “one of the worst” he’s seen in decades. McDonald’s reported that more customers are ditching its pricier meals. Deutsche Bank pointed out that goods companies, especially those depending on consumer wallets, are dragging behind service‑focused businesses. The absence of official job numbers, caused by the government shutdown, made things worse for investors trying to track the labor market. But alternative indicators, like those from the National Federation of Independent Business, the San Francisco Federal Reserve, and state-level claims, all suggest the job market “is still doing well,” said Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. That’s despite nearly 80,000 layoffs from at least 17 S&P 500 firms, including Amazon, UPS, and Target, since early September, data from Goldman Sachs showed. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index hit a three-year low in November. Its director, Joanne Hsu, said the drop hit across all age groups, income levels, and political leanings. There was one exception: people holding large stock portfolios. That group saw sentiment rise by 11%. Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said the top 40% of earners now hold 85% of the country’s wealth, and two-thirds of that wealth is tied directly to stocks. With equities up over 90% in the past three years, Lisa warned that “forecasting the labour market may increasingly be less important than forecasting the direction of the stock market itself in order to understand consumption levels.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Business|Amazon|Citigroup|Deutsche Bank'|Federal Reserve|Goldman Sachs|Google|JPMorgan|Microsoft|UPS|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-09 08:30:39

Key Takeaways: CZ said he was surprised by Trump’s pardon, insisting he never met or did business with the US president or his family. He claimed that Binance and World Liberty Finance have no connection, pushing back against speculation of financial ties to Trump-linked ventures. The pardon sparked political backlash, with Democratic lawmakers alleging a “pay-to-play” scheme. Speaking with Fox News on Friday , CZ said he had met Trump’s son, Eric, only once at the Bitcoin Middle East and North Africa conference in Abu Dhabi. “There is no business relationship between me, Binance, and World Liberty Finance,” CZ stated, dismissing speculation of financial ties to the Trump-linked crypto platform. CZ Says He ‘Did Not Know’ When Trump Pardon Would Happen CZ claimed that he was unaware of the pardon’s progress. “I did not know when or if it was going to happen. I believe my lawyers submitted the petition in April, and it took a few months. There was no indication of how far it went along. Then, it happened one day.” The pardon, granted in October, triggered strong political reactions. While many in the crypto community viewed it as a symbolic win for digital asset advocates after years of regulatory hostility, Democratic lawmakers condemned it as an act of political favoritism. CZ surprised by Trump's pardon,denying any business links to the Trump family On November 7 (EST),n an interview on FOX News'Special Report,Zhao Changpeng (CZ) said he was surprised by former President Trump's pardon and firmly denied allegations or rumors that he or Binance… pic.twitter.com/YQj0bNF6bz — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 8, 2025 During a post-pardon press conference, Trump said he didn’t personally know CZ but was told the case was “politically motivated.” “He had a lot of support, and they said that what he did is not even a crime,” Trump said. The decision has since become a flashpoint in Washington. Representative Maxine Waters accused Trump of a “pay-to-play” arrangement , claiming the pardon was tied to crypto-related investments funneled into Trump-affiliated ventures such as World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Several Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have called for an inquiry, sending an open letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging a review of the pardon process. Warren’s Lawyer Rejects CZ Defamation Threat As reported, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s lawyer has dismissed CZ’s threat of a defamation lawsuit , insisting her comments about his criminal conviction were factually correct and supported by public records. The dispute stems from an Oct. 23 post on X, where Warren criticized former President Donald Trump’s pardon of Zhao , calling it “corruption.” Zhao’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén, demanded a retraction, accusing Warren of damaging her client’s reputation. In response, Warren’s attorney, Ben Stafford, said any defamation claim would be “without merit,” emphasizing that Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance. Stafford clarified that Warren’s post did not claim Zhao was charged with direct money laundering, only that he broke AML laws – a statement “true in all respects,” he said. Warren also alleged that Zhao “financed Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon,” citing media reports linking Binance to the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, Binance is reportedly exploring ways to re-enter the US market following President Donald Trump’s pardon of CZ.

Key Takeaways: A US judge declared a mistrial in the landmark MEV fraud case against brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno. Prosecutors accused the pair of exploiting Ethereum’s validator layer, calling it “the first exploit of its kind.” However, the defence argued their actions followed the network’s internal rules. After three days of deliberation, a fatigued and divided jury forced U.S. District Judge Jessica Clarke to declare a mistrial on Friday. First-Ever MEV Criminal Case Targets Brothers Accused of Exploiting Ethereum The case against Anton and James Peraire-Bueno marked the first criminal prosecution centered on maximal extractable value (MEV), a practice where traders profit from how transactions are ordered on Ethereum. Prosecutors claimed the brothers went beyond normal MEV tactics, exploiting Ethereum’s validator layer to reorder transactions and siphon funds. The Department of Justice called it “the very first exploit of its kind,” accusing the pair of undermining “the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.” But the highly technical nature of the case and the challenge of fitting blockchain mechanics into traditional fraud statutes left jurors at an impasse. “We have debated with each member being open… We are no closer to a unanimous decision. We are under stress. Some cried. Many have not slept,” the jury wrote in their final note, according to Inner City Press . Prosecutors urged Judge Clarke to resume deliberations or replace a departing juror, but she refused. “This is their 11th note, no progress. I am going to declare a mistrial,” Clarke ruled. The government must now decide whether to retry the case, seek a plea deal, or dismiss the charges altogether. Tensions reportedly rose when prosecutors suggested that jurors could convict even if the defendants didn’t realize their actions were illegal, a claim the defence called “outrageous.” CRYPTO BROS TRIAL DAY 18: In Trial for Taking $25 Million from Ethereum Sandwich Bots, jury Day 3, note coming, after hypo – interim book here: https://t.co/68q2sSDFbB AMZN paperback Code Is Law (?) after verdict; Inner City Press will live tweet, thread below pic.twitter.com/lSXGjqBInI — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) November 7, 2025 The defence insisted intent, or mens rea, must be proven. Judge Clarke sided partly with prosecutors, telling jurors that “wrongful means a bad purpose” and that knowledge of illegality wasn’t required. Observers say the mistrial highlights the growing tension between crypto’s open architecture and legal interpretations of fraud. “This case was born of ignorance and fear,” wrote lawyer Carl E. Volz in DL News, calling it “a hangover from the Biden-era hyper-skepticism about crypto.” The brothers maintain they operated within Ethereum’s rules. Backed by Coin Center, their defence argues that punishing non-standard validation methods “recalibrates blockchain incentives” and risks destabilizing the system. Growing MEV Threat Challenges Blockchain Scalability MEV exploitation has emerged as a dominant threat to blockchain scalability, according to recent research from Flashbots. According to a report covered by Cryptonews in June, MEV bots now consume 40% of all blockspace on Solana and over half of the gas usage on Ethereum rollups, such as Base and OP Mainnet. The Peraire-Bueno case represents the first criminal prosecution of MEV manipulation; however, similar exploits continue to occur across various networks. A Ronin Network breach in August 2024 initially appeared malicious but was later revealed to be a white-hat operation, with the hacker returning $9.8 million after discovering a vulnerability in the bridge. Recent data from EigenPhi shows more than 81,000 users fell victim to sandwich attacks in the last 30 days alone.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s dominance is weakening, dropping over 5% since May, paving the way for an upcoming altcoin season. Analyst Matthew Hyland believes Bitcoin’s recent volatility may be influenced by Wall Street manipulation. Altcoin season remains elusive for now, with CoinMarketCap’s index still deep in “Bitcoin Season” territory. “The reason why you should have confidence in the altcoin price action is because the BTC Dominance chart looks bearish and has looked bearish for many weeks,” Hyland said in a post on X on Friday . “The downtrend is favorable to continue; therefore, this relief rally has been a dead cat bounce in a downtrend,” he added. Analyst Claims Wall Street May Be Behind Recent Bitcoin Volatility Hyland also suggested that Bitcoin’s recent volatility might not be entirely organic. In a video shared Saturday, he argued that Wall Street institutions could be behind the market swings. “Over the past month, I’ve kind of just maintained the view that a lot of this was really just manipulation, essentially for Wall Street to set themselves up,” he said. Bitcoin’s dominance, the share of total crypto market capitalization held by BTC, has dropped 5.13% since May and now sits at 59.90%, according to TradingView data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency recently slipped below $100,000 for the first time in four months before recovering to $102,090 at press time, per CoinMarketCap. Despite the modest rebound, Bitcoin has fallen 15.6% over the past 30 days, keeping sentiment subdued across the broader market. The reason why you should have confidence in the Alt coin price action is because the #BTC Dominance chart looks bearish and has looked bearish for many weeks The downtrend is favorable to continue therefore this relief rally has been a dead cat bounce in a downtrend: https://t.co/QgduZZ3Qxq pic.twitter.com/5RlgY3CRG2 — Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) November 8, 2025 CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index currently stands at 28 out of 100, well within “Bitcoin Season” territory, signaling that capital is still concentrated around BTC. The last time the index flipped into “Altcoin Season” was on Oct. 8, shortly after Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $125,100. However, the optimism faded quickly following the Oct. 10 crash, which erased $19 billion in leveraged positions and sparked a shift toward safer assets. Some analysts believe the next altcoin season will look very different from the euphoric runs of 2017 and 2021. For now, traders are watching closely to see whether Bitcoin’s dominance continues to fall, a trend that could set the stage for a long-awaited, but more selective, altcoin rally. JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $170K Within a Year JPMorgan analysts expect Bitcoin to climb to around $170,000 within six to twelve months, citing the completion of the perpetual futures deleveraging phase and improved volatility dynamics relative to gold. The bank’s strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted that Bitcoin markets have largely stabilized following the October 10 liquidation event, the largest in crypto history, and a smaller wave triggered by the $128 million Balancer exploit. In their Wednesday note, analysts said open interest in Bitcoin perpetual futures has returned to historical norms, signaling the end of excess leverage. “The message from the recent stabilization is that deleveraging in perpetual futures is likely behind us,” the team wrote, adding that ETF redemptions remain modest compared to prior inflows. They identified perpetual futures as the key gauge of crypto market health rather than traditional futures or ETF activity. JPMorgan’s bullish projection is also based on Bitcoin’s improving volatility ratio against gold, which has fallen below 2.0. The bank calculated that to align with private-sector gold investments, valued at about $6.2 trillion, Bitcoin’s market cap would need to rise roughly 67%, implying a fair value near $170,000.

Writer and analyst Adam Livingston, who has also utilized the BTC power law –that places it at a “fair value” at $142k – has suggested investors will likely see a rise in the asset soon. Based on the long-term power-law model of Bitcoin price growth, there remains considerable potential energy in this asset, and it is poised like a “coiled spring” to unleash upside rather than risk to the downside. Rebel analyst and writer Adam Livingston, a proponent of both BTC and the power law, which suggests that BTC’s “fair value” is closer to $142,000, believes that prices are likely to rise. The upper-band price for the leading cryptocurrency by December 31, 2025, is projected to be approximately $512,000, while the fair-value price is around $142,000, with the low end of the range coming in just north of the $50,000 level, according to Livingston . The fact that price has been “hugging” the fair value line since March 2024 is rare and indicative of an imminent explosion higher for Bitcoin, Livingston said. Historically speaking, he noted that whenever Bitcoin achieved its current level versus the long-term power-law, it either experienced a major surge due to being undervalued or had a short dip below this band before rallying to make moves even stronger. Bitcoin market shows resilience amid sell-offs Bitcoin has seen huge price fluctuations this year, including several steep trading liquidations and a severe plunge last month that dropped the value below the closely followed benchmark of $100,000. That tumble shook investor confidence and led to steep cuts in price forecasts throughout the industry. On an aggregated fund flow basis, ETP Institutionals have been receiving incoming flows over the last few weeks. Miners, whose break-evens have just doubled with the most recent halving, are choosing to hold more of their mined Bitcoin as opposed to selling on the open market – a sign often indicative of future price appreciation. In the meantime, there were nearly all-time highs for long-term holders, a sign of accumulation rather than exodus activity. Analysts said the recent selloff had not provoked widespread panic selling and noted that the market appeared to be showing tendencies toward patient positioning instead. But not everyone is convinced we’re headed for a rally. Contacted after October’s sell-off and a subsequent turn in market sentiment to risk-off, some of the big banks have updated their projections. With market dynamics continuing to mature and new investment narratives emerging, Galaxy has adjusted its end-of-2025 price prediction from $180,000 to $120,000. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest also cut its long-term estimate, slashing around $300k off the prior target. Wood pointed to the increased use of stablecoins as digital stores of value in emerging market countries — a role Bitcoin once occupied. Stablecoins, which replicate the U. S. dollar on a blockchain, have gained popularity in countries experiencing high inflation, currency instability, or banking crises. Wood argues that this has stifled grassroots demand for Bitcoin as a form of “digital cash” in war zones. Market swings between fear and confidence The gap between power-law-like models and their more cautious counterparts reflects a broader tension within the market. Y et long-term Bitcoin accumulation continues. Major mining companies are consolidating and doubling down on their investments as global regulatory clarity has improved. And Bitcoin’s macro backdrop, including the sovereign debt clouds and long-term inflationary pressures, is also supportive of its bullish narrative as a hedge. Livingston argues that similar dynamics have occurred in history before. For now, the market remains subdued, but the underlying tension is building — and the “spring” that never fully released in 2020 appears to be coiling once more.

The message focuses on how Ripple has positioned itself in alignment with this global financial messaging standard since the beginning of its development strategy. The attached video features Pegah Soltani, Head of Payments Products at Ripple, who provides detailed commentary on the importance of ISO 20022 and Ripple’s role in the broader evolution of payment infrastructure.

She notes that systems in Europe and the United States use different messaging methods, which results in isolated payment networks that do not operate seamlessly with one another. Soltani adds that the data transmitted between these systems lacks depth and structure, often leading to processes that require manual correction. According to her, these conditions contribute to inefficient transaction handling and an overall unsatisfactory experience for payment users. Importance of ISO 20022 Implementation Soltani describes ISO 20022 as a global standard designed to unify the exchange of financial information. She states that it promotes interoperability across payment networks, streamlines transaction processes, and enables the transfer of richer, more structured data. She further explains that the standard can increase competition because it is open and adaptable. Within this framework, institutions can communicate more consistently, reducing operational complexity and improving the reliability of cross-border financial activity . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Early Alignment and Security Commitments According to Soltani, Ripple aligned with ISO 20022 from the outset, based on an internal understanding that the industry would shift in this direction. She emphasizes that Ripple acted early in contributing to the shaping of the payment standards through participation in related governance bodies. Soltani also highlights Ripple’s commitment to security, noting that the company holds SOC 2 certification. This certification assures users of the company’s approach to security, privacy, and data handling standards. She also mentions that Ripple has achieved SOC 2 Type 2 status, which demonstrates that its practices have been consistently maintained over time rather than merely put in place. SMQKE’s post highlights Ripple’s position on ISO 20022 and its long-term strategy in modernizing global payment infrastructure. The commentary from Soltani outlines the challenges of current systems, the benefits of standardized messaging, and the company’s ongoing adherence to security requirements. The remarks align with Ripple’s broader messaging around efficiency and interoperability in cross-border financial operations.

Some agencies (like ICODA) offer per-placement packages for faster visibility. How can a PR campaign success be measured? Beyond article counts, focus on syndication reach, traffic, and engagement. Agencies like Outset PR quantify these through analytics-driven tools to ensure transparency.

CRCL's Q3 is expected to be strong, driven by robust USDC growth and high interest income, but future rate cuts may limit upside. The launch of Arc blockchain and a potential National Trust Bank license are key long-term catalysts for diversification beyond interest income. Options market shows bullish sentiment for CRCL, but high volatility and crypto market uncertainty keep near-term risks elevated. Following one of the most hyped IPOs of 2025, Circle Internet Group (CRCL) has retraced since the post-IPO high of $298, now trading around $100. At this point, Circle's valuation has come full circle. In a run-up to the Q3 earnings report next week (before market open November 12), CRCL is worth a revisit. I last covered CRCL around the IPO and leaned towards a more cautious Hold rating. The IPO was already richly valued, and the stock price priced in much of the optimism; hence, caution was warranted. Circle’s main business is tied to issuing and managing USD-backed stablecoins and its reserve. USD-backed stablecoins received some policy attention earlier this year, with the stablecoin regulatory bill moving through Congress. The current government shutdown in the U.S. seems to have stalled that progress a bit, as there are more pressing matters. So are stablecoins back in focus or losing momentum? And what’s the traction for USDC ( USDC-USD ), Circle’s flagship product, been like? Not forgetting Circle’s interest income from reserves and expansion into a payment infrastructure, and how close to profitability Circle could be. What to Expect in Circle’s Q3 Result Q2 was a strong beat for Circle, and Q3 guidance was optimistic as of the time Q2 earnings were released back in August. The recent drop in CRCL stock price is not due to a single piece of negative news. I see it as a consequence of some profit-taking from IPO investors while the stock is still finding its ""true"" intrinsic value. There is also likely some effect from the 25 bps Fed rate cut last month. Circle had some interesting updates that could be the tailwinds in the near term, and some of the updates in Q3 advanced Circle on its roadmap to becoming an infrastructure provider for the internet of money. Beyond the fresh updates (which we’ll touch on down the line), Circle's stablecoin products USDC and EURC saw continued growth in Q3. Q3 was generally a good quarter for the stablecoins market compared to what Q4 is shaping up to be so far - we are halfway into Q4, and USDC circulating supply has only grown by ~2.9%. Total stablecoin trading volume reached $10.3 trillion in Q3 (the most active quarter for stablecoins since Q2 2021). The total stablecoins market grew by 18.3% and reached $287.6 billion in market cap, thus providing a new wave of liquidity for Circle to capture, and USDC reached 73.7 billion in circulating supply as of Q3 end, growing by ~21% in the quarter; USDC circulating supply was ~61.8 billion as of the start of Q3. The USDC circulating supply is currently 75.9 billion, with a fair value of assets held in USDC reserves at $76.2 billion. I expect the growth in USDC supply value in Q3 to be a direct driver of the expected Q3 earnings beat; the massive float earned interest throughout the high-rate quarter. Interest rates also worked in Circle’s favor. The Federal Reserve began a series of rate cuts since late Q3, but the average effective rate during Q3 stayed historically high, around an average of 4.3% in the quarter. That level, combined with USDC’s large reserve base, means Circle likely earned strong interest income through the quarter. Coinbase ( COIN ), a beneficiary of USDC yields, reported that the average USDC balances held across its products rose to an all-time high of $15 billion, which drove its stablecoin revenue to $355 million in Q3. Even as rates eased slightly in September, the high average rate from July to September kept yields on Circle’s reserve assets elevated, positioning Q3 as another strong period for net interest income growth. Previous Circle’s filings show reserve income drives most of the revenue (over 90% of the top line), so a high average rate and a massive float likely pushed net interest income higher in Q3. At this juncture, it is becoming necessary for Circle to develop a more diversified stream of revenue and shield the whole business from interest rate sensitivity. The launch of Arc blockchain testnet is an important step in this strategy. Circle is building Arc to be an open Layer-1 blockchain network purpose-built for enterprise-grade economic activity, designed to be stablecoin-native, and using USDC for gas fees instead of a volatile native token like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). The predictable dollar-based fees remove a major barrier for institutional adoption. Circle will potentially generate steady non-interest revenue from fees from the volume of payments, FX, and capital markets transactions processed on Arc, and service fees for developer services, custody, and specialized institutional products built on top of the Arc blockchain. Institutions, including Apollo ( APO ), Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ), and Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ), have already been onboarded on the testnet phase. While the launch of Arc testnet isn't an immediate catalyst for the Q3 results, and any meaningful financial impact from Arc can only be expected from next year when the mainnet launches and adoption takes shape, it is still worth mentioning because it could also shape future sentiment and valuation, as the market seems to be discounting CRCL based on future interest income and the anticipated rate cuts. Despite what I'd call an excellent Q3 and a likely earnings beat, CRCL could still not gain much on a Q3 earnings beat since the Fed has signaled the likelihood of more rate cuts ahead. The market seems to be putting a forward discount on CRCL - and rightly so, since the bulk of the top line still relies on interest earned from the short-dated treasury securities in reserve. CRCL’s drawdown is still a judgement call for each individual investor. On the surface, the current market cap of ~24 billion appears low to Circle’s assets and may suggest undervaluation. But remember that Circle is basically a stablecoin issuer, and most of the over $70 billion in assets are encumbered (held in trust). The USDC in circulation are liabilities. This is why Circle's liabilities almost match its assets. For investors with a longer-term view, I believe the launch of Arc and the National Trust Bank license approval ( Circle has already applied to the OCC for this license, and if that eventually sees approval) would be the more crucial long-term catalysts. In the near term, market data suggests CRCL still has fuel for a potential rebound. Total options open interest [OI] shows calls outweighing puts. Implied volatility is high for the short-term contracts (expiring this month), as traders are anticipating a big move (in either direction) as Q3 earnings approach. OptionCharts Open Interest by Strike chart (November 14th, 21st, and 28th expiries) shows bullish positioning for upside as the volume skews towards calls. The highest concentration of OI is a massive spike in November 21st calls. At the $125 strike (~40k contracts). The skew towards calls shows traders are expecting an upside, but the high overall volatility means risks remain heightened if Q3 earnings disappoint or Q4 earnings become softer than expected. There is also a lot of speculation going on here, as we can see an outlier and so far out-of-the-money call at the $350 strike with ~35k OI. It's tough to decide on CRCL at this juncture. Its valuation is tied to a lot of variables, including the crypto market momentum, which seems to be losing steam these days since Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $126k about a month ago. While CRCL drawdown presents a potential entry point, the risks remain heightened, and caution is still warranted.",USDC-USD|CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|USDC|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-09 09:33:20

Cardano's Price Holds Steady, Eyes on Potential Breakout Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) currently sits between 57 and 67 cents, showing some stability. Despite recent drops, losing about 11% over the week and 35% this month, it demonstrates potential for a comeback. The nearest resistance level is at 74 cents, and if surpassed, Cardano could aim for 84 cents. This rise would mean a boost of about a quarter from its current position. However, support at 52 cents is crucial to hold for any upward trend to solidify. Cardano's market indicators are neutral, with the Relative Strength Index close to 50. If momentum shifts, Cardano could potentially see a significant bounce. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Conclusion ADA faces a key moment as its price approaches an important support level. The coin's performance will be closely monitored in the coming days. A break below this level may signal further declines. Conversely, holding steady could present an opportunity for a rebound. The market is engaging closely. The trajectory in the near term remains pivotal to watch. ADA’s next move will likely influence broader market sentiment. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin price for 2026,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-price-for-2026/,"Author Robert Kiyosaki has made a bold prediction for alternative assets, noting that commodities such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) are likely to surpass the $200,000 mark in 2026. According to the Rich Dad Poor Dad author, Bitcoin could potentially reach $250,000 by 2026, reaffirming his long-standing support for the maiden cryptocurrency despite his repeated warnings of an impending market crash. In an X post on November 9, Kiyosaki outlined his forecasts for key assets while reiterating his distrust in traditional monetary systems. Alongside Bitcoin’s surge to a quarter of a million dollars, he expects gold to climb to $27,000 and silver to hit $100 within the same period. All three assets have maintained a bullish run throughout 2025. My target price for Gold is $27k. I began buying gold in 1971….the year Nixon took gold from the US Dollar. My target price for Bitcoin is $250 k in 2026. Silver $100 in 2026,” Kiyosaki said. Kiyosaki on printing of money He said his bullish stance on these assets is grounded in what he called “the laws of money,” including Gresham’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law. Kiyosaki criticized the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve for excessive money printing, describing the U.S. as the “biggest debtor nation in history.” “Unfortunately the US Treasury and Fed break the laws. They print fake money to pay their bills. If you and I did what the Fed and Treasury are doing…. We would be in jail for breaking the laws,” he added. According to him, the continuous expansion of the money supply undermines the dollar’s value and reinforces the need to hold scarce, decentralized assets such as Bitcoin. He emphasized that his investment strategy favors hard assets like gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, particularly during downturns, as a hedge against what he views as systemic economic mismanagement. Overall, in recent years, the financial educator has repeatedly warned of an impending broad-based market crash that, in his view, could affect stocks, bonds, real estate, and even traditional safe-haven assets. He has advised investors to anticipate such a crash and be ready to accumulate gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum when prices dip. For example, he previously said that “bubbles are about to start busting… when bubbles burst, odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too,” adding that any such decline would represent a buying opportunity. Kiyosaki market crash track record However, Kiyosaki’s track record with predictions has drawn criticism. A review of his market calls shows that only around 10% of his forecasts since 2022 have materialized as anticipated. Robert Kiyosaki’s past market crash prediction. Source: Mark McGrath Some of his more alarmist predictions, such as a “giant stock market crash” in October 2021 or a broad-based collapse in 2022, did not unfold as predicted, with markets instead showing resilience or modest gains. Analysts also note contradictions in his outlooks, such as warning that Bitcoin was overvalued one week and later urging investors to buy more. Featured image via Ben Shapiro’s YouTube The post R.

Thorn announced that he has lowered his year-end Bitcoin price target to $120,000, having previously set it at $185,000. This revision was made following “boundless optimism” at the beginning of the year, amidst market liquidity constraints and economic uncertainty in recent weeks. While Galaxy Digital's head of research noted that Bitcoin could regain momentum soon, he noted that current investor interest has shifted to other sectors. Thorn explained that investors are currently focusing on areas like artificial intelligence (AI), nuclear energy, quantum technology, and gold, which has temporarily dampened interest in Bitcoin. Related News: Bitcoin Predictions from Bloomberg Analyst McGlone: “By Monday Morning...” Thorn expressed his belief that interest will eventually return to Bitcoin, as it always has. Despite the downgrade, Alex Thorn remains positive about Bitcoin's long-term outlook. He believes the market is entering a more mature phase, and the distribution from large Bitcoin holders to new investors is solidifying the asset's base and laying a healthy foundation for a future uptrend. *This is not investment advice.

Although Ethereum (ETH) shows signs of having bright, long-term futures prospects through substantial whale buying during its ongoing correction, its road towards its estimated value of $10,000 may be longer than expected. By stark contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering blisteringly fast, explosion-like growth through its soon-to-be-concluded presale and doing more than just offering altcoin potential, as it has already proven itself as the best cryptocurrency to buy today. Ethereum’s Gradual Path At present, Ethereum is facing a serious price correction, and its price is testing essential support areas at around $2,800. It is pertinent to note that this price correction has led to massive accumulation by institutional investors, and whales have been accumulating more than 323,523 ETH, amounting to about $1.12 billion. Experts have explained this trend as an essential market correction and that it may be followed by a price rally. But this is more of a long-term market trend and is based on complex market structures and a successful recovery from essential support levels. As of now, investors searching for ‘the next crypto that will explode’ would find that, despite its fundamental correctness, this market is not immediate and is based on market catalysts like new projects that are currently on a roll. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making headlines through its presale trend that highlights its emergence as a powerful new crypto asset. Mutuum Finance has already managed to raise $18,500,000 from its strong community of holders, of which there are as many as 17,810, thereby indicating fanatical market belief and faith in this new crypto asset and project as a whole. Presently, this presale has reached its critical point, such that Phase 6 is currently 85% fulfilled at a price of just $0.035. Phase 6 is, quite literally, the final and last chance that market participants have of buying into this new asset at this price point and price range. Since Phase 7 is due for activation, this will automatically ushered in a price boost of 20% as its price is set at just $0.040 per asset. Adding to this sense of investment urgency is a significant platform upgrade from the Mutuum Finance team itself. Investors can now buy MUTM tokens via their debit or credit cards, meaning they don’t have to deal with investing hurdles as before. Such easy incorporation of common payment systems quickens the investment process, and new investors can easily get on board before the impending price increment. Stablecoins and The V1 Protocol The historic presale success is, at its core, fueled by the pioneering technical roadmap of Mutuum Finance. It has been announced that its V1 protocol will launch on Sepolia testnet within Q4 of 2025, signifying its entry into the world of a tangible, operable loan and borrowing system, as opposed to mere ideation and proof of concept. Among its most prominent features will be the implementation of its novel, decentralized stablecoin that is, for its part, secured exclusively by overcollateralized resources aggregated directly from its native loan system, providing for a strongly anchored and transparent link to the value of the U.S. dollar itself and thereby anchoring its value proposition within its sector of deFi and crypto generally. There is overwhelming proof of Mutuum Finance’s pending explosion on its horizon. With a presale phase that is close to being sold out, its revolutionary stablecoin design, and its ability to buy through credit cards, this is one of most compelling investment opportunities that has ever existed on this platform or any other platform that deals in cryptocurrencies on any market cycle that has existed on this or any other platform that is available today. While Ethereum has plans that lead towards a future, Mutuum Finance is actually providing tangible growth and innovation through its lucrative plans on this market cycle today on this platform that has otherwise only provided limited success through its former offerings until today on this platform that is actually providing tangible growth on this market cycle today. This is through this investment that is set on its pending horizon through its overwhelming plans that are about its future today on this platform that is ushering its birth on this market cycle through this extraordinary, lucrative, and unparalleled offering on this platform that is actually providing.

Amid this price decline, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs suffered a similar tumultuous fate, registering a net outflow of over $1 billion. Bitcoin ETFs See $1.28B In Net Withdrawals As Price Struggles Persist According to data from SoSovalue , capital outflows of 12 Bitcoin ETFs reached $558.4 million on Friday, taking total net outflows in the first week of November to $1.28 billion. This development indicates significant caution among institutional investors as Bitcoin strives to find price stability. The largest outflows of the week came from BlackRock’s IBIT, which suffered net withdrawals of $580.98 million. The investment fund now holds net assets of $82.28 billion, accounting for 3.97% of the total Bitcoin market cap. Fidelity’s FBTC also suffered the heavy brunt of investors’ fear as net outflows climbed to $438.30 million. However, with cumulative net inflows of $12 billion, FBTC still remains the second-best performing Bitcoin spot ETF. Other market players with significant performances include Ark Invest ’s ARKB and Grayscale’s GBTC, which recorded net capital drain of $128.92 million and $64.33 million, respectively. Meanwhile, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC suffered negative cash flow losses ranging $8 million – $13 million. Interestingly, Bitwise ’s BITB and Grayscale’s BTC produced the net inflows of the week valued at $4.69 million and $21.61 million, respectively. However, Invesco’s BTCO, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI all recorded zero netflow, despite heavy market activity. At press time, the Bitcoin spot ETFs now report a net outflow of $1.22 billion for November. Nevertheless, the cumulative total net inflow for the 12 investment funds is valued at $59.97 billion, as aggregated net assets drop to $138.08 billion by 6.5% from last week in October. BTC Price Overview At press time, Bitcoin trades at $101,901 after a 0.98% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 42.62% and valued at $53.58 billion. Following the intense price correction of the last week, the premier cryptocurrency is now 18.93% away from its all-time high of $126,198. Coincodex analysts predict a market recovery in the next five days, tipping BTC to hit $129,442.

54196950,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89003,1762682425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Why Experts Are Switching From Solana (SOL) to This Cheap DeFi Crypto,https://timestabloid.com/why-experts-are-switching-from-solana-sol-to-this-cheap/,"The crypto market is going through a shift. Investors are now focusing on projects that have real-world purpose instead of pure hype. While Solana (SOL) remains popular for its fast transactions, many experts are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is introducing a fresh approach to decentralized finance that focuses on lending, borrowing, and stable liquidity. With the presale in Phase 6 and the token price at $0.035, experts describe it as one of the most promising crypto to buy now before the next stage moves higher. A Dual Lending Model That Changes How DeFi Works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised about $18.6 million so far, showing strong market interest. Over 17,800 holders have already joined, and Phase 6 is almost complete with 87% of its 170 million token supply taken. As it steps into Phase 7, the price will rise by 15% to $0.040. This growing traction reflects how many investors see the project as a valuable alternative in a time when some assets are slowing after the last crypto crash. The biggest difference between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and older projects is its two-part lending design. This model will give users more choice and control in how they lend or borrow digital assets. The first part, Peer-to-Contract lending, will allow users to deposit assets such as ETH or USDT into automated smart contracts. These contracts will manage loans, interest, and repayments. In return, users will receive mtTokens, which will show their share in the pool and earn yield. These mtTokens can also be used inside the ecosystem to expand their opportunities. The second part, Peer-to-Peer lending, will let users create direct loan deals with other users. This feature will be ideal for people who prefer custom terms and want to lend or borrow niche tokens. By combining both systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will give investors flexibility while keeping the process fully transparent. The protocol’s first version is planned for the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. It will introduce smart components such as the Liquidity Pool, Debt Token, mtToken system, and Liquidator Bot. In this stage, users will have the ability to lend, borrow, and place ETH or USDT as collateral to support their positions. Launching V1 on testnet first gives users a chance to explore how the protocol works before the mainnet release. This early phase encourages community involvement, builds confidence through transparency, and helps generate momentum. Increased user participation and interest over time can also contribute to rising demand and reinforce the long-term value of MUTM. The Stablecoin Layer and Transparent Price System Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also working on a stablecoin that will act as the center of its economy. This coin will stay pegged to $1 and will only be minted when users borrow by locking collateral such as ETH. Once the borrower repays or gets liquidated, the stablecoin will be burned. This rule will keep the supply balanced and protect the value of every token inside the system. The stablecoin will not depend on outside supply or algorithmic tricks. Its interest rate will be controlled through Mutuum’s governance system to hold the peg. When demand pushes its price above $1, borrowing costs will go down, and when it drops below $1, the rate will rise. This mechanism will ensure constant balance and predictable value flow. The stablecoin will also be used in both P2C and P2P markets, creating a steady cycle of lending, borrowing, and reward distribution. The stablecoin will function as the core asset within Mutuum Finance’s P2C and P2P lending environments, enabling continuous lending activity and maintaining liquidity circulation throughout the protocol. Because stablecoins are viewed as a fundamental pillar of DeFi, a robust, overcollateralized design could help support strong and lasting demand for MUTM. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will further enhance safety by using Chainlink’s oracle feeds. These oracles will track accurate market prices for all supported assets, such as ETH, SOL, or AVAX. If a main feed fails, backup feeds or decentralized exchange averages will replace it. This setup will make pricing accurate, protect users from unfair liquidations, and keep confidence high. With transparent prices and reliable automation, the protocol will appeal to both individual investors and institutions looking for safer ways to lend and earn in DeFi. Exchange Listing Possibility and Long-Term Strength Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining a strong reputation as a value-driven DeFi project. Analysts expect that once the presale ends, the project will attract attention from major exchange platforms. The blend of stablecoin utility, smart lending, and verified audit data makes it a strong candidate for Tier-1 and Tier-2 listings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already completed a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. Its Bug Bounty Program of $50,000 adds another layer of safety, rewarding users for finding system vulnerabilities before launch. These steps prove the team’s commitment to security and transparency, which are both rare among early-stage projects. Experts now view Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the new benchmark for practical DeFi growth. Unlike speculative assets that rise and fall with market hype, this project is building something that will keep creating on-chain activity. The ongoing presale shows rising participation each week, and with the next phase’s price increase ahead, many investors are locking in their entries early. For those looking for the next crypto to buy now after the last crypto crash, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a fresh start. It blends the lessons learned from older networks like Solana (SOL) with real improvements that bring value to users. As 2025 unfolds, the combination of stablecoin integration, lending innovation, and exchange visibility will push MUTM into the spotlight as one of the most exciting DeFi stories of the year.

However, an exciting on-chain evaluation predicts a positive price action in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Launch Recovery To $120,000 If This Condition Holds – Details Bitcoin Price Below Average Cost — Details On November 8, popular market analyst Burak Kesmeci shared on X the underlying reasons behind his expectations of a bullish reversal. Kesmeci’s post mostly depends on the Bitcoin: 90-Day Market Price vs Realized Price Gradient Oscillator. Essentially, this indicator functions as a means of tracking the distance of Bitcoin’s market price deviation from its realized price over the past 90 days. A positive reading from the metric indicates a faster rising market price of Bitcoin, compared to its average cost basis (realized price), thereby showing growing bullish momentum. A negative reading, on the other hand, connotes a significant decline of market price beneath realized price, a sign of bearish momentum, which could extend into a ‘cooling’ phase. In the post on X, Kesmeci reveals that the metric’s reading has fallen to a value of -1.27 STDV (Standard Deviations). As previously explained, this indicates that the Bitcoin price has greatly fallen beneath its historical cost basis, a development that could point out that the flagship cryptocurrency’s price momentum has reached a state of ‘extreme cooldown.’ Expressed more simply, Bitcoin investors are paying much less than the amount its recent buyers did on average to acquire Bitcoin. If more investors were to purchase Bitcoin around its current price, there could be a total or significant absorption of what already appears to be exhausted bearish pressure. Notably, Kemesci also referenced past occurrences to buttress his prediction of an imminent price rebound. According to the analyst, periods where this metric fell below -1 STDV have often preceded the ends of downtrends and the beginnings of price expansions. We see this occurrence twice in recent months: first, in April, where Bitcoin saw a rise from about $82,000 to $100,000; and second, where the price saw a growth from $108,000 in July to reach $124,000. Thus, if historical data is reliable, the Bitcoin price could soon put in a new price bottom, after which significant movement to the upside would likely follow.

The email, which includes what appears to be an official notice labeled “Your 2025 Social Security Record Is Now Available,” falsely claims to provide a downloadable statement. However, the message is a phishing attempt designed to deceive recipients into clicking on malicious links or downloading infected files. WARNING This email is from the Philippines. Do not EVER click on a link or download a PDF. They are full of viruses. Carry on… pic.twitter.com/i8GOjvldhC — James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) November 7, 2025 Details of the Fake Communication The images shared by James Rule XRP show an email that mimics the legitimate formatting of the Social Security Administration’s official correspondence. It includes the SSA logo, formal language, and a “Download My Statement” button, alongside a footer referencing the Bureau of Internal Revenue. However, upon closer inspection, the sender’s email address reveals the deception. The email originates from “ebirforms-noreply@bir.gov.ph,” a Philippine government domain unrelated to the U.S. Social Security Administration. This foreign domain is the most critical indicator that the email is not authentic. According to James Rule XRP, recipients should never click links or download files from such messages, as they often contain malware or viruses intended to steal personal or financial information. The Importance of Caution in Digital Communication Phishing attacks remain one of the most common cyber threats. It often relies on fake government or financial institution emails to trick unsuspecting individuals. These fraudulent messages can lead to identity theft, data breaches, and economic losses. By mimicking trusted entities like the SSA, scammers increase the likelihood that recipients will engage with their content. James Rule XRP’s warning serves as a timely reminder for individuals—particularly those involved in crypto and online finance—to remain vigilant about potential scams. Even emails that appear legitimate can contain subtle inconsistencies, such as unusual sender addresses or prompts to download files. Verifying Authentic Communications The Social Security Administration has stated that it does not send unsolicited emails containing links or requests to download documents. Legitimate SSA communications are typically sent via official government domains ending in “.gov” and direct users to log in through secure, known websites.

In October, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, also cautioned the community about a sharp rise in phishing attempts targeting hardware wallet users . Schwartz noted that many of these scams involve deceptive emails impersonating legitimate wallet providers, instructing recipients to carry out supposed security upgrades or verification steps. He stressed that such messages should never be trusted unless their authenticity is confirmed directly through official support channels. As cybersecurity risks continue to evolve, James Rule XRP’s cautionary message underscores the need for users to verify the authenticity of any digital correspondence before taking action. Protecting personal information and exercising restraint when interacting with unsolicited emails remains essential to maintaining security in the digital era.

The suspect, Chetan Gangani, was arrested by operatives for his involvement in a cybercrime operation that funneled funds to the digital wallet. According to authorities, the arrest is part of an ongoing effort to crack down on mule bank accounts. Cybercriminals use mule bank accounts to move criminal proceeds, using multiple accounts in most cases, so they can obfuscate the origin and destination of the funds. In most cases, these usually happen before the funds are moved out of the country through digital wallets or by any other means. However, in this case, the suspect tried to move the funds out of the country using a digital wallet. Indian police arrest a suspect for money laundering According to the Indian police, the suspect was affiliated with six other arrested persons. While his arrest was recent, the others had been apprehended on November 3 as part of a string operation by authorities in the region. The operation spanned locations like Morbi, Surendranagar, Surat, and Amreli districts. The group was accused of allegedly routing Rs. 200 crore to criminals based in Dubai using more than 100 mule accounts. The police claimed that the Indian national allegedly helped the gang members convert Rs. Crore into different digital assets or USDT and then sent it to the digital wallet based in Pakistan. Gangani used his BitGet crypto wallet to send the money, using the application to send funds for over four months. Officials claimed that the Pakistan-based wallet receiving the funds had a balance of Rs. 29 crore, of which Rs. 10 crore was from Gujarat. The police mentioned that the criminals gave him a commission of 0.10% on every USDT he sent to the wallet. They alleged that the other persons held in connection with the crime also provided more than 100 mule accounts to the cybercriminals, limiting their operations to Gujarat. They claimed that the accounts were used in 386 cases, including digital arrests, task frauds, investment frauds, loan frauds, and part-time job scams. Police dismantle fraud network Speaking about the arrest, Harsh Sanghavi, deputy chief minister of Gujarat, mentioned that the CID crime division had cracked down on a major cross-border cybercrime network. “In a major breakthrough, the Gujarat Cyber Crime Center of Excellence has dismantled a large-scale ‘Mule Account’ network operating across multiple districts, including Morbi, Surendranagar, Surat, and Savarkundla, with direct financial links traced to Pakistan,” he said in his statement. Sanghavi mentioned that the cybercrime division of the Indian police carefully tracked the money trails through several layers. He mentioned that the criminals were smart, but the division was able to discover the Indian accounts that the funds originated from, linking them to the USDT transactions. “The probe revealed the transfer of Rs. 10 crore to a Pakistani Binance USDT account, which has accumulated over Rs. 25 crore from Indian accounts and this gang being one of the major sources,” he added. Over the past few months, residents and stakeholders have called on the government, seeking clarity on how it intends to regulate digital assets. The amount of illicit activities being carried out in the space has increased in that time frame, with these criminals targeting innocent citizens. To curb these illicit activities, India would need to move swiftly to create regulations that would safeguard investors in the crypto market, giving them a safe space to carry out their activities.

Merrin was arrested and charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception after officers began an investigation into the complaint late last year. The police alleged that the former Penrith Panthers and St George Illawarra Dragons Star stole $91,000 in crypto from his former teammate Kade Ellis, according to reports. Now, Merin and his lawyer, Paul McGirr, have hit back at the allegations. According to Merrin, he had paid the former teammate seven times what he invested in the cryptocurrency scheme. Former football star arrested for crypto theft According to reports , Ellis informed the police about the allegations almost a year ago after Merrin convinced him to invest in digital assets in 2021. He claimed Merrin had the password to the Bitcoin wallet where the funds were kept, a development that allowed him to access the funds at will. Officers claim they have also seized several electronic devices from Merrin’s property during the raid, and each of them will be analyzed by their forensic experts. Merrin was arrested and taken to Lake Illawarra Police Station, where the charges were brought against him. In his statement, Merrin’s lawyer mentioned that he intends to defend these allegations vigorously, noting that as a successful businessman with an impeccable record, it is important to fight the charges. “Not only did he make a full, documented payment to this alleged victim, but that payment was seven times the initial investment,” he said. McGirr also mentioned that details to prove his client’s claims will be ‘revealed in the court case’. “An agreement was made [between Merrin and Ellis], but unfortunately, none of it was in writing,” McGirr claimed. “As I stress for all business deals, it is always important to have contracts in writing – unfortunately, that wasn’t the case in this instance.” However, the report states that police have allegedly traced some of the money to an account for Merrin’s Freeze Yourself ice bath business. The former back-rower has been an active member of the crypto community since he retired in 2021, even describing himself sometimes as a ‘cryptocurrency enthusiast’ on his LinkedIn bio. He was granted conditional bail ahead of an appearance at the Port Kembla Local Court on December 3. Merrin first made headlines in 2017 after announcing his split from his girlfriend of three years. The pair started dating in 2014 and were engaged by the following year. Ellis played nine matches for Penrith from 2018 to 2019, before moving on to play 18 for St George Illawarra over the next two years. He moved to Wigan Warriors in the Super League in 2022, representing the team 124 times. The versatile player won the grand final with the Warriors in 2023 and 2024, in addition to his victories in the 2022 and 2024 Challenge Cups. He also made 250 appearances for New South Wales and the Australian national team, earning honors for representing both.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most popular tokens, is currently facing a serious sale and has seen its price plummet towards critical support, and this has placed serious doubt on whether it can recover soon as a solid investment option. However, this weakness is actually offering serious premiums on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , one of the brightest and growing defi cryptos, while going against all market trends, as its presale is actually succeeding despite all odds and can be considered one of the best cryptos that can be purchased today. Shiba Inu Battles Increased Selling Momentum Shiba Inu is currently experiencing a strong bear market, as its market indicators display a very concerning trend. The large sale of one billion SHIB tokens within a span of only 24 hours has triggered a drastic fall, breaking down below the critical support of $0.000010 strongly. Technical indicators suggest that a death cross has been observed, as the price is marked by a fall below the 200-50 average, generally suggesting a strong trend of downfall. At present, as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 34.47 and soon entering the oversold region, it can be observed that currently, it is a very delicate period for it. The next support will be at $0.000009, breaking down which may lead to drastic falls again. Mutuum Finance – Capitalizing on Unwavering Presale Momentum Contrary to this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is being extremely resilient and is experiencing huge demand as well. Its presale is a huge success, having raised a staggering $18,500,000, and has managed to attain the support of 17,810 holders as well. Mutuum Finance has reached a crucial phase, as its Phase 6 is 85% subscribed at a price of just $0.035. This phase is the final chance at getting tokens at this price, as Phase 7 begins a price boost of nearly 20% to $0.040. All of this is done deliberately to encourage early supporters, putting them on target for big gains and securing MUTM as having the best cheap crypto to buy that can and should be purchased now before prices become inflated. Improved Accessibility & Daily Incentives Adding on to its appeal as an investment option, Mutuum Finance has created a seamless buying system that is going to enable investors to buy MUTM tokens through debit or credit cards, thereby ensuring that there are no technical hurdles that would prevent people from investing worldwide. Alongside this is a lively leaderboard system that runs on a 24-hour cycle, thereby ensuring that the community is engaged on a daily basis. Every day, one user who has made at least one trade and is ranked at the top of the leaderboard is awarded a bonus of $500 MUTM, and this cycle repeats every day at 00:00 UTC. This is an operation that will highlight an actual loaning system, boasting its native and over-collateralized stablecoin that is built to offer more stability to its ecosystem. It is this utility and generating sustainable revenue that sets MUTM truly apart as a defi crypto, as they have far more longevity than other crypto projects that run on hype rather than actual success and progress. Strategic Alternative is Clear There is an identifiable market dynamic at play, and that is that while Shiba Inu is facing problems of whale sales and lost technical supports, Mutuum Finance has a lot more going on for it, and that is based on solid proof of a near-complete presale phase and immediate financial rewards for supporters. And for any investor trying to identify the best cryptocurrencies that can be purchased today, one thing is clear. The time to get MUTM at a price of $0.035 is running out indefinitely, and this is currently the most optimal financial move for the big growth story coming down the road for cryptocurrencies.

In a joint statement following a meeting between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Australia’s Trade Minister Don Farrell in Melbourne, both sides are committed to finalizing their talks on an Economic Cooperation Agreement. The Indian Commerce Ministry emphasized that it is looking forward to implementing a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Australia. It noted, “The constructive discussions focused on unlocking the full potential of the India–Australia Economic Partnership.” India and Australia’s talks centered on the CECA framework During their recent meeting , the two also reviewed the progress made so far on the CECA framework. They discussed ways to enhance trade relations and economic cooperation in goods, services, and investment. The Indian government confirmed , “Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to work constructively towards the early conclusion of a balanced and mutually beneficial CECA, building on the foundation of the India–Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA), which entered into force in December 2022.” Originally, Canberra expected to get a trade deal with India by the end of 2023, building on the existing agreement. For FY25, the total trade volume between the two nations reached $24.1 billion, driven by a 14% increase in Indian exports in FY24 and an additional 8% rise in FY25. Goyal also held trade discussions in Auckland this week and stated on Friday that India and New Zealand are close to striking a free trade deal. Still, India has yet to resolve its tariff situation with the US. President Trump had earlier slapped 50% tariffs on Indian exports to the US, seeking leverage over New Delhi’s oil imports from Russia. However, more recently, the American president has insisted that negotiations with India are progressing well , and he plans to visit the Asian country in 2026. He claimed that India had largely reduced its oil purchases from Russia. Indian minister Goyal also met with business figures from the Indian diaspora to discuss trade and investment opportunities. India and Bahrain held discussions to strengthen their ties Bahrain and India reiterated on Monday their determination to further deepen defense and security cooperation. Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani and S. Jaishankar, the Minister of External Affairs of India, met to discuss their bilateral relations and future areas of collaboration. A joint statement said the two nations aim to expand trade in electronics, petroleum, processed food, base metals, and gems and jewelry. Additionally, the two governments strongly denounced all acts of terrorism, including the attack at Pahalgam on April 22. They pledged to fight against cross-border terrorism by working together on intelligence, cybersecurity, and technology collaboration, as well as increased cooperation among its members. They also initiated talks on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, or CEPA. In addition to this, the two countries agreed to commence discussions on a DTAA to avoid conflict of taxes, enhance fiscal transparency and promote the development of business. Jaishankar even claimed that signing a bilateral investment treaty, along with CEPA, will further strengthen economic relations; India also welcomes Bahraini investment in its market.

To this end, XRP may be entering a bullish reversal after a prolonged correction, as the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the daily chart, with confirmation possibly imminent, according to insights shared by Ali Martinez in an X post on November 8. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Notably, the TD Sequential indicator counts a series of price candles to identify when an asset is overextended or ready for a reversal. A completed nine-count in a downtrend often signals fading selling pressure and the potential for a rebound. XRP key price levels to watch According to the analysis, XRP appears to have established a temporary floor around the $2.20 to $2.25 range, where recent candles show signs of stabilization following a sharp decline from the $2.55–$2.60 zone earlier in November. Now, the emergence of the TD Sequential “2” candle suggests early confirmation of bullish momentum, with traders now watching for a decisive move above $2.35 to validate the setup. If buying pressure builds, XRP could retest resistance around $2.50, a former support level before the recent pullback. A breakout above it would reinforce the bullish outlook and signal a potential short-term recovery. Conversely, failure to confirm the signal could push the asset back toward support at $2.10–$2.00, where buyers are likely to step in. The technical outlook comes as the asset has suffered from significant whale selling, which has derailed its momentum toward $2.5. However, XRP remains backed by strong fundamentals. For instance, Ripple has raised $500 million in a new funding round led by Fortress Investment Group, Citadel Securities, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital, valuing the company at $40 billion. Following the news, XRP briefly surged 5.7% before paring gains amid broader market weakness. On the other hand, Ripple President Monica Long said the funding highlights the firm’s sustained growth and focus on expanding blockchain-based financial infrastructure. She ruled out any near-term IPO plans, citing strong liquidity and continued private ownership. XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.28, having dropped about 1.7% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, the asset is down over 10%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, XRP remains below both the 50-day SMA ($2.64) and 200-day SMA ($2.65), confirming short-term bearish pressure despite the longer-term uptrend remaining technically intact. The narrow $0.01 gap between the two SMAs signals weakening momentum and raises the risk of an impending death cross if selling persists.

Most larger-cap alts are well in the red on a daily basis as well, with ETH sliding beneath $3,400 and XRP slipping below $2.30. BTC Back Below $102K It was an eventful and painful week for the primary cryptocurrency that began with a nosedive on Monday. At the time, the asset was rejected at $111,000 and driven south to around $104,000. After a brief recovery attempt, the bears intervened once again on Tuesday and initiated another violent decline that this time saw BTC dumping below $100,000 for the first time since June. The asset bottomed (at least for now) at just under $99,000. It bounced off on Wednesday and spiked to $104,000, where it was stopped, and the subsequent retracement resulted in another slip to a five-digit price territory. The rebound attempt was similar as BTC spiked to $104,000 on Friday evening but couldn’t surpass that level and now sits below $102,000 again. It’s down by over 8% in the past week, and its market cap has tumbled to $2.020 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the altcoins was also harmed in the past seven days and is well below 58% as of press time. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XMR, ZEC Defy Crypto Correction Most larger-cap alts have followed BTC on the way south in the past 24 hours. Ethereum is below $3,400 again, while XRP has lost the $2.30 support. More painful declines come from the likes of DOGE, ADA, HYPE, LINK, XLM, and SUI. In contrast, the two largest privacy coins have stolen the show with double-digit gains. ZEC has risen by over 11% daily to almost $600, while XMR has tapped $420 after a 13% surge. ICP, the recent high-flyer, is down by more than 12% daily, while TAO has dumped by 6%.

As the United States faces the longest government shutdown in its history, financial markets continue to show signs of strain. The deadlock between Congress and the White House over federal funding has triggered widespread economic consequences, affecting liquidity, investor sentiment, and regulatory activity. In this climate, financial expert Levi Rietveld has expressed confidence that XRP could experience its largest rally to date once the government resumes full operations. Rietveld’s statement arrives as the shutdown stretches beyond five weeks, disrupting agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , delaying regulatory reviews, and limiting oversight activity across financial markets. The absence of new approvals and reduced enforcement actions has contributed to uncertainty within the digital asset space. Despite this, Rietveld views the eventual reopening of the government as a potential catalyst for renewed momentum in assets like XRP . I expect the largest $XRP rally ever once the government shutdown ends. — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 8, 2025 Shutdown’s Broader Financial Impact The ongoing standoff, primarily rooted in disagreements over federal spending levels and health-care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, has led to significant economic implications. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers remain furloughed, and analysts estimate that the U.S. economy could lose billions of dollars in productivity and consumer spending. Liquidity across markets has also tightened as funds accumulate in government accounts rather than circulating within the private sector. This tightening has limited speculative capital flow into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. For XRP, this has meant subdued trading volumes and restrained price movement. The delay in federal operations has also postponed progress on key regulatory matters, such as exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals and compliance guidelines that could benefit the broader crypto ecosystem. With the SEC’s activity slowed, uncertainty has increased, discouraging institutional engagement and keeping investors cautious. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Outlook for XRP Post-Shutdown Rietveld’s expectation of a significant XRP rally hinges on a recovery in market liquidity and regulatory momentum once the government resumes normal functions. Analysts note that the end of the shutdown would likely result in the release of withheld federal payments, improved liquidity in financial systems, and renewed investor confidence. These conditions could support a rebound in speculative assets, including XRP, which has historically responded to shifts in market sentiment and macroeconomic stabilization. Market Sentiment and Timing While predictions vary, the consensus among market observers is that a prolonged shutdown continues to weigh on all risk assets. However, once a resolution is reached, the resulting normalization could open the door for a strong relief rally across digital assets. Rietveld’s projection places XRP at the center of that rebound, aligning with broader expectations that the end of fiscal gridlock could mark a turning point for both the U.S. economy and the crypto market.

According to the institution, the market “reset, not broke” and an upward trend may emerge in the coming months as the leverage structure returns to healthy levels. According to analysts, based on the implied distribution in the options market, the Bitcoin price could range between $90,000 and $160,000 over the next three to six months. Coinbase states that this distribution is asymmetrically upward. The report also notes that expected Fed interest rate cuts, liquidity expansion, and new regulations are medium-term macroeconomic influences that could extend the cycle into 2026. Coinbase describes the October 10 liquidation as a squeeze driven by market fixtures, not a structural issue. While pressure is mounting due to the sharp decline in altcoins and the pullback of market makers, the institution believes the fundamentals remain solid: “The sell-off brought the system back to a healthier level by bringing leverage levels back to levels closer to the beginning of the year. We expect a gradual upward climb rather than a sharp ATH run going forward.” Related News: This Year's Bitcoin Data for November Is Unusual - Here's a Comparison with Previous Years The institution also states that the risky altcoin segment was the most affected by the liquidation, while institutional investors remained largely insulated from this wave. According to Nansen data, “smart money” flows have been directed towards EVM-based networks like Ethereum and Arbitrum in recent weeks, while Solana and Binance Smart Chain have seen a loss of momentum. Coinbase states that these flows are not buy signals, but rather indicators used to understand which ecosystems the market is concentrated in. The report states that the next strong upward wave will likely be driven by institutions. Institutional investors were minimally affected by the liquidation wave because they kept their leverage low and largely concentrated in large-cap assets. Therefore, the market is expected to regain strength as institutional appetite returns, but it notes that this could take several months. *This is not investment advice.

In the buzzing world of digital assets, the hunt for the best altcoins to buy now is alive and kicking. With major names like XRP breaking records and Cardano rallying, crypto bulls are circling the next big wave in full force. Enter MoonBull and its wild presale scenario. The best altcoins to buy now aren’t just established heavyweights. MoonBull’s stage 6 presale is live, inviting traders and developers alike to hop on board before the rocket takes off. Missed crypto moonshots before? This could be the penguin‑style second chance. MoonBull Presale Stage 6: The Ground‑Floor Rocket Ride to Best Altcoins to Buy Now The spotlight turns full-throttle to MoonBull, one of the best altcoins to buy now , offering one of the most caught-the-penguin early-bird opportunities in the crypto market today. Stage 6 of the $MOBU presale is live at just $0.00008388, with over $550K already raised and more than 1,900 token holders joining the community . For investors hunting the next big jump, this presale is a golden chance to secure tokens at ground-floor pricing before demand surges. A $1 investment today nets approximately 11,921 tokens, which could be worth around $73.42 at listing, while $100 jumps to roughly $7,342, and $1,000 could reach $73,420, based on current MoonBull metrics. With a built-in ROI of 7,244% from Stage 6 to the projected $0.00616 listing price, the presale is truly first-come, first-served — and hesitation can be costly. For investors hunting the best altcoins to buy now, MoonBull delivers transparent tokenomics, powerful staking and governance ahead, and explosive upside potential. Early adopters are positioning themselves before this bull rocket takes off. Governance for All: Make Your Voice Heard MoonBull’s governance system gives holders real decision-making power. Every $MOBU token equals one vote, with no minimums or lockups. Starting at Stage 12, the community decides on burns, campaigns, and new features. Full transparency ensures every proposal and result is visible. By giving holders control over the project’s direction, MoonBull ensures that its evolution is shaped by collective input. Participation isn’t passive, it’s an opportunity to directly influence growth and strategy in a fair, decentralized environment. XRP: A Mature Altcoin Holding Ground and Eyes on Breakout On the news front, XRP benefits from a weakened regulatory overhang and expanding adoption in tokenized asset use‑cases. For financial analysts and blockchain developers, XRP offers a strong mix of infrastructure relevance and momentum from institutional flows. Though its upside may be more disciplined than meme‑style rockets, it remains a contender in the best altcoins to buy now category, especially for those focused on medium‑term growth rather than explosive presale swings. Cardano: Layer‑Platform Ambitions with a Steady Climb It’s backed by a strong proof‑of‑stake architecture (Ouroboros), real developer activity and a $71 million upgrade fund powering ecosystem growth. While ADA isn’t screaming 1000x!, its strength lies in institutional stacking and steady platform adoption. Analysts see targets from $1.15 to $1.25 if momentum continues. For blockchain developers and crypto‑enthusiasts aiming for long term and less‑volatile plays, Cardano is definitely among the best altcoins to buy now. Final Words XRP and Cardano are well‑established players in the altcoin arena. XRP carries institutional weight and breakout potential; Cardano offers platform stability and long‑term upside. But if the goal is to identify the best altcoins to buy now and aim for astronomical upside, MoonBull clearly takes the lead to the best altcoins to buy now . With the $MOBU presale at ground price, transparent numbers, and mounting community momentum, the bull ride is serving fresh peanuts. Jump in now before the penguins board the rocket, join MoonBull’s presale, and secure your spot.

Ethereum, Solana, and MoonBull are currently strong picks due to adoption, utility, and growth potential. Which crypto has 1000x potential? MoonBull is considered to have high growth potential because of its presale structure, staking rewards, and expanding ecosystem. What are the top 20 altcoins? Some of the top altcoins include Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Avalanche (AVAX), and MoonBull among others. Which altcoin is best to buy now besides MoonBull? Between XRP and Cardano, XRP appears best positioned for short‑to‑mid‑term breakout momentum given institutional flows and price structure. Cardano suits a long‑haul play with ecosystem foundations. How to pick a good meme coin or presale? Look for transparent presale terms (like price stage, tokens offered), community engagement, token utility, clear listing timeline, and strong upside projections. MoonBull checks every box: lowest entry, stage detail, and community metrics. Glossary of Key Terms Altcoin : Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Presale : A phase before public token listing where early investors can purchase tokens at a lower price. ROI : Return on Investment — how much profit is earned relative to the amount invested. Tokenomics : The economic model behind a crypto token, covering supply, distribution, incentives. Listing Price : The price at which a token debuts on exchanges after its presale stage. Stage 6 : A specific round of a structured presale, often indicating limited time or supply and increasing price in subsequent stages. Meme Coin : A cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media, community, or cultural meme status rather than long‑term fundamentals. Summary XRP and Cardano remain strong altcoins for 2025: XRP with institutional momentum and breakout signals; Cardano with platform strength and long‑term roadmap. Yet the best altcoins to buy now for explosive early gains is MoonBull ($MOBU). Its Stage 6 presale price of $0.00008388, projected listing at $0.00616, transparent token model and community traction make it a standout.

Enthusiasts and traders are increasingly accumulating the coin, hinting at potential bullish trends. This article dives into the reasons behind HYPE's steady climb and explores which other coins might be poised for a rise. Hyperliquid's Next Move: Will HYPE Break Through? Source: tradingview Hyperliquid , known as HYPE, is in a fluctuating market, trading today between a high $30s and a high $40s range. Despite a recent downturn, with a drop of over 6% this past week and more than 12% in the past month, the past six months show an impressive growth nearing 65%. Currently, it's testing its support level around the mid-$30s. If it manages to climb, it could meet the nearest challenge at the low $50s. Break past that, and the next goal sits in the low $60s. The coin has potential, but it needs to push through tough levels to continue its upward momentum. Conclusion HYPE has shown resilience, maintaining its upward trend even when the broader market hesitates. Increased on-chain trading activity reinforces confidence in its potential. Investors continue to gather HYPE which signals strong belief in its future value. The ongoing accumulation highlights a positive sentiment among traders, contrasting with the market's general mood.

Ogunsola claimed that these African-native AI solutions should be developed to tackle challenges faced by the continent. The University of Lagos VC made the call at the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (MIRG-ICAIR 2025), held for three days at the University of Lagos Multipurpose Hall, Akoka, Lagos. The conference, which was themed “Building Sustainable AI-Driven Transformation Infrastructures for African Economies,” was attended by undergraduates and postgraduate students, as well as participants from other institutions worldwide. Several technology organizations also participated in the event, showcasing AI tools and other innovations . University of Lagos VC urges African-native AI solutions Speaking at the conference, Ogunsola, represented by Prof Olufemi Saibu, the Director of Quality Assurance and Servicom Unit, said that Africa needs robust and scalable digital technologies to improve productivity. In addition, she noted that these technologies can also be used to address sector-specific challenges. She mentioned that the University of Lagos has continued to lead in AI research and innovation, with recent initiatives aimed at positioning students to be leaders in emerging technologies. She said, “At the University of Lagos, we are making giant strides in AI research. Just last month (October), we launched the ‘OpenAI Academy for Africa,’ and by the end of this month, we will be launching a world-class AI lab donated by the United Nations programmes.” She also added that the school is committed to raising the standards in educating, empowering, and improving the deployment of AI across Africa. Ogunsola added that the school is planning to create a Faculty of Computing and Informatics. She noted that it is a deliberate attempt to build a unit that will be focused on technology, but will also develop solutions that are Africa-oriented and indigenous to the challenges of the continent. Speaking at the event was Bosun Tijani, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy of Nigeria. He was represented by the National Director for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Dr Bunmi Ajala. Dr Ajala highlighted that AI has been reshaping economies and transforming sectors like agriculture, healthcare, education, and public services. “AI is our present reality, and it is reshaping the economy. It has gone beyond technological trends; it is a fundamental infrastructure for improving productivity across key sectors like agriculture, healthcare, education, and public services,” he said. “For Nigeria, a nation brimming with youthful talent but facing solvable challenges, AI offers an opportunity to leapfrog developmental stages and transform our economy. AI is already making a significant impact.” Professor of the School of Information and Department of Linguistics at the University of British Columbia, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, also spoke at the event, urging Adrian researchers to build AI tools that reflect the continent’s linguistic and cultural diversity. “We speak many languages, and we don’t have to rely on technology developed elsewhere. It’s time to build our own solutions. Every profession needs technology to thrive. We represent the communities we belong to, and we must look for solutions to their problems. The future is Africa,” he said. Dr Chika Yinka-Banjo, the University of Lagos Head of Department of Computer Science, also noted that the department has become a vibrant hub for innovation. “I want to use this opportunity to say that Computer Science, which is under the Faculty of Computing and Informatics, is a vibrant department. This group, MIRG, is also vibrant. I want to welcome everyone, and I wish you a successful conference.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Despite prevailing fear, some assets display remarkable resilience. One standout is NEAR, which continues to show robust performance. This intriguing dynamic suggests that the pattern of Layer 1 asset rotation remains in play, hinting at potential growth for savvy investors. Which coins are primed to surge next? NEAR Protocol Eyes Growth as Price Surges Amidst Bullish Momentum Source: tradingview The price of NEAR Protocol is currently fluctuating between just above $2 to around $2.40. It has increased by roughly 44% in the past week, showing strong upward momentum. If it breaks past its nearest resistance of $2.60, it could aim for the next level at close to $3. If it manages to hit this target, it would represent a potential gain of about a quarter from its lower range. However, the Simple Moving Averages show a mixed picture, creating uncertainty in the longer term. Nonetheless, the high RSI suggests bullish pressure, giving it a chance for further growth if the momentum sustains. Conclusion The strength of NEAR is evident even when the market is fearful. Other Layer 1 solutions like Solana, Avalanche, and Terra also continue to show strong performance. This ongoing activity highlights interest in Layer 1 tokens. These assets are gaining attention due to their potential and the different features they offer. The resilience of these tokens could indicate their appeal and viability for long-term growth.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining considerable popularity as one of the leading defi cryptocurrencies, Although its presale is still underway, its presale activity is intriguing, indicating a potential trend not unlike that of previous rallies. With this token being on its final stage of presale stage 6 at just $0.035, forecasts reveal that its potential return could be as high as 50x due to its ingenuously integrated ecosystem and rapid adoption rate. It is quite pertinent that this new cryptocurrency is not only basing its development on market trends but is actually laying a solid groundwork for appreciable value growth and stands as the best crypto to buy today for a potentially life-changing investment. How a Return of 50X is Achievable Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a favorable scenario for a potential price appreciation of 50x, as it is benchmarked against that of Binance Coin (BNB). Early this year, or precisely at the start of 2020, there was a notable low of approximately $10 recorded for BNB, and this was due to its growing number of utility services, such as its exchange and its platform for its smart chain. Subsequent to this, its remarkable price appreciation of more than $690 was achieved, thereby experiencing an astonishing growth of a whopping 6,900% within a span of 12-18 months for its supporters. Again, MUTM is on track and laying down solid foundations for such growth. With an inception rate of only $0.06, a 50-fold growth would have its value at $3.00, easily achieved through a myriad of success catalysts. To begin with, its presale has managed to raise a staggering $18,500,000, boasting of having garnered support from no fewer than 17,810 holders, symbolizing extraordinary market faith and support. Secondly, its dual market model of providing loan services through Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer is playing a colossal role in addressing a significant DeFi gap and is expected to generate huge revenues through its adoption. Third, the incoming V1 on Sepolia testnet , scheduled for late Q4 of 2025, and its implementation of an over-collateralized stablecoin, is expected to demonstrate its utility and, as such, will attract more people and more money into its market. Moreover, finally, and as is worthy of note, is that its buy-and-distribute mechanism, based on fees collected via protocol, has a sustainable demand cycle, as it purchases MUTM tokens and rewards users for their respective staking efforts, as most other leader cryptocurrencies, including that of BNB, on these same components. The presale itself is contributing towards this potential as well. In Phase 6, being currently at just 85% occupied and priced at $0.035, time is running out quickly on this entry point. The up-coming phase would boost the price one point to $0.040, meaning that investors are on target for a quick profit of 14% as soon as this presale is concluded before going on market sale. Future market growth then, as it would have to reach all the way up to market at $3.00, would be a staggering return of 500% on its list price of just $0.06 or, more reasonably, based on its presale price today, an astonishing return of 8,471%. These forecasts not only have roots in project milestones, but they can be traced back to other altcoins that have been launched on the market and have been quite successful in their performances. Secondly, as far as investment is concerned, this analogy can be used as a means of providing a realistic scenario for cryptocurrency investors, searching for the best crypto on which they could invest and comprehend ‘exponential growth’ returns, as is experienced with MUTM. Urgent Call to Capitalize on Ground-Floor Pricing Being part of a potential 50x adventure comes with time restrictions. Mutuum Finance has improved accessibility by providing a way for investors to buy through cards, giving them the ability to easily obtain tokens without any restrictions. Also, having a leaderboard that allows the greatest contributor of each 24-hour cycle a bonus of $500 has encouraged continuous engagement and helped boost this project into a perfect storm for value growth. Since they are close to completing Phase 6, time is running out for investors who would like to take advantage of this potential iconic crypto and buy it before it is too late at only $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a perfect storm of innovation, community, and timeliness that precedes massive success. The project has laid out a comprehensive roadmap that has resonated well with its community, just like many other popular cryptos had achieved before their monumental success. To secure one’s investment in a project that promises to revolutionize DeFi, potential buyers of cryptocurrencies need to buy into MUTM before its price increases.

Analysis of his transactions shows that Gunden transferred his remaining 3,549 BTC, valued at approximately $361.84 million, from his primary wallet. Notably, 600 BTC, worth about $61.17 million, has already been deposited to the crypto exchange Kraken, a move often seen as preparation for selling, according to Arkham data retrieved on November 9. The remaining funds are sitting in an unspent address, possibly awaiting further transactions. Crypto whale Bitcoin transaction. Source: Arkham This comes just a day after another major transfer on November 8, when Gunden moved 3,600.55 BTC valued at $372 million, with 500 BTC ($51.68 million) already sent to Kraken. In total, over the past two days, the whale has moved more than 7,100 BTC, bringing his total offloaded amount in recent weeks to roughly 11,000 BTC, equivalent to $1.12 billion at current prices. Possible impact on Bitcoin price Such large-scale movements of Bitcoin to centralized exchanges typically indicate an intention to sell, which can weigh heavily on market sentiment. Whale dumps of this magnitude tend to increase selling pressure, potentially leading to short-term corrections in Bitcoin’s price as liquidity absorbs the sudden influx of supply. If Gunden proceeds with selling his remaining holdings, Bitcoin could face intensified volatility in the coming days, especially as traders and algorithms react to the on-chain signals of a possible billion-dollar liquidation. Indeed, this selling pressure comes as Bitcoin struggles to make a notable move above the $100,000 mark, briefly correcting below that level earlier this week. Besides macroeconomic factors, the asset has also been weighed down by massive institutional exits through exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). Over the past week, the spot Bitcoin ETFs shed almost $2 billion, one of their steepest weekly declines since the products launched. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,009, having made a modest correction of 0.5% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeline, the asset is down over 8%.

This comes in response to the chatter surrounding Trump’s pardon of him in October 2025. CZ Says He Has Never Met President Trump In an interview with FOX News on Friday, November 7, Zhao revealed that he was “a little bit surprised” by the US President’s decision to pardon him. The Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to anti-money-laundering (AML) violations in 2023. While the former CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange agreed to a significant $4.3 billion fine on behalf of his company, he was forced to resign and received a four-month jail sentence. CZ was released from prison in September 2024, but this presidential pardon expunges his record of a criminal conviction. Although multiple reports have alleged that Binance and CZ lobbied through business deals for the co-founder’s pardon, there have been several rebuttals to such controversial claims. In a November 3 interview, Trump stated that he did not know the crypto founder, crediting his sons for pushing for the pardon. Now, CZ has come forward to state that he has no business links with the Trump family or their cryptocurrency project, World Liberty Financial. “That’s completely not accurate. There’s no deal, there has never been any discussions. It’s as simple as that,” the Binance leader said. CZ also addressed his decision to plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, including failure to implement adequate anti-money-laundering measures at Binance. The prominent crypto founder said, “the best way to confront the problem and solve it head-on.” US Leading In Crypto Regulation: CZ According to the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s decision to grant clemency to crypto figures was a way to “officially end the Biden administration’s war on the cryptocurrency industry.” In the FOX interview, Zhao highlighted the GENIUS Act as a move in the right direction by the United States regarding leading crypto regulation. The former Binance CEO believes that the increased regulatory clarity is an excellent development for the crypto industry. “I think in the last administration, even when I was charged and even when I pleaded guilty, there wasn’t any clear regulatory framework for crypto in the US, so I think now it’s getting much clearer, and [the] US is definitely leading,” CZ added.",Crypto News|binance|Changpeng Zhao (CZ)|crypto|crypto news|US President Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-09 12:00:29

On-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that while long-term holders have been actively taking profits, the market is showing limited capacity to absorb their sell-offs. This is a contrast to previous phases of the bull run, where rising demand was able to offset increased long-term holder activity. Related Reading: XRP’s Price Doesn’t Match Its Growing Real-World Use, Study Finds Rising Long-Term Holder Selling Pressure Mirrors Past Bull Cycles Data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, which was initially shared by Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, shows an interesting change in dynamics among Bitcoin holder activity that could shape the cryptocurrency’s next move. Julio Moreno explained that long-term holder (LTH) selling is a normal pattern in bull markets as investors take profits when Bitcoin approaches or surpasses all-time highs. The CryptoQuant data shows that the 30-day sum of LTH spending, represented by the purple line in the chart image below, has been increasing since early October. This behavior follows previous bullish rally phases, such as those seen in early and late 2024, when profit-taking coincided with expanding demand, and so Bitcoin pushed to new record prices. The chart accompanying Moreno’s post shows green areas representing periods of positive apparent demand growth and red areas indicating contraction. During January to March 2024 and November to December 2024, LTH selloffs occurred as demand expanded. Bitcoin Long-term Holder Spending Since October 2025, however, that trend has reversed. Even as LTH selling increased, demand has entered a red zone, showing that the market’s ability to absorb this selling pressure has weakened. This has coincided with Bitcoin’s struggle to sustain its position above $102,000, suggesting that price growth might be losing momentum. Sustained Weak Demand Could Delay Next Rally Moreno noted that the critical factor to watch isn’t just the volume of long-term holder sell-offs but whether demand growth can keep pace. When demand is strong, the influx of supply from long-term holders often drives healthy consolidation before another price surge. In contrast, when demand falls behind, the result tends to be prolonged corrections or sideways movement. A large portion of that demand now comes from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen a sharp slowdown in inflows. Data from SosoValue shows that US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs ended last week with net outflows of $558.44 million on Friday, November 7, one of the largest single-day outflows in weeks. Related Reading: Get Ready — The End Of November Will Be Massive For XRP, CEO Says Unless Bitcoin’s apparent demand begins to recover in the coming weeks and LTH sell-offs continue, then this might continue to weigh on price action and postpone the next leg of Bitcoin’s rally. In this case, we might continue to see Bitcoin consolidating between $101,000 and $103,000 for the rest of November. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $101,655, down by 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/technical-analyst-to-xrp-holders-get-ready-heres-why/,"Technical analyst ChartNerd has renewed focus on XRP’s interaction with the weekly 55-period weighted exponential moving average (55 WEMA). He reiterated an earlier view that the price may revisit the 55 WEMA in the low $2.20s before initiating a new leg higher. In his latest commentary, he pointed to historical precedence: a prior retest of the 55 WEMA was followed by a sustained rally of more than 400%. Based on that observation and the current condition of the weekly stochastic RSI, ChartNerd described the present setup as the concluding phase ahead of a decisive upward move. $XRP : GET READY https://t.co/d8zdKd80OQ — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 7, 2025 Price structure and moving average dynamics The price chart shows XRP trading around the weekly 55 WEMA, which ChartNerd treats as a structural support level and a potential launch point for an extended advance. The analyst’s scenario envisions a short-term pullback to the WEMA near $2.20, followed by renewed buying pressure. The moving average’s position relative to recent candles and the market’s reaction around that band are central to his interpretation: a clean retest and rejection from the 55 WEMA would validate the support, while a breakdown beneath it would require reassessment of the bullish thesis. Weekly stochastic RSI and momentum context ChartNerd also highlighted the weekly stochastic relative strength index (SRSI) as corroborating evidence. The SRSI is currently in oversold territory on the weekly timeframe, indicating momentum exhaustion at these levels. In the most recent data, the two SRSI lines are at notably low values and appear to be attempting a flattening or modest crossover. The analyst reads this combination — oversold weekly SRSI plus proximity to the 55 WEMA — as a condition that historically preceded strong directional moves in favor of the trend that followed the retest. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risk considerations and trade framing While ChartNerd frames the setup as favorable for a significant advance if the WEMA holds, the scenario carries the usual technical risks. A failed retest that turns the 55 WEMA into resistance would open the possibility of extended consolidation or lower supports being tested. Market participants should monitor price action around the WEMA, the behavior of weekly momentum indicators, and volume confirmation. For traders , clear invalidation levels and position-sizing discipline remain essential when acting on setups that rely on a single moving-average retest for trend continuation. ChartNerd’s argument is structured around a repeatable setup: retest the weekly 55 WEMA at roughly the low $2.20s while weekly momentum indicators are oversold, then observe for a decisive rejection and trend continuation.

With dominance near the 60% mark, many see this as a trigger point. This shift sets the stage for what could be the next big altcoin run . Especially for projects positioned with clear real-world utility or network upgrades, the moment to act might be slipping away. Even while attention grows on one emerging payment-focused DeFi ecosystem that has raised $28 million in private funding, the spotlight on other eye-catching tokens is growing. VeChain (VET): The Supply-Chain Altcoin Wake-Up Call VeChain has endured a rough stretch, yet the charts and ecosystem signals suggest that early buyers are already quietly loading up. Analysts think this could be one of the best cryptos to buy now if the broader rotation into altcoins kicks off. Technical indicators on VET are flashing “potential bottom” setups, with dual TD Sequential buy-signals showing up. Importantly, VeChain is gaining traction in enterprise and real-world asset tokenisation. Recent ecosystem updates show developer activity up more than 600%. Polkadot (DOT): The Cross-Chain DeFi Project Set to Scale According to recent commentary, if Bitcoin dominance hits resistance and reverses, DOT is among the coins ready to capture incoming capital. On the technical side, DOT currently hovers around key support near $2.60. But make no mistake, the market is watching and waiting. The upgrade known as “Asset Hub” (Nov 4) is a major milestone for the ecosystem, designed to unify its parachain services and may act as a catalyst. Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Context — Why This Matters While not an altcoin per se, understanding Bitcoin’s dominance is crucial to timing any altcoin move. Bitcoin dominance now sits near 59%–60% and has repeatedly rejected resistance lines. Analysts believe that if BTC dominance begins to roll over, it will signal a liquidity shift into altcoins. When Bitcoin dominance declines, the narrative often turns to altcoin season, a period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin significantly. The current market setup mirrors prior cycles where this kind of resistance held, followed by large-scale altcoin rallies. For savvy investors, watching the dominance chart is akin to watching a switch; once it flips, those positioned early in altcoins could reap outsized gains. Remittix (RTX): The Under-The-Radar Utility Token The payment-focused ecosystem is quietly rising and poised to benefit from the shifting tide away from Bitcoin dominance. Remittix has already raised over $28 million in private funding, signalling strong demand for its PayFi solution and catching attention among early-stage crypto investment circles. Remittix stands out not just as another token, but as a platform designed to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, with transparent real-time FX conversion and a deflationary token model built for global utility. Compared to the altcoins above, Remittix positions itself as the best crypto to buy now for utility-driven growth rather than speculation. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction: Global reach: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Real-world utility: Built for actual use, not just speculation Security first: Audited by a top blockchain security firm If Bitcoin dominance pivots and capital flows into altcoins, Remittix is uniquely positioned to ride both the narrative shift and real-world use case wave. For investors looking for the next 100x crypto (while not guaranteed), Remittix offers a compelling combination of timing, technology, and utility.

By 2028, CRO could reach a maximum value of $0.8337, with an average trading price of $0.7410. Cronos is expected to reach a maximum level of $2.56 in 2031. Cronos (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of the cronos chain, a decentralized, open-source blockchain developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading, and financial services company. CRO aims to power the next generation of decentralized crypto assets and applications, serving as a utility token. And enable real-time, low-cost transactions globally. Cronos cross-bridge mainnet beta suggests a bright future for CRO. This feature aims to improve interoperability between significant blockchain ecosystems, potentially increasing CRO’s attractiveness to developers and users. CRO’s recent performance reflects robust market sentiment and confidence. These factors, combined, present Cronos as a compelling investment opportunity within the dynamic crypto market, thereby increasing the demand for CRO. Eminem’s involvement comes as Crypto.com has been actively expanding its visibility through various high-profile partnerships, including those with actor Matt Damon, major sports teams, and even Trump Media. In this Cronos price prediction, we’ll focus on exploring the future market trends of CRO, its current price momentum, and its past performance, using in-depth technical analysis and a price prediction model.

Cautious market sentiment Lows trading activity shows traders waiting for a clear direction. Strong resistance at $0.128 as its repeated rejections signal limited upside until a breakout occurs. On November 9, 2025, Cronos trades at $0.1234, marking a 3.18% decline over the past 24 hours. The token’s intraday range has fluctuated between a low of $0.1225 and a high of $0.1287, reflecting moderate market volatility. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that CRO remains in a short-term downtrend, with sellers retaining control after a failed attempt to push prices above the $0.128 level. The overall trading sentiment is cautious, as traders await clearer signals before entering new positions. Cronos 1-day price chart: CRO testing key support levels On the daily chart, CRO shows a controlled decline after facing repeated resistance at $0.1287. Price action indicates a pattern of lower highs, which highlights weakening buying strength. The daily structure reveals consolidation within a narrow range, suggesting that bulls are struggling to maintain traction. The 50-day moving average acts as a ceiling around $0.128, while the 200-day moving average remains flat, reflecting long-term indecision. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering near 30–40 zone. This suggests that neither side currently holds a strong advantage. Volume data also shows a gradual decline, signaling limited enthusiasm from new buyers. If CRO breaks below $0.1200, it could trigger a deeper correction toward the $0.118 level, where previous buying activity emerged. On the upside, reclaiming and closing above $0.128 would be crucial for shifting the short-term outlook to bullish. Until then, market participants are likely to witness continued consolidation within the current trading range. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO tights range and weak momentum On the 4-hour chart, CRO continues to move sideways between $0.1225 and $0.1250, signaling a period of indecision. The shorter timeframe highlights reduced volatility as traders balance between minor dips and recoveries. Both the 20-period and 50-period moving averages are converging, showing that momentum is fading. The price has been oscillating around these averages, confirming a neutral-to-bearish short-term bias. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The RSI on the 4-hour timeframe is nearing oversold territory, implying potential for a short-lived recovery if buyers step in near $0.1220. However, any upward movement is likely to face resistance at $0.1250, where short-term sellers have been active. A decisive close above this level may open the path toward $0.1265, while failure to hold $0.1220 could lead to further losses. Cronos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.1946 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.1746 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.1290 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.1404 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.1688 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.1852 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.1390 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.1553 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.1735 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.1973 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.1996 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.1743 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.1477 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.1285 SELL What to expect from Cronos? Cronos is expected to remain in a consolidation phase as traders monitor the $0.12 support level closely. Price stability above this zone may attract gradual buying interest, but momentum is likely to stay muted unless a breakout above $0.128 occurs. In the short term, range-bound movement between $0.122 and $0.128 appears likely as market sentiment remains cautious. A decisive move beyond either boundary will determine the next directional trend, with a close above resistance signaling recovery potential and a drop below support opening room for further downside pressure. Is Cronos a good investment? Cronos (CRO) currently shows a cautious short-term outlook, with price stability near the $0.12 support but limited bullish momentum. The project’s expanding DeFi ecosystem and cross-chain developments support its long-term potential, though the current cronos price action remains range-bound. For long-term investors, CRO offers steady ecosystem growth and utility within the Crypto.com network. However, short-term traders should wait for a breakout above $0.128 before expecting any meaningful recovery. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? On November 9, 2025, Cronos (CRO) trades at $0.1234, down 3.18% over 24 hours, moving within a tight range of $0.1225–$0.1287. The token faces short-term pressure as repeated rejections at the $0.128 resistance indicate weakening buying strength, while the $0.12 support remains crucial to prevent further losses. Daily and 4-hour charts show consolidation, lower highs, and fading momentum, with the RSI hovering near neutral levels. Short-term movement is likely to stay range-bound between $0.122 and $0.128, with a break above $0.128 signaling bullish potential and a drop below $0.12 opening room for further downside. While CRO’s expanding DeFi ecosystem and cross-chain developments support long-term growth, traders should wait for a decisive breakout before expecting meaningful short-term gains. Recent news Cronos completed its “Smarturn” upgrade on October 30, 2025, boosting EVM compatibility, scalability, and interoperability. The update added EIP-7702 smart accounts, integrated Go-Ethereum v1.15.11 (with Cancun/Prague opcodes), introduced eth_getBlockReceipts, and improved transaction speed through PriorityNonceMempool and AnteCache. With IBC v2 integration for faster cross-chain communication, Smarturn enhances DeFi efficiency, lowers gas costs, and strengthens Cronos’s role as a leading Ethereum-compatible layer-1 in the Crypto.com ecosystem. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $ 0.50 by 2027, potentially increasing its market capitalization as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2029, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization, surpassing the current CRO coin price prediction for the cryptocurrency sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility. These strategic initiatives, along with CRO’s liquidity, staking rewards, and network governance, position it as a solid investment for those with a long-term perspective, especially considering institutional adoption.

CRO opened 2022 at $0.5575 but fell to $0.4409, partially due to concerns over a potential security breach on the Crypto.com platform, which temporarily suspended withdrawals in January. In 2023, Cronos experienced a peak in mid-March at around $0.80, followed by a steep decline and stabilization at around $0.20 by mid-year.

The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $101,780 as it struggles to build momentum. OG Bitcoin whales have hindered recovery momentum, cashing out millions and stalling price recovery. JPMorgan Discloses 64% Increase in BlackRock Holdings JPMorgan Chase has disclosed that it owns 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF as of September 30, a 64% increase since June. According to JPMorgan’s New York-based fintech arm’s latest 13F-HR Institutional Investment Manager holdings report, the firm owns IBIT shares worth $343 million. The report can be viewed on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website. Spot Bitcoin ETFs secured approval in January 2024, marking a watershed moment for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, primarily IBIT, are widely regarded as an important gateway for institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin ETFs offer investors access to the asset without requiring direct ownership. Unlike futures ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs represent direct asset buys. All 12 Bitcoin ETFs Register Substantial Outflows U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs recorded substantial outflows totalling $558 million on November 7, the largest single-day withdrawals since their launch. Fidelity’s FBTC registered the largest outflows with $256 million, followed by ARKB with $144 million and BlackRock’s IBIT with $131.43 million. The outflows come after the ETFs recorded a $240 million inflow on November 6. Total net assets under management as of November 7 were $138.08 billion. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC registered $15.44 million in outflows, while Bitwise’s BITB saw outflows of over $10 million. Additionally, eight Bitcoin ETFs, including VanEck’s HODL, Grayscale’s BTC , Invesco’s BTCO, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Franklin’s EZBC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI, reported zero activity. The outflows on November 7 were the second-largest single-day withdrawal in recent memory. The largest outflows were seen on November 4, when spot Bitcoin ETFs reported over $577 million in outflows. The total value added across spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed $5 billion on November 7, with BlackRock’s IBIT maintaining the highest cumulative net inflow at $64.32 billion. Crypto Treasuries Take Massive Hit Analysts have warned that digital asset treasuries are under immense pressure as the month-long cryptocurrency market downturn erased billions from their balance sheet. An analysis by on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant revealed the stress digital asset treasury companies are under. The analysis took Evernorth, an XRP-focused treasury company, as an example. According to CryptoQuant, the firm is sitting on $78 million in unrealized losses just weeks after acquiring XRP. The analysis warns that even established firms like MSTR have been hit hard. Strategy has reported a 26% drop over the past month as Bitcoin continued its decline. The stock is trading over 50% below its all-time high, according to data from Google Finance. However, the company is still in positive territory on its Bitcoin reserves, thanks to an average cost basis of around $74,000 per coin. Crypto Treasury Boom Has Peaked: Michael Novogratz Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes the hype around crypto treasury companies has likely peaked. Novogratz believes the focus has shifted to which existing companies can scale and dominate the ecosystem. “We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance.” According to Novogratz, the crypto treasury boom was fueled by favorable crypto regulations. As a result, treasury firms including Strategy, GameStop, SharpLink, and Trump Media began allocating reserves to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. Novogratz warned that the growing competition and saturation could make it difficult for newer players to gain traction. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin ( BTC ) is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $101,966. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a notable recovery on Friday, rising from a low of $99,170 to settle at $103,284. However, bearish sentiment has returned over the weekend, with the price falling to a low of $101,372 before moving to its current level. According to Charles Edwards, co-founder of Capriole Investments, Bitcoin “super whales” are cashing out of their Bitcoin, raising concerns about the impact on price recovery. While most analysts view BTC’s decline as a normal correction, some argue the correction is being fueled by selling from long-term holders. Additional data from Glassnode reveals that events where the whales have been spending more than 1,000 BTC per hour have been persistent since January. “The key distinction in this cycle is that these OG whale high-spending events occurred more frequently throughout, signalling persistent distribution.” However, despite the selling pressure, markets have shown tremendous resilience. BTC started the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising 0.84% on Friday and 0.56% on Saturday to settle at $111,666. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the flagship cryptocurrency rose nearly 3% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,548. BTC reached an intraday high of $116,410 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $114,087, ultimately dropping 0.40%. Selling pressure and volatility persisted on Tuesday as the price fell 1.03% to $112,906. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell 2.55% and settled at $110.032. Volatility and selling pressure persisted on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $111,629, fell to an intraday low of $106,279, and settled at $108,308. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC returned to positive territory on Friday, rising 1.15% and settling at $108,555. Source: TradingView Price action remained positive over the weekend, with BTC increasing 0.45% on Saturday and 0.44% on Sunday to settle at $110,536.

Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the flagship cryptocurrency slipped below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,892 before settling at $101,468. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $103,869 despite selling pressure. BTC returned to bearish territory on Thursday, dropping 2.48% to a low of $100,235 before settling at $101,290. The price fell to an intraday low of $99,170 on Friday before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settling at $103,284. Price action flipped to bearish over the weekend, with BTC falling 0.97% on Saturday and 0.62% during the ongoing session. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In more positive developments, Google Finance has announced plans to incorporate prediction market data from Kalshi and Polymarket in search results over the next few weeks. Here are some of the other major developments in the past week. DeFi The total value locked (TVL) into decentralized finance protocols has risen 40% since late September on Flare’s blockchain for data. The surge has been driven by demand for an asset that has very little to do with DeFi for most of its history: XRP. Technology Google Finance has announced it is incorporating prediction market data from Kalshi and Polymarket in its search results. The implementation will be completed over the next few weeks and is part of a new AI-powered upgrade. Business JPMorgan Chase has revealed it holds 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF as of September 30, a 64% increase since June. Institutional investors are pivoting to regulated crypto vehicles and investment products as they look to diversify their holdings and explore Bitcoin ETFs. Western Union has filed another trademark just days after announcing the launch of its own stablecoin in 2026. The trademark could encompass various cryptocurrency-related services. Forward Industries’ Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion stock buyback program. The program allows the company to repurchase its outstanding common stock through September 30, 2027. The authorization comes as the treasury company filed a resale prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple has closed a $500 million funding round, valuing the company at $40 billion, making it one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency deals of 2025. Citadel Securities, Fortress, and other major funds led the funding round.

Notably, the outlook comes as Ethereum continues to be weighed down by broader market sentiment, which has seen increased selling pressure. By press time, ETH was trading at $3,425, up almost 0.5% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the asset is down 12%. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold ETH price prediction Now, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, a long-term valuation model using a color-coded logarithmic curve, projects potential price levels for November 2025. At the top of the spectrum, the “Maximum Bubble Territory” is projected between $15,286.39 and $21,767.19, indicating extreme overvaluation and speculative exuberance. Just below this, the “But have we earned it?” band spans $10,701.94 to $15,286.39, typically representing a heated but not yet euphoric market. ETH Rainbow Chart. Source: Blockchain Center The “Is this the Flippening?” level ranges from $7,367.2 to $10,701.94, marking strong bullish momentum where investors might speculate on Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin’s dominance. The “HODL!” zone, between $5,078.4 and $7,367.2, reflects healthy growth and sustained optimism among long-term holders. Further down, the “Steady…” band lies between $3,529.58 and $5,078.4, pointing to a market in equilibrium where Ethereum is fairly valued. The “Still cheap” ($2,486.81–$3,529.58) and “Undervalued” ($1,775.54–$2,486.81) ranges suggest the asset remains attractively priced for accumulation. Finally, the lowest bands, “Accumulate” ($1,289.28–$1,775.54) and “Fire Sale” ($954.68–$1,289.28), reflect periods of excessive pessimism, offering potentially undervalued entry points. ETH’s ideal price for November 30 With Ethereum trading around $3,400, it sits at the lower edge of the “Steady…” band, just above the “Still cheap” zone. This placement suggests the asset remains moderately undervalued relative to the chart’s growth trajectory. If market sentiment stays stable and follows its historical logarithmic path, Ethereum’s equilibrium price by November 30 could fall between $3,500 and $5,000, aligning with the midpoint of the “Steady…” band. While not a scientific forecast or investment advice, the Rainbow Chart contextualizes Ethereum’s cyclical valuation trends within its historical performance.

Sellers dominate with consistently lower highs as buying pressure fades. The path of least resistance remains downward until Bitcoin breaks the trendline with conviction. Failed to close below $103,200, and a breakdown under $100,000 accelerates the decline toward $98,000-$95,000, potentially extending to the $90,000-$92,000 CME gap zone.

Each acquisition connects to the XRP Ledger, positioning the protocol for institutional-scale transaction volume. Critics citing high supply face shifting dynamics as stablecoins, tokenized bonds, FX, and credit flow through XRP as a bridge asset. Institutional lockups, transaction burning, and corporate treasury holdings create potential supply shock as value flows through the network at scale. Despite the growing adoption of the tech, Western Union has recently selected Solana for its dollar-backed stablecoin, USDPT, which is set to launch in the first half of 2026. The company chose Solana’s architecture for consumer remittances requiring fast, inexpensive processing, sidelining XRP from tens of billions in annual transfer volume. However, Western Union’s consumer focus differs from XRP’s institutional target market. The XRP Ledger includes compliance tools, such as trust lines and account authorization, that regulated entities require.

This divergence, coupled with the projected pattern, suggests a likely short-term rebound toward the $3,780–$4,000 region. Ethereum appears to be bottoming out with signs of recovery emerging. A break above $3,800 could confirm a bullish continuation toward $4,200, while failure to hold above $3,300 risks retesting lower supports around $3,050. Pepenode Presale Hits $2.09M as Investors Chase 600% Staking Yield An Ethereum rally back above $4,000 in the short term would bring attention back to ERC20 memecoins, particularly those still in presale. One of the viral presale projects whales are flocking to right now is Pepenode (PEPENODE) , which launched in August and has since raised over $2.09 million from investors. PEPENODE differentiates itself from typical Pepe meme coins by offering utility beyond viral marketing through its Mine-to-Earn framework. Unlike traditional mining that demands costly hardware and high electricity consumption, PEPENODE conducts mining by allowing token holders to purchase virtual nodes to earn passive rewards in tokens like Dogecoin and Pepe. The platform also offers staking with an annual yield exceeding 600%. With the presale currently underway, early investors can acquire PEPENODE at $0.0011363 before the price increases in subsequent phases.

According to the country, it plans to build a strong digital economy through its National Digital Economy Programme, which is expected to focus on three pillars. In its statement, the country has highlighted that the program will focus on aspects like digital government, business digitization, and digital society. Oman intends to raise the sector’s contribution to its GDP to 10% by the end of 2040. According to Dr Ali bin Amer al Shaithani, Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology (MoTCIT), the digital economy is expected to contribute around 3% to the country’s GDP by the end of this year. Oman wants a 10% GDP boost from its digital economy The program aligns with the Oman Vision 2040. It is also expected to happen in four stages. The stages include digital government integration and exporting digital services. Oman has been making progress worldwide in terms of its digital initiatives. The country ranks 45th in AI readiness, 41st in e-Government development, 1st in cybersecurity readiness, and 50th in network readiness. The goal is to reach the top 20 globally in those metrics. One of the key milestones for the country was launching the National Programme for Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Digital Technologies in 2023. The program promotes AI adoption across sectors, localizes AI technologies, and establishes a governance framework. It is presently running about 32 projects that are focused on boosting AI readiness, startups, and research output. One of the flagship programs of the initiative is the AI Economics Initiative. Other projects include Mu’een AI, an Omani language model that is being used by the government, the AI Studio, AI Makers, and the National Open Data Portal. In its quest to advance innovation, Oman also launched the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in a collaboration with the World Economic Forum. The country also issued a National Policy for the Safe and Ethical Use of AI, forming an AI Experts Committee that consists of public, private, and academic sectors to oversee things. Oman has also launched the Oman Digital Triangle to host AI data centers using green energy. In addition, the Green AI Alliance program will bring together 34 companies and institutions to promote sustainable AI investment in the country. Oman also announced an Artificial Intelligence Zone near Muscat International Airport. The zone offers incentives to attract regional AI firms and reinforce Oman’s position as a digital innovation center in the Middle East. Oman is not the only country looking to bolster its digital economy. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, India has also announced that it is setting up an AI governance group and expert panel by December. The country is moving fast to set up the committee to push the objectives that have been outlined in the India AI governance guidelines. The group will also lend expertise from several agencies so that all the bases can be covered. It is expected that after the groups are formed, India will move a step forward to develop regulatory sandboxes and tool-building programs. This way, the country will be able to create a balance between aiding innovation and protecting consumers. India, just like most countries, is moving fast in the AI scene, as countries continue to look for ways to push for the responsible use of artificial intelligence.

The attack on the couple was reportedly linked to a ransomware attack on digital assets. According to local media, Novak, who was convicted of large-scale fraud in St. Petersburg and subsequently moved to Dubai, raised hundreds of millions of dollars from new investors through his crypto payment app, Fintopio. Novak and his wife disappeared after attending an investment conference in early October. According to the investigation, the couple was abducted by the suspects after being lured to a rented villa. The perpetrators reportedly demanded Novak access to a large amount of crypto assets, but when he refused, the couple was killed.

The suspects, identified as Russian citizens, are expected to be extradited to St. Petersburg soon. Following Novak and his wife's disappearance, smartphone signals were reportedly detected for several days, first in the Hatta region of the UAE and Oman, and then in Cape Town, South Africa, before being completely cut off on October 4. Anna's father and stepmother reportedly traveled to Dubai to retrieve the couple's young children. The family declined to comment further to the press due to the ongoing investigation. Roman Novak was sentenced to six years in prison for fraud in 2020, and later settled in Dubai, presenting himself as a successful crypto investor and founder of the Fintopio platform, which he claimed offered fast transfers.

BlockDAG, Pepe, Near Protocol, and Ondo Among Top Crypto Coins Right Now",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/scarcity-or-hype-blockdag-pepe-near-protocol-and-ondo-among-top-crypto-coins-right-now/,"Market discussions around the top crypto coins right now reflect a sector shaped by contrasting strategies, scarcity mechanics, meme‑driven volatility, institutional narratives, and long-term utility frameworks. As capital rotates between presales, established Layer‑1s, and sentiment‑fuelled tokens, traders are seeking clearer distinctions between momentum spikes and sustainable structure. Recent price movements across BlockDAG, Pepe, Near Protocol, and Ondo highlight how each project takes a unique approach to value creation, whether through fixed supply mechanics, community-driven momentum, or technical and institutional development. In today’s competitive market cycle, analyzing these different strategies provides valuable insight into how each coin positions itself for short-term opportunities and long-term relevance within the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Tactical Scarcity with Strategic ROI BlockDAG’s approach has centered not on marketing buzz, but on structural scarcity and real delivery. Now in Batch 32 at a price of $0.005, it has already sold over 44 billion BDAG out of a fixed 50 billion cap. With only 4.3 billion BDAG remaining and the presale closing on February 10, BlockDAG has entered what it calls the “Value Era.” This marks the end of bonuses and early-stage incentives, and the beginning of open-market pricing. The coin is projected to list between $0.38 and $0.43, which would translate to an 8× gain for final-phase participants. These are not speculative numbers; they are based on confirmed listings with over 20 Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges. Beyond coinsupply metrics, BlockDAG (BDAG) has built real infrastructure. More than 3.5 million mobile miners are already active, 20000+ plug-and-play X10 miners have been shipped. Institutional support also adds weight. A total of $86 million has been allocated to institutions with no private unlocks or special rights, reinforcing the message that BDAG is intended for fair market exposure. This commitment to scarcity as a mechanism of value, rather than inflated staking or artificial APYs, sets BlockDAG apart from many presale-stage projects. Pepe Riding Meme Momentum With Volatility Risks Pepe continues to be one of the most reactive assets among the top crypto coins right now. Priced at $0.00000114, with a 3.8% gain over the past week, it thrives on rapid volume spikes and social trends. Its low unit price gives it a psychological edge among retail traders looking for fast multiples, often in the sub-penny category. However, it lacks any hard utility or circulating supply constraint that could translate into consistent price support. While its community engagement is unmatched at times, its tokenomics remain fully dependent on speculation. That makes Pepe a high-risk asset in a short-term tactical setting, where entries and exits are dictated more by X posts than protocol progress. There are no major upgrades, on-chain utilities, or scaling roadmaps tied to Pepe, which places it in a very different bracket than structured Layer-1s or scarcity-mode presales like BlockDAG. Near Protocol Quiet Gains Backed by Real Utility Near Protocol has made steady gains this week, climbing 4.2% to trade at $1.41. Unlike Pepe, NEAR has an active development base and strong technical fundamentals. Its sharded architecture and scalability solutions make it a recurring name in smart contract platform debates. The price movement this week reflects more than just news cycles; it indicates rising engagement across its dApps and DeFi tools. However, NEAR faces a different challenge. It has a large circulating supply and lacks the acute scarcity driver that coins like BlockDAG use to create urgency. While NEAR continues to gain attention from developers and long-term holders, it hasn’t seen the kind of parabolic surges other tokens experience during presale-to-launch transitions. Its growth is often tied to broader L1 rotation cycles or Ethereum congestion spikes, making its moves more predictable but less aggressive. Ondo Institutional Buzz With Slower Retail Appeal Ondo is trading at $0.27, having declined 3.5% over the past 7 days. Despite the short-term pullback, Ondo has drawn increasing attention in institutional and tokenized finance discussions. Its real-world asset (RWA) narrative has made it popular among certain DeFi circles looking to connect blockchain with structured finance and bonds. But Ondo’s retail penetration is still limited. Most of its traction comes from macro-focused investors and institutional forecasts rather than public hype. Unlike BlockDAG, which has shipped hardware to users and incentivized retail engagement via on-chain mining and gamified purchasing, Ondo has taken a slower route focused on regulatory alignment and capital markets integration. Final Thoughts: Which Tactic Wins? Among the top crypto coins right now, two distinct strategies are competing for capital. Meme-driven buzz tokens like Pepe offer sharp but often unsustainable moves. Utility platforms like NEAR and finance-oriented tokens like Ondo provide technical merit but lack urgency. BlockDAG, however, enters the spotlight with a tactical blend of fixed scarcity, real delivery, and presale mechanics that reward timing. With only 4.3 billion BDAG left before its $0.005 price locks, a projected listing at $0.40, and over $435 million already raised, BlockDAG presents a sharp contrast.

Binance Offers Insights,https://cryptopotato.com/what-really-happened-in-the-crypto-market-in-october-binance-offers-insights/,"October was a very eventful month for the crypto industry. Besides marking negative returns for the first time since 2018, the month witnessed several developments that could affect the price trajectory of certain cryptocurrencies. A monthly research report by the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has offered insights into what really happened in October. Analysts have also identified trends that have begun to gain momentum in November. The Rise of Privacy-focused Chains The $19 billion liquidation on October 10, which resulted in the unwinding of excessive leverage, triggered a negative trend that led to the crypto market experiencing its first red October in seven years. The market ended last month with a 6.1% plunge amid heightened uncertainty from the U.S. government and a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Notwithstanding the decline in total crypto market capitalization, Bitcoin’s dominance increased to 59.4%, while Ethereum’s fell slightly to 12.6%. Institutional interest in Ethereum waxed strong, with new altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recording significant inflows. Additionally, privacy coins witnessed a significant surge. Transactions on the top three privacy-focused blockchains increased by more than 30%. Zcash led the trend with a 160% surge in daily transaction count. Ethereum is also working on integrating privacy features to balance confidentiality with regulatory compliance. “Advances in zero-knowledge technology and adoption by decentralized apps highlight growing market interest and positive momentum for privacy-focused solutions in the crypto ecosystem,” Binance Research explained. Will November End Positively? Besides privacy blockchains, the industry also witnessed a rising interest in x402, an open payment protocol that reactivates the HTTP 402 code. Daily transactions using this standard surpassed 720,000. Analysts found that one-click HTTP mints initially drove the growth of the protocol; however, integrations by Google and Cloudflare reinforced the momentum. Binance Research believes that the two narratives currently defining the ecosystem include the speculative and the structural. Memecoin-led mints fuel the former, while adoption from artificial intelligence (AI) agents for autonomous payments drives the latter. As November progresses, an AI model trading competition is gaining traction. This competition has analyzed several trading behaviors, disclosing that success depends more on disciplined risk management than on prediction accuracy. Analysts believe the test serves as an example for AI-driven trading projects. Meanwhile, easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s expected end to quantitative tightening in a few weeks, could provide positive market catalysts by December. It remains to be seen if November will end on a positive or negative note. The post What Really Happened in the Crypto Market in October?

With the sale of more than 684 million tokens, currently priced at $0.1166, this payment-focused project has raised over $28 million, proving that investors are betting big on utility-driven crypto. With real-world adoption confirmed and exchange listings already lined up, Remittix may go from a niche to mainstream in no time.

The project focuses on fast, low-cost international payments, allowing users to convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send them directly to global bank accounts. The concept sounds simple, but its impact is huge. For small businesses, freelancers, and families who send money abroad, Remittix eliminates the delays and high fees that plague traditional banking systems. The team’s transparent development style has also built serious investor confidence. Regular updates, open communication, and clear milestones have made it one of the most credible projects in the emerging PayFi sector. Remittix’s core idea is what sets it apart: practical use, not hype. In a market filled with coins that rely on speculation, this token stands on function and trust. Simple Tools Make Remittix Accessible To Everyday Users Remittix has positioned itself as a real-world alternative to both centralized exchanges and slow wire systems. The platform’s success lies in its simplicity: anyone can send, receive, or convert funds globally within hours, not days. Transfers crypto to fiat in over 30 currencies within 24 hours Certified by CertiK and ranked #1 for security among pre-launch tokens Officially listed on BitMart and LBank, bringing major liquidity and visibility Offers a 15% USDT referral reward, claimable every 24 hours via the Remittix dashboard The beta version of the Remittix Wallet is already live, letting community members get early access to the testing of the core features that exist within the ecosystem.

That’s what makes Remittix different: it’s not just promising innovation, it’s actively rolling it out. Why Remittix Could Be The Best Crypto To Buy Now Every bull run brings a few tokens that defy expectations, and Remittix is shaping up to be one of them.

The momentum is already building. Remittix has crossed $20 million in total funds raised, with listings on BitMart and LBank securing wider exposure. The next stage will likely focus on scaling user adoption and forming global partnerships with financial institutions. Meanwhile, the 15% referral program is rewarding early supporters who bring new users into the ecosystem, a clever incentive that builds organic growth rather than relying on influencer hype. With all these factors aligning, verified security, working technology, and clear global demand, Remittix looks set to break into top investor portfolios.

This has quickly spread speculation that a new Bitcoin hoarding campaign could be imminent. Strategy's current Bitcoin portfolio stands at 641,205 BTC. The portfolio's total market capitalization is approximately $65.45 billion, while the average cost is calculated at $74,058. This massive holding currently puts the company at a profit of approximately 37.82%, or nearly $18 billion. Bitcoin yield analysis indicates a 26.21% year-to-date performance.

Although the flagship cryptocurrency appears to be in a state of calm this weekend, a recent on-chain evaluation shows the possibility of more price corrections in the short term. Bitcoin Risk-Adjusted Returns See Growing Downturn In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, data analytics platform Arab Chain revealed that there seems to be a growing amount of risks for Bitcoin market participants on Binance. This on-chain observation revolves around the Bitcoin Sharpe Signal metric on Binance, which tracks the efficiency of the returns relative to the risks taken by investors on the world’s largest crypto exchange. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Bottom In? Latest On-Chain Data Suggests So For context, a high or positive reading from this metric indicates that investors are getting good rewards for the risks they take on. Contrarily, a low or negative reading suggests the predominance of volatility over returns — a typical sign of waning investor confidence. According to Arab Chain, the Sharpe Signal has recently fallen to a negative value of about -0.277. What’s interesting is, this occurred around the same period when Bitcoin saw a decline to the $101,747 level. This indicates what the analyst described as “a clear decline in the quality of risk-adjusted returns on Binance.” Prior to this decline in the Sharpe Signal, the Binance network had consistently seen values above 0.2 — a period of “reward-over-risk” between July and September. It is worth mentioning that this period also coincided with a run of relatively positive momentum for the Bitcoin price. Outlook For Bitcoin Price Regardless of the weakening Sharpe Signal, Arab Chain explained that a full-scale capitulation is not necessarily what is in play. At the moment, there appears still to be a relatively stable amount of trading volume. This means the current decline is not directly being driven by liquidations or impulsive sales. Instead, it suggests less involvement of institutional investors. As a result, the market may just be experiencing a temporary correction or “cooldown” phase, as is expected after major price rallies. In a case where risk remains relatively higher than the rewards (more negative or sustained negative Sharpe Signal readings), the Bitcoin price could see more correctional movement, especially in the short term. However, the Bitcoin market could quickly see a local price bottom formation if the Bitcoin Sharpe Signal on Binance ascends into the positive region. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at approximately $101,750, reflecting no significant price change in the past 24 hours.

A 12-Second Historic MEV Boost ‘Heist’ In May 2024, the US Department of Justice announced an indictment against Anton and James Pepaire-Bueno, accusing the two MIT-trained brothers of a conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. According to the DOJ, the Pepaire-Bueno siblings stole $25 million in ETH in a first-of-its-kind heist targeting the prominent blockchain network. Notably, the brothers had explored a flaw in the Ethereum MEV Boost system, allowing them to view hidden pending transactions: Acting as a block builder, they “poisoned” a block to trick trading bots into revealing their strategies, then executed a sandwich attack, buying a large volume of ETH before another trader’s order and selling immediately after the price rose. This attack was targeted at a trio of cryptocurrency traders, allowing them to net a profit of $25 million in just 12 seconds. According to a report by Business Insider, in the case presented to the US District Judge Jessica Clarke for the Southern District of New York, the prosecutors likened the crypto trade hustle to a common fraud. Assistant US District Danielle Marie Kudla stated that creating a poison block was an act of deceit against other traders that should be punished by law. However, the lawyers of the defendants countered this narrative, stating the Pepaire-Bueno brothers had not operated beyond the bounds of trading in a bot-eat-bot world of Ethereum. Jury Fails To Convict Or Acquit ‘MEV Brothers’ On Friday, November 7, the jury in the case struggled to reach a unanimous verdict, according to Business Insider. The 12-man team. stated the peculiar case that had undergone a four-week trial had resulted in significant personal emotional cost. Notably, some jurors had broken down into tears during deliberations, while others complained of sleeplessness over the three days of deliberation. Moreover, one juror was scheduled to travel on Saturday, according to the Inner City Press . Following the motion for a mistrial, the prosecutors were willing to move the case to Monday and continue with 11 jurors. However, Judge Clarke opted to declare a mistrial as she strongly believed an extension would solve the jury’s confusion. While this ruling might provide some relief for the Pepaire-Bueno brothers, it’s worth noting that the charges remain active and prosecutors can still move for another trial.

As the market evolves, investors increasingly focus on structural factors such as token distribution, supply design, network utility, and ecosystem development. These elements shape how different assets position themselves for the next market cycle, especially as competition intensifies across both new and established networks. Whether driven by scarcity, interoperability, privacy technology, or legacy adoption, each project presents a unique framework for long-term value. This article compares several leading contenders to show how distinct models influence performance and perception within the rapidly shifting crypto landscape. BlockDAG: Scarcity Meets Strategic Market Entry BlockDAG has become the center of discussion among analysts evaluating top crypto projects for 2025. Its scarcity-based approach and carefully timed presale mechanics differentiate it from many legacy coins. With the presale ending on February 10, fewer than 4.3 billion BDAG coins remain from its 50 billion total supply cap. The current presale batch 32 is priced at $0.005, and with over $435 million raised, institutional participation has already validated the project’s long-term credibility. The BlockDAG market debut is projected to reach around $0.40, translating to an 8× potential gain from the current entry point. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its clear shift into what it calls the “Value Era”, where scarcity, exchange integration, and coin distribution converge to create momentum before listings. Over 20 Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchange partnerships are confirmed, underscoring its broad accessibility at launch. This scarcity-led valuation model has placed BlockDAG among the top crypto projects not just for short-term trading, but also for strategic long-term positioning. The team’s commitment to transparency, along with CEO Antony Turner’s statement emphasizing roadmap stability and community strength, signals that BlockDAG is building more than hype; it’s laying down measurable fundamentals. Aster (ASTER): Riding Momentum Through Utility Expansion Aster (ASTER), currently trading around $1.09 USD, has recorded a 12.6 percent increase in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap. Its recent momentum is tied to ongoing developments in cross-chain interoperability and network scaling. The Aster network continues to attract liquidity through its smart contract functionality, which allows developers to build decentralized applications across multiple chains with enhanced transaction speed and cost efficiency. While Aster’s recent surge reflects positive sentiment, its volatility remains linked to network adoption cycles rather than limited supply or scarcity mechanics. This gives short-term traders opportunities for rotation gains but limits long-term scarcity-driven appreciation. Compared with BlockDAG, which ties valuation growth to capped supply and early-phase distribution, Aster relies primarily on utility metrics and developer adoption. Still, Aster holds a key position among top crypto projects because of its robust community engagement and consistent upgrades. However, without a scarcity component or deflationary trigger, it may not sustain the same price acceleration momentum expected from scarcity-anchored tokens like BlockDAG. ZCash (ZEC): Privacy Coin Showing Revival Through Volume Growth ZCash (ZEC) has experienced a notable 45 percent price rise week-over-week, recently quoted at around $388 USD on KuCoin. The privacy-focused asset has benefited from renewed institutional interest in privacy-enabled protocols, particularly following global discussions around transaction anonymity and data security. ZCash’s price movement, however, often tracks macro sentiment in the broader crypto privacy segment. Its current market structure suggests high volatility, with potential for short-term continuation but uncertain medium-term sustainability. The absence of new technological catalysts or token burns places its upside largely in the hands of market traders and speculative demand. Comparatively, BlockDAG’s market debut strategy, anchored in predictable scarcity and post-listing liquidity, offers investors more structured entry points. While ZCash retains relevance as one of the original privacy coins, its momentum may fluctuate as investors seek newer, scarcity-backed models with defined launch trajectories. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Legacy Strength, Limited Growth Drivers Bitcoin Cash (BCH) remains one of the more established assets in the top crypto projects category, trading near $555 USD with a 24-hour range showing moderate volatility, according to Investing.com. As a legacy fork of Bitcoin, BCH continues to attract loyal supporters for its role in facilitating faster, cheaper transactions. However, its market narrative has become repetitive, with little innovation or ecosystem expansion to re-ignite major upside. The coin’s market stability is commendable, yet growth prospects remain capped due to saturation and a lack of fresh utility incentives. While BCH is likely to maintain relevance as a transactional token, its trajectory does not reflect the same asymmetrical opportunity that BlockDAG’s scarcity-based model provides. Investors positioning for future-oriented growth are increasingly shifting attention to assets with clear supply constraints, strong exchange pipelines, and ongoing community engagement. Summary As investors weigh the top crypto projects for 2025 , the contrast between scarcity-backed strategies and legacy-driven models is becoming clearer. BlockDAG, with its $435 million presale, $0.005 current batch price, and $0.40 market debut target, represents the new standard of structured valuation and disciplined tokenomics. Meanwhile, Aster, ZCash, and Bitcoin Cash sustain their relevance through network utility and historic brand value, yet lack the scarcity component driving next-cycle gains. For investors focusing on both near-term returns and strategic positioning, BlockDAG’s Value Era signals a pivotal moment in the evolution of crypto assets built for long-term sustainability.

Ripple has just closed a $500 million funding round at a $40 billion valuation, and while traders debate how high XRP can run, a PayFi DeFi project is quietly appearing on best crypto to buy now lists. The backdrop is ideal for both fear and FOMO. One of the sharpest pullbacks of 2025 briefly wiped out most of the gains before buyers stepped back in, a reset that can make a mega bullish XRP price prediction realistic, and that can also send early-stage crypto investment stories, such as Remittix, moving much faster. XRP Price Prediction For November: ETF Hype Versus Market Jitters XRP is trading around $2.30 today, down about 5 % to 8 % on the week but up more than 5 % in the last 24 hours as dip buyers return. Traders are watching the $2.20 to $2.30 support band closely, since holding that zone keeps any constructive XRP price prediction alive, while a daily close above roughly $2.35 could invite a push toward $2.54 to $2.80 and possibly $2.90 to $3.05 if ETF optimism accelerates. Bitcoin has slipped back under $108,000 after whales reportedly sold more than $600 million in a few days, and total crypto market value recently dropped by close to $1 trillion, yet research desks still flag XRP as a leading payment network while also noting that the biggest multiples often come from an undervalued crypto project that locks in a real-world trend early. Why A PayFi DeFi Project Like Remittix Is On Best Crypto To Buy Now Lists Remittix fits that gap as a PayFi-driven DeFi project that aims to fix cross-border payments instead of chasing meme cycles. Its rails convert a wide basket of cryptocurrencies into local bank payouts in more than 30 countries, with fees that feel closer to a low gas fee crypto than a legacy transfer. Crucially, the numbers are already moving. Remittix has raised over $28 million so far, with over 684 million RTX tokens sold and a growing base of more than 40,000 investors. The token is still available at $0.1166 at the time of writing, before the next planned price step. The wallet beta is live, community users are testing real transfers, and the first centralized exchange listings on BitMart and LBank are confirmed, with another major listing in progress. On top of that, the team is fully verified by CertiK, which is widely viewed as a leading blockchain security firm, and Remittix currently holds the top slot on its pre-launch token rankings. Analysts who quietly rank Remittix as a candidate for best crypto to buy now point to a mix of fundamentals that is difficult to ignore: Remittix has a single focus on everyday global payments for freelancers, businesses, and remitters, which can support steady on-chain activity rather than only speculative spikes. RTX sits at the core of fees, access tiers, and future rewards, so investors gain a direct link to ecosystem usage, not just distant governance votes. The PayFi model targets expensive remittance corridors, positioning RTX as a serious contender among top crypto under $1 options with real-world use. Live wallet testing, growing community metrics, and CertiK verification together suggest an undervalued crypto project that is already delivering product, not only promises. Compared with XRP, which now trades at a far higher valuation under constant ETF and regulatory headlines, Remittix still lives in the part of the curve where one strong year can change portfolios. If you read this while the token sits near $0.1166 and look away, the risk is simple. Other investors may lock in that early position in what could become the next 100x crypto narrative, and the real regret will be watching RTX move without you.

The token has already increased from its initial presale price of $0.001 to roughly $0.012, reflecting the strong presale momentum. With this momentum, analysts estimate that Ozak AI could see 500× to 1,000× growth from its initial phase within the 2025 – 2030 period. As the AI-crypto sector moves into its next major bull cycle, Ozak AI is shaping up to be one of the projects worth watching. Ozak AI’s Presale: Still Open for Early Investors Ozak AI’s presale is started earlier this year with a price of $0.001, then moved to $0.003, $0.005 and currently each token costs $0.012. So the early investors are already 12x up from the current price. With this strong investor demand, presale funding has been raised over $4 million. As the current phase is going to end soon, the next Phase price is set at $0.014, and the end projected price is at $1. So, the doors are still open to the early investors to buy now and may get an immediate 16.7% increase in value when the $OZ token moves to Phase 7. $OZ Tokenomics and Utility Within the Ecosystem Ozak AI distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market by providing a transparent, organized, and utility-driven ecosystem. The $10 billion fixed supply of the $OZ token guarantees its long-term worth and scarcity. Also,a clear 30% was allocated for the presale, and it presents a comprehensive whitepaper , which details the token distribution and use cases. The $OZ token users can use premium AI agents for analytics tools, earn performance-based awards, and make cryptocurrency predictions. Then, it includes governance, fee reductions, and staking. Ozak AI is becoming more and more accepted by early investors due to its innovative features and beneficial use cases. Ozak AI‘s Innovative Features Ozak AI is positioned as a blockchain-based intelligence technology. Its main aim is to analyze real-time data and forecast market behavior up to date; for that, it uses machine learning models, including neural networks, and combines with ARIMA, to give traders and institutions reasonably accurate risk assessments and financial predictions. It also offers Customizable Prediction Agents for its own trading purposes and Ozak Data vaults to secure the personal data. To strengthen this ecosystem, Ozak AI has formed several trusted partnerships to enhance its platform. Among those recent ones are Phala Network , which establishes the foundation for a privacy-preserving AI infrastructure and enables Ozak AI to accelerate the processes. Then, tie up with AIxBlock to speed up AI model training by utilizing decentralized GPU resources, allowing no-code automation. Ozak AI Growth Forecast 2025-2030 Given the state of the financial markets today, Ozak AI's emphasis on AI automation, real-time data systems, and decentralized computing is greatly needed. So, analysts think that the project may experience long-term growth. And the token's value might reach $0.50 by 2026, which could be 500x returns. If Ozak AI keeps up its roadmap and increases the platform's practical applications and maintains this strong momentum, it may surpass $1.00 by 2030, which would represent a 1000x increase from its initial presale price of $0.001. Conclusion: Despite the fact that early presale supporters have already witnessed notable increases in value from $0.001 to $0.012, analysts contend that the project is still in its early stages of valuation. The current stage however provides a strategic entry point for those who missed previous phases, ahead of the next wave of value increase during the 2025–2030 AI-crypto expansion.

The crypto market's revitalization, especially in AI cryptocurrency sectors, positions Ozak AI as a compelling investment opportunity with its ongoing presale. Investment Opportunities in Ozak AI's Ongoing Presale The initial phases of the Ozak AI presale kicked off with tokens priced at just $0.001 and have seen a gradual increase to $0.012. The ongoing presale has already attracted over $4 million in investments, signaling strong market confidence and investor interest. As the presale progresses, each phase escalates in price, with the next set at $0.014—a potential immediate gain of 16.7% for new investors before the price targets the forecasted $1 mark.

Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after this price surge? While timing markets is challenging, many analysts believe Bitcoin still has long-term growth potential.

It called the post an “update regarding previous and ongoing efforts to address and mitigate” the current issues. However, rather than soothe already hot tempers, the post has backfired , triggering a new wave of criticism. Details from Re7 Labs’ post The long post from Re7 Labs details the steps the team has been taking to mitigate risk and, where feasible, to prevent or minimize potential losses. The post detailed things like what happened, the actions the team took afterward, and the current status of things in the xUSD Euler Markets, deUSD, and sdeUSD markets on Plume, and sUSDX and USDX markets on BSC. In all three cases, Re7 Labs claimed to have noticed something was wrong, even though no proactive action was taken until after the market crash. For example, with xUSD, it was not until after the market crash on October 10 that Re7 Labs’ due diligence had complaints that were so easily brushed aside with assurances from Stream’s CEO of stability. In Elixir’s case , the team let borrowing in Re7 Labs Euler Earn USDT0 vault on Plasma go on until it became uncomfortable, after which it allegedly asked Elixir to start to pay back some of the outstanding debt. Still, it was not until after it was found that Stream was borrowing against Elixir assets that the team took real action, introducing reduced caps and reallocated funds. Meanwhile, Elixir repaid the sdeUSD position on Plume by November 6, eliminating Re7-curated exposure. As for Stable Labs, the Re7 Labs team claimed to have caught discrepancies on November 4, but when the team reached out to ask them to “justify how they could afford to borrow at those rates and why they weren’t unwinding those positions,” they got no meaningful response. Since there was no further action, Re7 Labs set a strict deadline demanding repayment of all outstanding positions by November 5. The next day, on November 6, all that came from the CEO were contradictory statements, which prompted Re7 Labs to disable borrowing and reduce LLTVs/fees. It has also demanded liquidity deposits into specific markets to enable users to unwind their positions. However, no response has been received. To conclude the post, Re7 Labs claimed its role as a curator has limitations, but that the team will continue to actively look for ways to resolve these issues while providing timely updates. Community response to the Re7 Labs update The update was supposed to be a lengthy tell-all to quell much of the anger brewing against Re7 Labs as a curator, but it has had the opposite effect. Its role as curator meant Re7 Labs had the responsibility of setting the lending parameters, collateral limits, and risk controls in vaults where users deposited stablecoins like USDT0, exposing them to these borrowers. While the team made it seem like it was able to spot issues quickly and attempt to rectify them, the report has revealed an important fact that many users did not fail to point out in the comment section; the team failed in its job as a curator. Not only did it take the words of Stream Finance’s CEO of stability at face value, but users say it could have done better due diligence as a risk curator, and that if it had, the crisis may have been averted. There were also complaints about how the update only talks about data people already have, rather than providing solutions to the existing issues. The total mapped exposure across DeFi from the Stream Finance collapse is estimated at $284-285 million in debt across seven networks, involving curators like Re7 Labs, MEV Capital, Varlamore, and TelosC. The Stream Finance breakdown was the third major DeFi incident within a number of days, following a $128 million Balancer exploit on November 3 and a $1 million oracle manipulation on Moonwell.

The Graph 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of The Graph confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value has decreased to $0.0648 over the last 24 hours. In addition, the prevailing volatility levels suggest a higher chance of a reversal or further decrease in the price levels. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to comparatively high volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has moved to $0.0704. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.0549. GRT/USD 1-day price chart.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives a relatively bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s price decreased to $0.0648 in the past 24 hours. A continuation of the current price action might diminish any opportunities for investors. The high volatility on the daily chart shows that there is a high chance of further price dips, which, if they occur, can lead to a retest of the $0.0628 support. Why is GRT down? The decrease in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Moreover, the past few days supported the bulls, as the price was increasing, so the coin is moving down today after finding resistance. Will GRT reach $0.5? The Graph token should reach near $0.5 in 2030. In that year, the price will range between $0.418268 and $0.453124. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ The Graph Forecast, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

After weeks of range-bound majors and dips driven by the government shutdown, capital is rotating into crypto presales. Traders are uncertain about market direction in the short term, and presales provide early-stage upside while dodging intraday volatility. The race to find the best cryptos to buy has two main contenders: Digitap ($TAP) and BlockchainFX (BFX). Digitap is the world’s first omni-bank built for the stablecoin era, and BlockchainFX is a trading “super app” pitching on-chain stocks and synthetic equities. One has already rolled out a Visa debit card, while the other is targeting a niche that has historically struggled with volume and faces serious regulatory headwinds. In the rush to find altcoins to buy, increasingly, investors and traders are turning to $TAP. Here’s why. Digitap: an Omni-Bank for the stablecoin decade Digitap’s core promise is to erase the line between fiat and crypto, presenting money as a single, borderless system. The app is now live on iOS and Android, finally bringing crypto and fiat together. This unified finance platform offers deposits, swaps, transfers, remittances, payroll, and Visa card spending—everything anyone needs to manage all their finances. However, the reason $TAP is being called one of the best cryptos to buy now is that, at its core, it has a multi-rail architecture. Digitap can settle transactions on public blockchains or established banking corridors such as SWIFT, SEPA, Faster Payments, and ACH. It selects the rail by cost and speed and then executes in real time. Users who want to send money to a friend in another country or a business that needs to pay an international invoice can now do so in minutes. The user experience remains familiar, like any fintech app, while the engine beneath supercharges the experience. In the increasingly dominated utility-led market of 2025, Digitap’s offering of providing a modern neobank feel on the outside with crypto rails under the hood has sent this presale soaring past $1.6 million in record time. Tipped as an app that can onboard millions of people to use stablecoins without even knowing it, $TAP is a clear leader for winning the crown of best crypto presale in 2025. BlockchainFX (BFX): The super trading app BlockchainFX positions itself as a trading “super app,” aiming to enable the world to trade on-chain stocks and synthetic equities, and offer a comprehensive brokerage-like experience. The pitch is highly ambitious. But unfortunately, the headwinds look structural. Historically, on-chain stock markets and synthetic equity platforms have struggled with liquidity fragmentation, limited market depth, and complex regulatory regimes across jurisdictions. Equities are securities, and products that emulate them tend to run into headaches. BFX should still be able to carve out a niche, but with big competition from platforms like Hyperliquid, which recently introduced stock trading, it will have to pull all the stops out. The use case is simply not as clear as the stablecoin-led consumer payments narrative that already has proven demand and a clear distribution path. Which is the better crypto presale in 2025? $TAP vs. BFX Digitap’s biggest advantage is its distribution. Recently partnering with Visa, a great signal of legitimacy, it has rolled out virtual and physical cards that allow on-chain balances to plug into millions of checkouts globally. Turning altcoin and stablecoin balances into daily spending money is a leading reason why Digitap keeps showing up on shortlists of the best altcoins to buy in Q4. Both projects are highly ambitious, but they are not competing in the same field. BlockchainFX pursues a challenging, heavily regulated trading vertical. Whereas Digitap is operating in a secular growth lane— 2025 is a stablecoin gold rush —and Digitap leverages this to provide real-world settlement and improve cross-border payments. Additionally, the app already being live is very rare among crypto presales, signalling high confidence from the team. $TAP can be purchased for just $0.0297 today, but investors will have to be quick because it will jump to $0.0313 in the next round. As investors rush to find the best cryptos to buy, an omni-bank riding the stablecoin narrative looks like an easy winner.

Although some coins, such as Dogecoin, have potential growth, a great revolution is waiting for its emergence because of high-utility projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new defi crypto project is quickly making waves and generating investment attention, not because of hype but because of its actual development roadmap and presale, which is breaking records. Its soon-to-be-achieved success is expected to reshape what is considered optimal when it comes to investing within this market cycle, possibly eclipsing mere improvement expected of more established altcoins. Dogecoin’s Journey: Steady But Slow Current technical analysis of Dogecoin indicates a positively optimistic future projection. Having reached an altitude of $0.168, this altcoin is currently on a recovery trend after its correction cycle. Market indicators denote that the buying pressures are trying to break through a resistance point of $0.171. Future market estimates project a possible highest point of $0.86 by the end of 2028, quite an appreciable growth that still draws its devoted audience. Although this is a positive trend, its progress is organically tied to social sentiment and does not possess underlying mechanics for generating returns that would characterize the new breed of outstanding cryptocurrencies. As an investor weighing their option of what crypto to buy and hold, then Dogecoin is more about investing in a popular brand than technology that truly disrupts. Mutuum Finance Presale: The Final Chance at Ground Pricing On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a very attractive and urgent opportunity as well. In fact, this project’s presale has become one of a kind, raising an impressive sum of $18,500,000 from an increasingly large number of holders, currently at 17,810, and has reached its climax, as they have already filled phase six 85% at only $0.035, and this is actually the final moment to buy tokens at this price. There is close to a 20% price surge that will be triggered once Phase 7 is opened, and this will see the price go up to $0.040. This is strategically planned such that people who are currently investing will be on target for a potential return of as high as 400% once it is launched at a price of $0.06. Peeking into a Revolutionary Dual-Market Ecosystem The presale trend is, therefore, basically fueled by the innovation that Mutuum Finance has brought about through its protocol design. Mutuum Finance is actually spearheading a bi-market loan platform that harmoniously combines efficiency and flexibility for users. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) platform provides automated yield earning on large assets such as ETH and USDT through community-managed pools. On the other hand, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market platform facilitates customized loan contracts for other types of assets as well. Such advanced infrastructure on the platform ensures that Mutuum Finance becomes more than just an emerging crypto, as it is designed for both general and institutional investors, thereby making it a tough competitor as a defi crypto. Incentivizing Early Adoption and Ensuring Security Mutuum Finance will boost its presale offering through community incentives. There is a leaderboard that runs on a daily cycle of 24 hours, and this helps create some kind of healthy competition, as the number one community member wins a bonus of $500 MUTM tokens, and this cycle is repeated daily at 00:00 UTC. Additionally, Mutuum Finance has launched a historic presale reward of $100,000 , and this will see each of ten lucky members win $10,000. This is complemented by dedication to community interaction and an equal dedication to safety, as reflected by a completed audit on the platform’s integrity through Certik, ensuring that it is one of the best cryptos to buy today. There is undeniable investment potential due to the coming together of a near sold-out presale phase, advanced technology infrastructure, and powerful investor incentives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has developed a framework that supports growth, making it the next big crypto that has utility value. Although Dogecoin is likely to keep going up, its potential is nothing compared to that of MUTM. The time to invest before its price becomes more expensive is running out, and thus doing it now is the most optimal strategy for any trader looking to create a solid cryptocurrency portfolio.

Schiff's statements quickly sparked controversy on social media, with some users reminding them that the economist had issued similar warnings 12 years ago when BTC surged to $1,000. Related News: This Year's Bitcoin Data for November Is Unusual - Here's a Comparison with Previous Years Among the criticisms leveled at Schiff was the question, “If $100,000 is a historic opportunity, why are you recommending a sell?” Schiff responded by saying that Bitcoin might never surpass $100,000 again due to an impending price drop.

According to real-time market data from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $102,982.66 on the Binance USDT market, marking a concerning downturn for investors. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? Market analysts point to several factors influencing the current Bitcoin price movement. The digital asset has been facing increased selling pressure amid broader market uncertainty. However, experienced traders recognize that such corrections often create new buying opportunities for long-term investors. The recent Bitcoin price action reflects typical market cycles where periods of consolidation follow significant gains. Market sentiment remains divided between those seeing this as a temporary pullback and others concerned about deeper corrections ahead. How Should Investors React to Bitcoin Price Volatility? Understanding market psychology is crucial when the Bitcoin price shows volatility. Here are key considerations for investors: Dollar-cost averaging remains an effective strategy during price dips Historical data shows Bitcoin has recovered from similar corrections Market fundamentals for cryptocurrency adoption continue to strengthen Technical indicators suggest potential support levels below current prices The current Bitcoin price movement serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent volatility. However, many experts believe the long-term trajectory for digital assets remains positive despite short-term fluctuations. Where Could the Bitcoin Price Go From Here? Technical analysis suggests several possible scenarios for the Bitcoin price in coming days. The $100,000 level represents a significant psychological support zone that could determine near-term direction. Market participants are closely watching trading volumes and institutional activity for clues about next moves. Meanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve with increasing institutional adoption and regulatory developments. These fundamental factors may ultimately have greater impact on the Bitcoin price than short-term technical movements. Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts The recent Bitcoin price action underscores several important lessons for market participants. Volatility is an inherent characteristic of cryptocurrency markets, and successful investors develop strategies to navigate these fluctuations. The current Bitcoin price below $103,000 may represent either a warning signal or an opportunity depending on individual investment horizons and risk tolerance. As the market digests this Bitcoin price movement, remember that cryptocurrency investing requires both patience and perspective. Today’s price action forms just one chapter in the ongoing story of digital asset adoption. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to drop below $103,000? The Bitcoin price decline resulted from combined factors including profit-taking, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic concerns affecting cryptocurrency markets. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? While the current Bitcoin price may present buying opportunities for some investors, individual decisions should align with personal risk tolerance and investment strategy. How low could Bitcoin price go? Market analysts identify several support levels, with $100,000 representing a key psychological barrier that could influence future Bitcoin price movement. Will Bitcoin recover from this drop? Historical patterns show Bitcoin has recovered from similar corrections, though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results in cryptocurrency markets. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Investment decisions should consider your financial goals and time horizon rather than reacting solely to short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin price movements often influence the broader cryptocurrency market, though individual assets may show varying degrees of correlation.

While both continue to show strong community backing, a new wave of innovation is redefining investor attention. Among the rising names is Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi-focused project that’s quickly building momentum through its real-world payment utility and global partnerships. With over $28 million already raised through private funding, Remittix’s impact is being felt across the market, signaling that change is closer than many expect. Cardano and Dogecoin Hold Their Ground Cardano is currently selling at $0.5652 following a significant gain of about 9.37% in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $20.65 billion. Dogecoin is currently selling at $0.1761 following a significant gain of about 9.53% with a market capitalization of about $27.46 billion. Analysts point out that newer coins like Hyperliquid, Zcash, and Remittix are drawing attention with greater technical or practical use cases, whereas Cardano concentrates on blockchain scalability, and Dogecoin lives on community enthusiasm. The New Contenders to Watch Hyperliquid (HLP) has impressed with a 7.2% price increase to $40.60, supported by a $13.86 billion market cap. Its $581.71 million trading volume, though down by 7.96%, shows sustained liquidity from institutional investors. Zcash (ZEC), known for its privacy layer, saw a pullback of 13.61% to $534.67, yet its trading volume surged 146.69% to $4.64 billion, suggesting active buying on dips. Both tokens have technical potential, but it’s Remittix (RTX) that’s capturing broader mainstream interest through real-world application rather than speculation. Why Remittix Is Surging Ahead Remittix (RTX) , priced at $0.1166, is being recognized as one of the best DeFi projects of 2025, connecting crypto and fiat payments seamlessly. The project allows users to send digital assets directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, a major advancement for global remittance and business payments. Key Highlights: $28M+ raised in private funding, signaling strong investor confidence CertiK verified and ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens for security and transparency Future listings confirmed with BitMart and LBank Wallet Beta Testing is live, opening access to top iOS holders Remittix’s growing recognition also comes from its ability to merge traditional finance with blockchain through its crypto-to-fiat PayFi model. The project recently launched a 50% bonus campaign before its $30 million milestone announcement, alongside a $250,000 giveaway aimed at rewarding its expanding global community. Building Trust and Real Utility Unlike many of the meme-based assets, such as the DOGE ETF, Remittix had a focus on practical use. Full integration with traditional payment systems and verification by CertiK adds a layer of legitimacy often not seen in early crypto projects. And with continued momentum, experts believe Remittix is a top crypto under $1, combining security, utility, and innovation for strong long-term growth.

This one came after a rather interesting promise by US President Donald Trump, who said that many Americans, aside from high-income people, would get a dividend of at least $2,000 per person. BREAKING: President Trump announces that he will be paying a “tariff dividend” of at least $2,000 per person. Stimulus checks are officially back. pic.twitter.com/Dt4UgHVMrT — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 9, 2025 Trump’s promise came after he defended the tariffs against numerous nations that he imposed during his current presidential run. The US Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments on whether these tariffs are even legal, while multiple experts have spoken against them. These dividends of at least $2,000 reminded of similar ‘free money checks’ that many Americans received – the stimulus sent during the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, when countless businesses had to close temporarily and people were left without jobs, the US government began sending checks of $1,200 to people. The ever-vigilant and vocal crypto community started to speculate whether these funds were used to purchase crypto, and many altcoins exploded shortly after, which intensified the rumors. Interestingly, BTC’s price, alongside most altcoins, spiked in the past few hours after Trump made his announcements, which brought comparisons between the two events. For now, though, bitcoin jumped from under $102,000 to $104,000 within minutes, while ETH is up by more than 4% and trades above $3,500. ZEC continues to outperform following another 24% surge to $650. XMR follows suit with a 19% pump. BTCUSD.

While volatility has cooled down, the structure is showing signs of potential weakness. Buyers have yet to show strong signs of re-entry, and with the recent flush in open interest, the market remains cautious. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has broken below both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, located around the $110K mark, indicating that short-term momentum has shifted bearish. The price is currently hovering around the key $100K level, which acted as support during recent corrections. The RSI is also sitting near 36, showing that the market is approaching oversold territory, but not quite there yet. There’s a risk of continuation lower if the buyers fail to defend this zone, with the next major support sitting around $95K. Overall, the daily structure looks heavy, and recovery above the $108K–$110K zone is needed to flip the outlook back to bullish. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4-hour timeframe, the market recently broke down from a rising wedge pattern and retested it as resistance before continuing lower. Momentum remains weak, and attempts to bounce from the $100K zone have failed so far. The price is holding just above the $100K–$101K support block, but the structure remains fragile. Any loss of this level could lead to a fast drop toward the next demand area near $95K. The RSI on the 4H is also near 41, showing some room for further downside, though not aggressively oversold. Sentiment Analysis Open Interest Open interest has taken a significant hit recently, dropping from above $45B to under $33B over the past few weeks. This wipeout reflects a broad de-leveraging, likely driven by liquidations of aggressive long positions. Such a reset often clears out froth, but the fact that OI hasn’t rebounded yet suggests traders are still risk-off. The lack of fresh leverage entering the market implies that participants are waiting for clearer price action before re-engaging. This sentiment aligns with the choppy price behavior and shows a market still on edge despite technical support zones holding, for now.

Among cryptos that are built on the Ethereum platform, some of them have more priority than others, and some of these are situated on one end of the spectrum, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), a meme token that experienced a huge price surge primarily based on community sentiment and mere speculation, and on the other end is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is the top crypto and widely considered the best crypto to buy for early-stage investors. Where the buzz is coming from is in MUTM’s model, as it is providing a credit system and under-collateralized loan system that is decentralized, meaning that users can get access to funds without having to lock up large sums of money upfront. Whereas other tokens exist based on trying to create enough buzz to go viral, MUTM has actual utility and application through its yield-sharing mechanism and stable demand through borrowers and liquidity providers. With its presale, currently trading at about $0.035, having already moved relatively quickly, it is clear that market support is present. Where investors find themselves is trying to decide whether to back based on speculative culture (SHIB) or actual application (MUTM), which is being recognized as the top crypto and the best crypto to buy for the 2025 cycle. Shiba Inu Price Outlook: Bears Remain in Control Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently finding it hard to muster enough strength, having fallen below an essential support point and thereby marking a clear transition of power in favor of the bears. Moreover, SHIB has managed to breakout of its previous range and is currently trading within an descending channel, a clear indication of a forthcoming fall. From a technical analysis point of view, breaking above or below the range of $0.0000093-$0.0000095 is essential, or else it may fall sharply towards the range of $0.0000080-$0.0000075. Although some fundamental believers have managed to accumulate, currently, the market trend is bearish, and there is no definite sign of buying strength. It is because of this growing uncertainty that many investors have begun to look towards more emerging projects on the Ethereum platform that have more defined growth catalysts, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become one of them, widely recognized as the top crypto and regarded as the best crypto to buy by analysts and early adopters alike. Mutuum Finance Presale Sees Significant Worldwide Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging quite quickly as one of the most popular projects of 2025, and it is gathering a lot of attention within the DeFi space. With more than 17,810 participants and raising over $18.5 million, this project is gaining considerable trust and expanding adoption worldwide quite quickly, thereby strengthening its position as the top crypto and the best crypto to buy for investors seeking real utility and high-growth potential. At present, this project is still on Phase 6 of its presale, trading its tokens at a rate of $0.035, presenting an ideal time for investors to get on board before its price increases by an additional 20% as it enters Phase 7, up to the rate of $0.04. Easy and Seamless Onboarding via Direct Card Payments To enhance accessibility, Mutuum Finance has recently made it possible for users to buy tokens directly via Credit and Debit Cards on its official site. No need for complex onboarding and technical wallet implementation, as previously required, and Mutuum Finance is now easier than ever for beginner and experienced investors alike to participate in, thanks to this improvement that keeps Mutuum Finance at the forefront of user-centric DeFi projects that prioritize applicability and accessibility. Progressing Towards the Launch of the V1 DeFi Protocol Mutuum Finance is going on to Phase 2 of its development lifecycle, as it begins work on developing its DeFi protocol for its platform, V1. Some of these changes include adding lending and borrowing functionality via smart contracts, as well as improving its user interface and backend system functionality for scalability and reliability purposes. Mutuum Finance is approaching a Sepolia testnet, which is intended to help them test its functionality before launching it officially on its platform. Strong Coin For Long Term Growth In The DeFi Market With swift presale progress, growing accessibility, and active technological development, Mutuum Finance is emerging as one of the most prominent up-and-coming projects of 2025 in the cryptocurrency market. According to many observers, based on growing investor faith and value, MUTM is the top crypto and considered the best crypto to buy today, especially as anticipation builds for its next big phase of development and implementation. Mutuum Finance has managed to raise more than $18.5 million from over 17,810 investors, and Phase 6 of its presale is more than 85% sold out at a price of $0.035. Its utility and scalable growth potential lie in its innovative model of under-collateralized lending, its flawless credit and loan system, as well as its soon-to-be-released V1 DeFi protocol on Sepolia testnet. Traditional meme currencies such as Shiba Inu remain under constant bear market pressures, and Mutuum is the top crypto and the best crypto to buy for the coming market cycle. Take part in the Mutuum Finance presale today and get tokens before the price jump that will occur during Phase 7, taking it to $0.04.

54205262,624363,1762704011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54205262.jpeg,"Bitcoin 1st, Zcash 2nd: Arthur Hayes’ Surprising Portfolio Move",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-1st-zcash-2nd-arthur-hayes-surprising-portfolio-move/,"Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has revealed that Zcash (ZEC) is now the second-largest liquid holding in his family office, Maelstrom, trailing only Bitcoin. According to his post on X, the shift follows a rapid run-up in ZEC’s market value that has moved the coin back into the conversation among big investors. Hayes Names Zcash Second Biggest Asset Based on reports, Zcash has risen dramatically since September, gaining more than 700% over that span and hitting intraday highs above $700 earlier this month. That surge pushed ZEC back into the top 20 coins by market capitalization, with several outlets placing its market cap in the roughly $9 billion to $11 billion range as trading volumes spiked. The price moves are being linked to renewed interest in privacy features and a wave of retail and speculative flows. Due to the rapid ascent in price, $ZEC is now the 2nd largest *LIQUID* holding in @MaelstromFund portfolio behind $BTC . — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 7, 2025 Bold Targets Spark Attention Reports have noted that Hayes has floated an aggressive long-term target for ZEC — $10,000 — a figure that grabbed headlines and helped fuel further buying. He described ZEC as Maelstrom ’s second-largest liquid holding, though he stopped short of listing the exact dollar amount or the percentage of the portfolio represented. That detail has left observers guessing about how big a stake Maelstrom actually holds. in a Friday post on X, Hayes wrote: “Due to the rapid ascent in price, ZEC is now the second largest *LIQUID* holding in MaelstromFund portfolio behind BTC.” Privacy Coins Draw Renewed Attention Analysts and market commentaries say the rally has put a spotlight back on privacy coins, with Zcash’s shielded-transaction options often cited as a core technical feature behind the token’s narrative. At the same time, privacy tokens carry an extra layer of regulatory risk in some jurisdictions, and some exchanges or services have in the past tightened access to such assets. That mix of promise and caution is part of why ZEC’s jump is drawing close scrutiny. Supply Events And On-Chain Activity Traders will be watching several concrete things: on-chain metrics for shielded versus transparent transfers, exchange flows and whether large holders move coins, and the effect of a scheduled Zcash supply change expected in mid-November that will cut miner rewards — an event some traders say could tighten available supply. Volatility has been extreme; one day’s gain can be followed by sharp losses, and liquidity can ebb when prices move quickly. This disclosure from a high-profile investor puts Zcash back in the headlines and could draw more capital into privacy tokens.

Related Reading: XRP On Fire: Over 21,000 New Wallets Appear In 48 Hours The firm purchased nearly 170 BTC between October 24 and November 5, a haul valued at more than $14 million at current market rates. American Bitcoin Boosts Holdings Eric Trump, listed as co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, said the company is growing its stock of Bitcoin through a mix of scaled mining operations and market purchases. Reports have disclosed that this size of accumulation puts American Bitcoin at about the 25th spot among corporate Bitcoin holders, based on data from Bitcointreasuries.net. The Michael Saylor-led Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) remains far ahead as the largest corporate holder with more than 641,000 BTC on its books, worth around $66 billion. Trump-Linked Ventures Report Large Crypto Gains Based on reports, members of the Trump family have collected roughly $1 billion in pre-tax gains over the last year from a range of crypto projects. Those projects include memecoins such as TRUMP and MELANIA, which together reportedly brought in about $427 million, plus the WLFI token with about $550 million in gains. Reports also point to big outside backers. Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun is reported to have invested $75 million in WLFI, while Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund is said to have provided $2 billion to Binance using the USD1 stablecoin. The family’s various ventures have pushed their combined crypto exposure into the multi-billion dollar range. Mining Margins Squeeze Firms After Halving Miners across the sector are feeling pressure after the 2024 Bitcoin halving cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. That change tightened profit margins, forcing some operators to seek new revenue streams, including AI-focused computing services. American Bitcoin’s model ties mining and treasury accumulation together, but the economics for smaller miners are getting tougher.

Sharing a new chart alongside his post, he noted that the same structure outlined earlier in the year continues to guide his outlook for the asset’s next move. XRP’s Unchanged Structure According to Dark Defender, “Our structure remains unchanged since 13 Feb 2025. (Even 18 months earlier than that).” His captioned chart illustrates XRP’s movement on a monthly scale, identifying a completed third wave and the beginning of what he describes as the fifth wave, an important phase in Elliott Wave theory that often signals renewed upward momentum. Our structure remains unchanged since 13 Feb 2025. (Even 18 months earlier than that) #XRP completed the Monthly 3rd Wave. The 5th Wave is starting. Targets: $5.85 & $10 levels short-term.

Many will revise their charts & turn #Bullish starting today… https://t.co/SpQzMtQXn7 pic.twitter.com/Zznp0wF8oI — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) November 7, 2025 The chart highlights a long-term descending trendline that XRP appears to have broken decisively in late 2024. Since then, the asset has moved into what the analyst identifies as the start of Wave 5. While the visual structure indicates that XRP’s third wave peaked at its all-time high of $3.65 , support currently holds at approximately $2.22, aligning closely with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level visible on the chart. XRP’s price is consolidating after a recent pullback , and the next expected upward move, according to the chart, projects two possible targets with 261.80% at $5.85 as the first target and $10 as the second target. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is XRP Heading Toward Double-digits? The $5.85 and $10 levels have been featured in several of Dark Defender’s past analyses , but the reaffirmation adds weight to the idea that the long-term technical setup remains intact. These projected price targets are derived from Fibonacci extensions drawn from the previous waves’ price action, consistent with methods commonly used in Elliott Wave forecasting. XRP’s position above the long-term resistance line suggests that the market may have transitioned from a consolidation phase into a more directional phase. The maintenance of the same chart structure since early 2025 also suggests that, in the analyst’s view, the broader pattern has not been invalidated by recent market fluctuations. Dark Defender stated that many analysts will soon start revising their charts and predictions and leaning toward bullish projections for XRP as we head toward the end of November. The analyst expects the market sentiment to shift as traders recognize the same wave structure he identified months ago, targeting double-digit levels for XRP.

Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.396556–$0.504708 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.176 over the last 24 hours as buyers tried to maintain support around $0.167 and succeeded. Moreover, buyers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.270379 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2029. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,780 DOGE in November; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.41 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142.

Speaking to Fox News on Friday, CZ revealed that he had never personally met Trump before or after the pardon was issued in October. “I never physically met or spoke with Trump,” he said, adding that the only interaction with the Trump family was a single encounter with Eric Trump during the Bitcoin Middle East and North Africa conference in Abu Dhabi. “There is no business relationship between me, Binance, and World Liberty Finance,” Zhao stated. He explained that he was unaware of the pardon’s progress throughout the process, saying: “I did not know when or if it was going to happen. I believe my lawyers submitted the petition in April, and it took a few months. I didn’t know the progress. There was no indication of how far it went along, etc. Then, it happened one day.” Mixed Reactions and Political Backlash The pardon drew polarized reactions. Supporters within the crypto community hailed it as a positive signal for digital assets and a break from what they described as the Biden administration’s anti-crypto stance. However, Democratic lawmakers quickly criticized the decision, accusing Trump of corruption and self-interest. During a press briefing following the pardon, Trump said he didn’t know CZ personally but was informed that the case against him was politically motivated. “He had a lot of support, and they said that what he did is not even a crime, it wasn’t a crime. He was persecuted by the Biden administration,” Trump remarked. Democrats Question Pardon Motives Representative Maxine Waters led accusations that Trump’s decision may have been linked to financial contributions from the crypto sector. Waters claimed Trump engaged in a “pay-to-play” arrangement, suggesting the pardon was in exchange for potential investments in ventures tied to the Trump family, such as World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Several Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, signed a letter addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the pardon.

However, one network deviated from this path entirely. XRP introduced a model that broke away from Bitcoin’s underlying design. A recent post by crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) on X revisited this defining distinction, emphasizing the digital asset’s role as the first cryptocurrency to adopt a completely different structure. The post featured excerpts from publications highlighting Ripple’s early divergence from the Bitcoin model. The Fortune article, which mistook Ripple for XRP at the time, described the digital asset as the “first [cryptocurrency] alternative to bitcoin that has a substantially different structure.” This acknowledgment underscored how XRP was conceived with a purpose distinct from the proof-of-work systems that defined the first generation of cryptocurrencies, and offered a more decentralized framework . RIPPLE IS THE FIRST CRYPTO SOFTWARE BUILT ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FRAMEWORK FROM BITCOIN + EVERY OTHER CRYPTO PROJECT WAS ORIGINALLY BASED ON BITCOIN’S SYSTEM “Ripple is important not just because of its specific functions, but because Ripple is the first alternative to… pic.twitter.com/HtqF8Tmc16 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 7, 2025 Breaking from the Bitcoin Blueprint Before XRP’s introduction, most digital currencies were developed as forks or derivatives of Bitcoin. The second referenced excerpt, from an early analysis of cryptocurrency development, stated, “Until July 2013, all cryptocurrency software, except Ripple, was based on the open source Bitcoin system.” Unlike Bitcoin, which depends on mining for transaction validation, Ripple’s framework was engineered for speed, scalability, and institutional-grade settlement . It replaced the energy-intensive mining process with a consensus protocol that enabled transactions to be confirmed within seconds rather than minutes. The Evolution of XRP and Its Purpose XRP embodies the structural and functional differences described in both excerpts, built not as a Bitcoin alternative in ideology, but as a practical solution to the inefficiencies of existing payment systems . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By focusing on liquidity and settlement rather than mining or speculation, XRP demonstrated that blockchain technology could serve the financial sector in ways Bitcoin’s design could not. This deviation set the stage for XRP’s later development as the backbone of an enterprise-grade payment network adopted by financial institutions worldwide. A Milestone in Cryptocurrency Architecture The evidence presented by SMQKE reinforces a critical historical fact that XRP’s architecture marked the first real departure from Bitcoin’s model. The emphasis on a “substantially different structure” defined a new class of cryptocurrency technology focused on performance, trust minimization, and interoperability rather than replication of Bitcoin’s framework. XRP’s early divergence continues to shape the evolution of digital assets. Its network remains a testament to how alternative blockchain designs can coexist with Bitcoin, and even outperform it .

Senior banking executives and Bank of England observers met at The Langham, London, to discuss a confidential report highlighting flaws in global payment systems and advocating for programmable settlement rails. Major banks like Barclays, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Lloyds Banking Group reportedly discussed using the XRP Ledger to create a global liquidity network, according to a post by Lord Belgrave and shared by X-user Pumpius. According to Pumpius, this information is a secret report connecting XRP to HSBC, Barclays, and the Bank of England. Legacy Problems: Why Banks Are Looking for Change The report, as described, focuses on three major pain points in correspondent banking: persistent liquidity locks, heavy messaging overhead, and multi-tier reconciliation delays. EXPOSED: SECRET REPORT CONNECTING XRP TO HSBC, BARCLAYS & BANK OF ENGLAND REVEALED. A must read, especially if you’re new to #XRP https://t.co/SgfYb8UKFV — Pumpius (@pumpius) November 8, 2025 Financial institutions, it says, “lock trillions of dollars in nostro-vostro accounts” simply to keep payments moving smoothly, while the messaging architecture (e.g., via SWIFT) dictates flow, not settlement. By contrast, landmark experiments by the Bank of England and Ripple showed that the Interledger Protocol enabled two simulated RTGS systems to settle cross-currency payments synchronously, eliminating reconciliation steps. Proposed Solution: Finite Finality on Modern Rails According to Pumpius’s post, the confidential report shifts quickly from diagnosis to prescription. It endorses a distributed ledger architectural design built on near-instant finality, embedded compliance layers, and minimal intermediaries. At its core is the XRP Ledger — cited as “at the center of that design.” While public records confirm that the Bank of England’s 2017 FinTech Accelerator ran a proof-of-concept with Ripple Labs Inc. exploring ILP-based settlement, they do not confirm the exact banks, meeting venue, or full report described. Institutional Context & Recent Developments The involvement of HSBC and Barclays is plausible: HSBC announced in 2023 its partnership with Metaco, a platform acquired by Ripple, to support its institutional digital-asset custody infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 UK Finance has launched a pilot program for tokenized sterling deposits, partnering with major banks such as Barclays, HSBC, and Lloyds, to test digital pound deposits until mid-2026. This initiative aims to modernize payments, reduce fraud, and improve settlement processes, aligning with the UK’s crypto regulation plans. These developments suggest a broader strategic alignment between major UK banks, tokenized-money experiments, and rails derived from the XRP ecosystem. What We Know, and What Remains Private Verified: The Bank of England has publicly documented a PoC with Ripple exploring synchronized settlement using ILP across RTGS systems . UK banks have launched pilots for tokenized deposits that enable programmable payments as part of an effort to modernize digital transactions. What remains private: the exact confidential report described by Pumpius and Lord Belgrave, the meeting details at The Langham, and the final agreements or contractual commitments the report purportedly included. In conclusion, the Pumpius post reignites the long-standing narrative that major banks and central banks are readying a tectonic shift in settlement infrastructure. While many pieces align with public disclosures, the specific report and linking of banks to the XRP Ledger remain unconfirmed in the public domain. For readers following the evolution of digital ledger adoption, the convergence of PoCs, pilots, and private briefings suggests one thing: the rails for moving value may finally be under redesign.

With the market heating up, both veterans and newcomers are searching for the best crypto to join now . Recent buzz has surrounded projects like Solana and Polkadot, both making waves in their respective ecosystems. Solana’s network expansion and Polkadot’s cross-chain upgrades are sparking conversations across the blockchain jungle, leaving investors wondering what’s next in this bullish landscape. But there’s one project stealing the spotlight, MOBU crypto. Its ongoing MOBU crypto presale is sparking FOMO among investors. Currently in Stage 6, $MOBU is turning heads with a massive ROI curve and a rapidly growing user base. The best crypto to join now might just be this under-the-radar penguin in a sea of bulls. MOBU Crypto Presale: The Best Crypto to Join Now for Massive ROI The MOBU crypto presale is sparking excitement among early investors. In its 6th stage, $MOBU is priced at $0.00008388, with projections hinting at a listing price of $0.00616, suggesting a potential ROI exceeding 7,200%. Over 1,900 holders have already jumped aboard, and the presale tally has surpassed $550K, demonstrating strong early confidence. This is what makes MOBU crypto one of the best cryptos to join now. A $100 investment could bring over 1.1 million tokens, translating to a projected $7,343 at listing. Even a modest $300 investment could soar to $22,000 or more, underscoring why the $MOBU presale is drawing serious attention. The FOMO is real: early adopters from Stage 5 have already seen a 235% ROI, and another 27% price surge is around the corner. Crypto enthusiasts are calling MOBU a “bull run magnet” due to its blend of innovation and scarcity-driven demand. Investors are moving fast because it’s first-come, first-served, a limited window before the next price jump. The best crypto to join now isn’t just about hype; it’s about numbers, timing, and smart entry points, and MOBU checks all those boxes. Bullocracy: The Power of the People, On-Chain MoonBull’s governance system flips the power dynamic, putting decision-making in the hands of its holders. Every $MOBU counts as one vote, granting everyone an equal voice in proposals, burns, and development decisions. No minimums, no barriers, just pure community control. Full transparency ensures accountability, making governance both empowering and inclusive. This democratic framework turns holders into true stakeholders, driving MoonBull’s evolution with unity, purpose, and unstoppable collective energy. Solana: Recovering Strong, Setting the Stage Solana continues its rebound, driven by growing developer activity and expanding ecosystem adoption. Despite volatility, its reputation as a fast, low-cost blockchain remains strong. The recent surge in transaction volume and improved validator performance shows the chain’s resilience in adapting to market cycles. As institutional interest grows, Solana is positioning itself as a strong player in DeFi and NFT spaces. Polkadot: Building a Multi-Chain Future Polkadot continues to strengthen its infrastructure through new parachain integrations and governance updates. Its focus on interoperability is reshaping how blockchains communicate and scale together. With consistent developer participation and gradual market stability, Polkadot remains one of the most talked-about layer-0 solutions in the ecosystem. Its roadmap for enhanced governance and community-driven innovation keeps it relevant.

But not everyone is panicking. In the middle of this downturn, whales are piling up on the top altcoins to buy now for all the right reasons: solid utility, strong momentum, and room to explode when the market flips green again. Digitap ($TAP) leads with its crypto–fiat bridge, which is gaining attention quickly in its crypto presale . Dash (DASH) is proving that privacy is making a comeback. And Filecoin (FIL) is winning the storage race tied to AI and DePIN growth. Together, these three coins have made it to ChatGPT’s list of the best 3 cryptos to buy now . ChatGPT’s List of the Best 3 Cryptos to Buy Now The rise of some cryptos at a time when giants like Bitcoin struggle shows that whales are changing strategies. And right now, ChatGPT is bullish on these three best cryptos to buy now : Digitap ($TAP) – The world’s first omni-bank bridging crypto and fiat. It leads the crypto presale race, having raised $1.6 million and sold more than 100 million tokens. Dash (DASH) – Testing a three-year resistance with analysts expecting another 150% rally as users seek financial anonymity. Filecoin (FIL) – The quiet powerhouse of decentralized storage. FIL has pumped over 130% weekly as AI and DePIN demand real-world data solutions. 137% Presale Jump — Why Digitap Draws Investor Focus Every bear market exposes the weak and rewards the smart. When the latest crash wiped billions off charts, investors and traders felt the need for a reliable platform. And they seem to have found one now that Digitap continues to see impressive numbers in its crypto presale . The shift to Digitap makes complete sense since it’s not just another presale project. The omnibanking platform was created for moments like the ongoing market crash. When everything else tanks, users can instantly flip crypto into fiat right inside the global money app. And it’s the first time traders have a genuine “safe mode” in crypto. But that’s only the teaser of what’s coming next with Digitap. The omnibank merges traditional banking and blockchain into one platform. Users can now rely on one dashboard to send, swap, or spend both crypto and fiat. What’s more, Digitap has partnered with Visa to give crypto holders a chance to spend cryptocurrency like cash from anywhere and anytime they want. And the Digitap presale numbers are icing on the cake. Over 100 million tokens have been sold. More than $1.6 million has been raised in just over a month. And the presale coin price has already jumped 137% from $0.0125 to $0.0297. But the good news is that the crypto presale coin is still sitting at a massive 78% discount before launch. And investors can still secure a 371% ROI by joining the Digitap crypto presale today. Analysts even foresee a 100x post-launch pump and believe Digitap ($TAP) could be the best crypto to buy now . Rising Privacy Demand Puts Dash Back in Market Spotlight While the rest of the market bleeds red, Dash is painting the charts green. The privacy coin has surged 146% in a week to surpass the $100 mark and is capturing everyone’s attention. DASH Price Chart (4H) | Source: TradingView With regulators tightening their grip on on-chain transparency, the demand for financial anonymity is exploding. Data from Artemis shows that privacy coins have climbed 129% in fully diluted market cap over the past month. And it has become the strongest sector performance out of 24 tracked. Change in Fully Diluted Market Cap of Tokens Across Sectors (1M) | Source: Artemis And Dash is one of the top performers among privacy coins. It’s now testing a three-year resistance trendline on the price chart. This is a level that’s blocked every major DASH price rally since 2022. Analyst CryptoLycus says a clean breakout here (that has already happened) could hit $175. And this could cement Dash’s return as a safe haven for those going all in on freedom and control in a tightening crypto market. Along with Digitap and Filecoin, DASH is easily one of the best 3 cryptos to buy now before that breakout confirms. Filecoin Jumps 133% as AI and DePIN Fuel Storage Demand If Dash is privacy’s comeback story, Filecoin is the infrastructure comeback. Bitcoin is trembling right now, and traders are panicking. But FIL is going the opposite way and has jumped 133% in price this week. And it appears like the sleeping giant behind decentralized storage is finally waking up. FIL Price Chart (4H) | Source: TradingView The Filecoin comeback also seems to have a solid foundation. Analysts note that AI and DePIN projects are now hungrier than ever for scalable, censorship-resistant storage. Filecoin is the perfect option in that case. What’s more, its v26 upgrade cut gas fees nearly in half. And this has driven the 25% daily growth in storage deals and a 30% jump in utilization. Additionally, data from Artemis shows file storage coins make the top-performing sector this week . In fact, file storage coins have even left privacy coins behind this week. Change in Fully Diluted Market Cap of Tokens Across Sectors (7D) | Source: Artemis And this could just be the beginning. CW , a well-known market analyst, predicts FIL could climb to $7.5. The analyst calls it a key breakout target. With real-world use cases and solid fundamentals, Filecoin looks like one of the best 3 cryptos to buy now . But it still lacks the kind of momentum crypto presale coins (like Digitap) carry. And now that some experts foresee a 100x price climb post-launch, $TAP seems to have no competition. One-Tap Fiat Conversions Set Digitap Apart From Rivals When the dust settles, one truth stands out: the market belongs to projects that focus on utility over hype. And utility with innovations in fintech is exactly why Digitap tops this list of the best 3 cryptos to buy now . Dash is thriving on the comeback of privacy coins. Filecoin is capitalizing on the AI storage rush. But Digitap is solving a problem that affects every trader. It’s going after the gap between crypto and cash. When volatility hits, users can convert crypto into fiat in just one tap through the Digitap app. And with that one tap, traders and investors can escape the mess that usually follows a market crash. On-chain data shows that over 120,000 wallets have joined the crypto presale so far. The Visa-powered cards, multi-currency wallets, and a fully audited system seem to be playing a massive role in Digitap’s increasing adoption. That’s why some market experts are confident about a potential 100x price pump for Digitap post-launch. But the presale supply is flying off the shelves faster than ever now. And this means the opportunity to grab probably the biggest gains next year is slipping away with each passing day. Crypto Presale Demand Surges as 100M $TAP Tokens Sell Fast The market is back under pressure after a period of optimism. And even in the market crash, Digitap is winning for all the right reasons. The main reason is that Digitap is giving common crypto users what they want: crypto-fiat swaps and spending in one app. Sure, Dash and Filecoin are two of the top gainers this week. But their strength lies in trends. Digitap is here to stay in the long run. For whales adjusting their strategy for 2026, $TAP has turned out to be the best crypto to buy now . And that explains the rapidly depleting crypto presale token supply. Over 100 million tokens are already gone. And the rest will follow soon. But those who wait around with their hopes tied to legacy coins may only have regrets down the line. That’s because market analysts seem more optimistic about Digitap’s 100x price pump in early 2026.

Consequently, he outlined his strategy that involves purchasing certain assets and disposing of others. Additionally, Kiyosaki set some big price targets for his two favorite cryptocurrencies, which are also the two largest by market cap. Gold, Silver First The prominent author and investor has been advocating for BTC for years, but he has only recently added ETH to his portfolio. Before that, he was a big proponent of the two largest precious metals – gold and silver. Kiyosaki has also been warning about an impending market crash, particularly for stocks, which he believes are significantly overvalued. In his latest tweet on the matter, he outlined gold as his first choice for a hedge against market uncertainty. His target for the precious metal is at $27,000, which he got from popular gold bug Jim Rickards. It’s worth noting that the yellow metal had a spectacular year, set numerous new all-time highs, but it’s still far below that level at $4,000/oz as of Friday’s close. After disclosing that he owns silver (as well as gold) mines, he noted that his price target for the former is $100 in 2026. CRASH COMING: Why I am buying not selling. My target price for Gold is $27k. I got this price from friend Jim Rickards….and I own two goldmines. I began buying gold in 1971….the year Nixon took gold from the US Dollar. Nixon violated Greshams Law, which states “When fake… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 9, 2025 $250K BTC, $60K ETH When it came to posting predictions about the two biggest cryptocurrencies, Kiyosaki seems to believe that ETH has more substantial room for growth. His target for BTC, which is at $250K, would require a more modest 150% surge from the current levels. At the same time, ETH trades at around $3,500 as of now, while skyrocketing to $60,000, which he believes is achievable, would be a tough challenge. The asset would need to jump by more than 1,600%. What’s even more interesting is that if both of these crypto targets are reached, ETH would be the number one digital asset by market cap, as its own would be north of $7.2 trillion (given the current circulating supply). In contrast, BTC’s market cap would be around $5 trillion.

Although cryptocurrencies such as Ripple (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have increasingly impressive technical and fundamental changes, a new player on the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is making its mark on why it should occupy one of the ‘best’ spots on any serious investor’s list. This pioneering defi crypto project is not only leveraging market trends but is actually trying to develop a sustainable ecosystem, and this itself is a big reason why it is actually the best crypto to invest in for substantial gains. Its presale records are testimony to a market confidence that could precede a potential market breakout. Ripple (XRP): Finding Ways Past Resistance Ripple’s XRP is currently battling a crucial resistance point in its fight for a recovery following a recent correction. It is approaching stability after establishing a floor at around $2.066, and its fight for a recovery is based on a breakout above the strong resistance at $2.30. Technical indicators highlight that a bear trend line is being established at $2.25 on the hourly charts, presenting an outright ceiling. If this resistance is pushed through successfully, it may spark a break-out towards $2.36 and could reignite a rally towards the crucial $2.50 mark once again. But its price trend still has a strong correlation with market sentiment, especially that of Bitcoin, and is quite unclear as of now. If one is about to invest in any crypto today, one may have brand awareness associated with XRP but is limited due to market fluctuations. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Institutional Acceptance Brings About Shiba Inu is seeing a notable buying vista following a historic event. T Rowe Price, a fund manager that handles a staggering $1.7 trillion, has included SHIB as part of its filing of an active crypto ETF with the U.S. SEC. From a historic point of view, this is a paradigm shift for this popular memecoin, as it comes with more prestige and potentially new demand sources for this asset. It is combined with technical analysis that reveals a potential breakout pattern relative to Bitcoin, and some analysts have predicted that it could see gains of several hundred percent. Furthermore, the community that is following SHIB is busy trying to think of ways that they can make this token as rare as possible, and they have recently experienced a burn rate that has increased by over 1,993%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Case of a Strong Presale While XRP and SHIB present their case, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is presenting a financial show through its presale, racing towards phase 6 conclusion. They have already made an impressive collection of $18,500,000 and have managed to accumulate 17,810 holders, symbolizing its market fitness and adaptability. They have reached the most critical moment of their presale, and Phase 6 is already 85% completed at $0.035. This is literally the final call for tokens at this tier, as the coming phase will implement a price hike of nearly 20% due to a price of $0.040 approaching. Structurally, this sets up prospective buyers for a potential profit of as much as 400% above its market value at this time, as this is more than just a new cryptocurrency on the market—this is a deliberate market entry into a lucrative environment. Dual-Market Lending The burning passion for MUTM tokens has its roots in a revolutionary essential product of this project, namely, a dual-market lending platform. This platform masterfully merges two previously incompatible concepts. Namely, the capital efficiency of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools of assets such as ETH and USDT, and the flexibility of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market. Thus, this complex design meets all levels of user demand and solidifies Mutuum Finance as a credible deFi crypto platform, unlike other speculative assets, as it has practical applications and genuinely scalable growth potential. There is no ambiguity about the investment thesis of Mutuum Finance. Based on its proven presale model, utility-focused protocol, and soon approaching price hike, there is a limited time frame for maximum profit potential. Missing this project on a list of purchases for investors trying to identify the ‘best cryptos to buy’ would be a serious oversight. This project represents the characteristics of the next big crypto because it holds innovation and opportunities simultaneously. The ability to be part of this project is disappearing by the hour because of its potential as the most promising ICO of this year.

54208057,624342,1762711206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54208057.jpeg,From Hype To Real Use: Stablecoin Payments Surge $41 Billion In Q3 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/from-hype-to-real-use-stablecoin-payments-surge-41-billion-in-q3-2025/,"The stablecoin market recorded its strongest quarterly expansion since 2021, with $41 billion in net inflows during the third quarter of 2025. According to Orbital’s Stablecoin Retail Payments Index, retail adoption of stablecoins has entered a new phase of stability after a year of intense growth, owing to the fact that the crypto industry is moving from speculative trading to practical, everyday use in emerging economies. Retail Activity Settles As Crypto Market Finds Its Balance Stablecoin activity has begun to level out following a 69% increase in user adoption between mid-2024 and mid-2025. According to the latest report data from Orbital, there were about 3.6 million daily active users in Q3, indicating that the market is stabilizing following the excitement of previous months. However, the important thing is that retail payment volumes nonetheless climbed somewhat, up 4% to $1.77 trillion, even as the number of transactions declined slightly from 1.33 billion to 1.21 billion. This trend points to larger, more significant transfers replacing the smaller ones below $10,000 that prevailed in previous quarters. Tether’s flagship token, USDT, continues to dominate the retail industry, accounting for 83% of total transactions. On the other hand, USDC is the favorite token among DeFi users, accounting for more than 50% of the DeFi market. In terms of crypto exchange, Binance plays the major role of controlling much of the liquidity for both tokens and providing the rails for retail payments across emerging markets. Emerging Markets Lean On Stablecoins To Fight Inflation Stablecoins are increasingly being used as lifelines in struggling economies. This trend has been acknowledged by financial experts, with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently revising her $1.5 million Bitcoin prediction due to the growing popularity of stablecoins. Orbital’s report shows that users in Algeria, Bolivia, and Venezuela are paying staggering premiums of 90%, 77%, and 63%, respectively, to access dollar-pegged tokens. This is a sign that stablecoins are becoming digital versions of the US dollar in these regions. Mid-tier premier ranges between 8% and 18% in countries like Türkiye, Ethiopia, and Argentina. On the other hand, markets such as India, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa show lower premiums, as improved financial infrastructure makes it easier to buy and sell stablecoins at near-market rates. Some countries, including Colombia and Peru, even trade below parity, a sign of stronger liquidity and growing market maturity. Notably, a new generation of blockchains is competing for a share of stablecoin traffic. Binance Smart Chain still leads in retail transfers but saw growth slow by half in Q3. Aptos has now stabilized after its massive breakout earlier in the year, while Plasma, the newest entrant, set a record of $7 billion in deposits within days of launching its native token, XPL. Tron also continued its steady climb due to its heavy USDT usage, and Ethereum saw its total stablecoin supply expand by $35 billion. Stablecoin Wallet-to-wallet Transfers According to data from CoinGecko, the stablecoin market cap today is around $311 billion.

According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency has been hovering around the $102,000 level over the past 24 hours. While this current choppy price action seems like an improvement from the severe downturn witnessed in recent days, it doesn’t particularly bring calm to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin price might still be at risk of further correction in the coming days. Why BTC Price Might Find Bottom Around $95,000 In a November 8 post on the social media platform X, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci predicted the local bottom for the price of Bitcoin. According to the crypto pundit, the flagship cryptocurrency could fall to as low as $95,000 before seeing relief and perhaps rebounding to new price highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Surge To $5,500: What To Watch Out For To Mark The Bottom The relevant metric here is the Realized Price of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) age bands, which evaluate the holding pattern of different investor classes through their different realized prices. The UTXO age bands metric tracks the average price at which Bitcoin holders purchased their coins compared to how long they’ve held the assets. The age bands under focus in Kesmeci’s analysis are the 1-week to 1-month group (green line) and the 1-month to 3-month cohort (purple line), which offer insight into short-term holders’ behavior and overall market sentiment. According to the on-chain analyst, the green line has crossed below the purple line three times in 2025. Kesmeci noted that this cross often preceded short-term corrections, including the ones seen on February 24 ($99,000 to $76,000) and September 8 ($117,000 to $109,000). Similarly, this cross occurred on November 1, with the Bitcoin price falling from $110,000 to $99,000. Furthermore, the average dip suffered by the Bitcoin price on these three occasions stands at around 13.3%, with a 45-day consolidation period. Based on this historical pattern, Kesmeci expects the Bitcoin price bottom to form around the $95,000 and $96,000 region after the most recent crossing of the 1-week to 1-month band below the 1-month to 3-month band. Kesmeci concluded: In short, long-term investors are in the red, and this is an undesirable situation for a bull cycle. However, if history repeats itself, Bitcoin may “catch its breath” once more in this region and prepare the ground for a new rise. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $102,440, reflecting a nearly 1% decline in the past day.

XRP ETFs Are Already Here,https://timestabloid.com/floodgates-are-creaking-open-xrp-etfs-are-already-here/,"A seismic shift is underway in the cryptocurrency markets. Investors are no longer content with direct token exposure alone—they want regulated, exchange-traded instruments. Enter the era of XRP ETFs. In a timely post by X Finance Bull, trading communities learned that various futures, leveraged and spot-linked ETFs tied to XRP are already live through issuers such as Teucrium, Volatility Shares, ProShares, and REX. This is the warm-up act. The main event arrives when fully regulated spot-XRP ETFs launch. Early Exposure: Futures & Leveraged Products Since earlier this year, funds like Teucrium’s 2× Long Daily XRP ETF (ticker XXRP) and ProShares’ Ultra XRP ETF have opened trading. These allow traders to ride XRP price movements and margin flows without holding the token directly. They provide access—but with elevated risk, given leverage and futures dynamics. The floodgates are creaking open. $XRP ETFs are already here, and this is just the warm-up Live futures, spot, and leveraged XRP ETFs from Volatility Shares, Teucrium, ProShares, REX, and more are already trading. But the real show starts when all spot ETFs go live. Just… pic.twitter.com/5xnbKajVzV — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) November 9, 2025 The Spot-ETF Threshold The truly transformative step will be the launch of spot-XRP ETFs—funds that hold the underlying token rather than derivatives. Five spot-XRP funds from 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and CoinShares are now on the DTCC list, preparing for market access. Notably, 21Shares filed a Section 8(a) amendment that could trigger automatic effectiveness of its S-1 registration after 20 days if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains passive. Why Liquidity Could Flood The pattern to watch is institutional V-shaped flow rather than a slow trickle. When spot ETFs open, large managers, pension funds, and asset allocators gain access to XRP through traditional channels. The same dynamic sent spot-Bitcoin ETFs surging in adoption and funds. With XRP’s increasing utility in global settlement rails and tokenization, the frameworks align for major inflows. Analyst sentiment aligns with this view. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Practical Utility, Not Just Hype What differentiates XRP today is its real-world anchor. The token serves cross-border settlement, supports tokenization rails, and underpins stablecoin circuitry in some ecosystems. Broad product availability without mere speculation boosts investor confidence. The institutional narrative now includes XRP as infrastructure, not only as a speculative asset. Risks and Mitigating Variables Even so, risk remains. Leveraged and futures-based ETFs amplify losses as well as gains. Spot-ETF launches may be delayed due to regulatory review, technical listing issues, or custody concerns. Market participants should consider timing, fund structure, and issuer credibility before positioning. In conclusion, the gate is cracking—and then opening. What began with futures- and leveraged-linked products now evolves into fully regulated spot-XRP ETFs. When that happens, liquidity is likely to pour in, not drip. For XRP and its supporters, the infrastructure is aligning. For investors, timing, product selection, and risk management will matter more than ever.

Uniswap, a DeFi protocol founded in 2018 by former mechanical engineer Hayden Adams. The Uniswap exchange is a 100% on-chain automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The AMM allows DeFi users to swap ether (ETH) for any ERC-20 token without intermediaries, solving many liquidity problems most exchanges face. Uniswap’s unique features and utility make its token, UNI, attractive to traders and investors. Will UNI reach $100? How high can UNI go in five years? Let’s take a look at Uniswap’s technical analysis and price prediction to provide answers to these queries.

Cryptocurrency gains 8,83% of its value. UNI coin faces resistance around the $6.84 level. On November 9, 2025, Uniswap price analysis revealed a strong bullish trend for the day. The altcoin’s price significantly increased to $6.53 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency gained 8.83% in value, but it faces strong resistance around $6.84. This situation also indicates that selling pressure may build even below the $7 level, as the coin faced a rejection near that price point previously. Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart for Uniswap confirms an upward trend in the market. The UNI/USD pair is oscillating near the $6.53 level following the continuation of the bullish trend. The bullish push has significantly uplifted the price, as long green candlesticks on the chart signify buying activities. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the current level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $6.88, whereby its lower limit, indicating support, has moved to $5.06. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending in the neutral region. The indicator’s value was recorded at 54.75 today. The upward curve on the RSI signifies a solid bullish trend. Further stability can be expected if the buying momentum intensifies and the indicator moves near the overbought region. Uniswap price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour chart analysis of Uniswap also shows the continuation of buyers’ support, as the price levels are recovering. This is evidenced by its price improving to $6.54 over the past four hours; it may increase further in the coming hours if bulls exert more pressure. Moreover, increasing volatility signifies a higher chance of a reversal or greater price oscillation. The Bollinger Bands are covering more area, leading to a high level of volatility. This high volatility signals more market unpredictability. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $6.54, indicating the breached resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $4.99, establishing the support point. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has entered the overbought region once again. The indicator’s value increased to 72.02 over the past few hours, with its curve pointing upward. This condition suggests buyers’ interest at the current price level on the four-hour chart.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is increasing after a highly bullish trend observed over the current trading session. If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might increase to the $6.84 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $22.26 level by 2027 and above $45.69 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing positive market sentiment today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining, and so is UNI. As buyers gained ground around $5.05, positive sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.54, while the average price is expected to be around $8.79. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.27 and $7.8; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $45.69 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

Some analysts say that if this continued and maintained its support floor, then it could be on its way towards breaking through all-new highs once again soon. Yet, despite this optimistically promising development, most market speculators currently have their eyes on other opportunities, ones that can earn them more than Bitcoin, for instance, can deliver. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Even at just $0.035 and still rife within its presale phase, Mutuum Finance is, as of today, the top crypto that boasts an improved risk-reward value than that of Bitcoin itself, as of 2025 standards, and is the best crypto to buy as of today, still relatively early on. Bitcoin at a Potential Launch Point Again, Bitcoin has managed to test its weekly support level for its RSI, and this is a region that has marked some of its most prominent rallies into all-new price highs in previous instances when this region was touched. Although Bitcoin is currently trading sideways along its support area, its indicators are currently suggesting that a period of greatness may be on its way as this is likely a high-conviction buying phase before any price rally into new highs is made. As investors prepare for the future breakout, they’re also interested in investing in early-stage projects that have more potential, and this is why there is continued focus on Mutuum Finance, which is currently on a roll and being recognized as the top crypto and the best crypto to buy for those seeking high upside before mainstream adoption. Mutuum Finance Presale Quickens due to Growing Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still on a roll in the world of decentralized finance, and its presale is progressively gathering momentum as more and more people rally around its cause. In presale phase 6, MUTM is retailing at a price of $0.035, thereby registering a massive 250% increment from presale phase 1, during which it sold its tokens at only $0.01. More than 17,810 participants have already joined its presale, and cumulative sales have exceeded $18.5 million, meaning that presale phase 6 is getting close to being 85% sold out. Turning into Phase 7, the price of the token is expected to be $0.04, closer to its actual market listing price of $0.06. Despite its steady price growth, MUTM has managed to become the top crypto in terms of early-stage potential and is widely regarded as the best crypto to buy now for early investors aiming to secure gains ahead of its listing. Simplified Global Access through Direct Card Purchasing Mutuum Finance has continued to open its platform up by allowing Credit and Debit Cards purchases of its MUTM tokens on its platform. First, this means that there is no need for complicated exchange infrastructure and onboarding, and any investor can easily get on board. By doing this, Mutuum Finance is ensuring that there is a link between non-users and decentralized finance, and this cements its practical applicability. Building a Stable and Scalable DeFi Lending Ecosystem Mutuum Finance has, at its root, an over-collateralized loan and borrowing system that is aimed at offering sustainability and stability. Mutuum has a conservative loan value, and only up to a maximum of 75% of this value can be loaned. If one, for instance, puts down a value of $8,000 of ETH, they can get a loan of up to $6,000, and this will be reflected in the creation of mtTokens that earn interest over time. USDT and stablecoin holders can enjoy safe and predictable access to liquidity, and this enables them to earn revenue without having to sell their assets, thanks to this combined system that connects utility, efficient use of capital, and growth of assets, making MUTM a very distinctive option for investors who aim for instant earning and strong long-term DeFi performance. Mutuum Finance has managed to raise over $18.5 million from more than 17,810 investors, and Phase 6 of its presale is close to being sold out, priced at just $0.035, being over 85% sold out. Even then, its token has seen a whopping 250% growth from its launch price of $0.01, and this is just its inception stage. With its scalable, over-collateralized DeFi lending and borrowing model, direct payment cards, and a lucrative roadmap that would lead it towards Phase 7, priced at just $0.04, MUTM is a utility and growth asset that would surpass many other cryptocurrencies soon. It is now considered the top crypto and the best crypto to buy by investors seeking early exposure. You can participate in the presale of Mutuum Finance today and secure your entry into this market through its starting price.

This crypto is gaining strong attention for combining blockchain technology with property income and transparent on-chain mechanics, as RentStac does. With its presale currently active and structured across multiple stages, it is becoming one of the most talked-about tokens in the sector. While many early-stage projects rely on speculation, this one has a clear roadmap, verified metrics, and a defined token model. The total supply is capped at two billion tokens, with forty percent allocated to the presale. The full fundraising goal across all seven stages is around twenty-seven million dollars. Why the Presale Matters When tokens are sold at early-stage pricing, entry levels are often much lower than post-listing values. The current presale price is two and a half cents per token, marking the first phase of a structured rollout. Each phase introduces a gradual increase in price, rewarding early participants and creating a transparent token economy. This pricing structure, combined with limited supply and a real-use ecosystem, positions the token as one of the few presale opportunities built on fundamentals rather than short-term speculation, much like RentStac, which is reshaping how DeFi connects with tangible assets. What the Project Does This crypto aims to connect decentralized finance with the global rental market. It uses a framework where real estate assets are held legally and represented as blockchain tokens. Investors gain exposure to rental income streams and liquidity without owning or managing physical properties. It also introduces a dual-yield model. Holders can stake tokens to earn protocol revenue while benefiting from token appreciation. Earnings are distributed in stablecoins, reducing volatility and providing consistent yield potential within the ecosystem. Key Tokenomics and Structure The token supply is fixed at two billion units. Forty percent of the total is reserved for the presale, ensuring wide distribution before listing. The remaining tokens are allocated to staking rewards, ecosystem growth, team reserves, and partnerships. The project targets approximately twenty-seven million dollars in total presale funding. Each stage gradually raises the price from two and a half cents up to just over five cents, depending on the phase. Security and Transparency Security has been a key focus since the project’s launch. Smart contracts have been reviewed through third-party platforms, scoring over ninety-two percent on technical audits. A full audit by a top-tier blockchain firm is currently in progress. The protocol also implements multi-signature wallets, oracle verification for property data, and independent entities to manage real assets. This layered approach ensures that every token is supported by verifiable, real-world activity a practice seen in audited DeFi projects like RentStac. Example of Entry and Growth At the current presale price of two and a half cents, an investor purchasing five thousand dollars worth of tokens would receive two hundred thousand units. If the token later reaches one dollar, that position would be valued at two hundred thousand dollars. Even smaller entries can generate meaningful returns under the same price assumptions. The key factor is early participation, while prices remain at the lower presale stages. The Bigger Picture This crypto represents a shift in the DeFi landscape, moving away from high-risk speculation toward real economic value. By connecting blockchain with verified assets and income streams, it offers a structure that aligns with investor demand for sustainability and transparency. With a fixed supply, low entry price, and legally backed framework, this project stands out as one of the most credible presales in the market today. As the DeFi sector evolves, it could become a model for how real-world value and digital finance finally converge a direction already being defined by RentStac.

During a recent informal meeting, a contact at BlackRock reportedly compared the coming moment for XRP to the 2013 upheaval around Bitcoin. Meanwhile, crypto commentator TheXRPguy relayed that BlackRock expects “big things” for XRP once a crucial institutional product launches. Institutional Momentum The filing tracker maintained by The Block reveals both live and pending XRP-linked ETFs. As of now, several spot XRP ETF applications remain “pending”, even as futures-based products trade. Recent regulatory filings by firms like 21Shares and Franklin Templeton include amendment sections such as Section 8(a) to trigger automatic review timelines. I met my guy from blackrock today for a coffee and he said big things are coming for XRP once the ETFs are launched. He said, it’s like bitcoin 2013 — TheXRPguy (@TheXRP_guy) November 8, 2025 Regulatory Background The backdrop to this moment is the resolution of the long-running legal dispute between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. That case concluded with Ripple paying a fine and both sides withdrawing appeals , thereby clearing a significant regulatory cloud over XRP. In turn, analysts now assess approval odds for a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. at the 70–85% range. Liquidity and Market Impact If a spot XRP ETF gains approval, its impact could mirror major prior moments in crypto. The product would allow regulated, brokerage-friendly exposure to XRP, potentially unlocking billions of dollars of institutional capital. An article claims that, based on filings, inflows could reach “several billions” in the initial months. Early listings and pricing behavior suggest that XRP has already logged increased volume and a breakout move above $2.30, tied to ETF filing momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the Comparison to Bitcoin 2013 Matters In 2013, Bitcoin underwent a dramatic shift from niche to headline asset as investor access broadened and speculation surged. The BlackRock contact’s analogy implies that the forthcoming moment for XRP might likewise represent a shift from crypto-adjacent to mainstream finance. While mechanics differ—ETFs for altcoins differ from early speculative froth—the analogy underscores the scale of possible change in exposure and market architecture. What to Watch Next Key indicators now include the SEC’s formal review timelines (triggered by amendment filings), ticker approvals, and first-week fund inflows. Firms to monitor include Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Grayscale, and other major asset managers. Traders and institutional watchers should also monitor order-book depth, custody provider activations, and whale accumulation. In summary, the narrative passed through TheXRPguy adds nuance to an already unfolding institutional story. If the filings and regulatory windows align as many anticipate, XRP may face a watershed moment. Whether the surge truly matches the magnitude of Bitcoin’s 2013 episode remains uncertain—but the market is clearly bracing for something substantial.

The most serious move toward ending the shutdown that has paralyzed the US government for more than a month has come from Democratic senators. Multiple sources told Axios they are ready to advance a spending package that could reopen the government. The move represents a significant easing of the debate, a move not seen in recent years. According to both Democratic and Republican sources, at least 10 Democratic senators will support bringing the package, which includes spending bills and short-term stopgap funding, to a vote.

Interestingly, more than half of that amount was spent in the third quarter alone, when DATCos collectively acquired $22.6 billion worth of digital assets. Q3 2025 has therefore been the strongest quarter on record for DATCo accumulation. Bitcoin DATCos Dominate In its latest analysis, CoinShares revealed that altcoin-focused DATCos represented $10.8 billion of this Q3 spending, or 47.8% of the total. However, despite the rise of altcoin treasury strategies, Bitcoin-focused DATCos still lead the market by a wide margin. Bitcoin DATCos have purchased at least $30.0 billion worth of BTC since the beginning of 2025, and accounted for 70.3% of all aggregate DATCo crypto purchases this year. Ethereum DATCos were the second-largest group by acquisition value. In fact, at least $7.9 billion was spent on ETH in 2025. Most of that ETH spending, with at least $7.1 billion, took place in August. Other assets, including SOL, BNB, WLFI, and various smaller-cap assets, accounted for 11.2% of purchases in 2025. CoinGecko expects this share to rise as more altcoin-centric DATCos begin deploying capital. Even with this altcoin expansion, Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the dominant assets held by corporate digital asset treasuries. Strategy Leads DATCos Strategy is currently the largest DATCo by crypto holdings, reporting $70.7 billion in BTC on its books, which represents roughly half of all DATCo-owned digital assets. The firm alone holds 3.05% of the total Bitcoin supply in circulation. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion, Sharplink, and Forward Industries are the only altcoin-focused DATCos in the top 15 by holdings, and all three entered the category only after June 2025. In total, seven pure play DATCos are among the top 15, and only three crypto mining companies make the top 15. Of the five companies with corporate crypto reserves that are also in the top 15, four are crypto-related businesses, with Tesla the sole exception. The total number of DATCos has expanded from just four in January 2020 to 142 in October 2025. 76 of them were formed this year alone. Hut 8 Mining Corp was the first DATCo, back in November 2017. Strategy later became the first pure play DATCo in August 2020. Total DATCo holdings reached $137.3 billion at the end of October 2025, up 139.6% year-to-date. Of the 142 DATCos, 113 hold BTC, while only 15 hold ETH and 10 hold SOL.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are closely watching Litecoin’s trajectory. Often called ‘digital silver’ to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin has maintained its position as one of the top cryptocurrencies since its 2011 launch. This comprehensive Litecoin price prediction analysis examines whether LTC can achieve the ambitious $1000 milestone by 2030. Understanding Litecoin’s Market Position Litecoin operates as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone worldwide. Created by Charlie Lee, Litecoin features faster block generation times and uses scrypt in its proof-of-work algorithm. The LTC cryptocurrency has consistently ranked among the top digital assets by market capitalization, demonstrating remarkable resilience through multiple market cycles.

Several critical elements will determine whether our Litecoin price prediction materializes: Technological Developments and Upgrades Litecoin continues to implement improvements that enhance its utility and security. The MimbleWimble extension block implementation provides optional privacy features, while ongoing work on the Lightning Network integration could significantly boost transaction capacity and speed. Market Adoption and Real-World Use As more merchants and payment processors integrate Litecoin, the fundamental value proposition strengthens. The growing acceptance of LTC cryptocurrency for everyday transactions creates organic demand beyond speculative trading. Regulatory Environment Impact Global regulatory clarity will play a crucial role in Litecoin’s future. Positive regulatory developments could trigger institutional investment, while restrictive policies might temporarily suppress growth. Can Litecoin Realistically Reach $1000? The $1000 price target represents approximately a 10x increase from current levels. Achieving this milestone would require: Sustained bull market conditions in the broader cryptocurrency space Significant adoption increases beyond current projections Successful implementation of key technological upgrades Favorable macroeconomic conditions supporting risk assets While challenging, our Litecoin price prediction analysis suggests that under optimal conditions, the $1000 target becomes plausible by 2030. The crypto market analysis indicates that Litecoin’s established position and continuous development provide a solid foundation for long-term growth.

The consensus suggests that while short-term volatility is inevitable, the long-term trajectory remains positive. The LTC cryptocurrency benefits from its first-mover advantage, strong brand recognition, and active development community. FAQs About Litecoin Price Prediction What is the highest price Litecoin could reach by 2025? Based on current crypto market analysis, Litecoin could potentially reach $350-$400 in a strong bull market scenario by 2025, though more conservative estimates suggest $250-$300. How does Bitcoin’s performance affect Litecoin? Litecoin typically correlates strongly with Bitcoin price movements. When Bitcoin experiences significant gains or losses, Litecoin often follows similar patterns, though sometimes with amplified volatility. Who created Litecoin and how does this affect its future? Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee , a former Google engineer. His continued involvement and advocacy provide credibility, though some critics argue about his decision to sell his LTC holdings in 2017. What advantages does Litecoin have over newer cryptocurrencies? Litecoin benefits from established network security, widespread exchange support, merchant adoption, and proven technology. Its longer track record provides confidence compared to newer, unproven projects. Should I invest in Litecoin based on these predictions? All cryptocurrency investments carry significant risk. This Litecoin price prediction represents analysis, not financial advice. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before investing. Conclusion: The Future of Digital Silver Our comprehensive Litecoin price prediction analysis suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for LTC through 2030. While reaching $1000 represents an ambitious target, it remains within the realm of possibility under favorable market conditions. The LTC cryptocurrency continues to demonstrate resilience and maintains its position as a prominent digital asset.

The increase broke a months-long stretch where consumer prices hovered at or below zero, which is the first positive reading since June and the strongest level seen since January. On a month-on-month basis, CPI also rose by 0.2%, compared with Reuters-polled analysts’ expectations of zero growth, thanks to the National Day and Mid-Autumn holiday period, where spending tends to increase across travel, dining, and household goods. Food remained a point of pressure. Prices for food products fell 2.9% from the same period last year. However, compared to September, even food managed a slight 0.2% monthly uptick. Producer prices continue their downward streak At the factory level, conditions remained under strain. Producer prices declined 2.1% from last year, easing only slightly from analyst expectations of a 2.2% decline, and making the third straight year where wholesale prices have been in negative territory. On a monthly basis, producer prices nudged up 0.1%, though that increase does not reverse the ongoing downward trend manufacturers have been facing. Dong Lijuan, serving as chief statistician at the bureau’s urban division, explained that “in October, policies aimed at expanding domestic demand continued to take effect, coupled with the boost from the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.” The combination of policy measures and seasonal activity helped support consumer spending, but the structural problems around industrial pricing are still present. Industrial profits in September climbed more than 21%, suggesting that certain companies are still finding ways to maintain earnings. However, analysts continue to point to long-standing issues involving the financial structure of local governments. Many local administrations depend heavily on tax revenue tied to industrial production. This creates incentives to push factories to maintain or expand output, even when demand weakens, leading to overcapacity and increasing competition among producers. Meanwhile, an official survey released on October 30 showed that manufacturing activity contracted more than expected, falling to its lowest level in six months. Sub-indexes covering new orders, production, employment, and raw material inventories all recorded deeper contractions. On the external front, exports in October fell unexpectedly. Shipments to the United States dropped 25%, and that was the seventh consecutive month of double-digit declines, per the NBS. During a meeting in South Korea on October 30, President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed to a trade truce, reducing the risk of escalation that had raised concerns over the possibility of a broader trade conflict. Policymakers in Beijing have emphasized that the economic plan for the next five years will require efforts to “vigorously boost consumption” and connect domestic demand with long-term investment planning. Separately, the Ministry of Commerce announced the temporary suspension of a clause connected to export controls on dual-use items. The suspension, effective immediately until November 27 next year, pauses restrictions introduced in December 2024 that banned the export of materials like gallium, germanium, antimony, and also specific superhard materials to the United States. A notice under the Export Control Law had previously blocked exports aimed at military users and denied related licensing, according to CNBC.

The decision came after supply shortages hit automakers and their suppliers, who rely on these basic semiconductors for electrical systems in vehicles. The ministry said the exemptions are active now, allowing chips packaged in China to be delivered to buyers again. Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, but owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, which has been the center of tension between Beijing and The Hague. The commerce ministry did not detail what counts as civilian use. However, companies in Germany and Japan have already confirmed that shipments of the Chinese-packaged chips have resumed. Even with the resumed flow, the dispute over the company’s ownership and production direction remains unsettled. The Dutch government took control of Nexperia on September 30, claiming Wingtech intended to move European production to China, arguing it was a threat to European economic security. After that, China halted exports of the finished chips. Permission for exemptions began only after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on October 30 and signaled a willingness to reopen certain trade channels. China tells the EU to pressure the Netherlands China’s commerce ministry said it expects the European Union to push the Netherlands to reverse what it called the “seizure” of Nexperia, adding that Beijing wants the EU to “further intensify efforts” and encourage the Netherlands to correct what it described as incorrect actions. According to Reuters, the ministry also said that China has been working to protect global semiconductor supply chains, while criticizing the Netherlands for creating disruption by not resolving the dispute sooner, so its export halt was a response to the Dutch government’s takeover rather than an act of escalation. Trade relations between China and Europe have already been fragile. European officials have increasingly voiced concerns that Chinese manufacturing is heavily subsidized, leading to excess output that floods global markets. Industry in Europe is under pressure from rising competition as well as supply chain dependency, so this Nexperia situation has only amplified those concerns. European officials discuss possible countersteps In Frankfurt on Friday, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said Europe must consider how to respond if trade relations with China continue to deteriorate. Joachim said the region needs to make clear that its industries will be protected if required. “Europe has to think about how to retaliate, maybe, when things are escalating further,” he said. Joachim added that conversation is still necessary to avoid letting disputes grow unchecked, saying, “But my impression here is that first of all it’s important that we talk to each other. I think we should understand better what’s going on.” The European Union has since shared its concerns about Chinese trade restrictions, especially on materials needed for manufacturing. Beijing has set controls on exports of rare-earth magnets, which are used in electric vehicle motors and defense equipment, requiring companies to apply for import approvals. This has increased hurdles for manufacturers already dealing with cost pressure and supply instability. Joachim will travel to China this month with German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil. He said the visit is intended to improve communication and reduce strain. Joachim said the aim is to speak directly and search for ways to ease the stress points that have built up. “To discuss things in a cooperative sense, I guess, is the best that we can do to overcome one or the other stress situation we had in the past,” he said.

The price action reflects a market struggling to find direction, caught between bullish optimism and lingering selling pressure. Despite the broader slowdown in its price action, technical analysis shows that XRP is still displaying a resilient structure on the charts that maintains its critical support levels. According to Egrag Crypto, a popular analyst known for his long-term technical outlooks on XRP, the token may soon enter what will become the most explosive fifth wave yet. Related Reading: XRP’s Price Doesn’t Match Its Growing Real-World Use, Study Finds XRP Elliott Wave Analysis: ‘The Power Of 5’ Egrag Crypto’s latest technical analysis on the social media platform X points to the fact that XRP is in the final stages of its fourth impulse wave, which is a corrective wave based on the popular Elliott Wave Theory. Notably, this movement is now setting up for the beginning of the fifth wave, which is a bullish impulse under the same theory. Looking at previous cycles on the 5-day candlestick timeframe chart, particularly during 2017 and 2021, showed that similar setups came before massive upward surges in XRP’s price. The analyst’s chart displays a repeating structure of five-wave patterns, each representing major bullish impulses in the token’s history. The chart also reflects the distinct cyclical rhythm of XRP’s price behavior over the years. Each major impulsive phase (waves 1, 3, and 5) has always been followed by smaller corrective waves (2 and 4), a structure that continues to repeat with precision. The overlapping bands in cyan and pink, representing exponential moving averages, now point to XRP consolidating within a strong support region around $2.20, which indicates that the fourth impulse wave is coming to an end. XRP Technical Analysis: Source @egragcrypto on X Analyst Says Don’t Fight It By Egrag Crypto’s measure, the ongoing consolidation might be setting the stage for a similar move to double-digit prices if the fifth wave unfolds as projected. The visual projection marks potential Fibonacci extensions of 1.272, 1.414, 1.618, and 2.618 at $4.789, $5.515, $6.755, and $18.259 as possible long-term targets once the fifth wave takes hold. These levels may act as resistance points in the impending bull phase because they resemble the wave geometry that drove XRP’s earlier rallies in 2017 and 2021. Interestingly, the analyst also referenced how skepticism often peaks before major rallies. He reminded followers of a trader who lost $30 million shorting XRP during its last major uptrend in 2024. As such, the analyst concluded by urging traders not to “fight the fifth wave” but to “ride it.” Related Reading: Get Ready — The End Of November Will Be Massive For XRP, CEO Says At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.27, down by 1.6% and 9.2% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

For much of the year, investors were selling shares or borrowing funds to buy crypto, betting that corporate treasuries loaded with tokens would outperform holding the coins directly. Now that Bitcoin and Ether have fallen, those same stocks are falling harder. Some investors are smugly saying they saw this coming, while others are doubling down like nothing changed. Michael Saylor set the model back in 2020 when he reshaped a small software company, then known as MicroStrategy, into a major crypto holder now operating as Strategy. When Bitcoin rallied earlier this year, Strategy’s valuation climbed to about $128 billion in July. Today, it is closer to $70 billion. The collapse in value is also affecting the many companies that copied Strategy’s move, as well as investors who chased the hype. Well‑known venture capitalist Peter Thiel backed many of these companies and is now taking losses alongside everyday traders who followed charismatic promoters. Stocks fall as crypto slide spreads Saylor has stayed optimistic in public messages, saying Bitcoin is “on sale.” But critics who questioned the logic of paying premiums for these companies are now being heard. Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra Markets, said: “The whole concept makes no sense to me. You are just paying $2 for a one‑dollar bill. Eventually those premiums will compress.” Many traders expected exactly this outcome, since these companies were often priced above the actual value of their crypto holdings. When these companies first appeared, large institutional investors used them as a workaround to get exposure to crypto. But in the past two years, crypto exchange‑traded funds have made that workaround unnecessary. As a result, the original appeal of crypto‑treasury stocks is weakening. BitMine Immersion Technologies, a major ether‑treasury play backed by Thiel and run by longtime Wall Street strategist Tom Lee, is down more than 30% over the past month. ETHZilla, a former biotech company that shifted into ether accumulation and also counts Thiel as an investor, is down 23% over the same period. Crypto prices rose earlier this year, helped by favorable sentiment under the Trump administration. That rise fueled additional demand for crypto‑treasury companies. But the rally came to a halt on October 10, when a surprise tariff announcement against China triggered selling pressure. A record‑length government shutdown and uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy also added strain. Bitcoin has fallen 15% in the past month. Strategy is down 26%. Matthew Tuttle’s ETF MSTU, which targets twice the daily move of Strategy, is down 50%. Investors unwind trades while others stay committed Investor Jimmy Chanos, who closed his hedge funds in 2023 but still trades privately, had been shorting Strategy while buying Bitcoin. He told clients on Friday that he is now closing that position. Jimmy said crypto‑treasury stocks are still priced above the value of their holdings, but not at the extreme levels seen earlier. “The thesis has largely played out,” he wrote. Some companies still hold enough reserves to avoid immediate trouble. Others may struggle to raise cash to buy more tokens, which could put more pressure on crypto prices. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive, said, “A lot of them are stuck.” Strive bought Bitcoin at prices more than 10% above current levels, and its shares are down 28% this month. Cole said Strive can “ride out the volatility” because it raised funds using preferred shares instead of debt. Not everyone is backing away. Cole Grinde, a 29‑year‑old investor in Seattle, put about $100,000 into BitMine at $45 a share earlier this year. He is down about $10,000 but says he is adding more. He sells BitMine options to offset some losses. Cole said Tom Lee’s background and influence made him confident. “I think his network and his pizzazz have helped the stock skyrocket since he took over,” he said.

Developers now have access to an official test environment on AlphaNet, opening a rich realm of programmable possibilities. According to Denis Angell of XRPL Labs, this is the first time the ledger supports Layer 1 smart contracts, ushering in a new era. In a commentary shared soon after, ecosystem analyst Vet called the development a “big step” for smart contracts on the XRPL . He emphasized that this advance allows institutions and developers to build DeFi‑style services directly on the ledger. What’s Changing The new capability introduces smart contracts that integrate with XRPL’s core architecture. The update supports deployable contracts running on WebAssembly (WASM) with access to XRPL’s payment and token‑issuance features. BIG step towards smart contracts on the XRP Ledger. Still early but lemme explain. Why smart contracts on the XRP Ledger and what does it mean for our ecosystem? – Advanced institutional products on services on chain – Prediction markets – Innovative AMM/lending protocols… https://t.co/893pFSgwSG pic.twitter.com/PWLsTC4Ltc — Vet (@Vet_X0) November 7, 2025 Key changes include new transaction types such as ContractCreate and ContractCall, and ledger entries for contract state and byte‑code storage. This means developers can write, deploy, and interact with on‑chain applications directly on XRPL rather than relying exclusively on side‐chains or external protocols. Why It Matters for the Ecosystem This evolution gives XRPL a compelling advantage. First, it blends the ledger’s high‑speed settlement, low‑cost transactions, and native primitives with programmability. XRPL has long been chosen for payments and tokenized assets; now it gains a full logic layer. According to Vet, this opens doors to advanced institutional products, prediction markets, innovative lending, and AMM protocols. It also reduces reliance on ledger amendments for each new feature—developers can simply deploy code. This streamlines governance and may enhance security by keeping the base protocol stable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risks and Operational Considerations Adding smart contracts at Layer 1 introduces trade‑offs. Vet summarized key areas: preserving network throughput so payments remain unaffected; ensuring enterprise and exchange workflows remain intact; establishing compute‑use guardrails to prevent resource exhaustion; and maintaining network resources in good condition. Technically, because smart contracts can consume compute and storage, the XRPL team must ensure the ledger remains robust. The fact that AlphaNet is a dedicated dev environment points to cautious rollout practices. Looking Ahead As testing on AlphaNet continues, attention will turn to when smart contracts move to the XRPL main‑net and how smoothly that migration occurs. Roadmap elements such as “Smart Escrows” and expanded language support are already referenced. If testing proves successful, XRPL could very quickly become a leading programmable ledger for institutional DeFi, not just payments. For developers, this is the moment to engage. For institutions, this is a moment to evaluate. And for the XRPL ecosystem, this is the moment to scale. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
