Crypto analyst TradingShot revealed why this development was a positive going forward and is a good buy signal for those looking to invest in the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Ethereum Claims Address Dominance With 43% Lead—Will It Keep Rising? Bitcoin Triggers Buy Signal After Price Hit Second Green Month Candle TradingShot mentioned in a TradingView post that it is always a good signal to buy whenever the Bitcoin price closes two consecutive green monthly candles. He made this assertion based on the multi-year chart, which he also claimed shows that the market continues to rally whenever Bitcoin records these two straight green candles. The crypto analyst revealed that the Bitcoin price recorded three straight green candle occasions and a clear accumulation phase in the 2021 bull run. Meanwhile, in the 2017 bull run, the Bitcoin price recorded numerous straight green candle occasions. This market cycle looks to be replicating the 2021 bull run pattern, as BTC recorded three straight monthly green candles between January and March earlier this year before it recorded an accumulation phase. Therefore, as TradingShot explained, this is likely a good buying opportunity since the Bitcoin price could record a third straight monthly green candle in November. Another reason why Bitcoin would likely experience a monthly green candle in November is because the flagship crypto has enjoyed monthly positive returns most of the time it closed October in the green. The Bitcoin price outlook for November also looks bullish because of the upcoming US elections. The aftermath of the elections is expected to bring certainty to the market, which could cause Bitcoin to rally. Economist Alex Krüger predicted that the BTC could rally quickly to $90,000 if Donald Trump wins. Meanwhile, he mentioned that there is a chance that the flagship crypto could drop to as low as $65,000. Price Needs To Stay Above $69,000 In The Meantime In an X post, popular analyst Justin Bennett mentioned that the drop in Bitcoin’s price below $70,000 isn’t a good look, but the Bulls’ last line of defense is $69,000. He remarked that the $65,000 lows are next if that price level fails to hold on the high time frames. Justin Bennett added that he doubts that the equal highs from March and October near $73,700 will go unchallenged. However, before that happens, he suggested that the Bitcoin price could retest the lows at around $65,000. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also revealed that the Bitcoin price needs to hold above $69,000 to reach a new all-time high (ATH). He predicted that BTC could rally to $78,000 if the $69,000 level holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading?

Ethereum Could Crash Over 60%, Analyst Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/market-shockwave-ahead-ethereum-could-crash-over-60-analyst-says/,"Like most digital assets, Ethereum witnessed a correction this week by losing over 5% in the last 24 hours while trading just above $2,500. While the increased on-chain activity could eventually make the bulls bet for the bounce back of Ether, a few experts differ with this perspective. Crypto veteran analyst Peter Brandt predicts further downfall in Ether to the extent of loss of over 60% from its present price, with no indication of changing. Currently, Ether is trading at a 42-month low. While Bitcoin re-tested the $70k mark early this week, Ether maintains a sluggish price action and is too far off from the experts’ target of $4k.

Ether’s Strong Bearish Movement Ethereum trades at its 42-month low against the world’s top digital asset, which suggests a bearish momentum. Zooming out of the price chart, Ethereum is on a downward spiral and a painful market correction for holders and investors. According to Brandt, Ethereum’s bearish sentiment will continue with no reassuring signs of reversal. Interesting to note that there was not a buy signal in $ETH In fact, chart remains bearish with unmet target at 1551 pic.twitter.com/sjkXyTQXU2 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 31, 2024 In a Twitter/X post, Brandt shared a graph saying there’s no but signal for Ether. He added that Ethereum’s chart is bearish, with the bulls making it difficult to hit the $1,551 target. The 1-day-chart highlights the asset’s continued bearish moment momentum that started last August, characterized by a descending channel. Ethereum’s bearish flag is terrible news for traders and holders, suggesting a continued downtrend. Analyst Sees Bearish Metrics For Ethereum Aside from the bearish signals on the graph, Brandt also noted a few discouraging metrics for Ethereum. For example, Ether has dropped by over 5% over the last 24 hours, registering a sharper decline than Solana, at -4.91%, and Bitcoin, at -3.87%. Also, Brandt noted that the ETH/BTC trading ratio dipped to 0.03613, a 42-month low, as BTC continues to lead the broader crypto market. Although Ethereum is currently priced at $2,507, Brandt sees the asset dipping even further to $1,551, reflecting a possible 62% decline from its current value. $1,551 As Ethereum’s Unmet Target Brandt sees $1,551 as the asset’s unmet target and a key milestone. In his analysis, this level serves as the holders’ point of capitulation. The recent dips in price have affected investors’ and holders’ confidence, with Ethereum struggling to sustain the $2,400 support.

According to a popular crypto pundit, the meme coin appears not to be done yet, as it readies itself for another move to the upside. Here’s Why $0.169 Could Be Pivotal To DOGE’s Future In a new post on X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has put forward an exciting outlook for the price of Dogecoin over the next couple of days. According to the market expert, the largest meme coin looks primed to cross the $0.2 landmark as the month of November drags on. This bullish projection is based on the formation of a bull flag pattern on the Dogecoin four-hour chart. The bull flag is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a period of steady upward movement (the flagpole) followed by a short period of price consolidation or slight downward movement (the flag). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Correction Triggers $296 Million In Liquidations – Can BTC Still Hit ATH? Typically, the bull flag is an excellent upward continuation pattern that could suggest the persistence of a positive run. The trick is to wait for the breakout of the flag (the price consolidation) before confirming the continuation of the upward trend. This breakout from the flag often results in a move higher, usually measuring the length of the prior flag pole. According to Martinez, this pattern appears to be playing out on the Dogecoin four-hour chart, with the trigger point lying around the $0.169 mark. The analyst noted that there is a major resistance around $0.168 and a successful close above this region could see the DOGE price run up towards its 2024 high. Using the length of the first flagpole, the price target for Dogecoin is placed at around $0.209, which would represent a 29% rally from the current price point. While a move to $0.209 would reflect a major leap in the meme coin’s price trajectory, DOGE would still be about 250% adrift of its all-time high price of $0.7316. Dogecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Dogecoin stands at around $0.1603, reflecting a mere 1.1% in the past day. While the meme coin seems to have slowed down in the last 24 hours, its weekly performance still places it amongst the best-performing assets in recent weeks. According to data from CoinGecko, the DOGE price is up by nearly 20% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH?
