The reason for this bullish outlook is a presale that is selling millions of tokens daily, a pace that is rapidly pushing the once-distant dream of a $1 valuation well within reach. This explosive momentum has propelled Ruvi AI past the $4 million fundraising milestone. A burgeoning community of over 3,900 holders has already acquired more than 285 million RUVI tokens , a testament to the project’s incredible demand. This record-breaking sales velocity is a clear signal that the market views Ruvi AI as a project with the potential for an earth-shattering rally, far exceeding the initial performance of many now-established coins. Smashing Forecasts with Unprecedented Demand The comparison to Avalanche’s early days is significant. While AVAX created a wave of crypto millionaires, Ruvi AI’s current trajectory suggests it could deliver even more explosive returns. The key difference is the sheer speed of token sales. By selling millions of tokens each day, Ruvi AI is demonstrating a level of market hunger that analysts say is rare and often precedes a massive price surge. This isn’t just speculative hype. Ruvi AI’s value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its credibility is further solidified by a successful CyberScope audit, which assures investors of its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , signaling to the broader market that it is a serious contender. This powerful combination of utility and trust is why experts believe its $1 price target is becoming a realistic short-term goal. The Super App Fueling the $1 Valuation Goal The engine driving Ruvi AI’s historic demand is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is designed to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token and support its journey to $1. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining the creative process. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative workflow for maximum efficiency. Last Call: Guaranteed 40% Price Jump Is Locked In The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at a ground-floor entry of just $0.020 . However, this opportunity is disappearing at an astonishing rate. In a powerful demonstration of its in-demand status, 20% of the Phase 3 token allocation was sold in just a few days . According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns as RUVI heads towards its $1 goal: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s vibrant community. The Verdict With a presale demand that outpaces even the early days of market titans, Ruvi AI has proven it has the momentum and fundamentals for a historic run. For investors looking to get in on the ground floor of a project with a realistic path to a $1 valuation, the time to act is now.

As such, traders should expect the coin to continue trading in the $2.70-3.10 mark for the next few days. Key levels to watch are $2.65 and $3.15 with each level suggesting a breakout from the trend. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market capitalization, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR’s innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant medium term growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR down? NEAR found short term support at the $2.80 price level enabling the price to recover rapidly to $3.10 before the price crashed again to below the $2.70 mark. Now the price has returned to the $2.70 mark but struggles in climbing higher. Will NEAR recover? NEAR protocol price has seen a massive selloff in the last thirty days as price fell from near the $3.00 mark to the current $2 price level.

In the past few days NEAR observed a quick recovery to the $2.80 level where it faced short-term resistance and crashed back below the $2.70 mark. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next several years. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable price prediction. However, the project must keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem.

The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35.

In mid-July, the price of NEAR Protocol surged toward the high of $3 but it started to decay in the later half of the month, a trend that continued in August with NEAR closing the month at $2.38.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|NEAR|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 21:04:25

Security CoinStats has integrated the Glider Token Risk, a breakthrough scanning technology from cybersecurity firm Hexens. The new integration brings advanced token analysis tools to traders worldwide. It also gives them instant access to over 22 smart contract risks before they buy. Regulation The United States Senate has scheduled a high-profile hearing on October 1 to examine the taxation of crypto assets. The hearing will involve several industry experts, including representatives from Coinbase and Coin Center. Canada’s FINTRAC has imposed a C$19.6 million ($14.09 million) penalty on Peken Global Limited, the entity operating KuCoin. FINTRAC states the platform failed to comply with Canadian anti-money laundering policies. However, KuCoin has appealed the decision in court. Senator Elizabeth Warren , along with several Democrats and ethics lawyers, has called for an investigation into potential ethics violations related to deals with the United Arab Emirates. The Trump administration has recently relaxed restrictions on the sale of sensitive national security technology to the United Arab Emirates.

The flagship cryptocurrency is trading around $109,570. The market is divided over BTC’s next move, with some predicting a drop to $60,000, while others favor a push towards $140,000. Vanadi Coffee Approves Bitcoin (BTC) Investment The Spanish coffee shop franchise-turned Bitcoin treasury company has approved a €1 billion investment in Bitcoin . The approval came in an extraordinary shareholder meeting, with the company highlighting the value of Bitcoin as a global, liquid, and decentralized reserve asset that can withstand the volatility affecting markets. Vanadi Coffee claims to be the first Bitcoin treasury in Spain, and plans to leverage BTC as a long-term asset and a hedge against inflation. The company added that the investment plan will be conducted with complete transparency, in accordance with local regulations. Salvador Martí, President of Vanadi Coffee, called the development a milestone for the company. “We believe in Bitcoin as a store of value for the future and as an asset capable of strengthening management with a long-term vision, transparency, and discipline.” Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops To Lowest Level Since March The cryptocurrency market is in a nervous mood after Bitcoin (BTC) lost key levels over the week. Investor sentiment has been battered, causing the market’s Fear & Greed Index to drop by 16 points in a single day. The index fell to 28 on Friday, its lowest level since March, before recovering to 33. Bitcoin started the week above $115,000, but price crashes on Monday and Thursday pushed the price below the key $109,000 level. This triggered liquidations of over $1 billion in long positions. The crash in the Fear & Greed Index highlights how quickly market sentiment can change when important levels fail to hold. However, fearful conditions are also an opportunity for long-term traders to add to their holdings at a discount. Analysts believe Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could be closer to their next recovery phase than many expect, with some traders already bracing for a turnaround. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down during the ongoing session, maintaining its position above $109,000. The flagship cryptocurrency faced extended bearish pressure this week, crashing nearly 4% on Thursday to fall below $110,000 and settle at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61%, but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline. BTC is trading around $109,500 during the ongoing session. Meanwhile, traders are divided about BTC’s next move, with some predicting a crash to $60,000, while others believe it will rally to $140,000. Multiple analyses state that the price could repeat the same trajectory that foreshadowed the 2021 market top. One analyst highlighted that in 2021, BTC registered a sharp rally to record highs, followed by a blow-off top, a sharp correction, and lastly, a failed test of resistance levels. The sequence triggered a crash that sent the price from $69,000 to $32,000 in weeks. The analyst points out that BTC’s current structure is mirroring the same process and risks a similar trajectory. However, not everyone expects market-ending declines. One trader highlighted a cluster by the 200-day simple and exponential moving averages, which could serve as a support during bull market dips. Analyst Bitbull believes BTC is still far from a cycle top, highlighting that the US Business Cycle, a broad indicator of economic momentum, has yet to peak. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $114,724. It recovered from this level to settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30%. BTC reached an intraday high of $117,998 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,117. The price lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.22% to $115,690. Source: TradingView BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping 0.41% on Sunday to end the weekend at $115,282. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $111,761 on Monday as bearish sentiment intensified. It recovered from this level to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday as BTC reached an intraday high of $113,357. However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $112,017, ultimately dropping 0.64%.

Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $110,369 before settling at $109,697. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline.

In the following lines, we break down the chilling details of the crime and examine whether this story had anything resembling a happy ending. The Bone-Chilling Thriller Grant – a small town in the state of Minnesota – recently became the scene of a brutal crypto-related crime. On September 19, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch Center received a 911 call from a man reporting that he and his family had been held at gunpoint during a violent home invasion by two armed suspects. The individuals in question were the brothers Raymond Christian Garcia and Isiah Angelo Garcia. Earlier that day, the father of the man who called 911 was taking out a garbage can to the street when the alleged criminals suddenly attacked him with an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun. The brothers took the victim into the garage, where they bound his hands and brought him into the house. They later woke up his wife and adult son at gunpoint and also zipped their hands, forcing them to lie on the floor. Raymond Garcia supposedly held the wife and son in their residence for nine hours, while his brother forced the father (Victim 1) to log into his cryptocurrency accounts. He demanded that the victim transfer huge amounts of digital assets into a designated wallet provided by the attackers. “During the robbery, Victim 1 saw both Garcia brothers frequently making phone calls to an unknown third party, who appeared to be providing the information related to the cryptocurrency accounts and transfers,” the official announcement reads. Through this third party, the brother became aware that the father had additional crypto funds and demanded access to them. The victim explained that the assets were stored on a hard drive at a family cabin, approximately three hours away. Isiah Garcia forced the man into his truck and drove to the location where the remaining funds were transferred. In total, the victim sent $8 million worth of digital assets to the attackers’ wallets. The son of Victim 1, who was held at gunpoint while Isiah Garcia was gone, used a brief opportunity to call 911. The police officers were quick to react, and when they arrived, they found Raymond Garcia running out through the back door. For his part, Isiah Garcia (who was returning to the house with the truck) saw the chaos, ditched the vehicle and his weapon, and walked towards a nearby middle school parking lot. To protect the safety of the pupils, Mahtomedi Public Schools was forced to cancel its homecoming football game. In the next few days, the law enforcement officers checked video surveillance cameras and tracked the brothers’ previous locations, and managed to arrest them on September 22 in Texas. What Now? The incident was described by Acting US Attorney Joseph H. Thompson as “a blow to the sense of safety in everyone in Minnesota.” “This is not normal. Minnesotans should not accept wild violence and thievery as normal. Every Minnesotan deserves to live in peace and a life unaffected by rampant crime,” he added. On September 23, the Garcia brothers were charged by complaint in Washington County, Minnesota, with three counts of kidnapping with a firearm, one count of first-degree aggravated robbery, and three counts of first-degree burglary. The following day, they were both charged in a federal complaint with kidnapping. The attackers were scheduled to make their initial appearances in federal court on September 25, at which time the government will request their detention pending trial. “As alleged in the complaint, the Garcia brothers terrorized a Minnesota family in their own home, kidnapping one family member while holding the rest of the family hostage in order to conduct a brazen cryptocurrency theft. This office, together with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners in Minnesota and in Texas, will work tirelessly to hold accountable those responsible for this horrific crime,” FBI Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston, Sr assured.

52401881,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=822253,1759094639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52401881.jpeg,Poland’s crypto law met with criticism and backlash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/poland-adopts-controversial-crypto-law/,"Lawmakers in Poland have approved a bill designed to regulate the country’s cryptocurrency market in accordance with the latest EU rules. Critics say, however, that the legislation goes beyond European requirements, stirring controversy, not just in the crypto community, but in Polish politics as well. Crypto act passed amid concerns over excessive regulation The Sejm, the lower house of Polish parliament, has adopted a new law implementing the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations in the EU member state. The legislation, which has been in the making for quite some time, aims to impose order in Poland’s crypto space, arguably the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. It has been criticized, however, for attempting to overregulate the nation’s crypto industry, stifling innovation and threatening to kill the business of domestic firms that work with digital assets. On Friday, 230 members of the chamber voted in favor of the bill, another 196 rejected it, with no abstentions. The Crypto Assets Act will now go to the Senate, the upper house of parliament in Poland. The government-sponsored law should ensure protection for customers and other market participants from what has been described as “dishonest entities,” the Polish PAP news agency reported. It introduces criminal liability for certain violations such as provision of crypto services and issuance of digital tokens without authorization, and defines the obligations of approved platforms. Its provisions stipulate that Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) will be tasked to supervise the sector and equipped with the appropriate tools to conduct oversight. The KNF will be responsible for registering violations of the new rules and fraudulent activities involving operations with cryptocurrencies. Perpetrators of the most serious offences will face harsh penalties, including fines of up to 10 million Polish złoty ($120,000) and even imprisonment for up to two years. The bill regulates online cryptocurrency exchanges, which will again be supervised by the KNF. They will be required to maintain individual client accounts, which should protect user funds, PAP detailed. According to official data, released earlier this year, 18% of Poles have already invested in crypto assets, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. In July, Deputy Finance Minister of Poland Jurand Drop insisted the proposed regulations are crucial for strengthening investor protection. He also noted the lack of mechanisms to fight fraud, pointing out: “20% of investors in this market declare they have been victims of some kind of fraud or abuse.” Poland’s crypto law met with criticism and backlash The long-awaited legislation was not accepted well by members of the country’s crypto community and the parliamentary opposition, who criticized it throughout its review in the Sejm. While transposing MiCA into national law “sounds innocent,” the crypto act is a “real horror” for crypto entrepreneurs, the crypto news outlet Bitcoin.pl wrote in an article on Saturday. Highlighting some of the powers granted to Poland’s financial regulator, which stirred the industry on the weekend, the Polish portal commented: “The crypto assets law gives the KNF permissions that resemble a repression apparatus rather than market supervision.” They come with “fees, which can simply finish smaller companies” and the “clear guidelines” are just restrictions and costly requirements that will suffocate innovation, the website elaborated, adding: “This law can deal a fatal blow to domestic companies operating in the crypto sector.” The exodus of Polish cryptocurrency firms may have already started, with XTB, one of the largest brokers in Poland, signaling it may seek a license in Cyprus. Jakub Bartoszek, president of the crypto exchange service Cashify, emphasized that the Polish implementation of MiCA is one of the most extensive, imposing high entry costs and multiplies barriers. The crypto entrepreneur expressed hope that Polish President Karol Nawrocki “will listen to the voice of the market and veto the law in its current form,” something the head of state has indicated he may do. During debates in the Sejm, Bitcoin proponent and former presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen also urged Nawrocki, who took office in August, to stop the bill.

Co przyniesie ostatni kwartał 2025 roku?",https://bitcoinist.com/nowa-fala-adopcji-krypto-4-kwartal-2025/,"Rynek kryptowalut wchodzi w ostatni kwartał 2025 roku z dużą dynamiką. Decyzje amerykańskich regulatorów, rosnące zainteresowanie funduszy ETF oraz nowe projekty technologiczne sprawiają, że inwestorzy zastanawiają się, jak ulokować swoje środki. Nie chodzi już tylko o Bitcoina czy Ethereum. Dziś na radarze pojawiają się zarówno dojrzałe aktywa, jak XRP, jak i świeże inicjatywy w rodzaju Snorter Token. Nadchodzi nowa fala adopcji kryptowalut. XRP kandydatem do trzeciego miejsca na podium ETF-ów Ostatnie tygodnie przyniosły istotne informacje dla rynku. SEC analizuje sześć wniosków o uruchomienie spot ETF-ów powiązanych z XRP. Wśród aplikujących są takie podmioty jak Grayscale, 21Shares czy WisdomTree. Decyzje mają zapaść między 18 a 25 października . XRP SPOT ETF TRACKER OCTOBER WILL BE HISTORIC: Grayscale — OCT 18 21Shares — OCT 19 Bitwise — OCT 20 Canary Capital — OCT 23 WisdomTree — OCT 24 Franklin Templeton — OCT 25 CoinShares — OCT 25 $XRP Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/PrNW0GevU4 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 26, 2025 Analitycy wskazują, że ewentualna zgoda oznaczałaby otwarcie drzwi dla ogromnego kapitału instytucjonalnego. Cytując jednego z ekspertów: Zatwierdzenie ETF-ów na XRP może uruchomić rotację płynności z Bitcoina i skierować uwagę funduszy na trzecią co do wielkości kryptowalutę pod względem adopcji regulacyjnej . Warto zauważyć, że Bitcoin już korzysta z efektu ETF-ów, a Ethereum powoli podąża jego śladem. Jeśli XRP dołączy do tego grona, układ sił na rynku może się zmienić. Derywatywy budują fundamenty pod dalszy wzrost Nie tylko ETF-y napędzają oczekiwania wobec XRP. Coraz większą rolę odgrywa rynek instrumentów pochodnych. Dane CME pokazują, że otwarte pozycje na kontraktach futures na XRP przekroczyły 1 miliard dolarów, co jest najszybszym wzrostem wśród wszystkich kryptowalut w tym kwartale. CME ogłosiło także, że od 13 października uruchomi opcje na XRP oraz kontrakty Micro XRP. Dzięki temu inwestorzy instytucjonalni otrzymają regulowane narzędzia do ekspozycji na XRP – komentują analitycy. Równolegle Ripple stara się o licencję bankową w USA, która w przypadku powodzenia zapewni jej bezpośredni dostęp do systemu bankowego. To ruch, który zwiększyłby wiarygodność projektu w oczach największych inwestorów. XRP w kluczowym punkcie Z technicznego punktu widzenia XRP znajduje się w formacji trójkąta zniżkującego. Dolne wsparcie w rejonie 2,70 USD pozostaje nieprzełamane, ale każdy test tego poziomu budzi nerwowość. Średnia krocząca 50-dniowa na poziomie 2,96 USD zatrzymuje kolejne próby wybicia w górę. Świece z długimi cieniami pokazują walkę podaży z popytem, a RSI w okolicach 40 sugeruje brak wyraźnego momentum. Scenariusze są jasne: byki mogą przejąć inicjatywę dopiero po zamknięciu dnia powyżej 3,00 USD, niedźwiedzie liczą na spadek w okolice 2,59 USD. Rynek czeka więc na katalizator, a takim może być październikowa decyzja SEC. Snorter Token – nowe narzędzie na Solanie Podczas gdy XRP walczy o regulacyjną legitymizację, na drugim końcu spektrum pojawiają się projekty świeże i innowacyjne. Jednym z nich jest Snorter Token . Jest on botem tradingowym działającym w ekosystemie Solany. Jego presale zebrał już ponad 4 miliony dolarów, a do zakończenia sprzedaży pozostało jedynie 25 dni. Aktualna cena wynosi 0,1063 USD. W świecie, gdzie inwestorzy nieustannie poszukują kryptowalut z potencjałem x1000 , Snorter wzbudza zainteresowanie dzięki połączeniu technologii i marketingu. Dlaczego Solana? Szybkość i niskie koszty Snorter został oparty na Solanie, ponieważ sieć ta zapewnia błyskawiczne transakcje i minimalne prowizje. To kluczowa przewaga nad botami działającymi na Ethereum, które często zmagają się z wysokimi opłatami i przeciążeniami sieci. Główna funkcja Snortera to wykrywanie nowych tokenów jeszcze zanim staną się popularne. Bot monitoruje mempoole zarówno Solany, jak i Ethereum, wychwytując świeże projekty i pierwsze oznaki płynności. Dzięki temu użytkownicy mogą wchodzić w rynek szybciej niż reszta inwestorów. Bezpieczeństwo przede wszystkim Twórcy Snortera podkreślają, że nie chodzi o ślepe polowanie na każdy nowy token. Wbudowane filtry kontraktów i mechanizmy anty-rug mają minimalizować ryzyko związane z oszustwami czy tzw. rug pullami. Warto przypomnieć, że wielu inwestorów, którzy w 2021 roku kupowali Dogecoina czy Shiba Inu na szczytach, do dziś pozostaje na stratach. Snorter ma działać odwrotnie. Ma na celu umożliwiać wejście w projekt na wczesnym etapie i wyjście z zyskiem, gdy szerszy rynek dopiero się dowiaduje o jego istnieniu. Token SNORT – serce ekosystemu Posiadanie tokena SNORT odblokowuje pełnię możliwości bota. Najważniejsze korzyści to: obniżona prowizja za handel do 0,85% (konkurencja często pobiera 1,5–2%), unlimited snipes – możliwość uczestnictwa w dowolnej liczbie projektów, dostęp do zaawansowanych analiz, udział w głosowaniach nad rozwojem projektu, staking z dynamicznym APY sięgającym 115%. Każdy z tych elementów zwiększa popyt na token i jednocześnie ogranicza jego podaż w obiegu. Śpiesz się, presale jest na finiszu Presale Snortera kończy się za 21 dni. Po tym terminie token trafi na giełdy, gdzie jego cena prawdopodobnie wzrośnie wraz z popytem. Inwestorzy mają ograniczone okno czasowe, aby wejść na preferencyjnych warunkach. Zakupu można dokonać za pomocą SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, a także kartą kredytową. Rekomendowanym rozwiązaniem jest portfel Best Wallet. W praktyce odpowiedź na pytanie jak kupić Snorter Token sprowadza się więc do kilku kliknięć. Kryptowaluty łączą technologię i kulturę Przypadek Snortera pokazuje szerszy trend. Kryptowaluty coraz częściej łączą dwa światy, czyli zaawansowaną technologię i społecznościowy marketing. To połączenie może sprawić, że projekt zyska finalny sukces poprzez kompleksowe podjeście. W tym sensie Snorter staje się ciekawym uzupełnieniem dynamicznej sceny kryptowalut, w której z jednej strony instytucje czekają na decyzje SEC w sprawie XRP, a z drugiej inwestorzy indywidualni polują na kolejne okazje.",Altcoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BTC|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-28 21:24:40

The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $6.61 in 2031. Worldcoin (WLD) is garnering significant attention from both investors and enthusiasts, a trend that aligns with broader market predictions. In early May, WLD experienced a notable surge, quickly positioning itself among the top-performing altcoins. This rise coincided with a spike in activity surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly those related to OpenAI. The increased interest in Worldcoin is likely fueled by speculation surrounding potential collaborations and future projects that could integrate AI technology into the cryptocurrency space, further driving its market momentum.

Resistance holds sellers at $1.31, limiting recovery attempts. Bearish structure with lower highs and lows confirms bearish market control. On September 28, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) trades at $1.25, marking a 3.50% decline in the last 24 hours. The token shows a clear downtrend as it tests key support at $1.25, with immediate resistance placed at $1.31. Over the course of the day, WLD struggled to hold gains after brief upward momentum, reflecting ongoing selling pressure. The current price also stands significantly lower than its all-time high of $11.82, recorded on March 10, 2024, representing a steep 89.44% drop in value over time. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD bearish momentum holds ground On the daily timeframe, WLD displays a consistent pattern of lower highs and lower lows, signaling sustained bearish pressure. Price action shows that every recovery attempt above $1.30 quickly meets resistance, with sellers tightening control around this area. The $1.31 resistance level is proving to be a critical ceiling, repeatedly rejecting bullish attempts to break higher. The inability to establish strength above this zone highlights weakened buying interest and declining momentum. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Meanwhile, the $1.25 level is emerging as a crucial support zone that could dictate the next directional move. If bears manage to push below this threshold, WLD risks opening the path toward deeper retracement levels, which could attract further selling pressure. Conversely, a successful defense of $1.25 could provide temporary relief, though upside potential remains capped unless volume builds strongly toward $1.31. This tug-of-war between support and resistance defines the current structure of the daily chart. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD pressure builds at support On the 4-hour timeframe, WLD reflects sharp selling activity after failing to consolidate gains above $1.29. The repeated rejections below resistance show that bulls lack the strength to drive a sustained recovery. Sellers are firmly defending the $1.29–$1.31 zone, forcing price action downward in successive waves. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Currently, the price continues to press against the $1.25 support level, raising concerns about a potential breakdown if momentum fails to reverse. If this floor is lost, the bearish move could accelerate quickly, as traders may trigger stop losses near this level. To regain strength, WLD would need to climb back above $1.29 and retest $1.31 with higher volume, but until that happens, pressure remains skewed to the downside.

Worldcoin’s immediate outlook depends heavily on how the $1.25 support reacts to ongoing selling pressure. A breakdown below this level could accelerate the downtrend, opening the way for deeper losses as bearish sentiment strengthens. If buyers manage to defend $1.25, the token may attempt a short-lived rebound. However, any recovery is likely to face resistance around $1.29–$1.31, where sellers have consistently regained control. Until WLD breaks above this ceiling, the broader market bias remains bearish. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin’s sharp decline from its all-time high of $11.82 to $1.25 highlights the risks tied to its volatile performance. The token has lost more than 89% of its value since March 2024, underscoring weak long-term momentum despite short-term trading opportunities. At present, the price action reflects heavy bearish control, with support at $1.25 under constant pressure and resistance capped at $1.31. Market participants view these levels as decisive for WLD’s next direction, but without a break above resistance, upside potential remains limited. Investors tracking Worldcoin are weighing its underlying utility and adoption against its prolonged decline. For now, sentiment leans cautious, as the asset struggles to attract sustained buying interest while trading at multi-month lows. Why is the WLD Price Down today The drop in WLD to $1.25 comes as bearish sentiment dominates the market, with sellers overpowering buyers at every recovery attempt. Repeated failures to break above $1.31 have reinforced downward pressure, leaving traders cautious about taking long positions. Market activity shows that momentum has shifted firmly in favor of sellers, with liquidity thinning around key support levels. Broader weakness across altcoins has also weighed on WLD, amplifying its decline and keeping the token locked in a tight range between $1.25 and $1.31. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2031. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success. Worldcoin price prediction September 2025 Worldcoin is expected to exhibit a range of price movements in September 2025. The potential low is $0.84, while the average price might be around $1.30.

Optimists argue upgrades will eventually lift the project, but patience is wearing thin. In contrast, exciting new names like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are picking up traction quickly, with investors betting that speed, utility and community energy can deliver far stronger returns than the slow-moving ADA ecosystem. ADA price pressure mounts Cardano (ADA) has long been praised for its academic and research-first approach, but that steady pace hasn’t always rewarded short-term traders. At the moment, the ADA price sits close to the $0.50 mark, which many view as a key psychological level. A break below could trigger fresh selling pressure, with some analysts warning of a slide into the mid-40 cent range if momentum doesn’t return. Although ADA still benefits from a loyal community and a strong development team, the crypto market has become increasingly competitive. Faster, cheaper and more flexible tokens are drawing in capital that might otherwise have flowed into Cardano. For holders, this raises a difficult question: Wait for ADA’s slow-but-steady progress, or rotate into newer projects. Layer Brett’s presale surge In sharp contrast to Cardano’s cautious progress, Layer Brett (LBRETT) has come out of the gate swinging. The token sits at just $0.0058 in presale and has already pulled in more than $4 million, showing how quickly demand is building. Early buyers are also being rewarded with staking returns that remain above 620% APY at the time of writing, although yields will fall as more wallets join the pool, giving first movers the strongest upside. Crucially, Layer Brett is not relying on hype alone. As an Ethereum Layer 2 project, it brings faster transactions and lower costs, while the roadmap outlines NFT rollouts, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging. Buying is kept deliberately easy: Connect a wallet, use ETH or USDT, and tokens are secured in minutes. For presale investors, this combination of meme-style virality and serious technical underpinnings has made LBRETT one of the most talked-about launches of the year. Social traction and upcoming giveaway Momentum around Layer Brett isn’t only about presale numbers. Its community presence is growing fast across multiple platforms. Telegram and X groups are closing in on 10k members each, TikTok has already passed 25k followers, and YouTube reviewers are adding to the buzz with growing view counts. This visibility is helping LBRETT reach investors who might never have considered getting in early on a meme-driven project. Adding fuel to the fire, the team has hinted at a $1 million giveaway designed to reward early adopters and keep engagement high. Community-driven marketing of this kind is proving powerful and it’s a sharp contrast to Cardano’s slower, development-focused communication style. ADA vs. LBRETT: where’s the upside? For cautious investors, ADA remains a respectable hold with long-term potential if its upgrades gain traction. It has history, credibility and a strong base of supporters. But for those looking for bigger multiples in the near term, Layer Brett is making the stronger case. With its presale still under one cent, staking returns above 600 percent, viral community growth and a utility-rich roadmap, LBRETT is being tipped to move from fractions of a penny to $1 and beyond. That’s the kind of breakout Cardano holders haven’t enjoyed in years. While ADA price movements are tied to slow ecosystem progress, Layer Brett is proving that speed, hype and utility together can create an outsized opportunity. Secure your LBRETT tokens today — the presale is live, and early entry won’t last forever.

Priced at $0.035, Mutuum Finance is storming the market. The project remains in presale phase 6 that is more than 50% sold out. Having already raised well over $16.5 million in presale, with more than 16,620 holders, MUTM has been hailed by analysts as the “next SHIB” on account of its growth potential. And unlike SHIB, whose growth comes from community hype, MUTM comes with actual utility from its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that combines peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract models. With great staking rewards, good security audits, and a clearly defined roadmap, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling chance for investors to reap great rewards and a real DeFi-supported alternative to traditional meme coins. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: October Momentum Builds Amid Burn Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) is displaying hints of a potential bullish reversal heading into October, fueled by underlying on-chain events that can sustain a continued price resurgence. The token’s burn rate doubled 400% in 24 hours, removing over 1.15 million SHIB from circulation, an action that capped supply and added still more pressure to the price. Concurrently, token outflows from exchanges surged from $378,000 to 2.29 million tokens, a reflection of decreasing selling pressure as investors transferred assets from trading platforms, according to Coinglass. All these combined suggest SHIB can look forward to renewed traction in the coming weeks, and for those who are hoping for higher upside potential and with improved fundamentals, eyes are increasingly shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Momentum Accelerates Mutuum Finance recently launched the highly anticipated Stage Six presale. MUTM tokens now selling at $0.035, a 16.17% price appreciation over the previous round. Investor demand remains extremely robust, with more than 16,620 investors contributing more than $16.5 million of committed capital to date. To further enhance the security of the platform, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program where they welcome white-hat researchers and developers to identify bugs. They will be categorized into four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low, for thorough detection and speedy patching of possible vulnerabilities. Mutuum protocol is constructed around sound collateral management in a bid to protect the ecosystem and users. Some of the most noteworthy protective measures include perpetual collateral ratios, limits on loans, and deposit limits. Undercollateralized positions are quickly liquidated, while penalties and remediation fees stabilize the platform and minimize systemic risk. Efficiency is the central concept at Mutuum Finance. Through optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, and particularly overcollateralized positions, the protocol achieves maximum capital utilization with strong protection. Reserve requirements act as a market shock absorber, and surplus reserves can be invested profitably in riskier assets to offset volatility. Mutuum Finance’s vision is to redefine DeFi along three pillars: long-term sustainability, reliability, and access. Through the provision of a secure and scalable lending and borrowing platform, the platform is democratizing decentralized finance for retail as well as institutional customers. As a gesture of gratitude for the initial community engagement, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will be rewarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The action is one way of showing that Mutuum cares about rewarding the initial adopters of the project while promoting awareness for the cause. While Shiba Inu could stage a comeback in October, Mutuum Finance is a superior purchase. With over $16.5 million raised, 16,620+ investors, and tokens valued at $0.035 in Stage 6 presale, MUTM is blending true DeFi utility with strong security, staking benefits, and total lending solutions. Its pioneering platform and growing community place it above the rest as a meme coin alternative. Join the Mutuum Finance presale today to be on the ground floor before the next phase of growth.

This retest has been most visible in futures open interest, where billions of dollars in positions have been wiped out across major exchanges. This rapid unwinding comes as a correction move to weeks of excessive leverage during uptrends that had pushed derivatives activity to unsustainable levels. Related Reading: When Will XRP Reach $25? Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction Massive Open Interest Wipeout Across Major Exchanges The most recent Ethereum price correction was a broader market reset rather than a mere dip, with leveraged traders facing the brunt of the losses. Data shows that Ethereum’s open interest experienced a steep downfall over the just concluded week across multiple crypto exchanges. According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, billions worth of Ethereum positions were wiped out last week, with Binance leading the downturn with the steepest monthly average drop. Ethereum’s slide under the $4,000 mark proved to be the breaking point for over-leveraged traders. The move unleashed a wave of liquidations across derivatives markets, compounding selling pressure. Data shows that more than $3 billion was erased on September 23 through Binance alone, followed by over $1 billion just a day later. Bybit also shed $1.2 billion in positions, while OKX recorded a $580 million decline. The sharp reduction is visible in aggregate open interest, which has slumped to its lowest level since early 2024. As the chart data shows, futures leverage and open interest were closely tied to the price rally in July and August, and at the same time, it declined in lockstep with the price. Ethereum Open Interest by exchange Spot Ethereum ETF Outflows Add To Market Strain Ethereum’s break below $4,000 and the decline in open interest coincides with a week of heavy outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. According to data from Farside Investors, $795.56 million flowed out over five trading days last week, which is the largest weekly exodus since the products launched. The sell-off intensified toward the end of the week, with Thursday recording $251.2 million in outflows, followed by another $248.4 million on Friday. Waning institutinal participation contributed massively to the sell-side pressure, with investors showing caution amid uncertainty over whether regulators will allow staking features in these ETFs. This synchronized exit from both derivatives and institutional products has amplified volatility, creating a convergence of pressure across Ethereum’s trading ecosystem.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,002. Despite this attempt to regain stability, the leading altcoin is still down by about 10% in a weekly timeframe, considering it was trading around $4,490 this time last week. The bullish scenario now lies in whether ETH can reclaim and sustain a move above $4,000.

While established coins like Tron (TRX) offer stability, market analysts are issuing an urgent message: Tron can wait. The real, time-sensitive opportunity lies with Ruvi AI (RUVI), a project whose presale is moving at such a blistering pace that it’s being called one of the fastest-growing altcoins on the market. With Phase 3 hitting 20% completion in just a matter of days, the window to secure a ground-floor position is closing rapidly. This incredible speed is the latest chapter in a presale that has been nothing short of spectacular. Ruvi AI has officially soared past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens already claimed by a rapidly expanding global community of more than 3,900 holders . This level of demand is why experts are urging investors to prioritize Ruvi AI, as it shows all the signs of a project on the verge of a major price explosion. Why the Urgency? The Power of Unprecedented Growth Analysts are advising investors to shift their focus from coins like Tron because the potential for life-changing gains lies in early-stage projects with explosive momentum. Ruvi AI fits this description perfectly. Selling 20% of its Phase 3 allocation in mere days demonstrates a level of market hunger that is rare and often precedes a massive rally. This is not just speculative fervor. Ruvi AI’s value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its credibility is further solidified by a successful CyberScope audit, assuring investors of its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , which signals to the broader market that it is a serious, high-growth AI contender. This combination of speed, utility, and trust is why experts are calling it a must-have for this bull cycle. The Super App Fueling a Record-Breaking Presale The engine driving Ruvi AI’s historic demand is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining the creative workflow. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. The Clock is Ticking: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . However, this ground-floor entry point is disappearing at an astonishing rate. With 20% of the stage’s allocation sold in days, the opportunity to buy at this price is extremely limited. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns for early supporters: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s vibrant community. The Verdict The message from market analysts is clear: while Tron has its place, the once-in-a-cycle opportunity for exponential growth is happening right now with Ruvi AI. With its record-breaking presale, powerful utility, and a guaranteed price increase just around the corner, the time to secure your position is now.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. At the start of September, Tron is trending near the $0.34 range, maintaining its price above $0.31, as the current Tron sentiment is bullish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 22:45:00

Some analysts believe a bounce is possible but others think momentum is fading as attention shifts to newer Ethereum-based tokens. Chief among them is Layer Brett (LBRETT) , a presale project already drawing comparisons to the viral breakouts of past meme cycles — and being tipped by some to deliver gains of more than 4600%. Pepe coin price prediction The Pepe coin price prediction has split opinions. On one side, bulls argue that PEPE still commands strong brand recognition as one of the leading meme tokens launched in 2023. Supporters point to deep liquidity and an established holder base as signs the token can recover quickly if market sentiment turns risk-on again. On the other side, skeptics highlight that PEPE has already seen its parabolic run and now struggles to find fresh catalysts. With the token sitting near crucial support, a break lower could undermine confidence further. Analysts who take the bearish view believe the best-case scenario is sideways trading, while more optimistic traders argue a rebound is still possible if volumes pick up. Layer Brett’s breakout potential While PEPE wrestles with support, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is climbing the charts of investor interest. Starting at just $0.0058 in presale, the project has already pulled in more than $4 million, a figure that shows how quickly demand is accelerating. Staking rewards are still sitting in the hundreds of percent — currently above 600% APY — though they reduce as more holders lock in, giving early movers the best shot at outsized gains. What sets Layer Brett apart is its Ethereum Layer 2 backbone. Low fees and faster speeds are paired with real utility features: NFT launches, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging all appear on the roadmap. Buying has also been kept simple, requiring only a wallet connection and ETH or USDT to secure tokens in minutes. It’s this blend of meme coin appeal and usable infrastructure that has analysts calling LBRETT the Ethereum meme with genuine staying power. Social traction and $1M giveaway tease Momentum behind Layer Brett isn’t just about numbers on a presale page. The project is seeing fast growth across social platforms, with Telegram and X groups closing in on 10k members each and TikTok already boasting over 25k followers. YouTube reviews are adding to the buzz, helping the token reach a wider audience. Adding to that excitement, the team has lined up a $1 million giveaway that has the community watching closely for details. It’s the kind of marketing push that keeps engagement levels high and helps LBRETT stand out against projects like PEPE, which are struggling to generate fresh momentum. PEPE vs. LBRETT — where traders see bigger upside For long-time holders, PEPE still has a role as one of the more established meme tokens, and any sharp market rally could lift its price off current support. But the ceiling may be limited compared to newer plays. With no major new catalysts, the risk is that PEPE trades sideways while attention drifts elsewhere. That’s where Layer Brett is capturing momentum. With a presale still under one cent, staking rewards in the hundreds of percent, viral growth across social media and a utility-driven roadmap, analysts suggest it could be on track for a move from $0.0058 to $1 — a return measured in multiples, not percentages. For traders seeking outsized opportunity, LBRETT is increasingly seen as the Ethereum meme play to watch in 2025. Early buyers are locking in LBRETT at presale — don’t miss your chance to do the same.

In an official Marumasa Hotta release , the firm said the name change will be officially instated at a meeting of shareholders on November 11. Marusho Hotta also announced that the company would change its English name to “Bitcoin Japan Corporation” as it begins stockpiling Bitcoin (BTC) . The company first announced its new Bitcoin treasury business operations after a June deal saw the US-based crypto custody player Bakkt Holdings agree to buy a controlling share in Marusho Hotta.

Read the full press release : https://t.co/XxHU3hm1Rf pic.twitter.com/Jon5t2iYnw — Bakkt (@Bakkt) September 22, 2025 Marusho Hotta: Bitcoin Pivot Under Bakkt The Japanese firm is one of the country’s most storied and best-known kimono makers and textile producers. It also operates a range of contemporary and hybrid fashion brands. But after years of falling sales and stagnation on the Tokyo Exchange, it was taken over by the Tokyo-based RIZAP Group in 2017. Bakkt made its move in June, claiming it hopes to become Marusho Hotta’s largest shareholder and transform the firm into “a leading Japanese Bitcoin treasury company.” In its September 26 release, Marusho Hotta wrote: “We have decided to launch a new business, the Bitcoin treasury business, so we can expand our business scope and expand into new fields in the future. We are also considering the launch of finance-related business operations.” These operations, it appears, will be primarily related to Marusho Hotta’s Bitcoin treasury operations. Marusho Hotta (8105) share prices on the Tokyo Exchange over the past 12 months. (Image: Google Finance) New Management Confirmed The firm has also confirmed that Bakkt International President Phillip Lord will become Bitcoin Japan’s new CEO. Akshay Naheta, the co-chief executive officer of Bakkt Holdings, will assume the new role of Chairman of the Board of Directors. The company added that its new management structure would “further align the interests of directors and shareholders.” This, the firm said, will help the company “achieve a medium- to long-term improvement in corporate value.” More Textiles Firms Turn to BTC? Marusho Hotta was founded in 1861 and opened one of Japan’s first kimono wholesale stores in 1894. It floated on the Tokyo Exchange in 1974. Earlier this year, Kitabo, a TYO-listed synthetic yarns producer, announced its own plans to buy Bitcoin and “enter the cryptoasset and Real-World Asset (RWA) sectors.” Kitabo said it plans to buy around $5.4 million worth of Bitcoin in an initial foray into the market. The firm, like many others in the world of Japanese textiles and traditional clothing, has seen revenues plummet in recent years. In 2021, the EU-Japan Center for Industrial Cooperation noted that “old, traditional [Japanese] retailers have seen sales diminish as they become less and less viable.” The likes of Kitabo and Marusho Hotta have certainly felt the pinch.

The buys came through names like Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, FalconX and OKX.

Exchange Balances Fall To 9-Year Low According to Glassnode data, the amount of ETH held on exchanges has plunged from roughly 31 million to about 14.8 million ETH — a drop of 52% from 2016 levels. Many of those coins are likely in staking contracts, cold wallets or institutional custody, and the recent launch of the first Ethereum staking ETF has helped pull more supply off exchanges. Lower exchange balances mean fewer coins ready to be sold instantly on exchanges, which can make price moves sharper when big orders hit the market. ETH Hovers Near $4,000 As Volatility Rises Based on TradingView readings, ETH is trading around $4,011, down roughly 0.33% over the last 24 hours and more than 10% over the past week. The token briefly slipped under $3,980 earlier in the session before climbing back, and it remains below a recent close of $4,034. This two-week pullback has returned ETH to a key $4,000 support area, and short-term swings have become more pronounced as holders reposition. $3,700 Becomes A Line In Sand Crypto analyst Ted Pillows has warned that the $3,700 to $3,800 zone could face heavy pressure. Reports note that if ETH falls below $3,700, many margin positions could be wiped out and spark forced selling that pushes prices lower. $ETH liquidity heatmap is showing decent long liquidations around the $3,700-$3,800 level. This level could be revisited again before Ethereum shows any recovery. pic.twitter.com/SQTbfrujAa — Ted (@TedPillows) September 27, 2025 With fewer coins on exchanges and concentrated margin exposure, the short-term outlook is more fragile even as longer-term demand indicators look solid. ETF Outflows Show Institutional Mood Can Flip US-listed ETH funds recorded nearly $800 million in outflows this week, their largest redemptions to date. Still, roughly $26 billion sits in Ethereum ETFs, equal to 5.37% of total supply.

Lookonchain data also highlighted a prior accumulation of roughly $204 million in ETH, showing similar patterns of large players stepping up during dips. Retail traders appear more cautious for now. But the sequence of big buys from institutional-grade custodians suggests some buyers view dips as buying chances while others choose to wait on the sidelines.

In the meantime, the project’s native token continues to be deep in the red on multiple scales and is close to charting another all-time low. Hackathon Halfway There CryptoPotato reported in August that the Pi Network Core Team had come up with a new way to engage with its Pioneers in the form of a hackathon. The 2025 event began on August 21 and its final submission is scheduled for October 15, with an optional midpoint check-in on September 19. The halfway video shows some of the applications that users have developed. The first is called Starmax, which allows users to buy goods with Pi in a simple way. Another one, dubbed Nature’s Pulse, connects consumers with farmers as it allows the former to purchase “fresh, affordable produce with Pi and get them delivered directly to them.” Eternal Rush is a Pi Network-native online game. ReloadPi enables Pi holders to spend their tokens on buying thousands of products from over 300 brands, including ordering pizza or other foods and beverages. StreamPi is a newly created application that caters to Pi investors, allowing them to upload their content and pay with just one token. The team also reminded that there will be a prize pool of 160,000 Pi tokens for up to eight teams and will be distributed in the following manner: 1st Place – 75,000 Pi 2nd Place – 45,000 Pi 3rd Place – 15,000 Pi Honorable Mentions (up to 5 teams) – 5,000 Pi each Pi Price Update Despite the evident success of the hackathon and other recent updates from the team, the project’s native token can’t catch a break. The asset marked a new all-time low last week at just over $0.25, and even though it tried to recover some ground, it was quickly halted and pushed south once again. It’s deep in the red on a weekly scale (25%) and currently sits just 2.3% above the ATL from September 22. The unlocking schedule for the next month is also somewhat concerning, as October 1 and October 4 will see the release of massive quantities, up to 13.4 million coins, which could intensify the immediate selling pressure.

The Math May Shock You,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-shib-really-ever-hit-1-the-math-may-shock-you/,"The Shiba Inu price prediction is back in the spotlight after another round of social media chatter asked the same question: Can SHIB ever really hit $1? Supporters argue that continued burns and ecosystem growth could fuel massive upside, while skeptics highlight just how huge the market cap would need to be for that milestone. At the same time, new tokens like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are drawing attention for more realistic paths to big gains — some forecasts even put its upside in the thousands of percent. Shiba Inu price prediction The Shiba Inu price prediction has always divided the crypto space. On the bullish side, enthusiasts point to token burns and an expanding ecosystem, including Shibarium, as reasons why SHIB could climb much higher in the next cycle. They argue that community backing remains one of the strongest in crypto and that virality can sometimes override traditional valuation models. On the other hand, the math behind SHIB hitting $1 is daunting. At current supply levels, it would require a market cap larger than the entire crypto industry combined. That’s why many analysts believe the realistic ceiling is far lower, perhaps fractions of a cent, unless supply reductions dramatically accelerate. The Shiba Inu price prediction heading into 2025 therefore ranges from modest gains to sideways action, with a moonshot to $1 considered highly unlikely. Layer Brett’s growth story While SHIB wrestles with questions of scale, Layer Brett is being framed as a meme coin with real upside potential. Priced at just $0.0058, the presale has already raised more than $4 million, showing clear demand from investors looking for the next viral hit. At the time of writing, staking rewards sit above 600% APY , though these will reduce as more wallets join, rewarding early adopters the most. What sets Layer Brett apart from older meme coins is its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation. Transactions are faster and cheaper and the roadmap adds utility beyond memes: NFT launches, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging are all in the pipeline. To buy, just connect a wallet, use ETH or USDT and tokens are secured in minutes. For many, this balance of accessibility, hype and utility is exactly what makes LBRETT a standout in today’s market. Social momentum and the $1M giveaway tease Community energy has been a decisive factor in meme coin success and Layer Brett is already building serious traction. Telegram and X groups are closing in on 10k members each, while TikTok has surged past 25k followers. On top of that, YouTube reviews and breakdowns are helping spread the word beyond the core crypto crowd. To keep engagement high, the team has teased a $1 million giveaway as part of its roadmap. That move is designed to reward early supporters and add another layer of excitement as the presale heads into later stages. Combined with viral social buzz, it positions LBRETT as a project with momentum that SHIB has struggled to recreate since its 2021 breakout. Shiba Inu vs. Layer Brett: The case for bigger multiples By contrast, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is being tipped as the more realistic path to outsized returns. With a presale price under one cent, staking rewards as high as 600 percent and a roadmap stacked with utility, analysts argue the token has far more room to run. For early-stage buyers, it offers the kind of explosive multiples that SHIB can no longer realistically deliver. Presale demand is climbing fast — secure your LBRETT allocation before the next price rise.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $2.29. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $3.72 and an average forecast price of $3.58. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The EOS ecosystem has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 in the near future? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.401 (-1.32%) Market Cap $640.38M Trading Volume $371.3K Circulating Supply 1.59B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4027 (Nov 04, 2024) 24-hour High $0.4073 24-hour Low $0.3999 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.441984 (9.92%) Price Volatility 5.33% 50-Day SMA $0.488746 14-Day RSI 29.43 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 37 (Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.578938 EOS price analysis: Negative market sentiment pushes EOS price toward $0.401 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downward market trend toward $0.401. The altcoin lost 1.32% of its value. The EOS coin looks for support around $0.389. On September 28, the EOS price analysis revealed a bearish daily trend for the altcoin. The EOS price experienced significant losses, reaching $0.401 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the altcoin lost up to 1.32% of its value today, as sellers continue to rule the market, causing further price depreciation. The altcoin has now been losing value for a second consecutive day, targeting the next support at $0.389. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirms a decreasing trend as the price moves downward. The EOS/USD value dipped to $0.401 today. The appearance of red candlesticks on the price chart signifies a bearish trend. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.517. The indicator’s lower limit, which serves as the support, has shifted to $0.389. EOSUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 30.38 and is at the brink of entering the oversold region. The downward curve on the RSI graph signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further instability in the market can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also shows selling pressure building up at the current price level. The altcoin’s value has decreased to $0.401 as bears are trying to dominate the price action. Low levels of volatility mark a lesser chance of a reversal in market trends or further price depreciation. The Bollinger Bands have converged, hinting at low volatility. This low level of volatility signifies increased market predictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.412, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.396, indicating support. EOSUSD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 36.19, the RSI curve is pointing downwards, confirming the selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates significant pressure from the selling side of the market. We can expect further depreciation if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

The EOS price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The EOS/USD value has decreased to $0.401 in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further decrease in price levels to retest the support of $0.389. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent resistance around the $0.405 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and took the price to $0.401. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is striving to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the price trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2028 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031, which makes it a good option to buy EOS, though accurate predictions are nearly impossible in the crypto market. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $3.72 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 90th-ranked cryptocurrency. It also experienced strong bullish sentiment in November last year, when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $3.88 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. In mid-July 2025, EOS recovered to $0.625. However, at the start of September, EOS is trending near $0.47 after a price drop, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 23:55:00

One of such comments was made in an old interview which has resurfaced to catch the eye of some XRP investors on the social media platform X. Years later, those comments are being revisited as XRP continues to push for adoption in global markets and as investors are counting down to the SEC’s upcoming decision on Spot XRP ETF applications. Utility Over Hype: Revisiting Garlinghouse’s Message A recent video which was posted on the social media platform X by popular XRP commentator JackTheRippler ties back into an interview where Garlinghouse noted how trillions in capital could pour into XRP in the coming years. In that conversation, Garlinghouse explained that hype alone cannot sustain the value of any cryptocurrency, insisting instead that true growth comes from solving real-world problems and building a customer base. These comments were made in a 2017 interview on CNBC’s Squawk Alley, at a time when cryptocurrencies were mostly valued on speculation alone. In the interview, Garlinghouse pointed out that XRP wasn’t just created to trade on exchanges but was meant to serve a real purpose, which is settling liquidity between banks. At the time, he noted that more than $27 trillion was sitting idle in correspondent banking accounts worldwide to facilitate payments between themselves.

Even though those words were spoken years ago, they still fit into today’s conversations about XRP. Its adoption potential in the worldwide financial system continues to be the foundation of why many investors believe XRP can stand apart from other cryptocurrencies. Countdown To US SEC’s Spot XRP ETF Decision The attention surrounding XRP nowadays is shifting to the regulatory front, with many investors awaiting the outcome of pending Spot XRP ETF applications . After Bitcoin and Ethereum won approval for similar products, many see XRP as the next logical step given its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency. The US SEC has introduced new listing standards designed to speed up crypto ETF approvals, cutting the review window to 75 days or less. Grayscale’s filing is due for a decision on October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19, Bitwise on October 20, CoinShares and Canary Capital on October 23, and WisdomTree on October 24. The eventual launch of a Spot XRP ETF could be the turning point that helps the cryptocurrency take its place alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in traditional finance. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.79.

Central to Labour’s Youth Guarantee programme , the plan represents one of the most radical attempts in years to address Britain’s persistent rates of long-term youth unemployment . In a speech at the Labour Party conference, Reeves will argue that she is committed to nothing less than the abolition of long-term youth unemployment. Under the scheme, those aged 16-24 and out of work for at least 18 months would be given a job offer they would have to take. Those who decline could face sanctions, including a reduction in benefits. Reeves will say the policy is not just about jobs, “It is also about dignity. “We will not allow a generation of young people to languish, without hope or prospects for the future — locked out from security and the fair chance that good work brings,” she will say. The Labour government is adamant that this is not about punishing the young, but preventing them from being left behind in a shifting economy. Budget will decide funding and scope The scheme will be detailed in the Budget on November 26. Ministers will detail whether jobs will be directly funded by the government or subsidised through incentives to employers. The scheme only applies to those in the specified age group and who have been on Universal Credit for 18 months. That means some groups of people — like young adults not claiming benefits, or the recently unemployed — will not be eligible. Officials concede that it is hard to be certain that the scheme creates new jobs rather than filling those that would have been taken anyway. Critics fear the government could pay employers to create low-quality jobs with limited long-term value. For years, unions and business organisations have called on the government to put money into youth jobs. The Trades Union Congress is calling for creating a permanent £1bn-a-year guarantee scheme, akin to those implemented during the 2009 financial crisis and the Covid pandemic. The British Chambers of Commerce supported the principle of a subsidised jobs scheme but warned that many businesses were struggling with higher national insurance contributions and new employment protections. The group said last week that young people without work history would be left without opportunities unless the government helped cover the cost. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of the CBI, said the plan was crucial for the economy but urged the government to provide more detail. She said the business group wanted to know how the scheme would operate and whether it would address rising employment costs. Previous schemes shape the current plan The UK has attempted similar programs in the past. The Future Jobs Fund, introduced in 2009, provided thousands of placements but was scrapped in 2010 as it was deemed too expensive. The Kickstart Scheme was established by Rishi Sunak during the pandemic to stave off a youth jobs crisis, but closed early after fewer than anticipated employers applied. Reeves is framing this plan as narrower. By prioritising those who have been unemployed or not in education the longest, Labour hopes to break a cycle of exclusion. Now one in eight 16-to-24-year-olds is not in work, education, or training, and that number has grown by almost a third over the past four years. The government is already testing elements of the Youth Guarantee in so-called “trailblazer” areas that connect young people with apprenticeships, places at college, or support packages. Ministers also announced earlier this year that £3.8bn of funding would be available to help those with health conditions, making it more difficult for them to move into work. However, skeptics, including international investors and domestic experts, warn that despite the momentum, serious structural challenges — such as skills shortages, regional inequality, and high cost of hiring — will make progress difficult.

This update came after the EV manufacturer shared its sales data from January 2023 to June 2025. According to the data, the company had only sold about 5,300 vehicles . This indicated that the automaker is struggling in the market even after adopting strategies such as opening its 45th sales location in Japan, introducing a competitive fourth EV model, and embracing plans to release an electric ‘kei’ car by late 2026. Although its sales were disappointing and its efforts did not pay off, BYD has not yet lost hope. To boost its sales, the company now offers customers discounts. Based on the strategy, it gives out discounts of up to ¥1 million, which is equivalent to around $6,700. This can be combined with government subsidies to lower prices by as much as 50%. For instance, when one purchases the Atto 3, he or she will pay just under ¥4.2 million. Considering its advantages in the era of the recent crackdowns in the industry, Chinese individuals have reportedly found this strategy appealing. Foreign automakers encounter hardship in the Japanese auto market Tech analysts commented on the situation, acknowledging that BYD’s pricing strategy is unusual because, in recent years, Japanese automakers have hardly reduced their car prices. This has raised worries that Japan’s pricing strategy may fail despite the automaker solidifying its position as a leading EV brand in China. Tatsuo Yoshida, a Senior Auto Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence covering the Japanese auto sector, further explained the situation, stating that the strategy could make first buyers feel like they got a bad deal for paying more, resulting in reduced resale values. The challenges outlined have demonstrated the struggles of foreign automakers like BYD in the Japanese auto market. According to reports from sources, buyers are inclined to choose well-known brands such as Toyota Motor Corp. and usually prefer gas-electric hybrids instead of battery electric vehicles (EVs). This proves that Japanese car buyers are loyal to local firms, affecting major legacy brands. To illustrate this, General Motors Company had quit the Japanese auto market after experiencing poor sales. Additionally, Hyundai Motor Company is taking another shot after leaving the market in 2009. For BYD, the mixed response in the Japanese auto market stands out when compared to the rising sales in the European market. Despite the challenges surrounding its operation, the company is still committed to expanding globally and addressing the challenges encountered in its homeland, China. Yoshida calls on the urgency of making an impression in the EV market Despite its short-term challenges, the Japanese auto market has long-term benefits that offset these challenges. According to reports from reliable sources, EVs are anticipated to make up only 3.4% of new vehicles in Japan in 2025; however, growth is predicted in the years to come. In a statement, Yoshida emphasized that the main goal is to make an impression, not Japan. According to the analyst, what matters for BYD is that it may be recognized by some of the most demanding customers in the world. “What they really want is a history of doing business in Japan with the most discerning quality customers, even if it does not make complete economic sense,” he said. The company still has a long way to go before it can bite off chunks of the market share away from local Japanese companies. BYD sold 512 of all its models for June, compared to a top EV in Japan, Nissan Motor Co.’s Sakura, which sold 1,137. However, Yoshida highlighted that these sales figures are insufficient to pay employee salaries and keep showrooms operational.
