The reason for this bullish outlook is a presale that is selling millions of tokens daily, a pace that is rapidly pushing the once-distant dream of a $1 valuation well within reach. This explosive momentum has propelled Ruvi AI past the $4 million fundraising milestone. A burgeoning community of over 3,900 holders has already acquired more than 285 million RUVI tokens , a testament to the project’s incredible demand. This record-breaking sales velocity is a clear signal that the market views Ruvi AI as a project with the potential for an earth-shattering rally, far exceeding the initial performance of many now-established coins. Smashing Forecasts with Unprecedented Demand The comparison to Avalanche’s early days is significant. While AVAX created a wave of crypto millionaires, Ruvi AI’s current trajectory suggests it could deliver even more explosive returns. The key difference is the sheer speed of token sales. By selling millions of tokens each day, Ruvi AI is demonstrating a level of market hunger that analysts say is rare and often precedes a massive price surge. This isn’t just speculative hype. Ruvi AI’s value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its credibility is further solidified by a successful CyberScope audit, which assures investors of its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , signaling to the broader market that it is a serious contender. This powerful combination of utility and trust is why experts believe its $1 price target is becoming a realistic short-term goal. The Super App Fueling the $1 Valuation Goal The engine driving Ruvi AI’s historic demand is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is designed to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token and support its journey to $1. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining the creative process. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative workflow for maximum efficiency. Last Call: Guaranteed 40% Price Jump Is Locked In The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at a ground-floor entry of just $0.020 . However, this opportunity is disappearing at an astonishing rate. In a powerful demonstration of its in-demand status, 20% of the Phase 3 token allocation was sold in just a few days . According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns as RUVI heads towards its $1 goal: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s vibrant community. The Verdict With a presale demand that outpaces even the early days of market titans, Ruvi AI has proven it has the momentum and fundamentals for a historic run. For investors looking to get in on the ground floor of a project with a realistic path to a $1 valuation, the time to act is now.

As such, traders should expect the coin to continue trading in the $2.70-3.10 mark for the next few days. Key levels to watch are $2.65 and $3.15 with each level suggesting a breakout from the trend. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market capitalization, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR’s innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant medium term growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions.

Now the price has returned to the $2.70 mark but struggles in climbing higher. Will NEAR recover? NEAR protocol price has seen a massive selloff in the last thirty days as price fell from near the $3.00 mark to the current $2 price level.

NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next several years. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable price prediction. However, the project must keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem.

The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13.

By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60.

Naver Financial is set to acquire Dunamu, the entity operating Upbit, one of South Korea’s most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. The acquisition will be completed via a share-swap deal and will make Dunamu a wholly-owned subsidiary of Naver Financial.

Security CoinStats has integrated the Glider Token Risk, a breakthrough scanning technology from cybersecurity firm Hexens. The new integration brings advanced token analysis tools to traders worldwide. It also gives them instant access to over 22 smart contract risks before they buy. Regulation The United States Senate has scheduled a high-profile hearing on October 1 to examine the taxation of crypto assets. The hearing will involve several industry experts, including representatives from Coinbase and Coin Center. Canada’s FINTRAC has imposed a C$19.6 million ($14.09 million) penalty on Peken Global Limited, the entity operating KuCoin. FINTRAC states the platform failed to comply with Canadian anti-money laundering policies. However, KuCoin has appealed the decision in court. Senator Elizabeth Warren , along with several Democrats and ethics lawyers, has called for an investigation into potential ethics violations related to deals with the United Arab Emirates. The Trump administration has recently relaxed restrictions on the sale of sensitive national security technology to the United Arab Emirates. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) plans to allow tokenized assets, including stablecoins, to be used as collateral in derivatives markets.

Investor sentiment has been battered, causing the market’s Fear & Greed Index to drop by 16 points in a single day. The index fell to 28 on Friday, its lowest level since March, before recovering to 33. Bitcoin started the week above $115,000, but price crashes on Monday and Thursday pushed the price below the key $109,000 level. This triggered liquidations of over $1 billion in long positions. The crash in the Fear & Greed Index highlights how quickly market sentiment can change when important levels fail to hold. However, fearful conditions are also an opportunity for long-term traders to add to their holdings at a discount. Analysts believe Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could be closer to their next recovery phase than many expect, with some traders already bracing for a turnaround. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down during the ongoing session, maintaining its position above $109,000. The flagship cryptocurrency faced extended bearish pressure this week, crashing nearly 4% on Thursday to fall below $110,000 and settle at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61%, but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline. BTC is trading around $109,500 during the ongoing session. Meanwhile, traders are divided about BTC’s next move, with some predicting a crash to $60,000, while others believe it will rally to $140,000. Multiple analyses state that the price could repeat the same trajectory that foreshadowed the 2021 market top. One analyst highlighted that in 2021, BTC registered a sharp rally to record highs, followed by a blow-off top, a sharp correction, and lastly, a failed test of resistance levels. The sequence triggered a crash that sent the price from $69,000 to $32,000 in weeks. The analyst points out that BTC’s current structure is mirroring the same process and risks a similar trajectory. However, not everyone expects market-ending declines. One trader highlighted a cluster by the 200-day simple and exponential moving averages, which could serve as a support during bull market dips. Analyst Bitbull believes BTC is still far from a cycle top, highlighting that the US Business Cycle, a broad indicator of economic momentum, has yet to peak. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $114,724. It recovered from this level to settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30%. BTC reached an intraday high of $117,998 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,117. The price lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.22% to $115,690. Source: TradingView BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping 0.41% on Sunday to end the weekend at $115,282. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $111,761 on Monday as bearish sentiment intensified. It recovered from this level to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday as BTC reached an intraday high of $113,357. However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $112,017, ultimately dropping 0.64%. The price fell to an intraday low of $111,066 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. Despite the bearish sentiment, it recovered to register a 1.19% increase and settle at $113,348. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $110,369 before settling at $109,697. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline.

In the following lines, we break down the chilling details of the crime and examine whether this story had anything resembling a happy ending. The Bone-Chilling Thriller Grant – a small town in the state of Minnesota – recently became the scene of a brutal crypto-related crime. On September 19, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch Center received a 911 call from a man reporting that he and his family had been held at gunpoint during a violent home invasion by two armed suspects. The individuals in question were the brothers Raymond Christian Garcia and Isiah Angelo Garcia. Earlier that day, the father of the man who called 911 was taking out a garbage can to the street when the alleged criminals suddenly attacked him with an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun. The brothers took the victim into the garage, where they bound his hands and brought him into the house. They later woke up his wife and adult son at gunpoint and also zipped their hands, forcing them to lie on the floor. Raymond Garcia supposedly held the wife and son in their residence for nine hours, while his brother forced the father (Victim 1) to log into his cryptocurrency accounts. He demanded that the victim transfer huge amounts of digital assets into a designated wallet provided by the attackers. “During the robbery, Victim 1 saw both Garcia brothers frequently making phone calls to an unknown third party, who appeared to be providing the information related to the cryptocurrency accounts and transfers,” the official announcement reads. Through this third party, the brother became aware that the father had additional crypto funds and demanded access to them. The victim explained that the assets were stored on a hard drive at a family cabin, approximately three hours away. Isiah Garcia forced the man into his truck and drove to the location where the remaining funds were transferred. In total, the victim sent $8 million worth of digital assets to the attackers’ wallets. The son of Victim 1, who was held at gunpoint while Isiah Garcia was gone, used a brief opportunity to call 911. The police officers were quick to react, and when they arrived, they found Raymond Garcia running out through the back door. For his part, Isiah Garcia (who was returning to the house with the truck) saw the chaos, ditched the vehicle and his weapon, and walked towards a nearby middle school parking lot. To protect the safety of the pupils, Mahtomedi Public Schools was forced to cancel its homecoming football game. In the next few days, the law enforcement officers checked video surveillance cameras and tracked the brothers’ previous locations, and managed to arrest them on September 22 in Texas. What Now? The incident was described by Acting US Attorney Joseph H. Thompson as “a blow to the sense of safety in everyone in Minnesota.” “This is not normal. Minnesotans should not accept wild violence and thievery as normal. Every Minnesotan deserves to live in peace and a life unaffected by rampant crime,” he added. On September 23, the Garcia brothers were charged by complaint in Washington County, Minnesota, with three counts of kidnapping with a firearm, one count of first-degree aggravated robbery, and three counts of first-degree burglary. The following day, they were both charged in a federal complaint with kidnapping. The attackers were scheduled to make their initial appearances in federal court on September 25, at which time the government will request their detention pending trial. “As alleged in the complaint, the Garcia brothers terrorized a Minnesota family in their own home, kidnapping one family member while holding the rest of the family hostage in order to conduct a brazen cryptocurrency theft. This office, together with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners in Minnesota and in Texas, will work tirelessly to hold accountable those responsible for this horrific crime,” FBI Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston, Sr assured.

52401881,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=822253,1759094639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52401881.jpeg,Poland’s crypto law met with criticism and backlash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/poland-adopts-controversial-crypto-law/,"Lawmakers in Poland have approved a bill designed to regulate the country’s cryptocurrency market in accordance with the latest EU rules. Critics say, however, that the legislation goes beyond European requirements, stirring controversy, not just in the crypto community, but in Polish politics as well. Crypto act passed amid concerns over excessive regulation The Sejm, the lower house of Polish parliament, has adopted a new law implementing the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations in the EU member state. The legislation, which has been in the making for quite some time, aims to impose order in Poland’s crypto space, arguably the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. It has been criticized, however, for attempting to overregulate the nation’s crypto industry, stifling innovation and threatening to kill the business of domestic firms that work with digital assets. On Friday, 230 members of the chamber voted in favor of the bill, another 196 rejected it, with no abstentions. The Crypto Assets Act will now go to the Senate, the upper house of parliament in Poland. The government-sponsored law should ensure protection for customers and other market participants from what has been described as “dishonest entities,” the Polish PAP news agency reported. It introduces criminal liability for certain violations such as provision of crypto services and issuance of digital tokens without authorization, and defines the obligations of approved platforms. Its provisions stipulate that Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) will be tasked to supervise the sector and equipped with the appropriate tools to conduct oversight. The KNF will be responsible for registering violations of the new rules and fraudulent activities involving operations with cryptocurrencies. Perpetrators of the most serious offences will face harsh penalties, including fines of up to 10 million Polish złoty ($120,000) and even imprisonment for up to two years. The bill regulates online cryptocurrency exchanges, which will again be supervised by the KNF. They will be required to maintain individual client accounts, which should protect user funds, PAP detailed. According to official data, released earlier this year, 18% of Poles have already invested in crypto assets, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. In July, Deputy Finance Minister of Poland Jurand Drop insisted the proposed regulations are crucial for strengthening investor protection. He also noted the lack of mechanisms to fight fraud, pointing out: “20% of investors in this market declare they have been victims of some kind of fraud or abuse.” Poland’s crypto law met with criticism and backlash The long-awaited legislation was not accepted well by members of the country’s crypto community and the parliamentary opposition, who criticized it throughout its review in the Sejm. While transposing MiCA into national law “sounds innocent,” the crypto act is a “real horror” for crypto entrepreneurs, the crypto news outlet Bitcoin.pl wrote in an article on Saturday. Highlighting some of the powers granted to Poland’s financial regulator, which stirred the industry on the weekend, the Polish portal commented: “The crypto assets law gives the KNF permissions that resemble a repression apparatus rather than market supervision.” They come with “fees, which can simply finish smaller companies” and the “clear guidelines” are just restrictions and costly requirements that will suffocate innovation, the website elaborated, adding: “This law can deal a fatal blow to domestic companies operating in the crypto sector.” The exodus of Polish cryptocurrency firms may have already started, with XTB, one of the largest brokers in Poland, signaling it may seek a license in Cyprus. Jakub Bartoszek, president of the crypto exchange service Cashify, emphasized that the Polish implementation of MiCA is one of the most extensive, imposing high entry costs and multiplies barriers. The crypto entrepreneur expressed hope that Polish President Karol Nawrocki “will listen to the voice of the market and veto the law in its current form,” something the head of state has indicated he may do. During debates in the Sejm, Bitcoin proponent and former presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen also urged Nawrocki, who took office in August, to stop the bill.

Co przyniesie ostatni kwartał 2025 roku?",https://bitcoinist.com/nowa-fala-adopcji-krypto-4-kwartal-2025/,"Rynek kryptowalut wchodzi w ostatni kwartał 2025 roku z dużą dynamiką. Decyzje amerykańskich regulatorów, rosnące zainteresowanie funduszy ETF oraz nowe projekty technologiczne sprawiają, że inwestorzy zastanawiają się, jak ulokować swoje środki. Nie chodzi już tylko o Bitcoina czy Ethereum. Dziś na radarze pojawiają się zarówno dojrzałe aktywa, jak XRP, jak i świeże inicjatywy w rodzaju Snorter Token. Nadchodzi nowa fala adopcji kryptowalut. XRP kandydatem do trzeciego miejsca na podium ETF-ów Ostatnie tygodnie przyniosły istotne informacje dla rynku. SEC analizuje sześć wniosków o uruchomienie spot ETF-ów powiązanych z XRP. Wśród aplikujących są takie podmioty jak Grayscale, 21Shares czy WisdomTree. Decyzje mają zapaść między 18 a 25 października . XRP SPOT ETF TRACKER OCTOBER WILL BE HISTORIC: Grayscale — OCT 18 21Shares — OCT 19 Bitwise — OCT 20 Canary Capital — OCT 23 WisdomTree — OCT 24 Franklin Templeton — OCT 25 CoinShares — OCT 25 $XRP Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/PrNW0GevU4 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 26, 2025 Analitycy wskazują, że ewentualna zgoda oznaczałaby otwarcie drzwi dla ogromnego kapitału instytucjonalnego. Cytując jednego z ekspertów: Zatwierdzenie ETF-ów na XRP może uruchomić rotację płynności z Bitcoina i skierować uwagę funduszy na trzecią co do wielkości kryptowalutę pod względem adopcji regulacyjnej . Warto zauważyć, że Bitcoin już korzysta z efektu ETF-ów, a Ethereum powoli podąża jego śladem. Jeśli XRP dołączy do tego grona, układ sił na rynku może się zmienić. Derywatywy budują fundamenty pod dalszy wzrost Nie tylko ETF-y napędzają oczekiwania wobec XRP. Coraz większą rolę odgrywa rynek instrumentów pochodnych. Dane CME pokazują, że otwarte pozycje na kontraktach futures na XRP przekroczyły 1 miliard dolarów, co jest najszybszym wzrostem wśród wszystkich kryptowalut w tym kwartale. CME ogłosiło także, że od 13 października uruchomi opcje na XRP oraz kontrakty Micro XRP. Dzięki temu inwestorzy instytucjonalni otrzymają regulowane narzędzia do ekspozycji na XRP – komentują analitycy. Równolegle Ripple stara się o licencję bankową w USA, która w przypadku powodzenia zapewni jej bezpośredni dostęp do systemu bankowego. To ruch, który zwiększyłby wiarygodność projektu w oczach największych inwestorów. XRP w kluczowym punkcie Z technicznego punktu widzenia XRP znajduje się w formacji trójkąta zniżkującego. Dolne wsparcie w rejonie 2,70 USD pozostaje nieprzełamane, ale każdy test tego poziomu budzi nerwowość. Średnia krocząca 50-dniowa na poziomie 2,96 USD zatrzymuje kolejne próby wybicia w górę. Świece z długimi cieniami pokazują walkę podaży z popytem, a RSI w okolicach 40 sugeruje brak wyraźnego momentum. Scenariusze są jasne: byki mogą przejąć inicjatywę dopiero po zamknięciu dnia powyżej 3,00 USD, niedźwiedzie liczą na spadek w okolice 2,59 USD. Rynek czeka więc na katalizator, a takim może być październikowa decyzja SEC. Snorter Token – nowe narzędzie na Solanie Podczas gdy XRP walczy o regulacyjną legitymizację, na drugim końcu spektrum pojawiają się projekty świeże i innowacyjne. Jednym z nich jest Snorter Token . Jest on botem tradingowym działającym w ekosystemie Solany. Jego presale zebrał już ponad 4 miliony dolarów, a do zakończenia sprzedaży pozostało jedynie 25 dni. Aktualna cena wynosi 0,1063 USD. W świecie, gdzie inwestorzy nieustannie poszukują kryptowalut z potencjałem x1000 , Snorter wzbudza zainteresowanie dzięki połączeniu technologii i marketingu. Dlaczego Solana? Szybkość i niskie koszty Snorter został oparty na Solanie, ponieważ sieć ta zapewnia błyskawiczne transakcje i minimalne prowizje. To kluczowa przewaga nad botami działającymi na Ethereum, które często zmagają się z wysokimi opłatami i przeciążeniami sieci. Główna funkcja Snortera to wykrywanie nowych tokenów jeszcze zanim staną się popularne. Bot monitoruje mempoole zarówno Solany, jak i Ethereum, wychwytując świeże projekty i pierwsze oznaki płynności. Dzięki temu użytkownicy mogą wchodzić w rynek szybciej niż reszta inwestorów. Bezpieczeństwo przede wszystkim Twórcy Snortera podkreślają, że nie chodzi o ślepe polowanie na każdy nowy token. Wbudowane filtry kontraktów i mechanizmy anty-rug mają minimalizować ryzyko związane z oszustwami czy tzw. rug pullami. Warto przypomnieć, że wielu inwestorów, którzy w 2021 roku kupowali Dogecoina czy Shiba Inu na szczytach, do dziś pozostaje na stratach. Snorter ma działać odwrotnie. Ma na celu umożliwiać wejście w projekt na wczesnym etapie i wyjście z zyskiem, gdy szerszy rynek dopiero się dowiaduje o jego istnieniu. Token SNORT – serce ekosystemu Posiadanie tokena SNORT odblokowuje pełnię możliwości bota. Najważniejsze korzyści to: obniżona prowizja za handel do 0,85% (konkurencja często pobiera 1,5–2%), unlimited snipes – możliwość uczestnictwa w dowolnej liczbie projektów, dostęp do zaawansowanych analiz, udział w głosowaniach nad rozwojem projektu, staking z dynamicznym APY sięgającym 115%. Każdy z tych elementów zwiększa popyt na token i jednocześnie ogranicza jego podaż w obiegu. Śpiesz się, presale jest na finiszu Presale Snortera kończy się za 21 dni. Po tym terminie token trafi na giełdy, gdzie jego cena prawdopodobnie wzrośnie wraz z popytem. Inwestorzy mają ograniczone okno czasowe, aby wejść na preferencyjnych warunkach. Zakupu można dokonać za pomocą SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, a także kartą kredytową. Rekomendowanym rozwiązaniem jest portfel Best Wallet. W praktyce odpowiedź na pytanie jak kupić Snorter Token sprowadza się więc do kilku kliknięć. Kryptowaluty łączą technologię i kulturę Przypadek Snortera pokazuje szerszy trend. Kryptowaluty coraz częściej łączą dwa światy, czyli zaawansowaną technologię i społecznościowy marketing. To połączenie może sprawić, że projekt zyska finalny sukces poprzez kompleksowe podjeście. W tym sensie Snorter staje się ciekawym uzupełnieniem dynamicznej sceny kryptowalut, w której z jednej strony instytucje czekają na decyzje SEC w sprawie XRP, a z drugiej inwestorzy indywidualni polują na kolejne okazje.",Altcoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BTC|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-28 21:24:40

The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $6.61 in 2031. Worldcoin (WLD) is garnering significant attention from both investors and enthusiasts, a trend that aligns with broader market predictions. In early May, WLD experienced a notable surge, quickly positioning itself among the top-performing altcoins. This rise coincided with a spike in activity surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly those related to OpenAI. The increased interest in Worldcoin is likely fueled by speculation surrounding potential collaborations and future projects that could integrate AI technology into the cryptocurrency space, further driving its market momentum. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $1.32 Market Cap $2.54B Trading Volume (24-hour) $940M Circulating Supply 2B WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.5817, June 2, 2025 24-hour High $1.35 24-hour Low $1.3 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.956 (-25.2%) Price Volatility 6.4% 50-Day SMA $1.011686 14-Day RSI 57.62 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Worldcoin price analysis: WLD faces a sharp decline as price tests critical levels Support at risk WLD holds at $1.25, but a breakdown could fuel further losses. Resistance holds sellers at $1.31, limiting recovery attempts. Bearish structure with lower highs and lows confirms bearish market control. On September 28, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) trades at $1.25, marking a 3.50% decline in the last 24 hours. The token shows a clear downtrend as it tests key support at $1.25, with immediate resistance placed at $1.31. Over the course of the day, WLD struggled to hold gains after brief upward momentum, reflecting ongoing selling pressure. The current price also stands significantly lower than its all-time high of $11.82, recorded on March 10, 2024, representing a steep 89.44% drop in value over time. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD bearish momentum holds ground On the daily timeframe, WLD displays a consistent pattern of lower highs and lower lows, signaling sustained bearish pressure. Price action shows that every recovery attempt above $1.30 quickly meets resistance, with sellers tightening control around this area. The $1.31 resistance level is proving to be a critical ceiling, repeatedly rejecting bullish attempts to break higher. The inability to establish strength above this zone highlights weakened buying interest and declining momentum. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Meanwhile, the $1.25 level is emerging as a crucial support zone that could dictate the next directional move. If bears manage to push below this threshold, WLD risks opening the path toward deeper retracement levels, which could attract further selling pressure. Conversely, a successful defense of $1.25 could provide temporary relief, though upside potential remains capped unless volume builds strongly toward $1.31. This tug-of-war between support and resistance defines the current structure of the daily chart. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD pressure builds at support On the 4-hour timeframe, WLD reflects sharp selling activity after failing to consolidate gains above $1.29. The repeated rejections below resistance show that bulls lack the strength to drive a sustained recovery. Sellers are firmly defending the $1.29–$1.31 zone, forcing price action downward in successive waves. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Currently, the price continues to press against the $1.25 support level, raising concerns about a potential breakdown if momentum fails to reverse. If this floor is lost, the bearish move could accelerate quickly, as traders may trigger stop losses near this level. To regain strength, WLD would need to climb back above $1.29 and retest $1.31 with higher volume, but until that happens, pressure remains skewed to the downside. Worldcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9607 BUY SMA 5 $0.942531 BUY SMA 10 $0.928258 BUY SMA 21 $0.942555 BUY SMA 50 $1.011686 BUY SMA 100 $1.012216 BUY SMA 20 $1.006532 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.902075 BUY EMA 5 $0.907784 BUY EMA 10 $0.923362 BUY EMA 21 $0.951525 BUY EMA 50 $0.989329 BUY EMA 100 $1.025326 BUY EMA 200 $1.187683 BUY ​​​​What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? Worldcoin’s immediate outlook depends heavily on how the $1.25 support reacts to ongoing selling pressure. A breakdown below this level could accelerate the downtrend, opening the way for deeper losses as bearish sentiment strengthens. If buyers manage to defend $1.25, the token may attempt a short-lived rebound. However, any recovery is likely to face resistance around $1.29–$1.31, where sellers have consistently regained control. Until WLD breaks above this ceiling, the broader market bias remains bearish. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin’s sharp decline from its all-time high of $11.82 to $1.25 highlights the risks tied to its volatile performance. The token has lost more than 89% of its value since March 2024, underscoring weak long-term momentum despite short-term trading opportunities. At present, the price action reflects heavy bearish control, with support at $1.25 under constant pressure and resistance capped at $1.31. Market participants view these levels as decisive for WLD’s next direction, but without a break above resistance, upside potential remains limited. Investors tracking Worldcoin are weighing its underlying utility and adoption against its prolonged decline. For now, sentiment leans cautious, as the asset struggles to attract sustained buying interest while trading at multi-month lows. Why is the WLD Price Down today The drop in WLD to $1.25 comes as bearish sentiment dominates the market, with sellers overpowering buyers at every recovery attempt. Repeated failures to break above $1.31 have reinforced downward pressure, leaving traders cautious about taking long positions. Market activity shows that momentum has shifted firmly in favor of sellers, with liquidity thinning around key support levels. Broader weakness across altcoins has also weighed on WLD, amplifying its decline and keeping the token locked in a tight range between $1.25 and $1.31. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2031. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

Optimists argue upgrades will eventually lift the project, but patience is wearing thin. In contrast, exciting new names like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are picking up traction quickly, with investors betting that speed, utility and community energy can deliver far stronger returns than the slow-moving ADA ecosystem. ADA price pressure mounts Cardano (ADA) has long been praised for its academic and research-first approach, but that steady pace hasn’t always rewarded short-term traders. At the moment, the ADA price sits close to the $0.50 mark, which many view as a key psychological level. A break below could trigger fresh selling pressure, with some analysts warning of a slide into the mid-40 cent range if momentum doesn’t return. Although ADA still benefits from a loyal community and a strong development team, the crypto market has become increasingly competitive. Faster, cheaper and more flexible tokens are drawing in capital that might otherwise have flowed into Cardano. For holders, this raises a difficult question: Wait for ADA’s slow-but-steady progress, or rotate into newer projects. Layer Brett’s presale surge In sharp contrast to Cardano’s cautious progress, Layer Brett (LBRETT) has come out of the gate swinging. The token sits at just $0.0058 in presale and has already pulled in more than $4 million, showing how quickly demand is building. Early buyers are also being rewarded with staking returns that remain above 620% APY at the time of writing, although yields will fall as more wallets join the pool, giving first movers the strongest upside. Crucially, Layer Brett is not relying on hype alone. As an Ethereum Layer 2 project, it brings faster transactions and lower costs, while the roadmap outlines NFT rollouts, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging. Buying is kept deliberately easy: Connect a wallet, use ETH or USDT, and tokens are secured in minutes. For presale investors, this combination of meme-style virality and serious technical underpinnings has made LBRETT one of the most talked-about launches of the year. Social traction and upcoming giveaway Momentum around Layer Brett isn’t only about presale numbers. Its community presence is growing fast across multiple platforms. Telegram and X groups are closing in on 10k members each, TikTok has already passed 25k followers, and YouTube reviewers are adding to the buzz with growing view counts. This visibility is helping LBRETT reach investors who might never have considered getting in early on a meme-driven project. Adding fuel to the fire, the team has hinted at a $1 million giveaway designed to reward early adopters and keep engagement high. Community-driven marketing of this kind is proving powerful and it’s a sharp contrast to Cardano’s slower, development-focused communication style. ADA vs. LBRETT: where’s the upside? For cautious investors, ADA remains a respectable hold with long-term potential if its upgrades gain traction. It has history, credibility and a strong base of supporters. But for those looking for bigger multiples in the near term, Layer Brett is making the stronger case. With its presale still under one cent, staking returns above 600 percent, viral community growth and a utility-rich roadmap, LBRETT is being tipped to move from fractions of a penny to $1 and beyond. That’s the kind of breakout Cardano holders haven’t enjoyed in years. While ADA price movements are tied to slow ecosystem progress, Layer Brett is proving that speed, hype and utility together can create an outsized opportunity. Secure your LBRETT tokens today — the presale is live, and early entry won’t last forever.

Priced at $0.035, Mutuum Finance is storming the market. The project remains in presale phase 6 that is more than 50% sold out. Having already raised well over $16.5 million in presale, with more than 16,620 holders, MUTM has been hailed by analysts as the “next SHIB” on account of its growth potential. And unlike SHIB, whose growth comes from community hype, MUTM comes with actual utility from its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that combines peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract models. With great staking rewards, good security audits, and a clearly defined roadmap, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling chance for investors to reap great rewards and a real DeFi-supported alternative to traditional meme coins. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: October Momentum Builds Amid Burn Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) is displaying hints of a potential bullish reversal heading into October, fueled by underlying on-chain events that can sustain a continued price resurgence. The token’s burn rate doubled 400% in 24 hours, removing over 1.15 million SHIB from circulation, an action that capped supply and added still more pressure to the price. Concurrently, token outflows from exchanges surged from $378,000 to 2.29 million tokens, a reflection of decreasing selling pressure as investors transferred assets from trading platforms, according to Coinglass. All these combined suggest SHIB can look forward to renewed traction in the coming weeks, and for those who are hoping for higher upside potential and with improved fundamentals, eyes are increasingly shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Momentum Accelerates Mutuum Finance recently launched the highly anticipated Stage Six presale. MUTM tokens now selling at $0.035, a 16.17% price appreciation over the previous round. Investor demand remains extremely robust, with more than 16,620 investors contributing more than $16.5 million of committed capital to date. To further enhance the security of the platform, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program where they welcome white-hat researchers and developers to identify bugs. They will be categorized into four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low, for thorough detection and speedy patching of possible vulnerabilities. Mutuum protocol is constructed around sound collateral management in a bid to protect the ecosystem and users. Some of the most noteworthy protective measures include perpetual collateral ratios, limits on loans, and deposit limits. Undercollateralized positions are quickly liquidated, while penalties and remediation fees stabilize the platform and minimize systemic risk. Efficiency is the central concept at Mutuum Finance. Through optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, and particularly overcollateralized positions, the protocol achieves maximum capital utilization with strong protection. Reserve requirements act as a market shock absorber, and surplus reserves can be invested profitably in riskier assets to offset volatility. Mutuum Finance’s vision is to redefine DeFi along three pillars: long-term sustainability, reliability, and access. Through the provision of a secure and scalable lending and borrowing platform, the platform is democratizing decentralized finance for retail as well as institutional customers. As a gesture of gratitude for the initial community engagement, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will be rewarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The action is one way of showing that Mutuum cares about rewarding the initial adopters of the project while promoting awareness for the cause. While Shiba Inu could stage a comeback in October, Mutuum Finance is a superior purchase. With over $16.5 million raised, 16,620+ investors, and tokens valued at $0.035 in Stage 6 presale, MUTM is blending true DeFi utility with strong security, staking benefits, and total lending solutions. Its pioneering platform and growing community place it above the rest as a meme coin alternative. Join the Mutuum Finance presale today to be on the ground floor before the next phase of growth.

This retest has been most visible in futures open interest, where billions of dollars in positions have been wiped out across major exchanges. This rapid unwinding comes as a correction move to weeks of excessive leverage during uptrends that had pushed derivatives activity to unsustainable levels. Related Reading: When Will XRP Reach $25? Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction Massive Open Interest Wipeout Across Major Exchanges The most recent Ethereum price correction was a broader market reset rather than a mere dip, with leveraged traders facing the brunt of the losses. Data shows that Ethereum’s open interest experienced a steep downfall over the just concluded week across multiple crypto exchanges. According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, billions worth of Ethereum positions were wiped out last week, with Binance leading the downturn with the steepest monthly average drop. Ethereum’s slide under the $4,000 mark proved to be the breaking point for over-leveraged traders. The move unleashed a wave of liquidations across derivatives markets, compounding selling pressure. Data shows that more than $3 billion was erased on September 23 through Binance alone, followed by over $1 billion just a day later. Bybit also shed $1.2 billion in positions, while OKX recorded a $580 million decline. The sharp reduction is visible in aggregate open interest, which has slumped to its lowest level since early 2024. As the chart data shows, futures leverage and open interest were closely tied to the price rally in July and August, and at the same time, it declined in lockstep with the price. Ethereum Open Interest by exchange Spot Ethereum ETF Outflows Add To Market Strain Ethereum’s break below $4,000 and the decline in open interest coincides with a week of heavy outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. According to data from Farside Investors, $795.56 million flowed out over five trading days last week, which is the largest weekly exodus since the products launched. The sell-off intensified toward the end of the week, with Thursday recording $251.2 million in outflows, followed by another $248.4 million on Friday. Waning institutinal participation contributed massively to the sell-side pressure, with investors showing caution amid uncertainty over whether regulators will allow staking features in these ETFs. This synchronized exit from both derivatives and institutional products has amplified volatility, creating a convergence of pressure across Ethereum’s trading ecosystem.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,002. Despite this attempt to regain stability, the leading altcoin is still down by about 10% in a weekly timeframe, considering it was trading around $4,490 this time last week. The bullish scenario now lies in whether ETH can reclaim and sustain a move above $4,000.

While established coins like Tron (TRX) offer stability, market analysts are issuing an urgent message: Tron can wait. The real, time-sensitive opportunity lies with Ruvi AI (RUVI), a project whose presale is moving at such a blistering pace that it’s being called one of the fastest-growing altcoins on the market. With Phase 3 hitting 20% completion in just a matter of days, the window to secure a ground-floor position is closing rapidly. This incredible speed is the latest chapter in a presale that has been nothing short of spectacular. Ruvi AI has officially soared past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens already claimed by a rapidly expanding global community of more than 3,900 holders . This level of demand is why experts are urging investors to prioritize Ruvi AI, as it shows all the signs of a project on the verge of a major price explosion. Why the Urgency? The Power of Unprecedented Growth Analysts are advising investors to shift their focus from coins like Tron because the potential for life-changing gains lies in early-stage projects with explosive momentum. Ruvi AI fits this description perfectly. Selling 20% of its Phase 3 allocation in mere days demonstrates a level of market hunger that is rare and often precedes a massive rally. This is not just speculative fervor. Ruvi AI’s value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its credibility is further solidified by a successful CyberScope audit, assuring investors of its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , which signals to the broader market that it is a serious, high-growth AI contender. This combination of speed, utility, and trust is why experts are calling it a must-have for this bull cycle. The Super App Fueling a Record-Breaking Presale The engine driving Ruvi AI’s historic demand is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining the creative workflow. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. The Clock is Ticking: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . However, this ground-floor entry point is disappearing at an astonishing rate. With 20% of the stage’s allocation sold in days, the opportunity to buy at this price is extremely limited. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns for early supporters: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s vibrant community. The Verdict The message from market analysts is clear: while Tron has its place, the once-in-a-cycle opportunity for exponential growth is happening right now with Ruvi AI. With its record-breaking presale, powerful utility, and a guaranteed price increase just around the corner, the time to secure your position is now.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. At the start of September, Tron is trending near the $0.34 range, maintaining its price above $0.31, as the current Tron sentiment is bullish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 22:45:00

Some analysts believe a bounce is possible but others think momentum is fading as attention shifts to newer Ethereum-based tokens. Chief among them is Layer Brett (LBRETT) , a presale project already drawing comparisons to the viral breakouts of past meme cycles — and being tipped by some to deliver gains of more than 4600%. Pepe coin price prediction The Pepe coin price prediction has split opinions. On one side, bulls argue that PEPE still commands strong brand recognition as one of the leading meme tokens launched in 2023. Supporters point to deep liquidity and an established holder base as signs the token can recover quickly if market sentiment turns risk-on again. On the other side, skeptics highlight that PEPE has already seen its parabolic run and now struggles to find fresh catalysts. With the token sitting near crucial support, a break lower could undermine confidence further. Analysts who take the bearish view believe the best-case scenario is sideways trading, while more optimistic traders argue a rebound is still possible if volumes pick up. Layer Brett’s breakout potential While PEPE wrestles with support, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is climbing the charts of investor interest. Starting at just $0.0058 in presale, the project has already pulled in more than $4 million, a figure that shows how quickly demand is accelerating. Staking rewards are still sitting in the hundreds of percent — currently above 600% APY — though they reduce as more holders lock in, giving early movers the best shot at outsized gains. What sets Layer Brett apart is its Ethereum Layer 2 backbone. Low fees and faster speeds are paired with real utility features: NFT launches, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging all appear on the roadmap. Buying has also been kept simple, requiring only a wallet connection and ETH or USDT to secure tokens in minutes. It’s this blend of meme coin appeal and usable infrastructure that has analysts calling LBRETT the Ethereum meme with genuine staying power. Social traction and $1M giveaway tease Momentum behind Layer Brett isn’t just about numbers on a presale page. The project is seeing fast growth across social platforms, with Telegram and X groups closing in on 10k members each and TikTok already boasting over 25k followers. YouTube reviews are adding to the buzz, helping the token reach a wider audience. Adding to that excitement, the team has lined up a $1 million giveaway that has the community watching closely for details. It’s the kind of marketing push that keeps engagement levels high and helps LBRETT stand out against projects like PEPE, which are struggling to generate fresh momentum. PEPE vs. LBRETT — where traders see bigger upside For long-time holders, PEPE still has a role as one of the more established meme tokens, and any sharp market rally could lift its price off current support. But the ceiling may be limited compared to newer plays. With no major new catalysts, the risk is that PEPE trades sideways while attention drifts elsewhere. That’s where Layer Brett is capturing momentum. With a presale still under one cent, staking rewards in the hundreds of percent, viral growth across social media and a utility-driven roadmap, analysts suggest it could be on track for a move from $0.0058 to $1 — a return measured in multiples, not percentages. For traders seeking outsized opportunity, LBRETT is increasingly seen as the Ethereum meme play to watch in 2025. Early buyers are locking in LBRETT at presale — don’t miss your chance to do the same.

In an official Marumasa Hotta release , the firm said the name change will be officially instated at a meeting of shareholders on November 11. Marusho Hotta also announced that the company would change its English name to “Bitcoin Japan Corporation” as it begins stockpiling Bitcoin (BTC) .

It also operates a range of contemporary and hybrid fashion brands. But after years of falling sales and stagnation on the Tokyo Exchange, it was taken over by the Tokyo-based RIZAP Group in 2017. Bakkt made its move in June, claiming it hopes to become Marusho Hotta’s largest shareholder and transform the firm into “a leading Japanese Bitcoin treasury company.” In its September 26 release, Marusho Hotta wrote: “We have decided to launch a new business, the Bitcoin treasury business, so we can expand our business scope and expand into new fields in the future. We are also considering the launch of finance-related business operations.” These operations, it appears, will be primarily related to Marusho Hotta’s Bitcoin treasury operations.

(Image: Google Finance) New Management Confirmed The firm has also confirmed that Bakkt International President Phillip Lord will become Bitcoin Japan’s new CEO. Akshay Naheta, the co-chief executive officer of Bakkt Holdings, will assume the new role of Chairman of the Board of Directors. The company added that its new management structure would “further align the interests of directors and shareholders.” This, the firm said, will help the company “achieve a medium- to long-term improvement in corporate value.” More Textiles Firms Turn to BTC? Marusho Hotta was founded in 1861 and opened one of Japan’s first kimono wholesale stores in 1894. It floated on the Tokyo Exchange in 1974. Earlier this year, Kitabo, a TYO-listed synthetic yarns producer, announced its own plans to buy Bitcoin and “enter the cryptoasset and Real-World Asset (RWA) sectors.” Kitabo said it plans to buy around $5.4 million worth of Bitcoin in an initial foray into the market. The firm, like many others in the world of Japanese textiles and traditional clothing, has seen revenues plummet in recent years. In 2021, the EU-Japan Center for Industrial Cooperation noted that “old, traditional [Japanese] retailers have seen sales diminish as they become less and less viable.” The likes of Kitabo and Marusho Hotta have certainly felt the pinch. After racking up years of annual net losses, Kitbo posted a net loss of $785,000 for FY2024. Marusho Hotta, meanwhile, posted a net income of minus 407.32 million yen (-$2,724,439) for the same period.

The firms are also likely to launch BTC lending services as part of their radical rebranding efforts. This year has seen scores of Japanese firms from all sorts of business sectors enter the Bitcoin treasury sector. Metaplanet has led the charge, snapping up enough Bitcoin to move into the global top five BTC treasury firms . Other firms, like the loyalty points provider Remixpoint, game-makers like Gumi, and the fashion retailer ANAP , have also thrown their hats into the Bitcoin ring in recent months.

The buys came through names like Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, FalconX and OKX.

Exchange Balances Fall To 9-Year Low According to Glassnode data, the amount of ETH held on exchanges has plunged from roughly 31 million to about 14.8 million ETH — a drop of 52% from 2016 levels. Many of those coins are likely in staking contracts, cold wallets or institutional custody, and the recent launch of the first Ethereum staking ETF has helped pull more supply off exchanges. Lower exchange balances mean fewer coins ready to be sold instantly on exchanges, which can make price moves sharper when big orders hit the market. ETH Hovers Near $4,000 As Volatility Rises Based on TradingView readings, ETH is trading around $4,011, down roughly 0.33% over the last 24 hours and more than 10% over the past week. The token briefly slipped under $3,980 earlier in the session before climbing back, and it remains below a recent close of $4,034. This two-week pullback has returned ETH to a key $4,000 support area, and short-term swings have become more pronounced as holders reposition. $3,700 Becomes A Line In Sand Crypto analyst Ted Pillows has warned that the $3,700 to $3,800 zone could face heavy pressure. Reports note that if ETH falls below $3,700, many margin positions could be wiped out and spark forced selling that pushes prices lower. $ETH liquidity heatmap is showing decent long liquidations around the $3,700-$3,800 level. This level could be revisited again before Ethereum shows any recovery. pic.twitter.com/SQTbfrujAa — Ted (@TedPillows) September 27, 2025 With fewer coins on exchanges and concentrated margin exposure, the short-term outlook is more fragile even as longer-term demand indicators look solid. ETF Outflows Show Institutional Mood Can Flip US-listed ETH funds recorded nearly $800 million in outflows this week, their largest redemptions to date. Still, roughly $26 billion sits in Ethereum ETFs, equal to 5.37% of total supply. Whales keep accumulating $ETH! 16 wallets have received 431,018 $ETH($1.73B) from #Kraken, #GalaxyDigital, #BitGo, #FalconX and #OKX in the past 3 days.https://t.co/0DPxgZMGN7 https://t.co/xtPLBKo9LZ pic.twitter.com/oEXZKIErmr — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 27, 2025 Related Reading: When Will XRP Reach $25? Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction Those numbers underline how quickly institutional sentiment can change: big inflows can vanish just as fast, and ETF flows now add a new, sizable layer to price dynamics. Lookonchain data also highlighted a prior accumulation of roughly $204 million in ETH, showing similar patterns of large players stepping up during dips. Retail traders appear more cautious for now. But the sequence of big buys from institutional-grade custodians suggests some buyers view dips as buying chances while others choose to wait on the sidelines.

In the meantime, the project’s native token continues to be deep in the red on multiple scales and is close to charting another all-time low. Hackathon Halfway There CryptoPotato reported in August that the Pi Network Core Team had come up with a new way to engage with its Pioneers in the form of a hackathon. The 2025 event began on August 21 and its final submission is scheduled for October 15, with an optional midpoint check-in on September 19. The halfway video shows some of the applications that users have developed. The first is called Starmax, which allows users to buy goods with Pi in a simple way. Another one, dubbed Nature’s Pulse, connects consumers with farmers as it allows the former to purchase “fresh, affordable produce with Pi and get them delivered directly to them.” Eternal Rush is a Pi Network-native online game. ReloadPi enables Pi holders to spend their tokens on buying thousands of products from over 300 brands, including ordering pizza or other foods and beverages. StreamPi is a newly created application that caters to Pi investors, allowing them to upload their content and pay with just one token. The team also reminded that there will be a prize pool of 160,000 Pi tokens for up to eight teams and will be distributed in the following manner: 1st Place – 75,000 Pi 2nd Place – 45,000 Pi 3rd Place – 15,000 Pi Honorable Mentions (up to 5 teams) – 5,000 Pi each Pi Price Update Despite the evident success of the hackathon and other recent updates from the team, the project’s native token can’t catch a break. The asset marked a new all-time low last week at just over $0.25, and even though it tried to recover some ground, it was quickly halted and pushed south once again. It’s deep in the red on a weekly scale (25%) and currently sits just 2.3% above the ATL from September 22. The unlocking schedule for the next month is also somewhat concerning, as October 1 and October 4 will see the release of massive quantities, up to 13.4 million coins, which could intensify the immediate selling pressure.

The Math May Shock You,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-shib-really-ever-hit-1-the-math-may-shock-you/,"The Shiba Inu price prediction is back in the spotlight after another round of social media chatter asked the same question: Can SHIB ever really hit $1? Supporters argue that continued burns and ecosystem growth could fuel massive upside, while skeptics highlight just how huge the market cap would need to be for that milestone. At the same time, new tokens like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are drawing attention for more realistic paths to big gains — some forecasts even put its upside in the thousands of percent. Shiba Inu price prediction The Shiba Inu price prediction has always divided the crypto space. On the bullish side, enthusiasts point to token burns and an expanding ecosystem, including Shibarium, as reasons why SHIB could climb much higher in the next cycle. They argue that community backing remains one of the strongest in crypto and that virality can sometimes override traditional valuation models. On the other hand, the math behind SHIB hitting $1 is daunting. At current supply levels, it would require a market cap larger than the entire crypto industry combined. That’s why many analysts believe the realistic ceiling is far lower, perhaps fractions of a cent, unless supply reductions dramatically accelerate. The Shiba Inu price prediction heading into 2025 therefore ranges from modest gains to sideways action, with a moonshot to $1 considered highly unlikely. Layer Brett’s growth story While SHIB wrestles with questions of scale, Layer Brett is being framed as a meme coin with real upside potential. Priced at just $0.0058, the presale has already raised more than $4 million, showing clear demand from investors looking for the next viral hit. At the time of writing, staking rewards sit above 600% APY , though these will reduce as more wallets join, rewarding early adopters the most. What sets Layer Brett apart from older meme coins is its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation. Transactions are faster and cheaper and the roadmap adds utility beyond memes: NFT launches, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging are all in the pipeline. To buy, just connect a wallet, use ETH or USDT and tokens are secured in minutes. For many, this balance of accessibility, hype and utility is exactly what makes LBRETT a standout in today’s market. Social momentum and the $1M giveaway tease Community energy has been a decisive factor in meme coin success and Layer Brett is already building serious traction. Telegram and X groups are closing in on 10k members each, while TikTok has surged past 25k followers. On top of that, YouTube reviews and breakdowns are helping spread the word beyond the core crypto crowd. To keep engagement high, the team has teased a $1 million giveaway as part of its roadmap. That move is designed to reward early supporters and add another layer of excitement as the presale heads into later stages. Combined with viral social buzz, it positions LBRETT as a project with momentum that SHIB has struggled to recreate since its 2021 breakout. Shiba Inu vs. Layer Brett: The case for bigger multiples By contrast, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is being tipped as the more realistic path to outsized returns. With a presale price under one cent, staking rewards as high as 600 percent and a roadmap stacked with utility, analysts argue the token has far more room to run. For early-stage buyers, it offers the kind of explosive multiples that SHIB can no longer realistically deliver. Presale demand is climbing fast — secure your LBRETT allocation before the next price rise.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $2.29. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $3.72 and an average forecast price of $3.58. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The EOS ecosystem has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 in the near future? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.401 (-1.32%) Market Cap $640.38M Trading Volume $371.3K Circulating Supply 1.59B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4027 (Nov 04, 2024) 24-hour High $0.4073 24-hour Low $0.3999 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.441984 (9.92%) Price Volatility 5.33% 50-Day SMA $0.488746 14-Day RSI 29.43 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 37 (Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.578938 EOS price analysis: Negative market sentiment pushes EOS price toward $0.401 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downward market trend toward $0.401. The altcoin lost 1.32% of its value. The EOS coin looks for support around $0.389. On September 28, the EOS price analysis revealed a bearish daily trend for the altcoin. The EOS price experienced significant losses, reaching $0.401 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the altcoin lost up to 1.32% of its value today, as sellers continue to rule the market, causing further price depreciation. The altcoin has now been losing value for a second consecutive day, targeting the next support at $0.389. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirms a decreasing trend as the price moves downward. The EOS/USD value dipped to $0.401 today. The appearance of red candlesticks on the price chart signifies a bearish trend. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.517. The indicator’s lower limit, which serves as the support, has shifted to $0.389. EOSUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 30.38 and is at the brink of entering the oversold region. The downward curve on the RSI graph signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further instability in the market can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also shows selling pressure building up at the current price level. The altcoin’s value has decreased to $0.401 as bears are trying to dominate the price action. Low levels of volatility mark a lesser chance of a reversal in market trends or further price depreciation. The Bollinger Bands have converged, hinting at low volatility. This low level of volatility signifies increased market predictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.412, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.396, indicating support. EOSUSD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 36.19, the RSI curve is pointing downwards, confirming the selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates significant pressure from the selling side of the market. We can expect further depreciation if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

The EOS price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The EOS/USD value has decreased to $0.401 in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further decrease in price levels to retest the support of $0.389. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent resistance around the $0.405 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and took the price to $0.401. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is striving to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the price trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2028 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031, which makes it a good option to buy EOS, though accurate predictions are nearly impossible in the crypto market. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $3.72 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 90th-ranked cryptocurrency. It also experienced strong bullish sentiment in November last year, when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $3.88 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. In mid-July 2025, EOS recovered to $0.625. However, at the start of September, EOS is trending near $0.47 after a price drop, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 23:55:00

One of such comments was made in an old interview which has resurfaced to catch the eye of some XRP investors on the social media platform X. Years later, those comments are being revisited as XRP continues to push for adoption in global markets and as investors are counting down to the SEC’s upcoming decision on Spot XRP ETF applications. Utility Over Hype: Revisiting Garlinghouse’s Message A recent video which was posted on the social media platform X by popular XRP commentator JackTheRippler ties back into an interview where Garlinghouse noted how trillions in capital could pour into XRP in the coming years. In that conversation, Garlinghouse explained that hype alone cannot sustain the value of any cryptocurrency, insisting instead that true growth comes from solving real-world problems and building a customer base. These comments were made in a 2017 interview on CNBC’s Squawk Alley, at a time when cryptocurrencies were mostly valued on speculation alone. In the interview, Garlinghouse pointed out that XRP wasn’t just created to trade on exchanges but was meant to serve a real purpose, which is settling liquidity between banks. At the time, he noted that more than $27 trillion was sitting idle in correspondent banking accounts worldwide to facilitate payments between themselves. RIPPLE CEO SAYS THAT #XRP SETTLES MONEY IN SECONDS! TRILLIONS IN CAPITAL COULD POUR INTO XRPL. DRIVEN BY REAL TOKEN, BUILT TO TOKENIZE THE ENTIRE REAL ESTATE SECTOR! DYOR/NFA GET REAL TOKEN HERE: https://t.co/kYx7u3Ko4Z pic.twitter.com/seidvGLqdy — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) September 27, 2025 His vision was that XRP, with its ability to settle transactions in seconds, could free up that capital and make cross-border payments much more efficient. “We use this digital asset called XRP to settle liquidity needs between banks,” he said. Even though those words were spoken years ago, they still fit into today’s conversations about XRP. Its adoption potential in the worldwide financial system continues to be the foundation of why many investors believe XRP can stand apart from other cryptocurrencies. Countdown To US SEC’s Spot XRP ETF Decision The attention surrounding XRP nowadays is shifting to the regulatory front, with many investors awaiting the outcome of pending Spot XRP ETF applications . After Bitcoin and Ethereum won approval for similar products, many see XRP as the next logical step given its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency. The US SEC has introduced new listing standards designed to speed up crypto ETF approvals, cutting the review window to 75 days or less. Grayscale’s filing is due for a decision on October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19, Bitwise on October 20, CoinShares and Canary Capital on October 23, and WisdomTree on October 24.

Central to Labour’s Youth Guarantee programme , the plan represents one of the most radical attempts in years to address Britain’s persistent rates of long-term youth unemployment . In a speech at the Labour Party conference, Reeves will argue that she is committed to nothing less than the abolition of long-term youth unemployment. Under the scheme, those aged 16-24 and out of work for at least 18 months would be given a job offer they would have to take. Those who decline could face sanctions, including a reduction in benefits. Reeves will say the policy is not just about jobs, “It is also about dignity. “We will not allow a generation of young people to languish, without hope or prospects for the future — locked out from security and the fair chance that good work brings,” she will say. The Labour government is adamant that this is not about punishing the young, but preventing them from being left behind in a shifting economy. Budget will decide funding and scope The scheme will be detailed in the Budget on November 26. Ministers will detail whether jobs will be directly funded by the government or subsidised through incentives to employers. The scheme only applies to those in the specified age group and who have been on Universal Credit for 18 months. That means some groups of people — like young adults not claiming benefits, or the recently unemployed — will not be eligible. Officials concede that it is hard to be certain that the scheme creates new jobs rather than filling those that would have been taken anyway. Critics fear the government could pay employers to create low-quality jobs with limited long-term value. For years, unions and business organisations have called on the government to put money into youth jobs. The Trades Union Congress is calling for creating a permanent £1bn-a-year guarantee scheme, akin to those implemented during the 2009 financial crisis and the Covid pandemic. The British Chambers of Commerce supported the principle of a subsidised jobs scheme but warned that many businesses were struggling with higher national insurance contributions and new employment protections. The group said last week that young people without work history would be left without opportunities unless the government helped cover the cost. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of the CBI, said the plan was crucial for the economy but urged the government to provide more detail. She said the business group wanted to know how the scheme would operate and whether it would address rising employment costs. Previous schemes shape the current plan The UK has attempted similar programs in the past. The Future Jobs Fund, introduced in 2009, provided thousands of placements but was scrapped in 2010 as it was deemed too expensive. The Kickstart Scheme was established by Rishi Sunak during the pandemic to stave off a youth jobs crisis, but closed early after fewer than anticipated employers applied. Reeves is framing this plan as narrower. By prioritising those who have been unemployed or not in education the longest, Labour hopes to break a cycle of exclusion. Now one in eight 16-to-24-year-olds is not in work, education, or training, and that number has grown by almost a third over the past four years. The government is already testing elements of the Youth Guarantee in so-called “trailblazer” areas that connect young people with apprenticeships, places at college, or support packages. Ministers also announced earlier this year that £3.8bn of funding would be available to help those with health conditions, making it more difficult for them to move into work. However, skeptics, including international investors and domestic experts, warn that despite the momentum, serious structural challenges — such as skills shortages, regional inequality, and high cost of hiring — will make progress difficult.

This update came after the EV manufacturer shared its sales data from January 2023 to June 2025. According to the data, the company had only sold about 5,300 vehicles . This indicated that the automaker is struggling in the market even after adopting strategies such as opening its 45th sales location in Japan, introducing a competitive fourth EV model, and embracing plans to release an electric ‘kei’ car by late 2026. Although its sales were disappointing and its efforts did not pay off, BYD has not yet lost hope. To boost its sales, the company now offers customers discounts. Based on the strategy, it gives out discounts of up to ¥1 million, which is equivalent to around $6,700. This can be combined with government subsidies to lower prices by as much as 50%. For instance, when one purchases the Atto 3, he or she will pay just under ¥4.2 million. Considering its advantages in the era of the recent crackdowns in the industry, Chinese individuals have reportedly found this strategy appealing. Foreign automakers encounter hardship in the Japanese auto market Tech analysts commented on the situation, acknowledging that BYD’s pricing strategy is unusual because, in recent years, Japanese automakers have hardly reduced their car prices. This has raised worries that Japan’s pricing strategy may fail despite the automaker solidifying its position as a leading EV brand in China. Tatsuo Yoshida, a Senior Auto Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence covering the Japanese auto sector, further explained the situation, stating that the strategy could make first buyers feel like they got a bad deal for paying more, resulting in reduced resale values. The challenges outlined have demonstrated the struggles of foreign automakers like BYD in the Japanese auto market. According to reports from sources, buyers are inclined to choose well-known brands such as Toyota Motor Corp. and usually prefer gas-electric hybrids instead of battery electric vehicles (EVs). This proves that Japanese car buyers are loyal to local firms, affecting major legacy brands. To illustrate this, General Motors Company had quit the Japanese auto market after experiencing poor sales. Additionally, Hyundai Motor Company is taking another shot after leaving the market in 2009. For BYD, the mixed response in the Japanese auto market stands out when compared to the rising sales in the European market. Despite the challenges surrounding its operation, the company is still committed to expanding globally and addressing the challenges encountered in its homeland, China. Yoshida calls on the urgency of making an impression in the EV market Despite its short-term challenges, the Japanese auto market has long-term benefits that offset these challenges. According to reports from reliable sources, EVs are anticipated to make up only 3.4% of new vehicles in Japan in 2025; however, growth is predicted in the years to come. In a statement, Yoshida emphasized that the main goal is to make an impression, not Japan. According to the analyst, what matters for BYD is that it may be recognized by some of the most demanding customers in the world. “What they really want is a history of doing business in Japan with the most discerning quality customers, even if it does not make complete economic sense,” he said. The company still has a long way to go before it can bite off chunks of the market share away from local Japanese companies. BYD sold 512 of all its models for June, compared to a top EV in Japan, Nissan Motor Co.’s Sakura, which sold 1,137. However, Yoshida highlighted that these sales figures are insufficient to pay employee salaries and keep showrooms operational. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Having a price tag of $0.035 MUTM is also in stage 6 of its presale. This phase is over 50% sold, and this is an indicator that the investors have less time to get before the window is closed. Mutuum Finance has true DeFi utility and innovative peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending, staking rewards, and solid security measures compared to SOL that is grappling with short-term volatility. Mutuum Finance may be the most appropriate cryptocurrency to invest at the end of September 2025. Solana Under Bearish Pressure With Key Breakdown Solana (SOL) is at a crossroad in the 4H chart because of the price movement being below the up-trending trendline and even at the key support region between the ranges of $214-210. This shift is reflecting bearish momentum, and technical analysts are looking at two important downside points to have the first target support at the $185 region and a more extreme possible retracement zone of $165 to $167 with further selling pressure. Solana is still dominating, but its present structure indicates a period of consolidation or even more radical price reduction, something that is causing investors to find other options elsewhere to potentially more dynamically generate growth opportunity Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Triumph Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing good performance in its presale. The current phase is already 50% complete and sells tokens at 0.035. The investor demand is high and this project has already collected more than 16.5 million. One of the roadmap highlights of it is the introduction of a USD-denominated stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain which will grant it assistance to long-term value, introduce liquidity, and supply users with steady returns. Sound Risk Controls and Architecture-based Security. Mutuum Finance is built on the hierarchies of risk management and the security imprinted in all the protocol layers. It deals with under-collateralization and over-collateralization events rather well with the help of such measures as cascading Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, liquidity protection, liquidation charges and reserve hedging schemes all of which keep the platform stable despite the fluctuations of market conditions. The protocol interest rate model is sound and sensitive to the level of liquidity. Lending rates are minimised to lengthen the borrower sub-market interest rates since excess liquidity is experienced. During a liquidity crunch, the rate of interest charged on borrowing is elevated in the perspective of promoting loan recovery and realization of new deposits. There are situations in which the dynamic model allows borrowing at fixed rates i.e. when one is presenting very liquid collateral and the overall balance in the market is maintained. Besides the core lending and borrowing business, Mutuum Finance is also undertaking a very aggressive growth strategy by staking rewards, token buybacks, and exchange listings, all of which are targeted at spurring a healthy ecosystem and usage in the long-run. The project has also created a $100,000 giveaway in honor of its first adopters, 10 participants will each be given $10 000 worth of MUTM tokens. The move signifies the interest of Mutuum in creating a healthy and strong community and rewarding birds of a feather as the platform takes an early lead in its speedy growth. MUTM offers actual DeFi utility, superior security, and long-term scalability. Invest in Mutuum Finance presale now and receive your share before the prices are increased.

MoonBull Presale Gains Speed While Cheems and Dogecoin Add Meme Market Heat,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-best-new-crypto-in-texas-moonbull-presale-gains-speed-while-cheems-and-dogecoin-add-meme-market-heat/,"What if the next big crypto moonshot is already blasting off and most people in Texas are still standing on the sidelines? The cryptocurrency conversation has evolved into a race to find the best new crypto in Texas, where meme culture, presale excitement, and community loyalty combine to create market momentum. Many investors chase the so-called best crypto in Texas before it takes off because being early often means being rewarded the most. It has become a meme itself among traders, who joke that timing the entry is like catching lightning in a bottle. Everyone wants to be the one bragging about calling the move before it happened. Some projects come and go in conversation, but MoonBull has quickly emerged as the one creating genuine urgency with its presale momentum. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Presale Rocket Poised for Texas Investors MoonBull is capturing serious attention as a candidate for the best crypto in Texas due to its ground-up construction. It is a meme coin launched on Ethereum to reward the community while avoiding the usual pitfalls of presales dominated by bots or whales. Transparency, fairness, and sustainability are central to its design. The project moved quickly into Stage 3 of its presale, showing just how strong the demand has been. The early numbers alone are striking. Over 400 holders have already joined, with the presale tally crossing $142,000 and a current price of just $0.00004057. That early surge hints at the kind of scarcity that makes investors rush to grab their share before stages get more expensive. The mechanics behind MoonBull give it an edge. One highlight is the staking system that unlocks at Stage 10. Holders can stake tokens directly from the dashboard and earn a fixed 95% annual yield. This feature rewards conviction while supporting stability since it encourages holders to lock in rather than sell off. Another standout is community governance that begins at Stage 12. Holders get a direct vote on project decisions such as surprise burns and future campaigns, making the token feel like a shared project instead of a closed-door launch. These features create both trust and long-term incentive for the people already on board. Referral rewards add another layer of attraction. Not only does each invite earn 15% for the referrer and 15% more for the buyer, but the top referrers each month can take home bonuses in USDC. This is not just about meme energy. It is about a system designed to grow naturally through incentives that keep people engaged. The early presale numbers tell the same story. An investor putting in $20,000 right now would receive nearly 492,975,104.76 MOBU. At the projected listing price of $0.00616, that position could expand into more than $3,036,726.65. It is the kind of upside that fuels excitement around what some are calling the best new crypto in Texas . MoonBull’s rapid climb to Stage 3 in a matter of hours suggests more than hype. It demonstrates confidence from the community and signals that later stages will fill even more quickly. That combination of momentum, scarcity, and community engagement is exactly what gives it an edge in this race. Dogecoin: The Veteran Meme King Dogecoin is often mentioned in discussions about the best cryptocurrencies in Texas, largely due to its reputation. It began as a joke but over time grew into one of the most widely recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. It benefits from brand power and a massive community that has kept it relevant even years after launch. The strengths of Dogecoin are clear. It is listed on nearly every major exchange, accepted by several merchants, and still used for tipping across social platforms. That broad adoption makes it more stable compared to many meme coins that struggle for visibility. Its deep liquidity and history give investors a sense of security when compared to smaller meme projects. However, Dogecoin no longer offers the same explosive upside that it once did. Much of its story has already been written, which means its price movements now rely more on broader market cycles and high-profile endorsements than new mechanics. Dogecoin does not have presale stages, staking programs, or governance layers to create fresh catalysts. Instead, its strength lies in its staying power and brand recognition. Cheems: The Meme Challenger Cheems is another meme coin that holds its own place in the conversation around the best crypto in Texas. It draws power from the viral appeal of the “doge family” of memes while carving out its own lane in the community space. Cheems has a loyal following and manages to capture bursts of attention whenever meme coin energy flares up across the market. What makes Cheems interesting is that it occupies a unique position between established giants and emerging tokens. It is not yet a household name, but it has enough recognition to be taken seriously in crypto circles. When meme coin rallies heat up, Cheems tends to ride the wave as traders look for alternatives with higher growth potential. That said, Cheems does not currently offer the kind of built-in incentives that other projects in the space have introduced. It does not have staking at high yields or community governance structures. Its growth depends heavily on community sentiment and social media traction. This makes it less predictable, but also means its upside could be significant if it catches viral momentum at the right moment. Final Thoughts Based on research and market trends, the race for the best new crypto in Texas comes down to three very different options. MoonBull brings energy, features, and presale speed that could reward early believers in ways other meme coins rarely achieve. For investors chasing real upside, MoonBull appears to offer the most powerful combination of mechanics and momentum. MoonBull presale is live, stages are moving quickly, and early numbers show both confidence and demand. Anyone looking to enter the world of crypto in Texas might see this as the right time to act, before prices rise further.

Markets and economists had widely anticipated the action. The decision follows three rate cuts earlier this year, representing a move toward greater caution while inflation quickens again. The central bank has tried to quell post-pandemic inflation without pinching off job growth. Recent data suggest progress, though risks of inflation persist. The monthly inflation gauge was up for a second straight month in August. Housing, food, and alcohol prices rose. Economists caution that this trend may indicate fresh price pressures, particularly in services. According to RBA Governor Michele Bullock last week, the economy was showing “a bit stronger” than expected signs. She added that the labour market is close to full employment and private sector activity is strengthening. Bullock, however, has cautioned that the RBA is not on a preset course. Future decisions will be conditioned on new real-time inflation, jobs, and wages information. Markets await guidance on cuts The 3.6% pause by the RBA hasn’t halted the debate over what happens next. Attention has shifted to the timing of the next step, with some analysts still predicting rate cuts are inevitable . Westpac and Bloomberg Economics foresee the four-year curve falling below 3 per cent by the end of 2026. They believe the economy will slow down sufficiently to compel the bank into action sooner than many think. National Australia Bank has also extended its forecast to May 2026 with no change in policy. NAB economists say stubborn inflation and robust growth will see the RBA keep rates on hold for significantly longer than market prices. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA ) previously called for a November cut. Now, its own economists are backing away. They cite data on inflation that have come in stronger than expected in recent months as the biggest risk, cautioning that the path to lower rates “is not clear, it is a done deal. “ International dynamics are also complicating the calculus. The US Federal Reserve slashed rates again earlier this month, the first time it has cut since late 2023. The Fed keeps easing while the RBA holds, and suddenly Australian assets start to look relatively attractive. That would bolster capital inflows, push the Australian dollar higher, and help local bond markets. Such a split interest rate could make it easier for the RBA not to rush into cutting. Higher relative yields could take some sting out of the financial stress without any need to loosen the stance on policy. But if the stronger currency were to remain, it would also jeopardize weakening exports. RBA navigates inflation risks carefully If the Fed moves too quickly to lower interest rates, inflation could reignite and reverse all the progress made over the past two years. But if it leaves rates too high for too long, the risk is weaker growth, sluggish job creation, and more financial stress on household s al ready stretched trying to keep up with hefty mortgage repayments. It’s a “delicate trade-off,” Governor Michele Bullock recently said. The central bank is walking a tightrope, seeking to maintain its credibility that it will fight against inflation while not tipping the economy into a downturn. For now, the board believes that moderate restraint on policy will be appropriate. This suggests that interest rates have risen enough to cool prices but not so far as to choke off demand. Surveys that measure payrolls and spending are rebounding as reopening proceeds apace, suggesting the strategy is working, though economists warn the direction could easily change. How much happens will depend on how inflation behaves in the next few months. And if prices for housing, energy, and services keep rising, the bank may not have a choice but to continue leaving rates higher well into 2026. Complicating matters, of course, is the global context. The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have started loosening policy. If Australia falls too far behind other countries, capital flows and exchange rate movements may rewrite domestic financial conditions unpredictably. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The financial arm of Sony was officially listed separately from its parent, prompting a rush of buy orders that resulted in shares going untraded at open. The listing is a watershed for Sony and the Japanese market. It is the first partial spinoff under a 2023 tax reform and the first direct listing in Tokyo in over 20 years. Shares of Sony Financial were assigned a reference price of ¥150 (or about $1) per share. But demand far outpaced supply. Brokers said that buy orders had piled up from the opening bell, preventing trading from getting underway. While the rarity of such a spin-off has fueled excitement, investor interest is mainly rooted in confidence in the business. With strong positions in banking, life, and non-life insurance, Sony Financial is seen as a profitable, stable company with a vast customer base. The company has already committed to buying shares worth up to ¥100 billion in the years ahead. Analysts say it could also help to supercharge investor appetite and calm trading once the initial frenzy cools. Sony sharpens its focus. The spinoff is part of a sweeping overhaul plan at Sony Group. The entertainment and technology giant plans to concentrate on its global strengths: games, music, movies, and image sensors. By unleashing its financial arm, Sony believes both can grow faster and more wisely. Sony has maintained a minority stake in the new company. This permits the parent to leverage future appreciation while freeing Sony Financial to access capital and set its own targets for growth. Executives have said the breakup will also bring greater transparency to investors, who can now assess the value of each business on its own. There are deep roots in the finance arm, as it began with life insurance in 1979 and went on to offer banking and other services. Millions across Japan now use it. The spinoff is designed to make it more flexible in digital banking and product development and allow Sony Group to assign its resources more squarely into entertainment and technology. Sony spinoff reshapes Japan’s market landscape Japan has been wary about direct listings for some time, preferring traditional initial public offerings. The success of Sony Financial’s debut might also prompt other companies to follow its lead, particularly under the new tax rules that have been touted as a way to encourage spinoffs and corporate overhaul. Industry observers say the listing could serve as a model for other Japanese conglomerates with multiple placements. If Sony’s gamble is successful, other companies may be tempted to seek to spin off businesses to unlock value for their investors. Investors will now be monitoring Sony Financial’s trading in the coming days. The robust demand signals market confidence, but the true test will come when trading returns to normal. The split is a fresh new start for Sony. Relieved of the burden of operating a financial arm, it is doubling down on entertainment and technology businesses with global prominence. For Japan, the spinoff could represent the beginning of a new dynamic environment that shakes up long-held company structures. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

BTC was near $112,110, ETH around $4,124, SOL near $209, and XRP about $2.86 alongside 24-hour gains of roughly 2%–4% for these names. Market breadth improved as risk appetite steadied after last week’s volatility. Spot ETF flows have turned constructive again this month, offering a structural bid that has supported rebounds across large caps even as macro headlines remained choppy. Bitcoin leads the market higher Bitcoin edged higher after a turbulent stretch tied to macroeconomic data and options positioning, with recent dips below $111K following a US GDP revision that pressured risk assets before they subsequently stabilised. On the flows side, US spot BTC ETFs recorded multiple consecutive days of net inflows in mid‑September, reinforcing demand from institutions and contributing to the latest bounce. Analysts warn that BTC may need to fall toward $104,000 for correction fatigue to set in—otherwise, the sellers may remain in control. If Bitcoin breaks below a key level near $110,500, further downside toward $107,200 or even $103,500 is possible. On the upside, a daily close above $113,500 could reassert bullish dominance. Ethereum back above $4,100 Ether tracked BTC higher today. Ethereum’s price—around $4,100–$4,200—is under pressure, even though it showed modest gains in the past 24 hours. Analysts suggest ETH must reclaim $4,580 to trigger a breakout. While institutional demand is holding firm, retail flows remain weak. Some price forecasts — driven by macro tailwinds and technical setups — see ETH reaching $5,000+ by year-end. Solana Solana (SOL) traded near $209, up 3.6% in the past day but still nursing a steep 10.6% weekly loss. Solana outperformed earlier in September amid substantial accumulation signals, including Galaxy Digital-linked withdrawals totaling roughly $724M of SOL from exchanges, while some analysts argue demand from treasuries and potential ETF catalysts could extend the narrative. That optimism has been tempered near month‑end by a surge in open interest and weaker technicals that left SOL vulnerable to deeper pullbacks, even as developers press network‑level performance proposals. The net result is elevated two‑way risk in the short run around the $200 handle despite strong year‑to‑date execution and interest from institutions. XRP remains below $3 XRP held at $2.86, with 2.4% daily gains offset by a 2.3% weekly drop. XRP’s price stabilised after a volatile month shaped by its US ETF debut, where “sell‑the‑news” flows overshadowed record day‑one volume before the market found footing again. Technical updates through September point to consolidation under $3, with traders watching for breakouts while macro and ETF narratives sway flows across the complex. The near‑term setup remains range‑bound, but improved risk sentiment today helped the token participate in the broader bounce shown in the screenshots. Top gainers and losers Among altcoins, Zcash (ZEC) was the standout performer, jumping 20% to $65.09 in the past 24 hours. Pump.fun (PUMP) also rallied sharply, climbing 15% to $0.005855, while Story (IP) advanced 12% to $9.17. On the downside, Plasma (XPL) slumped 12% to $1.47, leading the laggards. MemeCore (M) fell 2.7% to $2.29, and XDC Network (XDC) edged lower by 0.95% to $0.072, underscoring selective weakness across smaller-cap names even as the wider market strengthened.

52411869,317728,1759112290,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/52411869.jpeg,Mitchell Demeter Appointed CEO of Sonic Labs to Drive Global Growth and Institutional Expansion,https://chainwire.org/2025/09/29/mitchell-demeter-appointed-ceo-of-sonic-labs-to-drive-global-growth-and-institutional-expansion/,"George Town, Cayman Islands, September 29th, 2025, Chainwire Sonic Labs , the team behind the highest-performing EVM blockchain Sonic, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mitchell Demeter as its new Chief Executive Officer. Demeter, a pioneer in digital assets and seasoned entrepreneur, will lead Sonic Labs in its next phase of global growth, accelerating the adoption of Sonic as one of the world’s leading blockchains. His mandate includes expanding developer and ecosystem adoption worldwide, strengthening institutional relationships, and building bridges into U.S. and global capital markets as part of Sonic’s broader mission to redefine the future of finance. Since the launch of the Sonic network in December 2024, the organization has achieved many milestones, including having a proven mainnet that can confirm up to 400,000 transactions per second with confirmation times consistently under 1 second, coupled with successes such as the Coinbase listing for S, native issuance of USDC , integration of Chainlink’s CCIP , and many others. However, what’s missing are strong institutional connections in the U.S. and elsewhere backing the Sonic network and its ecosystem projects. This is a necessary component—coupled with great technology, business functions, and exchange listings—that will take Sonic to the next level. Under Demeter’s leadership, Sonic Labs will be assembling a strong executive team around him, bringing in proven operators with deep experience across both traditional finance and crypto to complement the foundation’s technology strengths. Sonic Labs is expanding its business development efforts in the United States and globally, actively recruiting and hiring leaders to deepen institutional relationships and build lasting partnerships with major U.S. and global investors and enterprises alike. This transition is coming at a pivotal moment. Industry leaders have forecast that within the next decade, as much as 10% of global GDP could be transacted on blockchain rails, representing over $10 trillion in on-chain economic activity. Sonic is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, combining unmatched speed and scalability with developer and institutional incentive models designed for mass adoption. Demeter said he has always believed blockchain would fundamentally reshape global markets, but that success now depends on building the right bridges between decentralized innovation and institutional frameworks. “Sonic’s technology is unmatched in speed and scalability, and our mission is to bring that performance directly into institutional finance and global markets,” he explained. He continued, “Our mission is not just adoption, it’s to make Sonic indispensable to the future of global finance. That means scaling our business development and partnership efforts with large, well-known U.S. and global entities, and supporting lighthouse applications through strategic partnerships that will serve as proof points for the entire industry. The world’s financial infrastructure is moving on-chain, and Sonic intends to be at the very center of that transition.” Under his leadership, Sonic will continue to expand its presence among institutional investors and builders alike, bridging global markets without losing sight of its decentralized roots. Michael Kong, who has guided Sonic Labs (and previously Fantom) to this stage, will continue serving on the Board of Directors and take on the role of Chief Information Officer, remaining actively involved in the company’s leadership. Michael has been central to the evolution of Fantom, now Sonic, since 2018, and will remain fully engaged in guiding and supporting Demeter as he leads the network into its next phase of growth. Kong noted that he has watched Demeter bridge public markets with blockchain for more than a decade and believes this is the right moment for his leadership. “Mitchell’s extensive network and trusted relationships across the blockchain ecosystem, traditional finance, and beyond will be critical in driving the partnerships and real-world applications that will take Sonic to the next level. Myself and the entire Sonic Board of Directors are fully committed to supporting him in achieving this vision.” About Mitchell Demeter Mitchell Demeter is widely recognized as a pioneer in the blockchain industry. He launched the world’s first Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver and co-founded Cointrader Exchange, one of Canada’s earliest digital currency trading platforms. Over the years, his work has been featured in Forbes, Time, Fast Company, Wired, Huffington Post, and other major outlets. As a serial entrepreneur and investor, Demeter has founded and scaled multiple ventures across industries, consistently demonstrating an ability to anticipate market shifts and deliver innovative solutions. As part of this transition, he will step back from his role as CEO of SonicStrategy and assume the position of Executive Chair, where he will continue to provide leadership on strategy and capital markets development.

Demeter, a pioneer in digital assets and seasoned entrepreneur, will lead Sonic Labs in its next phase of global growth, accelerating the adoption of Sonic as one of the world’s leading blockchains. His mandate includes expanding developer and ecosystem adoption worldwide, strengthening institutional relationships, and building bridges into U.S. and global capital markets as part of Sonic’s broader mission to redefine the future of finance. Since the launch of the Sonic network in December 2024, the organization has achieved many milestones, including having a proven mainnet that can confirm up to 400,000 transactions per second with confirmation times consistently under 1 second, coupled with successes such as the Coinbase listing for S, native issuance of USDC , integration of Chainlink’s CCIP , and many others. However, what’s missing are strong institutional connections in the U.S. and elsewhere backing the Sonic network and its ecosystem projects. This is a necessary component—coupled with great technology, business functions, and exchange listings—that will take Sonic to the next level. Under Demeter’s leadership, Sonic Labs will be assembling a strong executive team around him, bringing in proven operators with deep experience across both traditional finance and crypto to complement the foundation’s technology strengths. Sonic Labs is expanding its business development efforts in the United States and globally, actively recruiting and hiring leaders to deepen institutional relationships and build lasting partnerships with major U.S. and global investors and enterprises alike. This transition is coming at a pivotal moment. Industry leaders have forecast that within the next decade, as much as 10% of global GDP could be transacted on blockchain rails, representing over $10 trillion in on-chain economic activity. Sonic is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, combining unmatched speed and scalability with developer and institutional incentive models designed for mass adoption. Demeter said he has always believed blockchain would fundamentally reshape global markets, but that success now depends on building the right bridges between decentralized innovation and institutional frameworks. “Sonic’s technology is unmatched in speed and scalability, and our mission is to bring that performance directly into institutional finance and global markets,” he explained. He continued, “Our mission is not just adoption, it’s to make Sonic indispensable to the future of global finance. That means scaling our business development and partnership efforts with large, well-known U.S. and global entities, and supporting lighthouse applications through strategic partnerships that will serve as proof points for the entire industry. The world’s financial infrastructure is moving on-chain, and Sonic intends to be at the very center of that transition.” Under his leadership, Sonic will continue to expand its presence among institutional investors and builders alike, bridging global markets without losing sight of its decentralized roots. Michael Kong, who has guided Sonic Labs (and previously Fantom) to this stage, will continue serving on the Board of Directors and take on the role of Chief Information Officer, remaining actively involved in the company’s leadership. Michael has been central to the evolution of Fantom, now Sonic, since 2018, and will remain fully engaged in guiding and supporting Demeter as he leads the network into its next phase of growth. Kong noted that he has watched Demeter bridge public markets with blockchain for more than a decade and believes this is the right moment for his leadership. “Mitchell’s extensive network and trusted relationships across the blockchain ecosystem, traditional finance, and beyond will be critical in driving the partnerships and real-world applications that will take Sonic to the next level. Myself and the entire Sonic Board of Directors are fully committed to supporting him in achieving this vision.” About Mitchell Demeter Mitchell Demeter is widely recognized as a pioneer in the blockchain industry.

52412559,https://invezz.com/?p=2902156,1759112311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"At $0.035, analysts call an altcoin the best crypto to buy to hit $1 faster than DOGE",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/29/at-0-035-analysts-call-an-altcoin-the-best-crypto-to-buy-to-hit-1-faster-than-doge/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been viewed as the poster child of meme-driven rallies, but its growth has slowed considerably in recent years. While DOGE struggles to maintain momentum, analysts are pointing toward a new DeFi project that blends utility with strong tokenomics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at just $0.035 in presale Phase 6, is being highlighted as the altcoin with the fundamentals to reach $1 far sooner than DOGE. For those investing in crypto, this project introduces an ecosystem where dual lending, mtToken staking, and MUTM buybacks come together to fuel long-term value. Why MUTM’s utility puts it ahead of DOGE Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a meme token—it will be a Layer 2 DeFi protocol built with real financial mechanics designed for scalability. The platform introduces dual lending mechanics that combine peer-to-contract (P2C) pools for stablecoins and blue-chip crypto coins with peer-to-peer (P2P) pools for riskier assets like meme coins. This structure will allow users to earn predictable yields in P2C while exploring higher returns in P2P, creating balance in one ecosystem. The project is also preparing for its Beta launch at listing, which will let users experience the dashboard, lending systems, and mtToken staking functions firsthand. Mutuum’s dashboard is functional; it will display user holdings, track ROI in real time, and feature a Top 50 leaderboard that rewards major investors with bonus MUTM tokens. These design choices build long-term engagement and encourage participation, two aspects that DOGE has struggled to sustain. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further differentiates itself with stable interest rate borrowing. Initial rates will be locked to provide predictability, while rebalancing conditions will adjust over time for sustainability. Borrowers will operate under clear loan-to-value caps, collateralization rules, and liquidation penalties that feed back into the protocol’s treasury. This means predictable revenue flows will support platform growth and drive continuous token demand. Strong demand drivers to take MUTM to $1 The numbers behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are already compelling. Out of a total supply of 4 billion tokens, Phase 6 has raised $16.45 million, with 50% of its 170 million tokens already sold. The token is priced at $0.035 with over 16,650 holders participating. As presale phases progress, the price will rise, with the next step set at $0.04—a 15% increase. That creates an urgent opportunity for investors to enter at a discount before the price moves higher. Several factors are expected to propel MUTM’s valuation. The Beta launch will allow immediate user adoption and showcase lending and borrowing utilities from day one. Expected listings on top exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC, are anticipated, which will broaden access, improve liquidity, and expose the token to global audiences. The buy-and-distribute mechanism is another standout feature, with platform revenue directed toward open-market MUTM repurchases that are then redistributed to stakers. This cycle creates sustained buying pressure, reinforces holding incentives, and increases long-term demand. The presale has already proven highly rewarding for early participants. A Phase 1 investor who allocated $10,000 at $0.01 now holds $35,000 value at today’s Phase 6 valuation. By the next phase at $0.04, that same position will be valued at $40,000. Even investors entering at the current $0.035 stage are projected to see immediate gains as the presale progresses, showcasing how structured pricing supports consistent ROI. Security and transparency are central pillars of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a CertiK audit that included both manual review and static analysis, earning a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. Alongside this, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivizes white-hat testing and reinforces confidence in the platform’s readiness for launch. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just another presale. It’s a properly planned DeFi system that will beat speculative coins that don’t have any real worth. DOGE has relied on hype, while MUTM is getting ready to merge real-world mechanics with demand drivers that will help it reach $1. If you’re wondering why crypto is down today, this presale shows that the answer isn’t to sit out but to look for projects that are establishing long-lasting ecosystems. MUTM is being called the best cryptocurrency to buy right now since it has a lot of uses, a lot of people are interested in it, and its presale is picking up speed. This is a big change from DOGE’s slow growth.

A lot of people are now looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project that is meant to be useful in the real world and has a clear 700% upside for early investors. Some traders are asking why crypto is down today, but others know that downturns frequently lead to smarter rotations into businesses with stronger fundamentals. MUTM is the DeFi token to keep an eye on because it has two lending pools, a stablecoin structure, and Layer 2 integration that promises cheaper costs and faster transactions. This initiative is getting more and more interest from both retail and institutional investors who possess ADA and are looking for a new route. From ADA uncertainty to MUTM’s clear utility Unlike speculative crypto coins that depend heavily on community hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on mechanisms that will generate sustainable demand. Its dual lending structure will allow users to participate in Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for blue-chip assets like BTC, ETH, and stablecoins, while also enabling Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for meme tokens such as PEPE and DOGE. This flexibility will attract both conservative investors who value stability and risk-tolerant traders seeking higher yields. The platform will also introduce stablecoin issuance, providing users with a dollar-pegged asset that enhances both lending and borrowing efficiency. mtToken staking will reward users for securing liquidity, while the MUTM buyback system will redistribute revenue to strengthen token utility. Combined with Layer 2 technology, transactions will remain cost-efficient and scalable even as user activity increases. These features will be demonstrated in the Beta launch at listing, allowing early adopters to see the protocol’s full utility in action. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently drawing attention, with $16.45 million raised so far, 50% of its 170 million allocation already sold, and a price of $0.035. More than 16,650 holders are now part of this stage, signaling rising demand ahead of Phase 7. With the next price increase to $0.04—a 15% jump—the window for discounted entry is narrowing. For ADA traders who are shifting their strategies, the presale provides a timely opportunity to align with a project offering clearer growth prospects. Why MUTM is targeting a 700% run The projected 700% upside for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not based on speculation alone but supported by the protocol’s revenue model and demand drivers. A utilization-based interest system will dynamically adjust borrowing rates depending on liquidity, ensuring lenders remain incentivized and borrowers stay engaged. This flow of activity will grow the treasury, reinforcing the project’s long-term sustainability and supporting token demand. Deposit and borrow caps will also be applied to different asset classes, while restricted collateral mode will prevent correlated risk from destabilizing the system. These safeguards will encourage larger deposits and create higher confidence for participants, ensuring MUTM remains attractive for those investing in crypto with long-term goals. Expected listings on major exchanges such as KuCoin and Kraken will provide broad visibility and adoption. Increased access to trading pairs will drive retail inflows, while institutional interest will rise as the protocol proves its mechanics through the Beta launch and growing liquidity. With collateral and liquidation mechanics ensuring predictable revenue—through loan-to-value thresholds, liquidation penalties, and treasury allocations—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to generate ongoing demand independent of market hype. The investment examples highlight the strength of entering early. A Phase 1 investor who placed $10,000 at $0.01 now holds $35,000 at the current $0.035 presale price. A Phase 6 participant investing the same amount will see $11,500 value immediately after the Phase 7 price increase. This clear trajectory illustrates how retail participants can capture value at multiple presale stages while building confidence for the long-term run. Reinforcing this credibility is the CertiK audit, which delivered a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, paired with a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. These measures confirm that the protocol is taking security seriously while incentivizing independent oversight. For traders seeking safety alongside growth potential, this combination offers a rare balance. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing itself as the go-to project for ADA traders who are exiting stagnant positions and looking for more ambitious growth. With strong presale momentum, clear token mechanics, and a roadmap that includes Beta testing and top exchange listings, the project is uniquely positioned to deliver outsized returns. For those searching for the next DeFi gem, MUTM is more than an alternative—it is a structured opportunity for serious retail and institutional investors to capture a projected 700% run.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a standout, already showing 250% gains from its early presale phases and positioning itself as the top crypto to buy for 20x upside. This momentum is reinforced by MUTM’s advanced ecosystem, which combines dual lending pools, a stable interest rate model, and mtToken staking with open-market buyback incentives. In a market where crypto prices fluctuate and crypto predictions remain uncertain, MUTM provides a structured environment for crypto investment, balancing growth with risk management. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently priced at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. Phase 7 is expected to launch at $0.04, offering a 15% short-term gain and creating urgency for early acquisition. MUTM’s presale structure rewards early investors while maintaining demand, supporting projected upside through platform adoption, staking rewards, and buyback-driven supply reduction. ETH consolidates at $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) has entered a phase of consolidation around the $4,000 mark, trading in a relatively tight range as buyers and sellers wrestle for control. After slipping just below $4,000 in recent sessions, ETH has rebounded slightly but still lacks strong directional momentum. On-chain data suggests accumulation in cold wallets and continued inflows from institutional sources, but caution is warranted: if the $3,900 support fails, ETH may test lower levels such as $3,800 or $3,700. Meanwhile, ETF redemptions and broader market volatility are exerting pressure, making this consolidation zone an important battleground for the next leg. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): dual lending pools and stable interest rate model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate dual lending pools to cater to diverse investor strategies. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will accept stablecoins like USDC and DAI, as well as blue-chip cryptocurrencies such as ETH and BTC. These deposits will earn predictable yields through the stable interest rate model, which will include initial rate locks, higher starting rates, and rebalancing conditions to ensure liquidity remains healthy and borrowing costs remain consistent. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending pools will allow users to lend and borrow higher-risk, less-liquid assets such as meme coins, including SHIB and DOGE. These isolated pools will feature individually negotiated rates, offering higher returns for willing participants while protecting the core P2C liquidity. MUTM’s stable interest rate model is tailored to provide security for borrowers and lenders alike. Borrowers with volatile or less-liquid assets will benefit from predictable repayment schedules, while lenders will enjoy consistent accruals from deposits. Rate rebalancing will adjust periodically according to pool utilization, ensuring that liquidity is optimized for both borrowing and lending activities. Overcollateralization and liquidation thresholds will safeguard the system, with clear LTV caps and liquidation bonuses to protect the platform during market swings. Reserve factors and treasury allocations will further mitigate risk, giving confidence to both retail and institutional participants. Strategic growth Investors who participated in Phases 1–3, acquiring MUTM at $0.01–$0.02, will see their holdings grow substantially, while new participants in Phase 6 will have an immediate opportunity for upside appreciation post-next-phase launch. A $10,000 Phase 1 investment will project $50,000 in value through price progression and staking rewards, while a $10,000 Phase 6 investment will project $11,500 post Phase 7. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement enhanced collateral efficiency with restricted collateralization modes, deposit and borrowing caps, and correlated asset exposure controls. These features provide confidence to institutional participants while maintaining robust safeguards for retail investors. Price discovery and liquidity management will rely on Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds, aggregated market data, and DEX TWAPs, ensuring accurate valuations and efficient lending across both P2C and P2P pools. Roadmap, security, and incentives The MUTM roadmap is structured to build confidence in investors and strengthen adoption. Phase 2 will focus on smart contract development and front/back-end integration, Phase 3 will introduce beta testing and exchange listing preparations, and Phase 4 will deliver the live platform with Layer-2 scaling, staking, and buybacks. Multi-chain expansion will ensure wider adoption and efficient capital deployment. Security remains a priority with a CertiK audit scoring 90 for Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, alongside a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program. MUTM will also conduct a $100,000 ongoing giveaway , with ten winners receiving $10,000 in MUTM tokens each, further driving community engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great option for traders who want to avoid ETH consolidation and want to make structured crypto investments. MUTM offers a mix of risk-managed growth and presale upside through multiple lending pools, a steady interest rate strategy, overcollateralization safeguards, and open-market buybacks. Phase 6 is now half sold, and Phase 7 is expected to see a 15% price spike, which makes it hard to get in at a discount. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to be the best cryptocurrency to buy since it has a clear plan, excellent mechanics, and benefits for early buyers.

With 50% of Phase 6 already sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the standout DeFi project that combines real utility with promising upside. Unlike many projects chasing hype, MUTM operates dual lending pools that cater to both peer-to-contract (P2C) assets like stablecoins, ETH, and BTC, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for high-risk, high-reward tokens such as SHIB and PEPE. This strategic design is positioning MUTM as a crypto coin primed to achieve $1 by 2026, making it one of the most attractive options for investors looking at crypto predictions and crypto charts for next-generation returns. Phase 6 presale momentum and urgency Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has already raised $16.45 million, with half of the 170 million allocated tokens sold. The current price stands at $0.035, and the presale now includes more than 16,650 holders. The next phase will see the price increase to $0.04, representing a 15% gain, making this the last opportunity for investors to acquire discounted MUTM before the price rise. Layer 2 integration ensures that transactions on the MUTM platform will be faster and more cost-effective than traditional Layer 1 networks, attracting both retail and institutional participants. A Beta launch is planned prior to full listing, giving early adopters hands-on experience with the lending pools, stablecoin issuance, and staking mechanisms. Users will also be able to track their holdings and ROI through a sophisticated dashboard, while the Top 50 leaderboard will reward the most active and committed investors with bonus MUTM tokens, fostering community engagement and long-term participation. Road to $1 Several factors are expected to drive demand and support upward momentum. The Beta launch will provide users with early access to MUTM’s full platform functionality, giving them the chance to experience dual lending, stablecoin minting, and mtToken staking firsthand. This engagement will not only increase platform adoption but also create tangible demand for MUTM tokens. Anticipated listings on top-tier exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, will further expand visibility and liquidity, attracting a broader base of investors and traders looking to diversify their holdings with reliable crypto coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a buy-and-distribute model whereby a portion of platform revenue is used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the market, with rewards distributed to mtToken stakers. This mechanism will encourage long-term participation, stabilize token demand, and generate consistent activity across the platform. The structured staking and reward system creates predictable utility, ensuring that the presale interest converts into sustainable adoption and trading volume. Risk management is another pillar of MUTM’s design. Loans will be overcollateralized with calibrated loan-to-value ratios, and liquidation triggers will be closely monitored to safeguard the protocol. Penalties from liquidations feed into the treasury and support the reserve factor, creating a stable, self-reinforcing ecosystem. The restricted-collateral mode allows the platform to minimise systemic risk while maintaining flexibility for borrowers, ensuring investor confidence remains high as adoption scales. Early investment benefit Early investors are already seeing substantial gains. A Phase 1 participant who invested $10,000 is now seeing a valuation of $35,000, and this amount is projected to rise to $40,000 on paper in the next presale phase as the price adjusts to $0.04. These clear and structured investment outcomes highlight why MUTM is becoming a favorite among traders and investors analyzing crypto prices and future projections. Security and transparency are also central to the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit, including manual review and static analysis, and maintains a 50,000 USDT bug bounty to incentivize white-hat reporting and continuous improvement. This ensures that participants can invest with confidence, knowing the protocol prioritizes safety and reliability in a volatile market. MUTM has presale momentum, Layer 2 efficiency, dual lending mechanisms, Beta involvement, and structured demand drivers. Half of Phase 6 has already been sold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great investment opportunity for anybody looking for a DeFi project that has genuine value and a lot of potential. Like the other prudent early joiners, it is better to acquire tokens now before it gets close to its $1 target in 2026. MUTM is on track to be one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the next several years because it combines excellent foundations, new technology, and clear incentive systems.

Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain strong options due to their established networks, yet analysts suggest a new DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , could outperform both in returns. MUTM’s unique combination of dual lending mechanics, Layer 2 efficiency, and presale momentum positions it as a high-utility token capable of delivering exceptional ROI. Observers tracking crypto predictions, crypto charts, and crypto prices will find MUTM a compelling choice for both short-term gains and long-term growth. Phase 6 of MUTM’s presale has raised $16.45 million, with 50% of 170 million tokens sold at $0.035 and over 16,650 holders participating. The next phase is priced at $0.04, reflecting a 15% increase, creating urgency for early acquisition. A $100,000 giveaway will further engage the community, offering 10 winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens, amplifying awareness and adoption. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate as a foundational blockchain for smart contracts. Current crypto prices reflect steady performance, supported by network adoption and developer activity. Despite this, ETH’s large market capitalization limits its short-term ROI potential, making it more suitable for investors prioritizing stability and long-term portfolio growth rather than rapid gains. Historical crypto charts indicate consistent appreciation, yet ETH lacks mechanisms to deliver explosive returns compared to emerging DeFi ecosystems. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL), on the other hand, has been lauded for its speed and low transaction costs, attracting decentralized applications and NFT projects. Recent market movements highlight resistance levels and adoption challenges, with slower-than-expected scaling slightly dampening investor enthusiasm. SOL provides a balance of growth and utility but remains constrained by network-specific limitations and volatility, resulting in an ROI slower than high-utility DeFi platforms targeting real user demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a next-generation DeFi solution with dual lending mechanics that cater to both bluechip assets and high-volatility tokens. P2C lending allows users to leverage bluechip collateral such as BTC, ETH, and stablecoins. For example, 2 BTC can be used to borrow $100,000 USDC at 75% LTV, or 5 ETH can generate 3.75 ETH in stablecoins. P2P lending supports meme coins like PEPE and FLOKI, with interest rates negotiated to reward risk-tolerant investors. Layer 2 integration ensures faster, lower-cost transactions, boosting platform adoption and liquidity. MUTM offers a user-friendly dashboard to track ROI, and the Top 50 leaderboard will reward the most active investors with bonus tokens, encouraging long-term engagement and repeated participation. The upcoming Beta launch will provide early users with hands-on access to platform functionality, demonstrating practical utility that will drive demand and adoption. The demand for MUTM is supported by several structural drivers. Beta access allows users to experience real utility, which will increase adoption and trading volume. Expected listings on top exchanges, including KuCoin and Kraken, will expand liquidity and market visibility, contributing to price growth. The buy-and-distribute mechanism repurchases MUTM from the market to reward stakers, ensuring consistent buy pressure and incentivizing long-term holding. Stable interest rates combined with enhanced collateral efficiency will attract sophisticated users, driving borrowing volume, accumulating reserves, and reinforcing MUTM’s token value. Final words Investment examples highlight the token’s potential. An investor who swapped $12,000 from SOL and ETH into MUTM during early phases now sees holdings valued at $42,000 in Phase 6. Expected listing at $0.06, this investment is projected to reach $72,000 on paper, supported by Beta adoption, Layer 2 cost efficiency, and the platform’s structured utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a better choice for ROI than ETH and SOL. Ethereum (ETH) is stable, and Solana (SOL) grows slowly. MUTM, on the other hand, combines dual lending, Layer 2 efficiency, structured staking rewards, and presale FOMO to make a token that people really want and that has real uses. Investors who look at crypto predictions and charts will see that MUTM is a presale jewel that can give them huge returns and be used for a long time.

Crypto prices today show a clear slowdown in ETH momentum, prompting retail and institutional participants to wonder why crypto is down. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a standout DeFi project, offering a dual lending system and mtToken staking, with structured mechanics that project 20x upside from its presale price. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently priced at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. Phase 7 is projected at $0.04, offering a 15% short-term upside. Early presale investors from Phase 1, who acquired tokens at $0.01, have already seen a substantial projected return. A $10,000 investment in Phase 1 will translate into $35,000 in current Phase 6 value, while a $10,000 purchase now will project $11,500 post next phase on paper, delivering immediate growth and long-term potential. ETH run over? Some analysts are now warning that ETH’s rally run might be over for this season, pointing to signs of weakening momentum and rising downside risks. Ethereum (ETH) recently dropped below the $4,000 mark, with trading volume spiking and over $1.2 billion in crypto liquidations observed in a short span — a signal of heavy selling pressure. At the same time, open interest has fallen sharply, indicating many leveraged long positions have been closed out. Citi analysts have also revised their forecasts downward, projecting ETH could fall to ~$3,300 by year-end. Together, these technical and sentiment indicators fuel the argument that Ethereum (ETH)’s upward leg has likely paused — at least until broader market conditions improve. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending and stable interest model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate dual lending pools to serve a wide spectrum of investors. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will allow users to lend stablecoins or major cryptocurrencies like USDT, ETH, and LINK into audited liquidity contracts, earning interest on deposits. A typical example will see a $12,000 USDT deposit converted to mtUSDT, generating a projected 15% APY. Borrowing within P2C will remain secured with overcollateralization; for instance, $9,000 USDC can be borrowed against $12,000 ETH at a safe 75% LTV, ensuring system solvency and pool protection. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will handle riskier assets, including memecoins like PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE, within isolated pools. Rates will be negotiated individually, allowing lenders to earn higher returns without impacting P2C liquidity. Across both pools, the platform will implement overcollateralization, LTV caps, liquidation triggers, and a reserve factor ranging from 10% to 50% based on asset volatility, safeguarding investors’ capital even during volatile market conditions. MUTM will use a Stable Interest Rate Model for borrowers, featuring initial rate locks, higher starting rates, and rebalancing conditions. Stable assets will enjoy predictable borrowing costs, while volatile assets will be subject to dynamic adjustments to maintain solvency and incentivize timely repayments. This interest framework will provide transparency and security for both lenders and borrowers, ensuring the platform remains robust during periods of market stress or sudden crypto crash events. Liquidity management Price discovery and liquidity management at MUTM will leverage Chainlink oracles for USD and native asset pricing, with fallback feeds, aggregated data, and DEX TWAPs to maintain accurate valuations. Borrow rates will adjust according to pool utilization: lower rates will encourage borrowing when liquidity is abundant, and higher rates will attract deposits when capital is scarce. This system ensures efficient, liquid borrowing and lending while stabilizing the platform against sudden market movements. mtToken staking will allow users to earn MUTM rewards from platform revenue. Open-market buybacks will simultaneously handle circulating supply and create natural demand, amplifying investor incentives. The roadmap spans Phases 2–4, covering smart contract deployment, beta testing, exchange listing preparation, and live platform launch with Layer-2 integration for faster and cheaper transactions. Security, credibility, and FOMO opportunity MUTM’s presale will be backed by a CertiK audit, scoring 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, alongside a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program. A $100,000 giveaway , divided into ten $10,000 MUTM prizes, will further engage the community. MUTM is a solid alternative to ETH that will interest investors. It has a dual lending structure, overcollateralization, a stable interest rate model, and a price discovery framework that all work together to give you a lot of upside and security. There won’t be many chances to get reduced tokens because Phase 6 is nearly 50% sold and Phase 7 will cost 15% more. MUTM is a DeFi solution that mixes growth potential with structured risk management. This makes it one of the most appealing crypto projects for investors who want to move their money from ETH to assets with more potential.

The crypto fear and greed index has shown a shift toward caution, and crypto charts indicate subdued momentum in traditional blue-chip tokens. Traders questioning why crypto is down are now turning their attention to promising alternatives with tangible utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a DeFi protocol that offers structured growth, and early participants have already witnessed a 3.5× value gain on paper from Phase 1 to Phase 6. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale will offer tokens at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. The platform hosted over 16,650 holders this phase. This underdog altcoin combines real-world use cases with a growing community, positioning itself as a strong candidate to outperform BTC and ETH in ROI over the next few years. BTC & ETH hard to 100X Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are unlikely to be 100x from current levels due to simple market math and economic constraints. BTC already has a market cap above $1 trillion and ETH around $400–500 billion; multiplying these by 100 would require valuations of $100 trillion and $40–50 trillion, respectively—figures that rival or surpass the entire global GDP of roughly $110 trillion. Such growth would demand tens of trillions in fresh capital inflows, which is highly unrealistic given competition with traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. Moreover, both BTC and ETH have reached widespread adoption, with Bitcoin (BTC) established as a store of value and Ethereum (ETH) powering most DeFi and smart contracts, meaning their early-stage exponential growth is gone and future gains will be more gradual, like large-cap tech stocks. Smaller altcoins with lower market caps offer more realistic 100x potential, but BTC and ETH cannot scale that way again. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): dual lending mechanics and stablecoin innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will leverage two primary lending mechanisms. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending will focus on blue-chip tokens such as USDT and LINK, providing stable returns with interest rates that adjust based on pool utilization. For example, when capital is abundant, rates will remain low to encourage borrowing, whereas higher utilization will increase rates to attract deposits and incentivize repayments. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will accommodate higher-risk or less-liquid tokens, including memecoins like PEPE and DOGE, with individually negotiated rates. These P2P pools will remain isolated to protect the core liquidity of P2C lenders, ensuring that riskier trades do not compromise systemic stability. An innovative feature of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be its decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1. This stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against approved collateral, and burned upon repayment or liquidation. Interest rates will be dynamically governed by the platform to maintain the peg, while arbitrage opportunities will ensure that the token remains stable under market pressure. Price discovery and liquidity management will also be key drivers of MUTM’s growth. Chainlink oracles will provide reliable USD and native-asset pricing, supported by fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and on-chain DEX metrics for accurate valuation. Utilization-based interest rates will ensure safe borrowing while protecting liquidity. Low rates will attract borrowers when pools are underutilized, while higher rates will encourage repayments and deposits when liquidity is scarce, stabilizing the system and maintaining healthy pool balances. mtToken ecosystem CertiK audits will ensure security, with a Token Scan score of 90 and Skynet score of 79. A 50,000 USDT bug bounty will reward participants across four tiers: Critical ($2,000), Major ($1,000), Medium ($500), and Low ($200). Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway will select ten winners to receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.040, a 15% jump that will reward presale participants who act early. The mtToken staking mechanism will provide additional incentives. Users will stake their mtTokens to earn MUTM rewards, while a buy-and-distribute system will use platform revenue to repurchase MUTM from the open market, increasing demand and prices.. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will follow a clear roadmap. Phase 1 executed the initial presale, Phase 2 will focus on building core smart contracts and front/back-end infrastructure, Phase 3 will launch a beta for early user interaction and testing, and Phase 4 will include the full live platform with multi-chain support and advanced DeFi features. The beta launch will allow investors to experience all the offered features besides the already live dashboard, track ROI, and climb the Top-50 leaderboard, earning bonus MUTM tokens for top rankings. Conclusion By Phase 6, an investor who traded $5,000 ETH for MUTM in Phase 1 will have already made a 3.5× return on their investment. The protocol will offer a lot of upside for early adopters, with a predicted listing price of $0.06 and a long-term goal of $1. This is because of beta adoption, Layer-2 speed improvements, and visibility on key exchanges. More than half of Phase 6 has been sold, and the following phase will cost $0.040, which means that the last chance to get in at a lower price is coming up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer structured lending, new stablecoin mechanisms, and a strong presale momentum, making it the best option for investors who want to make a lot of money without investing in BTC or ETH.

With the crypto fear and greed index swinging toward fear and crypto charts indicating increased volatility, traders are analyzing why crypto is down and actively seeking safe entry points. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a standout solution, offering decentralized finance features designed to protect users while delivering meaningful returns. With Phase 6 of the presale already 50% sold at $0.035, the token is positioned for a 15% jump to $0.040 in Phase 7, creating an ideal window for investors looking to secure early-stage assets. BTC price status Bitcoin (BTC) recently slipped beneath the $112,000 threshold and is now at around $109K, triggering concern among traders as a wave of liquidations and weak support levels exacerbated the decline. As prices fell, the share of Bitcoin (BTC) held “in loss” more than doubled, signaling mounting stress in the market. Technically, BTC failed to hold above pivot zones near $110,000–$119,000, and some analysts now view a retest of the $110,000 level as likely. The broader macro backdrop—especially hawkish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve and a strengthening dollar—has added pressure to risk assets like Bitcoin (BTC). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): robust collateral and lending structure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement a Stability Factor to assess the security of collateral across all loans. Overcollateralization will remain a cornerstone, ensuring that both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans are fully protected against market swings. Automatic liquidations will trigger when collateral falls below thresholds, and liquidators will repurchase undercollateralized positions at discounted rates, reinforcing liquidity and minimizing systemic risk. For lower-volatility assets such as stablecoins or major tokens like ETH, LTVs can reach 75% with an 80% liquidation threshold, while volatile tokens, including DOGE and TRUMP, will remain capped at 35–50% LTV with 65% thresholds. Reserve factors will adjust dynamically between 10% and 50% according to asset risk. The P2C lending feature will allow a participant to lend $12,000 SOL and receive mtSOL, earning a 14% APY. Borrowers can leverage $12,000 ETH as collateral to secure $9,000 USDT while staying within a 75% LTV, ensuring both solvency and protection for lenders. P2P lending pools will accommodate higher-risk tokens such as PEPE with negotiated APYs, isolated from P2C lending, ensuring that the broader liquidity pools remain secure while offering high-yield opportunities to risk-tolerant investors. Market volatility and liquidity management will be actively maintained. Caps, liquidation incentives, and reserve factors will ensure that the protocol can handle market swings without compromising solvency. By maintaining structured thresholds and risk-adjusted LTVs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide participants with confidence that lending and borrowing operations remain safe even in turbulent conditions. Early investor advantage The presale stage is a major catalyst for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demand. Phase 6 currently offers tokens at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and over 16,650 holders participating. With half of the Phase 6 supply already sold, early investors will benefit from the imminent Phase 7 price increase to $0.040. The platform will launch a beta version at the time of token listing, giving participants early access to the offered features like dual lending and staking. Dashboard is already live, allowing them to monitor holdings, calculate ROI, and engage with the Top-50 leaderboard that rewards significant investors with bonus MUTM tokens. Security is emphasized through a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. Additionally, the project will implement a 50,000 USDT bug bounty across multiple severity tiers, along with a $100,000 ongoing giveaway where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Layer-2 integration will reduce transaction costs and improve processing speeds, enhancing the platform’s usability and attracting additional users. Investment examples highlight the potential of early participation. An investor exchanging $7,500 BTC into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 will witness their position grow through Phase 6 pricing, while the projected listing and broader adoption will set the stage for multi-year price targets reaching $3. The combination of presale momentum, Layer-2 efficiency, and structured collateral safeguards ensures that MUTM will be a leading option for investors seeking a secure and profitable entry into DeFi. Conclusion As BTC’s popularity fades and people look for safer options, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will create a structured, high-demand space for lending, borrowing, and staking. With Phase 7 coming up and more than half of the existing supply sold, the platform will give investors a rare chance to get into a strong DeFi ecosystem before the industry as a whole changes. Collateral safety, automatic liquidations, and multi-layered risk management will keep participants secure and set MUTM up for big growth.

With its presale price fixed at just $0.035, many in the crypto investing world see this as the type of asymmetric opportunity that rarely comes around. At a time when crypto prices today show volatility and some ask why is crypto down, MUTM is positioning itself with innovations that appeal to both retail and institutional investors. The dual lending system that redefines DeFi The presale is already attracting heavy interest. Phase 6 has brought in more than $16.5 million, with over 16,650 holders joining the project. Half of the 170 million tokens allocated for this stage are already sold. At $0.035 per token, this price marks the final discounted entry before the increase to $0.040 in Phase 7. Investors looking for exposure understand that presale positioning can be decisive, especially with analysts forecasting such dramatic growth. Buying now locks in access before the cost rises and before MUTM enters wider markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a design that blends two lending models into one ecosystem. The Peer-to-Contract system is dedicated to stablecoins and blue-chip assets such as ETH and BTC, giving users safer yields and deep liquidity. Alongside this, the Peer-to-Peer framework unlocks higher-return possibilities for lenders willing to engage with riskier tokens like meme coins. By keeping risk isolated in the P2P setup while maintaining stability through P2C pools, the project opens doors for broader participation across market segments. This dual-lending structure stands out as a balanced yet ambitious solution in decentralized finance. Why analysts project 120x growth by 2026 The growth trajectory for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is anchored by its structural revenue model and efficiency enhancements. Every liquidation penalty will flow directly into the treasury, building sustainable reserves that back the system. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency lets users extract more value from their deposits, amplifying borrowing activity while maximizing the capital utility of stable pairs. The utilization-based interest model ensures that as demand for borrowing increases, lenders are rewarded with higher yields, creating an ever-adapting balance that keeps liquidity deep and attractive. Together, these features form the foundation for a robust ecosystem that compounds demand for the token itself. Several upcoming milestones highlight why analysts are confident in the projected upside. The beta launch at the time of token listing will allow users to immediately interact with the core features of lending and borrowing. A Layer-2 integration is planned to cut costs and deliver faster transaction speeds, addressing one of the most persistent challenges in DeFi. The development of a decentralized stablecoin pegged at $1 will drive daily usage on the platform and expand real utility for users. On top of this, listings on Tier-1 exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase are expected to give the project global visibility and liquidity. Each of these milestones represents a direct pathway for accelerating both adoption and token value. Why MUTM stands out in today’s market With crypto investing often dominated by established names that already carry large valuations, finding the next undervalued project is the challenge. Unlike other projects that have already matured, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at a stage where investor entry is still early. This combination of strong presale traction, innovative mechanics, and clear growth catalysts sets it apart as one of the most compelling stories in digital assets. At $0.035, analysts see the token as a bargain price compared to the upside projections. For investors scanning crypto prices today, MUTM appears less as a speculative gamble and more as a calculated opportunity with a powerful design behind it. Analysts say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the cheapest cryptocurrency of the current cycle and that it could recover 120X its value by 2026. The coin combines new ideas with ease of use at a price that works for both small and large investors. With presale momentum already developing and several factors coming up, this is a good time to buy. As the rest of the market keeps asking why crypto is down, MUTM serves as a powerful reminder that there are still chances for those who see them early. At $0.035, it is not only a presale admission but also a smart way to get a piece of one of the most exciting launches in decentralized finance.

To commemorate the update, Alt.town has launched the “ValueFi Deposit Event.” With this update, $TOWN can now be freely swapped into KEY, the core point of Alt.town. KEY is used for DNA (creator token) trading and content payments, transforming $TOWN from a mere trading asset into a structurally significant utility token tied directly to platform demand. The newly launched deposit event allows users who swap $TOWN into KEY and hold their KEY on the platform to receive MILE point rewards as interest. While holding, KEY remains fully tradable and usable within the platform, with rewards maintained as long as it is not withdrawn. The total reward pool is set at approximately $10,000, designed to encourage stable holding behavior that supports long-term value growth and ecosystem stability. This update follows the August 26th listing of $TOWN on Binance Alpha, Bitget, Gate.io , and MEXC, which marked a significant milestone in Alt.town’s global expansion. Unlike many Web3 projects that focus primarily on short-term liquidity, Alt.town emphasizes a ValueFi model centered on real utility and user participation, rapidly expanding a use-case driven ecosystem for both fans and creators. Alt.town was developed by a team led by a former CTO of SM Entertainment, together with experts in content and blockchain. The platform pursues a “ValueFi” ecosystem where fans and creators grow together. At its core is the DNA tokenization system, which transforms creator IP into tradable tokens while reflecting fan engagement and creator activity in real time on-chain. Eugene, CEO of bitBLUE, commented: “This update marks a key turning point in building a real utility foundation for $TOWN.

Crypto exchange Uphold has released its weekly XRP report, covering whale behavior, Ripple’s latest moves in cross-border payments, shifts in market sentiment, and key price levels. With volatility shaping market psychology, the latest data provides a snapshot of where XRP stands as it approaches a critical price threshold. Here’s your #XRP Report for the week: Whales Accumulate Despite Volatility On-chain data shows large holders adding to their positions during dips. Analysts suggest whale accumulation could provide a base for the next rally. Ripple Expands Partnerships Ripple… pic.twitter.com/QnrqvJKL5U — Uphold (@UpholdInc) September 27, 2025 Whale Accumulation During Market Dips According to Uphold’s report , large XRP holders have continued to increase their positions despite recent volatility. On-chain data indicates that whales are taking advantage of market dips to accumulate more XRP. Analysts interpret this activity as potentially laying the groundwork for future price stability, suggesting that large-scale accumulation often provides a stronger base for upward movement. While short-term traders remain cautious, the buying activity among major holders underscores confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. Ripple’s Expanding Partnerships Another key highlight in the update is Ripple’s announcement of new integrations with important cross-border payment providers. These partnerships continue to strengthen the role of XRP in global settlement systems . By extending its network, Ripple is positioning XRP as a functional tool within the international payment infrastructure. These steps emphasize the ongoing development of XRP’s practical utility, which some analysts argue is more significant than short-term price fluctuations. Market Sentiment and Fear Index Uphold also pointed out that market sentiment has shifted into the “fear” zone, as measured by major indicators. Traders remain divided, with some anticipating further downside risk while others interpret the correction as a typical “buy the dip” scenario. Despite the caution reflected in sentiment indexes, whale accumulation and Ripple’s business advancements suggest that optimism remains within certain segments of the market. Key Price Levels and Technical Outlook At the time of Uphold’s report, XRP was trading at $2.74 within a weekly range of $2.68 to $2.89. The report identifies $2.70 as an important support level, cautioning that a break below this zone could lead to a retest of $2.60. On the upside, $2.90 is the resistance, and breaching this level could open the path back to $3 and beyond. Overall sentiment is described as mixed, balancing whale accumulation and Ripple’s progress against broader market caution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Perspectives Reactions from the XRP community offer contrasting interpretations of the report. One user, identified as JO, expressed optimism, stating that a $3 breakout appears inevitable and that fear will not prevent upward momentum. Another commentator, Contrarian DNA, took a longer-term view, suggesting that weekly movements are less relevant than the broader vision for XRP. They argued that whales are not accumulating for minor breakouts but for XRP’s potential role as a settlement layer in the future financial system. In this perspective, Ripple’s partnerships represent steady progress toward global adoption rather than isolated announcements. With XRP consolidating near the $2.70–$2.90 range, market attention is focused on whether the token can reclaim the $3 mark in the short term. Whale accumulation and Ripple’s continued partnerships provide underlying support, while sentiment indicators reflect caution among traders. The balance between long-term adoption narratives and immediate market psychology will likely determine XRP’s next move.

ETH is now consolidating and might aim for more gains if it clears the $4,170 resistance. Ethereum remained stable above $3,820 and started a recovery wave. The price is trading above $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $4,170 and $4,200. Ethereum Price Recovers Ethereum price remained supported above the $3,820 level and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to recover above the $3,880 and $4,000 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,275 swing high to the $3,826 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,150 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,170 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,275 swing high to the $3,826 low. The first major resistance is near the $4,200 level. A clear move above the $4,200 resistance might send the price toward the $4,250 resistance. An upside break above the $4,250 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,320 resistance zone or even $4,350 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,200 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,050 level. The first major support sits near the $4,000 zone. A clear move below the $4,000 support might push the price toward the $3,920 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,880 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

52414157,https://invezz.com/?p=2902445,1759115518,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Market pullback could open doors for these 3 cryptos: MUTM, SOL, ETH",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/29/market-pullback-could-open-doors-for-these-3-cryptos-mutm-sol-eth/,"The recent crypto crash has reminded investors that downturns often bring opportunities. Market pullbacks reset inflated valuations and open the door to projects with real growth engines. For those investing in crypto with an eye on long-term adoption, this is the moment to look beyond surface-level hype and into platforms that are building future-ready infrastructure. Among the names gaining attention are Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH), each offering distinct advantages at today’s crypto prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): utility-first lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining how lending works in the decentralized world. Its dual model of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending allows users to interact with major assets like USDC and ETH through efficient smart contracts, while also enabling lending in tokens such as DOGE and FLOKI through P2P agreements. This dual approach builds both stability and flexibility into the ecosystem. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $16.5 million at a token price of $0.035, with more than 16,650 holders and over half of the allocation sold. The beta launch has given early participants the ability to explore platform features before the full release, signaling that development is matching pace with presale traction. Features like its interactive dashboard, Top 50 leaderboard, and Layer-2 integration strengthen user engagement and network efficiency. Growth for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being anchored by mechanisms that drive long-term demand. Its stablecoin system, coupled with buyback mechanics, ensures ongoing participation while strengthening token value. A $100,000 giveaway program rewards early adopters, while a 50,000 USDT bug bounty secured through CertiK highlights the project’s commitment to security and transparency. As expected, exchange listings on platforms like Binance and KuCoin move closer; the stage is set for significant exposure. Investors from Phase 1 already secured a 3.5X value gain at current pricing, and post-listing projections aim at 12x returns. These numbers underscore why many see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the strongest presale opportunity available during this market pullback. Solana (SOL): speed and momentum Solana (SOL) continues to be recognized for its impressive transaction speed and ability to process high-volume activity at low costs. Over the past cycles, this performance positioned it as a top-tier blockchain and attracted a growing ecosystem of developers. However, despite these strengths, Solana (SOL)’s growth story is beginning to face challenges from newer projects with broader utility layers, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Investors who benefited from earlier price rallies in Solana (SOL) are now exploring diversification opportunities, and the current crypto crash makes this an opportune time to rebalance with tokens offering stronger upside at entry-level prices. Ethereum (ETH): resilient yet slower growth Ethereum (ETH) remains the most established smart contract platform in the market. Its ecosystem supports thousands of decentralized applications and continues to grow with upgrades that improve scalability. As the foundational blockchain for decentralized finance, it carries immense credibility and resilience even during pullbacks. However, Ethereum (ETH)’s growth curve is steadier compared to emerging projects, making it a safer but slower option for those investing in crypto today. While ETH is a long-term hold for stability, its room for explosive returns is narrower compared to what presale tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are currently offering. The bottom line When the market pulls back, it’s the perfect time to find assets that are worth less than they are. Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) are both good candidates for any diversified crypto portfolio, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because it has a unique mix of usefulness, quick acceptance through its presale, and a clear plan for listings and feature rollouts. Investors are looking at startups that have working models and strong incentives for adoption because crypto values are falling. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that is well-positioned to lead the next recovery phase since it includes new lending mechanics, solid security standards, and activities that are good for investors.

52414159,https://invezz.com/?p=2902494,1759115676,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"ETH down 4%, so whales wonder what’s the best crypto to invest for early ETH like gains",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/29/eth-down-4-so-whales-wonder-whats-the-best-crypto-to-invest-for-early-eth-like-gains/,"Ethereum (ETH)’s recent 4% weekly dip has caught the attention of whale investors looking for the next big crypto with ETH-style upside. Early ETH investors saw monumental gains when the token was still trading below $1, and today’s market presents an opportunity for whales to seek similar high-utility projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a platform positioned to deliver comparable returns, combining decentralized finance, dual lending pools, and innovative stablecoin mechanics. With its presale momentum and upcoming beta launch, MUTM offers a structured path for both yield-focused and growth-oriented investors. ETH down 4% weekly Ethereum (ETH) fell about 4% over the past week, and this mark has reached up to 10% now, underscoring rising pressure and weakening momentum in the altcoin space. The slide comes amid broad crypto market volatility and macro uncertainty, with many investors liquidating leveraged positions and rotating out of risk assets. ETH also dipped below the $4,000 mark (now around that level)—an important technical level—adding to bearish sentiment. Over the same period, spot ETF outflows have intensified, contributing to downward pressure on price. Unless ETH can reclaim support quickly, the risk of further losses toward deeper support zones remains elevated. Presale snapshot and lending mechanics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in its Phase 6 presale, raising around $16.50 million with over 16,650 holders securing their tokens. The current price sits at $0.035, and half of the 170 million token supply for this phase is already claimed. Phase 7 is set at $0.04, reflecting a 15% increase, creating a strong incentive for early buyers. The platform has undergone a CertiK audit, achieving a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00, reinforcing its credibility. With a growing social presence of 12,000+ Twitter followers, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 ongoing giveaway for ten winners, MUTM demonstrates both transparency and community engagement. The P2C lending model offers whales a chance to generate predictable yields while retaining their core assets. For example, a whale depositing $50,000 worth of BTC receives mtBTC tokens representing their pool share. With an average APY of 12%, that investor earns $6,000 annually without selling any BTC. These mtBTC tokens can also be staked or used as collateral to borrow other assets, providing flexible financial leverage while keeping exposure to BTC intact. Stablecoin pools like USDT and USDC serve as a foundation for long-term liquidity, making MUTM a reliable option for sustained yield generation. Borrowers also benefit from leveraging high-quality crypto. A trader pledging $2,000 in SOL can borrow $1,300 in USDT at a 65% LTV, enabling them to reinvest in other opportunities while preserving SOL exposure. This approach combines capital efficiency with risk management, highlighting MUTM’s structured lending environment. P2P lending caters to more speculative assets like SHIB and PEPE. While riskier, these pools allow lenders to earn higher yields by isolating volatility from the main lending pools. This separation ensures that P2C liquidity remains stable while offering users the chance to participate in higher-reward opportunities, balancing risk and reward across the platform. Collateral and liquidation policies are carefully designed to maintain solvency. Stable assets like BTC and ETH enjoy higher LTVs of 70–75%, while more volatile coins such as DOGE have restricted LTVs around 40%. Liquidation triggers and the platform’s stability factor safeguard the protocol, ensuring lenders and borrowers remain protected against market swings. Future catalysts and ETH-like growth Investors in Phase 1 who allocated $10,000 when MUTM traded at $0.01 now see their holdings valued at $35,000 at Phase 6’s $0.035 price. With the official listing projected at $0.06, that investment will rise to $60,000, and the platform’s $1 per token target by 2026 translates to a $1 million valuation. For Phase 6 investors purchasing at $0.035, the expected upside is around 28X, demonstrating a compressed ETH-style growth curve. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to interact with the dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard, enabling investors to monitor their holdings, calculate ROI, and compete for bonus tokens. This access experience is expected to drive engagement and broaden the user base, pushing MUTM demand higher. Layer-2 integration will enhance transaction efficiency, drastically lowering costs compared to Layer-1 networks and allowing high-frequency lending and borrowing with minimal friction. Combined with stablecoin pools and mtToken mechanics, this setup ensures that MUTM will maintain robust utility, offering both liquidity and real-world use cases. Expected listings on major exchanges like KuCoin and Kraken will make the token more visible and available to more people. The adoption rate is expected to speed up as more people use the platform’s lending and borrowing features. This will lead to higher demand for tokens and make MUTM one of the best presale opportunities of 2025. MUTM offers controlled growth with measured returns for investors who want to know if crypto is a smart investment in today’s volatile market. While the news is full with stories about the crypto crash and other crypto predictions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming the presale project that strikes the right combination between security, utility, and price upside.

The poll, which was conducted between August 22 and September 11, 2025, gathered responses from 2,549 participants. It found that while a majority lean positive, a significant minority remains wary of how Wall Street and traditional finance may reshape the asset. Wall Street vs. Decentralization Overall, 60% of respondents said mainstream adoption, including developments such as spot ETFs, corporate treasuries holding Bitcoin, and government accumulation, is positive for Bitcoin. Within this group, 41.4% described the trend as “very positive,” and cited greater legitimacy and long-term price potential, while 18.6% felt “positive” but expressed less enthusiasm. Another 19.4% of participants were neutral. However, 20.5% voiced concerns that Bitcoin’s expansion into traditional finance could compromise its core principles. This group included 12.7% who see mainstream adoption as “very negative.” They warned that decentralization and censorship resistance may be weakened. Meanwhile, 7.8% were “negative” but less strongly opposed. The skepticism was most pronounced among first-cycle investors, who experienced their first crypto market cycle. Among these newcomers, 29.3% viewed mainstream adoption as negative or very harmful, roughly double the 14.9% rate recorded among second-cycle participants and 15.7% among those in their third cycle or beyond. On the other hand, only 52.0% of first-cycle participants felt positive or very positive about Bitcoin’s mainstream momentum, compared with 65.2% of second-cycle respondents and 64.4% of long-term veterans. Second-cycle participants were also the most likely to call mainstream adoption “very positive.” The findings suggest that seasoned crypto users are more comfortable with the idea of institutional involvement, while newer entrants may either lack exposure to past adoption cycles or represent speculative traders wary of Bitcoin becoming another Wall Street asset. Crypto Demographics Among the participants, CoinGecko found that 68% identified as long-term crypto investors, while 20% described themselves as short-term traders. Builders made up 7% of the group, and 5% were sidelined spectators observing the market without active participation. In terms of experience, 38% were navigating their first market cycle with up to three years in crypto, 41% were in their second cycle spanning four to seven years, and 21% were seasoned veterans with over eight years of involvement. Geographically, respondents were concentrated in Europe, which accounted for 31% of participants, followed by Asia at 26% and North America at 22%. The remaining participants were spread across Africa, South America, and Oceania.

His decision reshapes the city’s mayoral race only weeks before the November vote. Adams announced the withdrawal in a video posted to X on Sunday. “Despite all we’ve achieved, I cannot continue my re-election campaign,” he said, pointing to the Campaign Finance Board’s decision to deny him public matching funds. The loss of those funds, combined with constant questions about his next move, made his position untenable, he said. https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1972348511892262962 Mamdani Holds Double-Digit Lead As Race Narrows Polls had shown Adams trailing badly in a crowded field. Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani has consistently led by double digits, with former governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, also in the race. Strategists say Adams’ exit could tighten the contest between Mamdani and Cuomo, though Mamdani remains the frontrunner. Pressure for Adams to step aside had been mounting. Party officials and donors worried that his presence would split moderate Democratic support, all but ensuring Mamdani’s victory. His campaign never gained traction, with his polling numbers slipping to single digits in recent months. Sliwa, meanwhile, has insisted he will stay in the race despite polling slightly ahead of Adams. His continued presence leaves the possibility of further vote splitting in November. Adams Earned ‘Bitcoin Mayor’ Title With Crypto Paycheck Stunt Adams, who took office in Jan. 2022, quickly made a national name for himself as one of the most pro-crypto politicians in America. He famously converted his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum , a symbolic move that earned him the nickname “Bitcoin Mayor.” He pledged to make New York the “global capital of cryptocurrency,” pushing blockchain integration in city services. His proposals included using blockchain for municipal recordkeeping, allowing residents to pay fines and taxes in crypto, and even issuing Bitcoin-backed municipal bonds. Critics, including City Comptroller Brad Lander, warned such ideas carried financial risks. Despite the skepticism, Adams became a fixture in the digital assets scene. He courted industry leaders such as Galaxy Digital’s Michael Novogratz for fundraising, spoke at major conferences like Permissionless and Bitcoin 2023, and lobbied for regulatory reforms. He often contrasted his stance with that of Andrew Cuomo, accusing the former governor of dismantling the industry through hostile policies. Crypto Community Loses One Of Its Political Advocates Disclosures suggested Adams’ personal crypto holdings were modest by late 2023. Still, his willingness to champion digital assets distinguished him from other national figures and reinforced New York’s ambitions in the sector. In May, he launched a digital assets advisory council aimed at bringing fintech jobs and investment to Manhattan. The move was part of a broader effort to align the city with federal progress on stablecoin rules and market structure legislation. Adams’ exit leaves New York politics without one of crypto’s most outspoken champions in elected office. For an industry that once looked to the mayor as a high-profile ally, the November election will determine whether City Hall continues to embrace digital assets or takes a more cautious path.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of those standouts, with its Phase 6 presale already 50% sold out. At a price of $0.035, the project has raised over $16.50 million and welcomed more than 16,650 holders. Phase 7 will increase the token price to $0.040, a 15% rise, showing that investors entering today are locking in a clear discount before the next leg up. Analysts project that buyers in this round are positioning for 350% gains even before the bull run fully resumes. A framework built on risk management and stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not simply another addition to the growing list of crypto coins. It is a decentralized lending protocol designed with multiple safety mechanisms to protect users and sustain long-term growth. The system is structured around overcollateralized borrowing, ensuring loans are backed by more value than borrowed, while automated liquidation triggers and penalty fees maintain stability if collateral values fall. Liquidators are incentivized to restore balance through discounted repayments, creating constant pressure toward systemic health. A key differentiator is its oracle strategy, which aggregates Chainlink feeds, fallback oracles, and time-weighted on-chain data. This ensures borrowers and lenders always interact with fair and tamper-resistant price information, reducing the risk of manipulation that plagues many DeFi platforms. Alongside this, borrow caps and Restricted Collateralization Mode limit the exposure of risky assets, so volatile tokens do not compromise the safety of the entire system. A reserve factor applied to each asset also feeds income into the treasury, which in turn will support platform sustainability. Unlike unchecked DeFi protocols that expose participants to systemic fragility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a structure where every component—whether liquidation penalties or collateral ratios—works together to safeguard investor capital. This emphasis on capital protection and controlled risk makes the platform more attractive during times of uncertainty, reinforcing why investing in crypto through structured protocols can outperform sentiment-driven alternatives. Security, roadmap, and investor upside Beyond its mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is securing investor confidence with external validation and community-focused measures. The project has undergone a CertiK audit, scoring 90.00 in Token Scan and 79.00 in Skynet assessments, demonstrating a commitment to robust code standards. Complementing this, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivizes ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities, while a $100,000 giveaway rewards and energizes its growing community. These steps underline a transparent approach rarely seen in newer crypto coins. The roadmap is equally compelling. Phase 2 focuses on core contract and infrastructure development, while Phase 3 is set to bring beta testing and functional demos. By Phase 4, the platform will go live, with MUTM token listings, claim activation, and multi-chain expansion. Each stage provides investors with tangible milestones that align with price growth and adoption momentum. The outcomes speak for themselves for investors who are keeping an eye on returns. At the current presale pricing, a Phase 1 allotment of $10,000 at $0.01 has already increased to $35,000, which is a 250% increase. People who buy in Phase 6 for $0.035 should see their worth rise by 350% before the bull cycle picks up speed again. This illustrates that making smart early investments in structured initiatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can lead to big profits even before the market as a whole starts to rise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting itself up as the uncommon presale token that offers strong security, long-lasting mechanics, and actual safety for investors. While other people chase after short-lived buzz, this project is showing that the best places to invest in crypto are platforms that create demand on purpose. With 50% of Phase 6 already sold, the chance to get tokens at a discount is running out quickly. This makes MUTM one of the best buys before the next bull run starts.

As major players rebalance, attention is moving away from the giants and toward undervalued altcoins that combine utility, scalability, and a low entry price. In this environment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out as a project priced at only $0.035 in presale, with analysts confident it will be the next crypto to break past the $1 mark by 2026. While large tokens fluctuate with crypto ETF flows, investors are hunting early opportunities with higher growth potential, and MUTM is emerging as a top candidate. BTC & ETH ETFs see $509M outflow Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs have reportedly seen a combined $509 million outflow, signaling that investors are pulling capital out of crypto exposure. Such outflows often reflect risk-off sentiment, portfolio rebalancing, or diminished confidence in near-term upside. In practice, large withdrawals from BTC/ETH ETFs can exacerbate price weakness because funds must sell underlying assets to meet redemptions, adding downward pressure. The move also suggests that “fast money” — traders using ETFs for shorter-term plays — may be turning cautious, focusing less on long-term conviction and more on liquidity and macro signals. Unless inflows resume, the persistent outflows could indicate a phase of underperformance or sideways trading for BTC and ETH, especially if broader markets stay volatile or interest rates remain uncertain. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): a next-gen lending model for broad adoption Momentum in the presale demonstrates that demand is building rapidly. Phase 6 has raised over $16.5 million, with more than 16,650 holders participating so far. At the current price of $0.035, half of the 170 million tokens allocated for this round are already sold. With Phase 7 set to push the price up by 15% to $0.040, investors are recognizing that this is the last chance to secure a discounted entry. An active community of more than 12,000 Twitter followers further amplifies awareness, fueling urgency to participate before wider exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to reshape decentralized finance with its dual lending system. The Peer-to-Contract model focuses on stablecoins and established assets like ETH and BTC, offering reliable liquidity and steady yields. In parallel, the Peer-to-Peer system will open lending for higher-risk tokens, where borrowers and lenders can negotiate terms while keeping risks isolated. This dual design provides flexibility across different risk appetites, ensuring that both conservative and adventurous participants will find a place in the ecosystem. Security and trust are equally important for growth, and MUTM has already undergone a full CertiK audit. The audit included manual review and static analysis, resulting in a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. For investors concerned about contract vulnerabilities, these results add an extra layer of confidence in the platform’s foundation. Catalysts set to drive the $1 breakthrough Multiple catalysts are aligning to position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for significant demand growth once it lists publicly. The upcoming beta launch will allow users to test real features before the token hits exchanges. Investors are already able to explore the lending and borrowing system, a dedicated ROI dashboard, and a Top 50 leaderboard where participants earn bonus rewards. This gamified environment not only creates engagement but also establishes token demand even before full rollout. The integration of a Layer-2 network will dramatically improve speed and reduce transaction costs compared to operating on Layer-1 alone. This efficiency will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a more attractive option for frequent borrowing and lending, driving sustained volume on the platform. With smoother transactions, users will engage more often, feeding a cycle of adoption and liquidity growth. Another major milestone is the launch of a decentralized stablecoin. Minted through overcollateralized loans, this $1-pegged asset will strengthen ecosystem activity by enabling borrowing, repayments, and on-chain liquidity that feeds back into MUTM demand. This feature adds practical utility, setting the project apart from tokens that lack real-world application. Exchange visibility will also amplify growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to list on major platforms such as Binance and MEXC. These listings will bring access to global investors, raise liquidity, and make it easier for traders to enter and exit positions. With strong exchange support, the market will gain greater confidence in evaluating MUTM’s fundamentals, likely pushing the price upward in line with bullish crypto predictions. The need to act is stronger than ever. Half of the Phase 6 tokens have already been sold, and prices will go up by 15% in Phase 7. Investors who wait will miss out on the best chance to buy in. Retail traders and institutional investors who are moving away from BTC and ETH ETFs are finding that MUTM offers not just a lower entry point, but also an ecosystem that encourages ongoing participation and long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a lot going for it, including new ways to lend money, smart contracts backed by security, a successful presale, gamified dashboards, Layer-2 efficiency, decentralized stablecoin usefulness, and forthcoming Tier-1 exchange listings. These linked factors are why analysts think MUTM will be the next cryptocurrency to hit $1 by 2026. This initiative gives you the chance to change your portfolio in a big way at a time when crypto values are going up and down, and regular ETF flows are changing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the clear choice for investors who are ready to act.

52415031,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84531,1759118409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Investing in Small-Cap Altcoins: What You Need to Know,https://timestabloid.com/investing-in-small-cap-altcoins-what-you-need-to-know/,"The cryptocurrency market has always been a place of rapid shifts, especially when it comes to small-cap altcoins. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the spotlight, investors eager for bigger gains often turn to tokens with lower market caps. One example is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has been on a tear lately, breaking records and drawing attention from retailers. Experts suggest exponential growth could follow once it makes its way onto major exchanges. Small-cap coins don’t always get the same coverage as the industry giants, but they can present unique opportunities. Since they are earlier in their growth cycles, investors who discover them before the wider market often see the most upside. At the same time, these projects come with higher risks, making careful evaluation essential. Why Small-Cap Altcoins Matter These tokens typically have much smaller market valuations compared to top assets like Bitcoin or Solana. Their limited size gives them the potential for outsized growth when adoption expands or when listings occur on major exchanges. Many of today’s largest cryptocurrencies started as small-caps, which is why investors continue scanning for the next breakout. The attraction lies in the possibility of sharp gains. Unlike large-cap coins that may move gradually, small-caps can deliver fast price surges if momentum builds. This speculative edge is what keeps traders and early adopters focused on them. Balancing Risk and Reward The same qualities that make small-caps appealing also make them risky. They tend to be more volatile, have less liquidity, and can collapse if they fail to deliver on promises. For this reason, experienced investors usually dedicate only part of their portfolio to them while holding stronger assets as a foundation. Research is key. Looking into the development team, the uniqueness of the technology, the size of the community, and whether the project has undergone audits can help separate serious contenders from risky bets. Transparency and consistent progress are usually the strongest signs of long-term viability. A New Breakout Opportunity One project standing out in this space is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its presale has shattered milestones, with demand outpacing supply as new participants rush in. The project’s audited framework, combined with a fast-growing community, has made it one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025. Analysts highlight that early participants could see exponential upside once the token lists on top-tier exchanges. Momentum around MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn comparisons to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. While nothing is guaranteed, its growth trajectory so far shows all the hallmarks of a coin positioned to surprise the market. Drivers Behind Small-Cap Growth There are common factors that tend to spark rallies in small-cap tokens: Community strength, as engaged supporters boost visibility. Exchange listings, which open liquidity and drive awareness. Real-world utility or unique features that set a project apart. Partnerships with established players that build credibility. Transparent audits and clear roadmaps that strengthen trust. Projects hitting these milestones often see momentum snowball into broader adoption. Market Context This surge in small-cap interest comes as the wider crypto market holds steady despite global uncertainty. Institutions continue to focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, while retail investors seek higher-risk plays with bigger upside. This dynamic has historically set the stage for smaller tokens to shine, especially during altcoin seasons that follow Bitcoin-led rallies. If 2025 plays out like previous cycles, the spotlight on small-caps could intensify. In that case, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are well placed to benefit as liquidity flows into newer tokens. Smart Ways to Approach For investors considering entry, risk management is critical. Allocating only a portion of a portfolio to these projects helps capture growth potential without overexposure. Diversification across multiple small-caps rather than going all in on one is another way to reduce risk. Patience also matters. Many small-cap investors have seen their biggest wins by holding through volatility while sticking to projects that keep delivering on their promises. Conclusion Small-cap altcoins remain one of the most exciting opportunities in crypto. They carry higher risk, but for those who research carefully and manage exposure, the rewards can be significant. In this landscape, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a clear frontrunner, smashing records and positioning itself for exponential gains once it lists on major exchanges. As the market cycle evolves, investors looking for the next breakout story should keep a close eye on this corner of crypto.

In a video captioned in his latest tweet, he examined the similarities between past and present price movements and explained why the short and mid-term outlook could be setting up a major breakout. According to StephIsCrypto, XRP bottomed in June 2025 before rallying 92% to a July peak, almost identical to the 93% surge from June to August 2020. They noted that the correction following July’s peak, which has so far seen a 26% decline, also aligns closely with the timeline of 2020, when XRP bottomed in late September. With today’s market in a similar condition to the 2020 pattern, the analyst argued that XRP may already have found its floor for this phase. Most People Don't Realize What's About To Hit #XRP ! (Price Prediction) pic.twitter.com/anzvXmnPJM — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 27, 2025 Short-Term Expectations and Possible Rally The video further broke down how the 2020 cycle unfolded after September. At that time, XRP consolidated sideways for about two weeks before launching a 252% rally beginning in early November. If the same trajectory repeats, StephIsCrypto projected that XRP could move sideways into early November before making another explosive move upward. By applying the same percentage increase from the last cycle, the analyst outlined that XRP could potentially approach the $10 level during this phase. They also cautioned, however, that just as in 2020, such a rally could be short-lived, followed by a steep correction. In the earlier cycle, XRP lost around 78% of its value shortly after that November run. While not predicting an identical outcome, StephIsCrypto highlighted the importance of being prepared for similar volatility. Technical and Sentiment Indicators Beyond price comparisons, StephIsCrypto noted that technical signals are also lining up with past cycles. Specifically, the 50-day simple moving average on the three-day timeframe is currently in the same position seen before major rallies in 2014, 2020, and 2024. This alignment adds weight to the possibility of a significant move in October or November. The analyst also examined market sentiment using tools such as Google Trends and the crypto fear and greed index. They explained that while prices are making higher highs, retail interest is forming lower highs compared to last December. This divergence, in their view, suggests the market could be closer to the end of the cycle rather than the beginning, echoing patterns observed in previous XRP runs . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Lower social media engagement and reduced retail participation were cited as further signs of waning momentum that could eventually lead to a larger correction. Going Forward StephIsCrypto emphasized that XRP appears to be tracking its historical cycle with notable precision. They see the most likely outcome as a significant rally in November, though they acknowledged that October could also provide upside potential. At the same time, they urged caution, saying that if history rhymes, a major correction could follow any near-term surge. For now, their analysis indicates that XRP is at a critical point, with the coming weeks likely to define whether the asset reaches new highs or faces another period of retracement.

The price now faces a couple of key hurdles near $2.880 and $2.920. XRP price is slowly moving higher above the $2.80 support zone. The price is now trading above $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.80 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.920. XRP Price Dips Eyes Upside Break XRP price found support near $2.70 and recently started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.780 and $2.80 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.995 swing high to the $2.70 low. However, the price is now facing hurdles near $2.88. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.80 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.88 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.995 swing high to the $2.70 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.920 level. A clear move above the $2.920 resistance might send the price toward the $2.9880 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.020 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.050. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.880 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.820 level. The next major support is near the $2.80 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.80 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.720. The next major support sits near the $2.70 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.80 and $2.720.

It reminds me of Solana in the earlier days, and Solana has proven its worth and is, you know, there with the big boys,” Wood said during a recent interview on the Master Investor podcast. Wood explained that while ARK Invest has not disclosed any holdings in Hyperliquid, the protocol’s growth is one she is closely monitoring. Her comments come at a time when competition among perpetual futures decentralized exchanges (DEXs) is intensifying. Aster, another player in the space, launched its token earlier this month and has already seen its trading volume and open interest surpass Hyperliquid’s. ARK Invest’s Focus on Core Assets ARK Invest currently maintains exposure to three major cryptocurrencies across its public funds: Bitcoin (BTC $111,777), Ethereum (ETH $4,118), and Solana (SOL $210.18). Wood noted that the firm’s Solana exposure is connected to Breera Sports, which is tied to the Solana treasury and backed by Middle Eastern investors. She added that economist Art Laffer has advisory links to the project. While the fund has diversified into some derivative protocols like Uniswap and Solana-related markets, Wood stressed that its core focus remains narrow by design. “If you’re talking about the big boys or girls, those are the big three right now,” she said. Bitcoin’s Enduring Dominance Despite the explosion of tokens and new protocols, Wood argued that the long-term future of crypto belongs to a select group of networks. “We don’t think there are going to be very many cryptocurrencies,” she said. “Bitcoin owns the cryptocurrency space when it comes to pure crypto.” Wood emphasized Bitcoin’s role as a monetary system with a fixed supply and resilience, contrasting it with Ethereum’s role powering decentralized finance. She also noted the growing importance of stablecoins but reiterated that Bitcoin remains central to ARK’s long-term thesis. Retail and Quant Traders Drive DEX Growth According to Bitget Wallet’s chief marketing officer Jamie Elkaleh, decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid are seeing a surge in activity from retail traders and semi-professional quants. Incentives such as airdrops, low fees, and fast execution are helping drive this shift. Institutions, however, still prefer centralized exchanges for their fiat access, compliance, and brokerage support. Yet the performance gap between DEXs and CEXs is narrowing, with order-book platforms such as Hyperliquid and dYdX v4 now offering execution speeds and liquidity previously limited to centralized venues.",Crypto News Today|DeFi,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BTC|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-29 04:21:52

On Saturday evening, South Korea’s National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac stated clearly during an interview on Channel A News television that his country cannot deliver $350 billion in cash. “It is objectively and realistically not a level we are able to handle,” Wi said, emphasizing that “our position is not a negotiating tactic.” Wi’s remarks followed Trump’s characterization of the investment commitments secured from Japan and South Korea as “up front” payments. Seoul and Washington reached an agreement in July promising an investment of $350 billion included in wider trade arrangement to reduce US tariffs from 25% to 15%. However, the two nations remain at odds over how the payment structure should work. Japan has made a similar commitment worth $550 billion, though details about how it will be carried out remain vague. Information that has surfaced about the arrangement has caused alarm among officials in Seoul. Last week, South Korea’s Prime Minister Kim Min-seok told Bloomberg News that without a deal of currency swap with the US, the investment might inflict severe harm on the country’s economy. The $350 billion amount equals more than 80% of South Korea’s foreign currency holdings. Japan also expressed reservations about their $550 billion US investment arrangement over the weekend. Sanae Takaichi, a top contender to lead Japan’s ruling party, indicated that revisiting the trade deal with the US might be an option if it fails to serve Japan’s interests. Speaking on Sunday about the investment fund, Takaichi said Japan must not back down if any aspects of the deal’s implementation prove unfavorable or unjust to the country, and “that includes a potential renegotiation.” Washington prefers cash over loans According to reports, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has informed South Korean officials that Washington wants the investment in cash instead of loans. Wi indicated the government is looking at other options and remains hopeful about achieving progress during the upcoming meeting between the two leaders at the APEC Summit in Gyeongju next month. In a related matter, Korea’s Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol informed reporters on Saturday that he has completed discussions with the US on foreign exchange issues and will announce specifics soon. A presidential official later clarified that Koo’s comments relate to the US Treasury’s report on currency policies of its major trading partners. Japan’s investment mechanism remains murky In Japan, the Asian country has accepted the $550 billion investment arrangement as part of an agreement with the US to lower tariffs on Japanese exports to 15%, but the funding mechanism remains unclear. A memorandum of understanding the both countries signed at the start of September indicated that once Trump has picked investment projects for Japan to finance, the country has 45 business days to come up with the funds. The sum must be deposited into the account or accounts designated by the US in dollars. However, Japan’s chief trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa has since maintained that JBIC and NEXI, the two organizations primarily responsible for funding the investments, will not provide money for projects that do not benefit Japan. Akazawa said he does not anticipate the investment mechanism will significantly impact Japan’s government finances because it will be executed according to existing laws that govern JBIC and NEXI. The Japanese trade negotiator has previously contended that only 1-2% of the $550 billion mechanism will be actual investment, with the remainder consisting of loans and loan guarantees. The LDP is scheduled to hold a vote for its next leader on Oct. 4.

The post , published on September 28, featured an image showing the number of accounts across various XRP balance ranges. It reported that the average amount of XRP held per wallet is “12,350.86 $XRP.” Like the XRP rich list , this table provides key insight into token distribution among wallets, breaking down accounts by balance categories, starting from wallets with zero to 20 XRP and rising to a small group of wallets with over 1 billion XRP. 5 wallets fall into the highest category, collectively holding more than 7.4 billion XRP. Other segments show that 22 wallets each have between 500 million and one billion XRP, while 58 wallets hold between 100 million and 500 million XRP. The average amount of #XRP per wallet, is 12,350.86 $XRP . pic.twitter.com/hD39nOOd2l — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) September 28, 2025 Average Holding Value at Current Market Price XRP is currently trading at $2.81, which means the reported average of 12,350.86 XRP per wallet equals about $34,700. This average value also sits far above the 1,000 XRP threshold , which many experts have set as the minimum investment for everyone serious about XRP. However, the image also reveals that most wallets fall on the lower end of the scale. There are over 1.3 million wallets with 20 XRP or less, and more than 2.3 million wallets holding between 20 and 500 XRP. These numbers suggest that the large sums in the top tiers contribute significantly to the calculated average. The XRP ecosystem is known for significant whale activity , and the concentration in a small number of large wallets creates a significant skew in the average. The table clearly shows the steep drop-off in holdings outside of the top categories.

One user questioned whether the average accurately reflects typical XRP holders, noting that many wallets reportedly contain only small amounts, often between 1 and 100 XRP. Another commenter found it surprising that wallets holding between 100 and 500 XRP outnumber those in the 75 to 100 XRP range, suggesting this group includes more than just retail traders, and hinting at potential institutional involvement . Others expressed doubt about the calculation itself, with one commenter suggesting the math may not align with their expectations for an average figure.

SOL price is now attempting to recover from $192 and faces hurdles near $215. SOL price started a fresh decline below $225 and $220 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $200 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another decline if it stays below $215 and $220. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price failed to stay above $220 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL traded below the $212 and $205 support levels to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. A low was formed at $191 and the price recently started a recovery wave above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $242 swing high to the $191 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $200 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there are more gains, the price could face resistance near the $212 level. The next major resistance is near the $215 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $242 swing high to the $191 low. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $230. Any more gains might send the price toward the $242 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $215 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $202 zone. The first major support is near the $200 level. A break below the $200 level might send the price toward the $192 support zone. If there is a close below the $192 support, the price could decline toward the $180 support in the near term.

Ethereum (ETH), despite recent setbacks, remains the perfect example of how patience and conviction rewarded early believers with extraordinary returns. During its formative stages, ETH traded for cents before transforming into a pillar of the market. In today’s downturn, retail investors are once again seeking that kind of ETH-like trajectory, and analysts are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the project that mirrors the same early fundamentals with innovative features like dual lending pools and a governance-backed stablecoin. Lending and stablecoin innovation reshaping crypto investment At this stage, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in its presale, which has already raised over $16.5 million. Phase 6 is 50% sold, with tokens priced at $0.035. The price will move next to $0.040, creating a 15% jump for those who secure their entry before the next round begins. Just as ETH’s earliest supporters multiplied their portfolios before it broke out, retail investors now have a chance to get in while MUTM is still undervalued and positioned for its next price lift. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building its foundation around a dual lending system that combines peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models. This allows retail traders to unlock liquidity while holding onto their long-term assets. For example, depositing $1,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) as collateral will allow borrowing up to 75% of that value, giving users liquidity without sacrificing exposure to future ETH gains. On the lending side, participants can contribute assets like $10,000 worth of ADA into the system and receive mtADA, a token that represents their deposit plus interest. This not only generates passive income but also strengthens the overall pool liquidity, benefiting both lenders and borrowers. The other pillar of the platform will be its decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1. Unlike volatile assets that swing with the market, this stablecoin is designed to maintain value through governance-driven interest rates and arbitrage opportunities. If the stablecoin drifts from its peg, borrowing rates will be adjusted to pull it back in line. Arbitrage traders will also have the incentive to restore equilibrium, ensuring stability across the platform. Overcollateralized loans and automatic liquidations will keep the system solvent and secure, removing risks associated with unbacked models that failed in the past. To support these mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate Chainlink price feeds as the primary oracle system. Additional fallback feeds, aggregated data sources, and decentralized exchange TWAPs will further reinforce price accuracy. This multi-layered price discovery design makes sure collateral values and liquidation events remain fair and transparent. Building momentum through buybacks, roadmap, and security Beyond its lending and stablecoin design, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built a token economy that continuously strengthens demand. Users of mtTokens will have the ability to stake them in smart contracts, earning MUTM rewards on top of their interest income. Revenue generated by the platform will also be used for open-market buybacks of MUTM, which will then be redistributed to stakers. This creates a feedback loop where growing adoption translates directly into buying pressure and increasing value for token users. The project’s roadmap outlines a clear path from development to launch. Smart contract deployment, beta testing on testnet, and exchange listing preparations are all milestones that will be completed before the live launch. Once the platform goes live, features such as multi-chain expansion and advanced risk parameters will unlock further opportunities for growth. Each step forward will expand adoption and bring more visibility to the project. Confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is further supported by its security-first approach. The team has engaged CertiK for a full audit, ensuring smart contracts are rigorously reviewed with both manual and automated tools. A bug bounty program worth $50,000 has also been created to encourage independent developers to stress-test the system, while a $100,000 giveaway is running to reward community participation during the presale. These steps showcase a commitment to transparency and safety that strengthens investor trust. Conclusion With most people making crypto investments out of fear, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a builder with strong fundamentals that will keep its worth over time. It has overcollateralized loans, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar, solid oracles, constant buybacks, and a well-structured roadmap. All of these things make it the finest ETH-like prospect for regular investors right now. The presale price is $0.035, and the next price increase to $0.040 is coming up soon. This project offers the kind of early-stage entry that has historically led to life-changing returns. Even though the market as a whole is going down, retail is choosing to plant its flag at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for an ETH-like path.

He commented, “We now have a deeper understanding of supply shocks and structural drivers of inflation and have expanded our use of high-frequency data for more timely and granular monitoring.” He added that the bank has developed ways to gauge neutral interest rates and conduct scenario testing, leaving policymakers better prepared to maintain price stability in turbulent times. This follows New Zealand Prime Minister Christoper Luxon’s recent comment that he spoke with RBNZ Governor Christian Hawkesby about the New Zealand economy. When asked whether he wished he had encouraged a bolder move to the governor, he said, “Pretty much, yeah.” Though he noted that, “I can give my views, but I do respect the independence of the Reserve Bank under legislation.” New Zealand law includes elaborate renderings to insulate (RBNZ independence). It is unusual for a prime minister or a cabinet official to comment publicly on rate decisions. ECB President Christine Lagarde warned that political interference in monetary policy threatens to destabilize economies. RBNZ recognised it had forecast errors in the pandemic period The RBNZ has been faulted for falling behind the curve after COVID-19. Officials, nevertheless, admitted that the former dual mandate had made it harder to prioritize inflation control. Conway noted that, in retrospect, stronger action might have helped back then, but policymakers had to weigh the risk of hurting jobs given their dual mandate. He stated: “In hindsight, an earlier or more aggressive tightening might have reduced inflation sooner.” The bank’s decision to raise the official cash rate from 0.25% in October 2021 to 5.5% in May 2023 also fueled public criticism. Not to mention, the bank struggled to produce accurate forecasts during the pandemic, when unusual economic shocks threw off its models. The bank noted that private analysts and other central banks also struggled with big forecast misses during that time. Still, it argued, since November 2022, its accuracy has nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels. RBNZ also acknowledged that the scale of pandemic-era fiscal easing had a bigger impact than expected, prompting efforts to refine its fiscal analysis and deepen collaboration with Treasury. The bank said it is ensuring it can quickly deploy tools like large-scale asset purchases or negative rates should future conditions demand them. It further noted, “Over the past two decades, neutral interest rates have declined significantly, both in New Zealand and globally. This structural shift increases the likelihood that the OCR could reach its effective lower bound in future downturns.” Though it claimed that as of late 2021, the country’s major banks had the systems in place to operate under a negative cash rate. New Zealand’s economy fell 0.9% in Q2 New Zealand’s GDP contracted more than expected in the second quarter as construction shrank and global jitters sapped demand, adding to calls for beefier easing when the Reserve Bank next meets in October. Official data on Sept. 18 indicated that GDP fell 0.9% in the second quarter of 2025, three times the 0.3% drop predicted by analysts and the RBNZ. The country’s economy has shrunk in three of the last five quarters, with annual GDP falling 0.6%. The markets are now lifting their bets for OCR reductions to 58 bps, with odds of a half-point cut in October rising to 20%. Westpac’s senior economist, Michael Gordon, believes the construction, manufacturing, and professional services were the biggest drags on the economy. Nonetheless, Conway insists they are working to improve the country’s long-run economic performance. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

He argued that artificial intelligence could make equities less attractive while positioning Bitcoin as the ultimate digital-age store of value. At the same time, Samson Mow believes a wave of nation-state adoption is approaching, with a number of countries preparing to launch Strategic Bitcoin Reserves. Despite Bitcoin hovering around $110,000 and lagging behind gold and equities, both analysts see strong long-term potential, though some suggest the next major rally may be delayed until 2026. Analysts Split on Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin’s journey toward new all-time highs is unlikely to be a straight path upward. This is according to market analyst Jordi Visser, who warned that big corrections of 20% or more will be part of the process. Even as the fourth quarter is traditionally strong for crypto markets, Visser believes pullbacks are inevitable while Bitcoin builds its long-term trajectory. By drawing a comparison to Nvidia, the high-performance chipmaker that is the world’s most valuable publicly traded company with a market cap above $4 trillion, Visser pointed out that massive rallies often come with equally sharp corrections along the way. Nvidia’s meteoric rise of over 1,000% since the launch of ChatGPT less than three years ago included at least five separate corrections of 20% or more, yet the stock still managed to set new record highs. Visser suggested Bitcoin will follow a similar pattern as part of what he calls the “AI trade.” According to his view, artificial intelligence will reshape the global economy, replacing human labor and disrupting traditional industries. This shift could weaken the long-term value of many established companies, making equities less attractive to investors. In such a scenario, Bitcoin will stand out as the ultimate store of value for the digital era by offering an alternative to depreciating fiat currencies and underperforming stocks. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Still, Bitcoin’s price performance over the past few months caused some debate among analysts and investors. While gold and equities are climbing to fresh highs, Bitcoin is trading near $110,000, which is roughly 11% below its record of more than $123,000. People are split on whether Q4 could drive BTC toward $140,000 or if the latest pullback signals the early stages of a deeper correction, which could potentially drag prices as low as $60,000. The lack of movement on proposals for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve also tempered optimism. Some analysts anticipated that such a reserve , built through regular government purchases, could drive huge demand for BTC in 2025, but the absence of progress has left investors a bit more cautious. Nation-State Bitcoin FOMO is Near Although the US strategic Bitcoin reserve is taking a bit longer than expected, Bitcoin adoption among nation-states could accelerate much faster than many expect. This is according to Jan3 founder Samson Mow. On the What Bitcoin Did podcast, Mow said that the world may be at the tipping point where gradual progress suddenly shifts into a wave of rapid adoption. He believes it is only a matter of time before a surge of countries embrace Bitcoin as part of their national strategies, and described it as a potential “nation-state FOMO.” A key driver of this narrative is the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which would see governments formally hold and accumulate BTC. Mow also said that although US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish such a reserve, the US has yet to begin purchasing. Still, he explained that the country is advancing its plans through budget-neutral acquisition proposals and the Bitcoin Act. Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn also suggested that a US reserve could materialize before the end of the year. However, Mow warned that the US risks being front-run by other countries, like Pakistan, if it delays purchases. The US currently holds 198,012 Bitcoin, according to Bitbo data , the largest sovereign holding of any government. Mow said he is particularly bullish on Latin America, where he expects major Bitcoin-related developments to emerge. The notion of governments and sovereign wealth funds holding Bitcoin has been gaining a lot of momentum throughout 2025. Fidelity Digital Assets predicted earlier this year that more nation-states and central banks would establish strategic positions in the cryptocurrency, which only adds credibility to the idea of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price has not delivered the explosive move higher that many anticipated. Mow admitted he expected a massive rally by now but suggested this cycle may simply be delayed until next year. Others in the industry share this outlook, including Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who recently predicted 2026 will be an “up year.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-29 05:30:00

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Doha-based QNB will use JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments system, allowing its business clients in Qatar to settle dollar payments in minutes and at any time of the week. Traditional rails often take several days and operate only on weekdays. Corporate clients are increasingly demanding faster and more reliable cross-border payments, Kamel Moris, executive vice president of transactional banking at QNB, told the outlet. “Now we can have a 24/7 service window, we can guarantee payments as fast as in two minutes,” he said. “It’s a treasurer’s dream.” According to Bloomberg, Qatar National Bank (QNB Group) has adopted JPMorgan’s blockchain platform to process US dollar corporate payments for its Qatar-based bank. With the integration of JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments system, QNB can now handle USD payments for local… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 29, 2025 QNB didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Faster, Cheaper Settlements Seen As Key To Attract Global Capital The move places QNB among a growing group of Gulf banks turning to global partners like JPMorgan to modernize payments. The region, which has long relied on oil-linked wealth and dollar liquidity, is now seeking to strengthen its financial infrastructure to support diversification strategies and attract global investors. Faster and cheaper settlement systems are seen as crucial to that shift. JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform, launched in 2019, is already processing about $3b in daily transactions. While that is only a fraction of the $10 trillion handled by the bank’s broader payments arm, the network has been expanding steadily as more institutions join. The US bank is the largest dollar clearer in the world and is using its position to extend Kinexys’ reach. QNB Adoption Shows Gulf Banks Driving Wider Blockchain Use For QNB, instant access to dollar payments meets the rising expectations of treasurers. In today’s global economy, information moves seamlessly, and money is expected to follow. Moreover, faster settlement allows the bank to compete more aggressively in corporate banking against both regional and international peers. At the same time, large financial institutions worldwide are investing more heavily in blockchain-based solutions. Their goal is to simplify back-office operations and improve transparency. For over a decade, banks have experimented with distributed ledger technology. However, only a handful of platforms have managed to scale commercially.

Many investors today are watching closely for signals that the next major surge could be around the corner. With Bitcoin consolidating near new highs and altcoin activity picking up across exchanges, the question for many is whether now is the final chance to secure a position before the market accelerates again. Among the projects generating buzz is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a token audited that has seen a record-breaking presale, a rapidly expanding community, and rising global attention. The conversation around timing couldn’t come at a more critical moment. Analysts argue that cryptocurrency often moves in cycles, and when momentum builds, those on the sidelines can find themselves priced out quickly. With growing speculation that the next phase of the bull market is approaching, retail and institutional players alike are reconsidering their strategies to avoid missing what could be a defining move. Why Investors Are on Edge For much of 2025, digital assets have traded in a volatile but upward range. Bitcoin’s price resilience despite global economic uncertainty has reinforced the narrative that crypto is maturing as an asset class. At the same time, altcoins have started to show renewed strength, with liquidity flowing into projects beyond the established leaders. Institutional adoption continues to play a role, with major financial firms exploring ETFs, custody services, and even direct token holdings. Each wave of adoption creates ripples across the market, and when combined with retail enthusiasm, it sets the stage for dramatic price acceleration. This mix of factors has many market watchers saying the next breakout could arrive sooner than expected. The Appeal of Small and Mid-Cap Projects While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate attention, some of the biggest stories in past bull runs came from lesser-known projects. Smaller tokens can deliver significant growth when they attract large communities and secure critical exchange listings. They often introduce innovations or fill market gaps that larger players leave behind. Investors are increasingly scanning for these breakout opportunities, knowing that history has shown the highest returns often come from projects that were underestimated at the start. But with opportunity comes risk, as not all small-cap projects are able to sustain their growth or prove their utility over time. A Standout Performance One project now being singled out as a top contender is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its presale has already smashed records, raising millions in a short period while selling out rounds at a rapid pace. The project has gone through rigorous audits by HashEx and CertiK , two of the industry’s most respected security firms, giving investors added confidence in its infrastructure. Beyond security, MAGACOIN FINANCE has cultivated a fast-growing community that spans across multiple regions, making it one of the most globally recognized presales of the year. Analysts have noted that its combination of strong audits, record-breaking fundraising, and rapid adoption positions it for exponential growth once major exchange listings go live . For many, this is why MAGACOIN FINANCE is seen as the “last train” before the broader market surge fully arrives. Catalysts Driving the Next Surge Several factors could accelerate the coming wave in crypto: Macroeconomic conditions – Central banks are still wrestling with inflation and growth concerns, driving investors toward alternative assets. ETF expansion – Institutional products bring new waves of liquidity and legitimacy into the space. Technological upgrades – From Ethereum’s scaling to Bitcoin’s layer-two solutions, improved infrastructure attracts more users. Retail participation – Grassroots enthusiasm tends to peak in late stages of bull runs, amplifying price momentum. Global adoption – Emerging markets are increasingly using digital assets for remittances, savings, and payments, boosting long-term demand. Together, these elements create fertile ground for altcoins to outperform, especially those already building strong communities and securing early trust. How Investors Can Prepare For those considering entry into the market, strategy and discipline are essential. Experts recommend diversification across both large and smaller projects to balance potential growth with stability. Timing also plays a role; entering before widespread hype can deliver the best positioning, but it requires conviction and research. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE illustrate why due diligence matters. Security audits, transparent roadmaps, and measurable milestones separate serious contenders from weaker plays. By focusing on fundamentals, investors can identify which tokens are most likely to benefit when the next surge begins. Conclusion The crypto market has always rewarded those who prepare before momentum hits full stride. With speculation building that a major surge is close, experts say this could be the final opportunity to “board the train” before prices accelerate further. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the most compelling projects of 2025, combining record-breaking presale success, strong security audits, and a growing global community. As Bitcoin stabilizes and altcoins strengthen, the stage is set for the next chapter of the bull cycle. Those looking to secure positions early may find this moment defining for years to come.

This has already triggered fear in the market, with the Fear and Greed Index falling into the Fear territory, marking a new 5-month low. From here, the next direction of the Bitcoin price carries a lot of weight for the entire market, and the point at which the cryptocurrency is sitting is a decision-making point. Bitcoin Price Falls Into Critical Junction According to crypto analyst Weslad, who posted an interesting analysis on the TradingView website, the Bitcoin price is now sitting at what could be considered a make-or-break level. This critical junction lies at a major supply zone, and with the strong supply at this point, a rejection could quickly follow. The crypto analyst explains that the Bitcoin price is currently still holding above the key demand zone of $106,269-$108,715, which is still very bullish for the price. In fact, this has been historically known as a point where the Bitcoin bulls have often held, supporting and triggering the next wave of uptrends. This means that the bulls will have to keep holding this demand zone if they want to maintain the primary uptrend. In the case of a successful hold and a subsequent bounce and breakout with strong momentum, it could put the Bitcoin price on a path to clearing its all-time high above $124,000. Moving further away from this point, the crypto analyst believes it is possible that this bounce could send the Bitcoin price rallying toward the $135,627-$139,616 target zone . This would be an over 20% increase for the cryptocurrency. Bears Could Still Take Control While it does seem that the bulls are holding the primary uptrend while keeping the Bitcoin price above the demand zone of $106,269-$108,715, there is still the possibility of bears taking over from here. Weslad points to the recent rejection from the $117,000 supply zone as proof that sellers are still very much active in the market. If the selling were to continue, then the pressure could press down the Bitcoin price further , putting the key demand support at risk. If the bears were able to successfully break below the demand zone of $106,269-$108,715, then the crypto analyst expects the price to continue to struggle. A downtrend from here could trigger another 10% crash , and such a crash could see the Bitcoin price moving straight toward $98,384. This break would mean Bitcoin losing the $100,000 psychological level for the first time in more than three months.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-29 06:00:33

His comments have drawn interest for challenging the notion that blockchain-based solutions, such as XRP, represent a break from the existing system . Booth suggested that the model behind XRP reflects the very structures it claims to transform. The video featuring Booth’s remarks was shared on X by Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto proponent. Xaif sees the discussion as a debate over whether XRP is driving change in financial systems or simply reproducing traditional structures. Jeff Booth — one of the most famous Canadian author, entrepreneur & investor Drops it straight — $XRP is essentially replicating the banking system. The question: is it reforming finance, or just re-building the old one? #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/3eILaPgzil — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) September 28, 2025 Concerns About Replicating the Existing System Booth questioned whether XRP’s design offers real change or simply follows the structure of existing financial institutions. He pointed out that the current system allows banks to create money through lending and then charge interest on it, a cycle that he views as central to today’s economic framework. While he raised doubts about introducing new technology into that framework without changing its fundamentals, he acknowledged that many in the crypto space are motivated by good intentions. Booth suggested that its approach risks maintaining some of the same practices it was expected to challenge. His remarks left open the question of whether a platform that works with banks and governments can still drive meaningful reform. Decentralization and Opportunities for Change Booth contrasted decentralized models with the legacy structures of finance, noting that the latter remain tied to interest-based lending. However, he did not argue that XRP’s role in facilitating cross-border payments and partnering with traditional institutions is entirely without merit. By bringing blockchain technology into established systems, projects like XRP could create opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce friction , even if they do not fully break from the old model. Reform requires more than technical innovation. It also involves rethinking incentives and the flow of capital. His perspective highlighted the need to balance the pursuit of decentralization with practical steps that can make existing systems fairer and more transparent.

Many XRP supporters argue that its integration with global payment networks is a necessary step toward modernizing finance, enabling faster transactions and improved liquidity. Booth’s comments invited consideration of whether working alongside established players can be part of progress rather than an obstacle to it, and XRP’s remarkable progress across the globe with tokenization, CBDC projects, and more, shows that Ripple’s approach of integration has its merits.

Morningstar increased its fair value estimate for Alibaba’s American Depositary Receipts by 49% to $267. The firm also set its Hong Kong-listed shares at HK$260. Separately, Morgan Stanley lifted its ADR price target by 21% to $200. The Hong Kong-listed stock rose as much as 4.1% to over HK$173 during Monday’s session. That brought the company’s gain this month to nearly 50%, putting it at the top of the Hang Seng Tech Index. Chelsey Tam, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in a note that the shares look undervalued. She said several things are helping cloud revenue grow, including more money going into overseas data centers, strong competitive results, wide use of the company’s open-source models, and better performance from chips it developed in-house. As reported by Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley analysts said they became more positive about Alicloud after a conference in Hangzhou. At that event, Alibaba announced plans to spend more on AI and revealed a new partnership with Nvidia. Cloud Growth Forecasts Raised to 40% Gary Yu and his team at Morgan Stanley raised their cloud growth forecasts to 32% for fiscal 2026 and 40% for fiscal 2027. The analysts said the higher estimates reflect increased capital spending, model improvements, strategic partnerships, and faster expansion into international markets. Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed stock is on pace for its best month since the company went public there in 2019. Investors are backing the internet company’s AI investments as a way to drive growth. In the most recent quarter, the firm reported triple-digit growth in AI-related products. Its cloud division also delivered sales growth that exceeded expectations. As optimism builds, Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management reopened positions in Alibaba’s ADRs this month . It was the first time the firm bought the stock in four years buying $16 billion worth of Alibaba stock. Half of that amount went into the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF, while the rest went into the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF. It marked her first major purchase of the company since 2021. Strategic Nvidia partnership to bypass U.S. Chip restrictions As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier Alibaba’s global AI spending could reach $4 trillion over the next five years . Eddie said Alibaba needs to keep up with that pace or risk getting left behind. Alibaba is now pursuing the same opportunity as Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta. Those companies are expected to spend $364 billion on AI next year, up from an earlier estimate of $325 billion. The company also signed an agreement with Nvidia to use its training tools for robotics and self-driving vehicles. Financial terms weren’t disclosed, but the partnership carries weight. U.S. restrictions have made it harder for Chinese companies to purchase Nvidia’s chips, so Alibaba is finding ways around those limits. Other Chinese firms are also developing domestic chips to replace American technology, including the processors used to train and operate large AI systems. Eddie said the company wants to become a complete AI provider, which includes making its own chips. The cloud division already serves clients in the U.S. and Australia and is now expanding its reach. New data centers are opening in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands. These facilities will support the next phase of Alibaba’s AI infrastructure. The company’s stock has climbed 110% in 2025. Cloud revenue grew 26% year-over-year in the second quarter. Eddie identified AI, cloud, and e-commerce as the company’s three main growth drivers, with AI now taking the leading role. Other companies are seeing similar effects from AI investments. Oracle is putting $35 billion into AI infrastructure for 2026, with that number expected to reach $65 billion by 2029. Thanks to new partnerships with OpenAI, Meta, and SoftBank, Oracle’s stock has surged, adding $390 billion in value this year.

This aggressive buying trend is driving scarcity and pushing many to expect higher crypto prices for ETH in the long run. Yet, as Ethereum (ETH) becomes increasingly expensive to enter, both retail and institutional investors are widening their search for undervalued tokens with stronger upside potential. That search is shifting focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage project priced under $1 that is designed to deliver real utility, scalability, and sustainable adoption. ETH supply hits 9-year low Ethereum (ETH) is seeing a striking on-chain shift: its supply held on centralized exchanges has dropped to a nine-year low as institutions ramp up accumulation. According to Glassnode data, about 14.8 million ETH now sit on exchanges — the lowest since 2016. Simultaneously, institutional buyers — including treasuries and ETFs — have acquired significant ETH positions, together now holding around 10% of total supply. This dual trend reduces the amount of ETH readily available for sale, tightening liquidity and potentially creating upward pressure over time — though short-term price action remains range-bound due to countervailing selling by long-term holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its security-backed design The presale is proving to be a major signal of early demand. With a fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens, Phase 6 has already generated around $16.5 million, with more than 16,650 holders now part of the community. Half of the 170 million tokens allocated for this stage are already sold, at the current price of $0.035. The next phase will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% increase, meaning early buyers are locking in a meaningful discount. Coupled with a rapidly growing online following of more than 12,000 on Twitter, the project is showing traction before even hitting exchanges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing an advanced decentralized finance framework that integrates dual lending mechanics into one seamless ecosystem. The Peer-to-Contract system will allow stablecoin-backed lending and borrowing with deep liquidity, giving participants reliable returns and safe access to capital. Alongside this, the Peer-to-Peer system will facilitate lending for more volatile assets, enabling higher-yield opportunities while isolating risk from the wider pools. This dual setup ensures the platform appeals to a broad user base, from conservative lenders to high-risk takers. Security has been prioritized at every stage of development. The project has undergone a thorough CertiK audit using both manual review and static analysis, achieving a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. These independent results give investors confidence in the protocol’s resilience and in the integrity of its smart contracts, a crucial assurance for those considering new DeFi ventures. Growth catalysts driving market attention Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself with multiple growth drivers that align with current market expectations and evolving crypto predictions. One of the most immediate catalysts will be the beta launch, arriving before the token is listed publicly. This release will allow users to test lending, borrowing, and the dedicated dashboard, where investors can track holdings, calculate ROI, and compete in a Top 50 leaderboard for bonus rewards. These gamified and data-rich features encourage not only platform use but also long-term retention. Another driver is Layer-2 integration. By operating on Layer-2 rather than purely on Layer-1, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deliver significantly lower transaction costs and faster settlement speeds. This efficiency is expected to attract higher borrowing and lending volumes, as users engage repeatedly with a platform that eliminates friction while maximizing capital flow. Further down the roadmap, the introduction of a decentralized stablecoin will reinforce daily activity within the protocol. Minted through overcollateralized loans, the stablecoin will create a continuous cycle of borrowing, repayment, and token burning, ensuring persistent demand while offering users a reliable $1-pegged asset. This stablecoin layer also adds real-world applications, making the platform more attractive to both DeFi enthusiasts and institutions seeking secure liquidity solutions. Major exchange listings are also on the horizon, with Coinbase and MEXC identified as target destinations. These listings will provide immediate access for global investors, improve liquidity, and shine a spotlight on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a competitor to established names in decentralized lending. Such exposure is expected to accelerate adoption and drive valuation, particularly as crypto ETF activity channels fresh capital into the space. The urgency is clear: Phase 6 is already 50% sold, and the next phase’s 15% price increase will soon make today’s entry point unavailable. Early investors have the rare advantage of securing tokens at $0.035 before the broader market has access. Both retail participants and institutions scanning for scalable, sub-$1 projects are recognizing that timing is critical to capture the full upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just a guess. The project combines structural design with significant growth catalysts, including as a dual loan model, CertiK-audited contracts, presale traction, gamified dashboard incentives, Layer-2 efficiency, forthcoming stablecoin integration, and planned Tier-1 exchange listings. In a world where ETH scarcity is driving up crypto prices and crypto predictions say that undervalued tokens will be the next big thing, MUTM is a strong candidate. People who buy during the presale phase are getting ahead of the game by getting one of the most highly anticipated DeFi protocols for less than $1. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to draw in institutions, the focus for asymmetric growth is now shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Early adopters are getting not just reduced tokens but also a spot in what is expected to be a high-utility ecosystem with global reach.

It is now sitting at a crucial support-turned-resistance zone, which needs to be cleared soon for the bull market to resume . The depth of the September correction currently stands at 13% when the asset fell earlier this month. The latest retreat only saw BTC decline to just below $109,000 late last week. “I think the Bitcoin bull market has not ended and will continue,” said Stock-to-flow model creator ‘PlanB’ on Sunday, before adding, “I don’t know until when, or how high. It could also be a long, steady uptrend, without FOMO+crash.” As you know, I think bitcoin bull market has not ended and will continue. I don’t know until when, or how high.

It’s impossible to give a timeframe, but I’m expecting $151k to be crossed within the next 6 months.” 50T Funds co-founder Dan Tapiero said the same thing: “Wake up. Bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as five years ago.” ITC Crypto founder Benjamin Cowen observed that Bitcoin closed its weekly candle above the bull market support band. He added that it was similar to 2020, when in September, there were two weeks up and then two weeks down. Meanwhile, trader and analyst ‘Tara’ looked toward Fibonacci retracement levels with the first being reached in today’s move and the second $114,300 after a potential pullback. The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has also returned to 50, neutral, after spending the last week in fear territory. Ethereum Reclaims Bullish Momentum Ether prices also reclaimed the psychological $4,000 level on Monday morning. “I’m not long-term bearish on ETH,” said investor Ted Pillows, who pointed out that the asset rallied almost 250% from its bottom, so a correction is expected . “I think the Ethereum correction will be over in a few weeks. After that, ETH will rally above $10,000.” ‘Daan Crypto Trades’ echoed the sentiment, observing that the weekly candle closed back above the previous cycle highs “after a solid effort by the bulls and a late Sunday push.” $ETH The weekly candle closed back above the previous cycle highs after a solid effort by the bulls and a late Sunday push. I didn’t think it would be able to do it so I’m pleasantly surprised. It will remain important to hold on to this area on the higher timeframe obviously. https://t.co/3yCtTP4daK pic.twitter.com/XFu15ifENU — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) September 29, 2025 The post Bitcoin Price Reclaims $112K as Bull Market Sentiment Returns appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-29 06:28:58

By Sunday, though, the Dogecoin price had begun to rebound, suggesting that there would be a rise in momentum, especially among buyers. This now puts the meme coin at a significant level, as there is the potential of the price bouncing off the current demand zone, but with bears still making a bid, the tug-of-war continues. What A Bounce From The Demand Zone Means Presently, the most critical support for the Dogecoin price lies at the $0.229 level, as outlined by crypto analyst Lingrid, which the cryptocurrency has managed to hold over the weekend. This support level serves as confirmation that the Dogecoin price could continue its uptrend much farther than it did back in early September. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Sitting On A Powder Keg: Here’s The Explosion That Will Send Price To $1.3 The analyst also outlines a bullish formation on the chart, which is a completed triangle breakout pattern. The completion of the bullish pattern is what had led to the initial bullish impulse before the price began to correct downward again. Following the correction, the Dogecoin price was observed to be testing the lower boundary of the triangle trading range. However, with the price still holding above the critical support level, it could see a sustained break from here. The meme coin has already seen a recovery coming out of the weekend, suggesting that the $0.22 psychological level would hold completely through the uncertain market headwinds. Now, if the Dogecoin price is still able to hold this psychological level, then it could be the signal that crypto investors are buying heavily into the altcoin. In the case of heavy buying, it could provide the needed push from the current demand level above $0.21. A leg-up from here would push it toward $0.25, where the next major resistance level lies for the digital asset. This makes $0.22 a very important level as it is the target for the bears to break through. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Crashes To Lowest Level Since March – Why This Is Good News This is because if the bears are able to push the price back down toward $0.22 and cause it to fall further, then the next target lies low at $0.18810. This is the rebound level with demand, thus the price would have to get here before the can bounce again. The crypto analyst also explains that the current triangle pattern could fail its bullish impulse if the Dogecoin price fails to reclaim higher ground. Also, there is the possibility that the Bitcoin price could crash, taking the crypto market down with it and pushing the Dogecoin price toward further decline.

While inflation appears contained, despite a fresh round of tariff-related headlines, the labor market remains an evolving narrative. Core PCE inflation data matched expectations last week, reinforcing hopes for more Federal Reserve rate cuts. “The labor market prints this week will begin to show us if the curve is going to steepen from here or if the Fed is really going to throw real rates even lower for an even crazier melt-up in equities, gold, silver, and Bitcoin,” commented macroeconomics researcher ‘Capital Flows’. “The markets are looking ahead to the October and December Fed meetings as more data comes in,” said the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events Sept. 29 to Oct. 3 Tuesday will offer some job openings data and consumer confidence reports as the big week of labor market data begins. Wednesday has September’s ISM Manufacturing PMI, which shows business conditions in the US manufacturing sector and serves as a significant indicator of overall economic conditions. Wednesday also has more ADP Nonfarm Employment data, and Thursday will see initial jobless claims data, shedding more light on the condition of the labor market. Friday’s unemployment reports represent the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of people actively seeking employment. One of the Fed’s two mandates is full employment, and it considers labor market changes when determining its policy decisions. Key Events This Week: 1. August JOLTS Job Openings data – Tuesday 2.

September Jobs Report -… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) September 28, 2025 On Friday, Fed Vice-chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman reiterated that she believes decisive interest rate cuts are needed to ward off rising trouble in the job market. “Recent data show a materially more fragile labor market along with inflation that, excluding tariffs, has continued to hover not far above our target,” Bowman said. Negative data or figures coming in below expectations this week could reinforce that premise. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets are showing rare gains this Monday morning, which has been typically red for the past few weeks. Total capitalization is up 2.2% to $3.95 trillion as markets attempt to claw back some of last week’s losses. Bitcoin reclaimed $112,000 in early trading in Asia but could not overcome resistance there and fell back to $111,640 at the time of writing. Ethereum made similar gains, topping $4,140 after adding 2.5% but it too was starting to retreat again. Altcoins doing better included Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, Hyperliqui, and Avalanche, but all of them sold off heavily last week.

While some debate whether this growth is a short-term spike, industry observers point to the platform’s robust mechanics—dual lending pools, stablecoin issuance, and mtToken buybacks—as a foundation for sustained long-term appreciation. In a market where hype-driven tokens dominate headlines, MUTM positions itself as a DeFi ecosystem designed for strategic investors seeking solid, predictable growth. Presale snapshot and community momentum Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised approximately $16.50 million, attracting over 16,650 holders. With half of the 170 million token supply sold, Phase 7 will see the price move to $0.04, a 15% increase that rewards early participation. The platform has undergone a CertiK audit, achieving a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00, reinforcing investor confidence. Social traction is strong with 12,000+ Twitter followers, and community incentives include a $50,000 bug bounty pool and a $100,000 giveaway where ten winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. The presale performance highlights the combination of solid fundamentals and growing community interest, offering investors a clear path to engage with a platform that balances innovation and stability. The structured roadmap, including the upcoming beta launch, will allow users to interact directly with lending and borrowing mechanics and all other perks that the platform offers. Currently on the website, users can calculate ROI on the dashboard, and compete on the Top 50 leaderboard for bonus rewards. Lending and borrowing mechanics drive growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leverages its P2C lending pools to deliver real utility and predictable returns. For example, a user supplying $10,000 in LINK will receive mtLINK tokens representing their share of the pool. With an average APY of 14%, they will earn $1,400 in passive income annually. These mtLINK tokens are also usable as collateral, allowing borrowers to access additional liquidity without selling their LINK holdings. For borrowers, the platform provides flexible options that maintain long-term exposure. A trader depositing $4,000 worth of SOL can borrow $2,800 in USDT at a 70% LTV. This arrangement enables liquidity for reinvestment or yield generation while retaining SOL for future growth. Stablecoin pools and bluechip token deposits combine to form a strong liquidity base, which supports the rising demand for MUTM and underpins the token’s expected appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also integrates P2P lending for higher-risk assets like DOGE and PEPE, keeping these speculative activities isolated from core pools. This separation ensures that long-term growth for investors in stable and bluechip assets remains protected while allowing retail traders to engage in higher-reward lending scenarios. Collateral, liquidation, and stability factor A critical driver of MUTM’s long-term growth is the platform’s collateral management and liquidation system. Assets have designated LTV limits and liquidation triggers: stablecoins generally carry a 70–75% LTV, bluechip tokens like LINK or SOL around 70%, and meme tokens up to 44% depending on volatility. The Stability Factor ensures that pools remain solvent, automatically triggering liquidations when collateral falls below safe thresholds. Liquidators repurchase the debt at discounted rates, preserving the integrity of the system while rewarding proactive participants. This mechanism protects the entire ecosystem, encouraging confidence among both long-term investors and active traders. Reserve factors further safeguard pool stability: low-risk stablecoins apply roughly 10%, whereas higher-risk assets use up to 44%. By combining P2C and P2P lending with these risk controls, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers structured growth that contrasts with the speculative swings of meme coins and hype-driven tokens. Investment outlook and future catalysts A Phase 1 investor who put $10,000 into MUTM at $0.01 currently has tokens worth $35,000 at Phase 6 prices. The expected listing price of $0.06 would make the same holding valued $60,000. The platform’s goal of $1 per token by 2026 would make it worth $1 million, showing that it has huge potential. If long-term growth happens, even investors in Phase 6 who buy for $0.035 could get 28 times their money back. The beta launch will let people try out all of the platform’s capabilities in person. More listings on large exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are expected to happen soon. This will make the market more liquid, visible, and active. These factors, along with ongoing mtToken buybacks and stablecoin loans, keep the demand for MUTM strong. As crypto predictions unfold and investors analyze the current arena, questions like is crypto a good investment and the latest crypto crash today highlight the importance of structured, utility-driven platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a long-term growth story that blends predictable yield, stability, and presale momentum, making it a standout option for traders seeking more than speculative hype.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple (XRP) are showing signs of stabilization and recovery. The three major cryptocurrencies are holding above key support levels after recent declines. Bitcoin is approaching the $112k level, while Ether is now trading above $4,100 per coin. XRP is finding its footing and could be heading to a critical support level if the market momentum remains bullish. XRP tops $2.8 as short traders suffer losses XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, has outperformed Bitcoin and Ether, after adding 2.6% to its value in the last 24 hours. The positive performance allowed XRP to reclaim the $2.85 mark after dropping to the $2.69 support level over the weekend. The coin’s rally also comes as the broader crypto market starts a new week bullish for the first time in nearly six weeks. XRP retested the $2.68 support level on Friday following the release of the PCE data. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, rose 2.7% year-over-year in August, while core PCE excluding food and energy climbed 2.9%. The PCE inflation data matched analyst expectations, suggesting that the Fed could likely balance sticky inflation with a softer labour market condition. There are two more FOMC meetings before the end of the year, with analysts expecting at least one more rate cut. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated last week that the apex bank has to approach the interest rate policy with caution as inflation is still not where they want it to be. The PCE data sent the crypto market into a bearish performance, with XRP dropping to the $2.69 level on Friday. The ongoing recovery could allow the cryptocurrency to rally higher in the near term, with the $3.0 resistance level a crucial target. The positive performance also resulted in heavy losses for short traders in the last few hours.

XRP’s price dropped by 6% on Friday after retesting its daily resistance level at $2.93 on Thursday. However, with the $2.68 support level holding, XRP added over 2.5% to its value in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $2.85 per coin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) now reads 57, suggesting that the recent bearish momentum is fading. The MACD lines also crossed into the bullish zone, indicating that buyers are slowly regaining control of the market. If the positive performance continues and XRP closes above the $2.93 resistance level, it could extend its rally and surge towards the TLQ at $3.0 over the next few hours. However, failure to close above the next resistance level could see XRP decline towards the daily support at $2.72 once again.

This allows Crypto.com to act as an intermediary for both retail and institutional clients in the U.S. derivatives market. “We will soon bring regulated, leveraged derivatives to retail customers in the U.S. through one interface,” said Crypto.com CEO and co-founder Kris Marszalek. “This is a significant step in delivering a full-stack derivatives platform under U.S. regulatory oversight.” Marszalek credited Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham for accelerating the approval process, stating, “We sincerely appreciate the partnership with Acting Chairman Pham and the CFTC, who are working hard to carry out the crypto agenda of President Trump.” Another significant milestone for @cryptocom as we have received approval from the @CFTC for derivatives licenses in the United States for margined derivatives.

The approval process involved documentation reviews and technical demonstrations of CDNA’s trading and clearing systems. The FCM application was submitted earlier in April 2022 and underwent a similar review by NFA staff. “Today’s approvals are proof that Acting Chairman Pham is delivering in real-time on President Donald J. Trump’s pledge,” said Steve Humenik, Head of Clearing at CDNA. Nick Lundgren, Chief Legal Officer of Crypto.com, said the move is part of the company’s broader push to become “the most regulated financial services platform in the world.” Travis McGhee, Global Head of Capital Markets, added that CDNA is building a next-generation clearinghouse with a focus on risk management and scale. CFTC Expands Digital Asset Advisory Roles, Links Efforts to New Crypto Bill The CFTC recently added new members to its Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) and Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS), showing its effort to bring industry expertise into digital asset policymaking. Fresh appointees to DAMS include Katherine Minarik of Uniswap Labs, Avery Ching of Aptos Labs, James J. Hill of BNY, and Ben Sherwin of Chainlink Labs, figures with backgrounds in blockchain infrastructure, legal policy, and institutional crypto strategy. JPMorgan’s Scott Lucas will now co-chair the group alongside Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul, replacing Caroline Butler. Lucas stressed the importance of “clear and effective regulatory frameworks,” while Kaul pointed to consumer protection as a key priority. DAMS advises the CFTC on blockchain, tokenization, and decentralized finance, helping the agency assess risks and align oversight across financial markets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-and-swifts-xrp-announcement-could-be-closer-than-people-think-heres-why/,"Pseudonymous crypto enthusiast {X} has drawn attention once again to the speculation surrounding XRP and its potential involvement in SWIFT’s cross-border payment infrastructure. In his latest commentary, he pointed out that many within the digital asset community have overlooked a previous incident in which an announcement suggesting an agreement between Ripple and SWIFT was shared prematurely. According to him, the official confirmation of such a partnership could be approaching sooner than anticipated. He added that if finalized, this type of development could propel XRP beyond Bitcoin in market standing. People seem to have forgotten very quickly that the agreement between Ripple and Swift to use XRP for cross border payments was announced early by mistake. Maybe the official announcement is closer than we think. Once this is announced XRP will overtake Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/79o3soqglx — {x} (@unknowDLT) September 27, 2025 Background of the Deleted Post The source of this speculation stems from a tweet initially published by Watcher.Guru on March 20, 2025. The post claimed that SWIFT was close to finalizing an agreement with Ripple to integrate XRP into its global payments system. It further stated that billions of XRP had been placed in escrow to serve as liquidity reserves for these cross-border transactions. The post was timestamped at 10:05 PM but was later deleted. Its removal led to questions across the cryptocurrency community about the authenticity of the information. Clarification on the Incident According to a report by Times Tabloid , the deleted Watcher.Guru post was the result of an account compromise. The outlet detailed that malicious actors had gained control of the account and published the misleading information in an attempt to deceive the market. Watcher.Guru later confirmed that there was no official basis for the claims and emphasized that the news of a Ripple-SWIFT partnership was not accurate. Despite this clarification, the content had already circulated widely before its deletion. Ongoing Speculation Among Analysts and Supporters While the original report was debunked, crypto enthusiasts such as {X} argue that the premature post may reflect discussions or developments that are still ongoing behind the scenes. He suggested that the announcement of a partnership could be imminent and that such a move would be transformative for XRP’s role in the global financial system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This assertion has sparked a fresh debate over XRP’s utility, particularly given its design as a bridge currency for settlement and its escrow system , which ensures liquidity stability. Implications for XRP’s Market Position The suggestion that XRP could surpass Bitcoin is ambitious, yet it underscores the significance some analysts attach to institutional adoption. A collaboration with SWIFT, which connects over 11,000 financial institutions worldwide, would represent one of the most impactful integrations for any digital asset. Although the original report was discredited, the notion that XRP could become a settlement medium within the SWIFT network gained traction among investors and market watchers.

The answer is a resounding yes. The rise of meme-powered tokens has turned skeptics into believers, delivering millionaires overnight while fueling the most viral trends in crypto. Today, investors are tracking a new wave of meme legends: MoonBull, Bonk, Notcoin, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Shiba Inu, and Pudgy Penguins. Each brings its own energy, community backing, and potential for massive returns. Yet among them, one presale is already turning heads with explosive speed and unstoppable demand, and that’s MoonBull, the clear frontrunner among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. What sets MoonBull apart in a sea of meme coins? Unlike others chasing hype, MoonBull is blending real innovation with lightning-fast growth. While Bonk, Notcoin, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Shiba Inu, and Pudgy Penguins hold strong positions in the meme coin arena, MoonBull is rewriting the rules with unique staking, referrals, and a presale that has rocketed to Stage 3 in record time. Investors looking at the best cryptos to watch in 2025 are quickly realizing that MoonBull offers the ultimate early-stage opportunity. 1. MoonBull: Staking Rewards and Smart Referrals That Fuel Growth MoonBull isn’t just a presale token, it’s an ecosystem of rewards designed to lock in loyalty while fueling viral adoption. At Stage 10, the MoonBull presale unlocks a powerful staking program, offering holders a fixed 95% APY with seamless access through the dashboard. Rewards are calculated daily, giving participants the freedom to grow passively without complicated barriers. Even better, there’s no minimum entry, meaning small investors can reap the same benefits as whales. This staking pool is powered by a dedicated reserve, ensuring sustainability while boosting token stability, positioning MoonBull among the best cryptos to watch in 2025 . But staking is just half of the magic. MoonBull also unleashes a referral system that actually pays, rewarding both referrers and new buyers instantly. With every invite, buyers enjoy 15% extra tokens, while referrers collect 15% of the purchase value straight into their wallets. On top of that, the most active promoters earn monthly USDC bonuses, turning community builders into top earners. This system ensures MoonBull isn’t just growing, it’s multiplying. Together, high-yield staking and instant-pay referrals create unstoppable momentum, placing MoonBull at the front of top presale cryptos on watchlist. MoonBull Presale Frenzy: The Clock Is Ticking The MoonBull presale is live now, and it’s moving faster than anyone expected. With 23 explosive stages designed for massive growth, the project reached Stage 3 within hours of launch, a record-breaking signal of investor demand. Currently priced at $0.00004057, MoonBull has already raised over $142,000 with more than 400 holders on board. Early investors are seeing jaw-dropping returns, with over 15,000% potential gains projected from Stage 3 to the listing price of $0.00616. Even those who jumped in at Stage 3 with just $100 would be staring at a potential $19,340.66 at listing. Every stage brings a 27.40% price increase until Stage 22, with the final climb of 20.38% to Stage 23 sealing the deal. This scarcity model ensures each delay means paying more, and missing the biggest multipliers. The rush to Stage 3 proves MoonBull isn’t slowing down, and the community’s strength is fueling its unstoppable rise. Investors watching trending meme coins to follow 2025 are already racing to secure allocations before the next surge. Waiting isn’t an option, the window for the lowest entry is vanishing quickly. 2. Bonk: Solana’s Community-First Meme Star Bonk is making noise as Solana’s flagship meme token, rising from grassroots hype into a token that powers both culture and utility. With liquidity spreads across decentralized apps, Bonk has cemented itself as more than a passing trend. Its utility as a community coin gives it real staying power in the Solana ecosystem, making Bonk one of the cryptos to watch for 100x ROI in 2025. 3. Notcoin: Gaming Meets Viral Tokenomics Notcoin merges gaming with viral mechanics, capturing a new wave of crypto-native players. Users earn tokens by engaging in simple, addictive in-app tasks, turning micro-engagement into macro adoption. By bridging the worlds of gaming and blockchain, Notcoin stands out as one of the early stage meme coins to follow in 2025. 4. Neiro: The Next Community Powerhouse Neiro is rapidly becoming a community-driven meme sensation, positioned as one of the presale hype projects to monitor. Its branding taps into viral culture, while its expanding community base keeps fueling speculation. With scalability potential and a strong roadmap, Neiro has firmly earned a place in the conversation around watchlist cryptos with FOMO buzz. 5.

Supported heavily within the Solana network, Dogwifhat thrives on its cultural value and endless memeability. Its strong social traction ensures it continues to be among presale tokens gaining traction and cryptos to watch for 100x ROI. 6. Shiba Inu: The Meme Titan That Started It All Shiba Inu remains a titan of meme coins, often dubbed the Dogecoin killer. With its Shibarium network expanding and utility features being tested, Shiba Inu continues to innovate. Its enduring popularity and market cap resilience keep it on the radar as one of the top meme coins before big listing surges in 2025. 7. Pudgy Penguins: From NFTs to Meme Coin Expansion Pudgy Penguins started as a leading NFT brand and has since evolved into a meme powerhouse crossing into tokenization. Its strong IP, merchandise sales, and growing brand identity place it uniquely in the mix. Investors are tracking Pudgy Penguins as community cryptos worth tracking for long-term potential. Conclusion: MoonBull Leading the Meme Coin Charge Based on the latest research, the best cryptos to watch in 2025 are MoonBull, Bonk, Notcoin, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Shiba Inu, and Pudgy Penguins.

The Qatar-headquartered bank announced Monday that it now uses JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments system to handle dollar payments for business customers in Qatar. The new setup lets payments go through in minutes at any time of the day, including weekends. Traditional banking systems mostly work during business hours and can take several days for money to reach its destination. Kamel Moris, who leads transactional banking at QNB, said business managers increasingly want their money to move as quickly as information does. The bank can now promise payments will clear in as little as two minutes around the clock. “It’s a treasurer’s dream,” Moris said during an interview as quoted by Bloomberg. Big banks worldwide are adding distributed ledger technology to their operations, seeing it as a way to make complicated back-office work simpler. Despite testing these systems for over ten years, most banks haven’t gotten them to work at large scale or make money from them yet. JPMorgan’s blockchain network handles $3 billion daily JPMorgan launched the Kinexys network in 2019. It now processes $3 billion in transactions daily. That sounds substantial, but it represents just a small slice of the roughly $10 trillion the bank’s payment operations handle every day. As the biggest US dollar clearing bank globally, JPMorgan wants to grow the platform by tapping into its extensive correspondent banking network. Opening the network to other financial institutions lets JPMorgan reach companies that don’t bank directly with them, according to Naveen Mallela, who runs Kinexys alongside another executive. “This is institutional-grade scale,” Mallela said. As reported by Cryptopolitan Swift is also running its own blockchain tests. The messaging network that connects more than 11,000 banks is checking whether its core system could eventually operate on blockchain technology. BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon and other major banks are participating in the trial. Results from the Swift pilot won’t come for months. One banker working on it called the project “an important technological transformation for the international interbank payments industry.” The development was first reported by Grégory Raymond of The Big Whale on X.

Speaking on the Master Investor podcast recently, Cathie Wood talked about the altcoin called Hyperliquid (HYPE). Wood stated that Hyperliquid reminded him of Solana's early days and called it “the new star of the block.” Wood emphasized that Solana has proven its value and entered the mainstream blockchain category, and pointed out that Hyperliquid also has this potential. “The trajectory of Hyperliquid is exciting. It reminds me of the early Solana, and Solana has proven his worth and, you know, he continues with the great players.” We Hold the Big Three Cryptos: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Stating that ARK Invest currently holds three major cryptocurrencies in its public funds, Wood said that these are “Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).” Wood said the firm held indirectly control of Solana through its Breera Sports project, which is linked to the Solana treasury and backed by Middle Eastern investors. On this point, Wood added that ARK Invest's strategy is deliberately narrow-scoped. “We don't think there will be many cryptocurrencies in the future. When it comes to pure crypto, Bitcoin dominates the cryptocurrency space. Ethereum has empowered decentralized finance, while Solana has proven its scalability resilience. If you're talking about the big guys, these are the big three right now.” Finally, Wood did not reveal whether they have made any investments in HYPE, although he believes Hyperliquid has a future, but he did note that competition among decentralized exchanges is intensifying. *This is not investment advice.

52421768,591366,1759131010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52421768.jpeg,XRP Stuns Galaxy CEO: Novogratz Makes The Bull Case He Once Dismissed,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-galaxy-ceo-novogratz-bull-case/,"Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz used a weekend appearance on Kyle Chassé’s podcast to make an unexpected—if nuanced—bull case for XRP, arguing that the asset’s value today is anchored less in on-chain activity than in an unusually durable, identity-forming community that has survived lawsuits, bear markets and cycles of derision from rivals. “XRP has one of the strongest communities there is. You want to learn about it, say something bad about them,” Novogratz said . “People will be out in front of your house with picket signs protesting you. Those community members love their token. They have a narrative, it’s going to be payments…” He acknowledged that present-day activity trails faster networks—“We can look at how much use case is on the blockchain. It’s not nearly as much as on Solana, right? Small. It doesn’t matter for their value proposition right now. Their value proposition is the intensity of that community.” The Bull Case For XRP The Galaxy CEO framed that intensity as a rational response to a broader collapse of trust since the 2008 crisis. “We have so little trust that we’re finding trust in these online crypto communities,” he argued, describing the strongest crypto ecosystems as “cults” in the sociological sense—conviction-driven communities that substitute identity and shared myth for institutional trust. “All the crypto that are successful are cults,” he said. It is the kind of commitment that inspires permanence signals—“that’s why people get tattoos… No one gets tattoos about their stock.” Novogratz contrasted equity investors’ price discipline with crypto tribal loyalty. “I’m an Oracle guy. I like Oracle when it’s cheap. I don’t like it when it’s expensive,” he said. “You’ve never heard an XRP Army guy think XRP is expensive… They just want to be in XRP.” The same identity logic, he noted, permeates Bitcoin: “I’ve got one employee who loves Bitcoin so much… if Bitcoin went away, he would have almost no purpose in life. Like, his purpose is Bitcoin.” Chassé pushed the analogy into equities by name-checking Tesla’s fandom. Novogratz agreed: “Tesla, because it’s become a cult. It’s a community. It’s a cult .” That bleed-through between markets, in his view, is the tell: culture can dominate valuation models for long stretches, and crypto’s most resilient assets are those whose communities behave as movements. XRP’s path through US litigation became his central case study in resilience. “I didn’t think XRP would last after the lawsuits and all the… It did. And it’s stronger. It’s actually been the best token you could have bought post-election,” he said, calling the phenomenon “almost irrational” but instructive for understanding why dismissing a community can be costly. Novogratz credited Ripple’s chief executive directly: “Brad Garlinghouse has done a world-class job of navigating these lawsuits, of keeping that community…” He also used the moment to revisit his own priors about decentralization purity tests. “I used to get angry about it because I was like, oh, it’s not Bitcoin. It’s not as decentralized… Like, who am I to judge where people want to store their money?” He extended the principle beyond XRP: “The same holds true for XRP or Cardano . If people want to store their money in that community, go for it… The arrogance of thinking my community is good, but your community sucks. It’s just stupid. Now, I can make technical arguments for more decentralized than you… Like, who cares? No one cares.” For Novogratz, crypto communities behave like polities—“They each have their own constitution, Declaration of Independence. They each have their own culture.” He illustrated the point with a story about Galaxy’s own office décor: “We have the Bitcoin white paper on our freaking ceiling… like the beginning [crawl] in Star Wars… That is the constitution of the Bitcoin community.” The implication for XRP is straightforward: as long as the “constitution” of its community remains intact—an ethos he sees as forged under legal fire—the token’s bid can be sustained by identity as much as by immediate utility. Chassé briefly touched on price perceptions from retail—“people think XRP is very cheap at $3 because if it gets the same price Bitcoin’s at one day, imagine the upside”—to which Novogratz responded by reiterating his refusal to play judge over others’ monetary choices. “When people thought I was crazy, I was like, who the freak are you to judge where I want to… save my money?” At press time, XRP traded at $2.85.",XRP|Mike Novogratz tattoo|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-29 07:30:10

Experts say, however, that the size of its current value makes it less likely to give investors huge returns in the future. Analysts say that the spotlight is now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage token that costs only $0.035 and might give investors a 1,500% return on investment by 2026. As crypto prices go up and down today, and a lot of investors are wondering why crypto is down during corrections, MUTM is pitching itself as a new chance with an asymmetric upside. Phase 6 of the presale shows that more people are interested. More than 16,650 people have already secured their seats, and more than $16.5 million has been raised. Half of the 170 million tokens set up for this round have already been sold, which shows how important it is for anyone who wants to get in at $0.035. Investors in crypto consider this as one of the last chances to get in at a lower price before Phase 7 raises the price by 15% to $0.040. The dual lending innovation driving growth The basis of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a dual lending architecture that broadens the possibilities of decentralised finance. The Peer-to-Contract system will function with stablecoins and other liquid assets, giving investors constant returns and clear risk restrictions. The Peer-to-Peer architecture will also facilitate lending for tokens that are less stable or less liquid. This will give participants an opportunity to earn greater rewards while keeping systemic risks low. This two-track strategy makes sure that different parts of the market are taken care of without affecting overall stability. This design is better with strong protection. Loans will always be overcollateralized, which means that borrowers must put up more value in collateral than the amount they borrow. This lowers the chance of default. At the same time, liquidation procedures will keep the protocol healthy and punishments will go straight to the coffers. This makes a cycle of long-term income that makes the platform stronger as more people use it. Structural demand drivers for 1,500% and roadmap catalysts Several features embedded within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are designed to create persistent demand and reinforce long-term value. First, liquidation penalties will continuously add to the treasury, creating a revenue stream that scales with activity on the platform. Second, the Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) system improves capital use by allowing higher borrowing power on stablecoins, increasing both lending and borrowing activity while still maintaining strict risk controls. Third, the utilization-based interest model dynamically balances supply and demand, ensuring liquidity is always available when needed and attracting new participants with competitive returns. Looking ahead, multiple catalysts are expected to accelerate adoption. At listing, a beta launch will allow users to engage directly with the platform, providing a firsthand experience of its lending mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing a Layer-2 integration, which will reduce transaction costs and improve speed compared to Layer-1 solutions. Additionally, the protocol will introduce a decentralized stablecoin, embedding continuous demand for borrowing and repayment cycles within the ecosystem. Visibility and accessibility will further expand once the token is listed on major global exchanges such as Binance and Kraken. These platforms will provide liquidity, global exposure, and institutional entry points, reinforcing adoption across different segments of the market. Final words On the other side, Cardano (ADA) is still a well-known and respected project, but because it is so big, it is less likely to deliver early investors the large returns they expect. Analysts claim that firms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have a decent chance of producing money since they have a lot of presale traction, treasury-building processes, and high-utility roadmap components that make them good for long-term growth. People don’t think that a 1,500% return on investment (ROI) for MUTM by 2026 is just a projection; they think it’s proof of strong structural design and the chance for it to be used by a lot of people. For investors looking for the next big thing in today’s volatile market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most attractive companies in the industry.

Understanding Chainlink’s potential price movements involves analyzing various factors such as market trends, technological advancements, partnerships, and overall market sentiment. This Chainlink price prediction aims to provide insights into its future performance by examining technical analysis and fundamental aspects that could influence its value.

A consistent pattern of higher lows shows growing bullish pressure, pushing LINK closer to the critical $21.69 resistance. Price action above $21.20 highlights steady accumulation, signaling potential strength for a breakout if buying demand continues. On September 29, 2025, Chainlink (LINK) trades at $21.29, recording a 2.80% intraday uptrend. The cryptocurrency has displayed resilience in the past 24 hours, establishing intraday support at $20.47 and testing overhead resistance at $21.69. With the price trading above the psychological $21 mark, LINK demonstrates strengthening market sentiment and a strong foothold for potential upside continuation. Chainlink 1-day price chart: LINK buyers defend $20.47 as momentum builds On the daily chart, LINK reflects a steady upward trajectory after defending the $20.47 support level, signaling strong demand absorption. The recovery from intraday weakness created a constructive bullish reversal pattern, with higher lows forming into the evening session. This strength carried LINK toward the upper boundary of its range, closing in on the $21.69 resistance zone, where further breakout potential lies. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The recovery phase was backed by improved trading volumes, suggesting stronger participation at higher levels. If LINK successfully clears $21.69 resistance, it could set the stage for further upward expansion toward new short-term highs. However, should momentum stall, the $21.00 level remains a key pivot, while any failure to hold this base risks retesting the $20.47 support floor. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK consolidation above $21.20 On the 4-hour chart, LINK price action indicates consolidation with bullish undertones. The token has been trading above $21.20, establishing a sequence of higher lows that highlight substantial short-term accumulation. Buyers are gradually tightening control, with momentum shifting in favor of an eventual test of the $21.69 resistance level. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView Market structure in this timeframe underscores resilience against downside pressure. While buyers maintain support above $21.00, the short-term outlook suggests that sustained demand could fuel a decisive push higher. As long as the token holds its rising base above $20.47, LINK is positioned to extend its gains and potentially break the resistance zone on renewed buying volume. Chainlink technical indicators: levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 23.52 SELL SMA 5 $ 23.55 SELL SMA 10 $ 24.10 SELL SMA 21 $ 24.20 SELL SMA 50 $ 20.87 BUY SMA 100 $ 17.37 BUY SMA 200 $ 16.13 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 23.35 SELL EMA 5 $ 23.57 SELL EMA 10 $ 23.86 SELL EMA 21 $ 23.35 SELL EMA 50 $ 21.05 BUY EMA 100 $ 18.86 BUY EMA 200 $ 17.46 BUY What to expect from Chainlink? Chainlink is positioned at a pivotal point as it consolidates near the $21.69 resistance level. A breakout above this barrier could open the path toward higher price targets, driven by consistent buying activity and the formation of higher lows on both daily and 4-hour charts. If the resistance holds, LINK may retest support zones at $21.00 and $20.47, which remain critical levels for sustaining the current bullish outlook. Holding above these bases would keep the upward momentum intact, while a loss of $20.47 could invite renewed selling pressure. Overall, LINK’s structure suggests buyers are gaining control, with short-term focus remaining on whether bulls can secure a close above $21.69. Is Chainlink a good investment? Chainlink remains a leading Oracle network, widely adopted across DeFi and enterprise solutions, that supports long-term demand. Recent price action shows strong defense of support levels and steady accumulation above $21.00, signaling bullish potential. For investors, holding above $20.47 and breaking $21.69 are key levels to watch. A sustained move higher would strengthen LINK’s outlook, while failure to defend support could limit short-term upside despite its strong fundamentals. Why is the LINK price up today? The LINK price is up today as buyers stepped in firmly at the $20.47 support level, sparking renewed demand and reversing earlier weakness. This defense created a clear base that allowed the token to climb back above the psychological $21.00 mark, restoring market confidence. The move higher has been supported by steady accumulation above $21.20, with price action showing a consistent series of higher lows. This structure reflects firm buying pressure, which is now pushing LINK closer to retesting the $21.69 resistance zone. Will Chainlink reach $50? Based on long-term forecasts, Chainlink (LINK) is projected to reach $50 by 2027, indicating potential future price movements as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Chainlink reach $100? Chainlink can reach $100 in the year 2029, per expert predictions. Does Chainlink have a promising long-term future? Chainlink shows some stabilization and potential for recovery, indicating the token may have a promising long-term future.

Demand for dark pool trading awakened Solana’s HumidiFi, surpassing Orca and Meteora in the past few days. HumidiFi rose to the top 3 of Solana protocols, on rising demand for dark pool trading. Following the success of Aster, the protocol gained attention, surpassing Orca and Meteora. The dark pool model, also known as proprietary market maker, is gaining on the fully transparent public order DEX, as well as concentrated liquidity pools. HumidiFi reached peak volumes in September, driven by demand for dark pools and veiled orders. | Source: DeFiLlama . The dark pool DEX achieved $8.55B in trading volumes for the past week. On September 25, the DEX achieved an all-time record of $1.91B in daily volumes. HumidiFi rose alongside ZeroFi and SolFi, though those markets are now lagging, with ZeroFi volumes near an all-time low. During peak Solana trading periods, HumidiFi has risen up the ranks of DEXs. The exchange has carried up to 15% of Solana on-chain trading volumes, even without opening a front-end to retail trades. HumidiFi acts as a proprietary, closed pool with a single market-maker. The DEX is not permissionless, but its liquidity, spreads and slippage are controlled. HumidiFi is used to make orders for the most liquid pairs, especially SOL/USDC. HumidiFi dark pools prevent sandwich attacks Solana has allowed dark pools as a way for institutional trading, as well as a tool to disable sandwich attacks. The network still undergoes front-running by bots, extracting over $4M in 10 days. Raydium remains the leading DEX on Solana , still driven by retail activity. However, whales and other professional traders aim for minimal slippage and available liquidity that does not register through on-chain analysis. Previously, transparent exchanges have led to whale-tracking, as well as aggressive counter-trading. In the case of Aster and HumidiFi, the trading pools remain fully veiled, though they still produce significant volumes. Dark pools boost Jupiter volumes The recent rise in DEX activity boosted Jupiter, based on its direct DEX involvement and its own perpetual futures market. Jupiter itself offers options to select one of the available automatic market makers, giving exposure to the available dark pools that lack a direct front end. However, Jupiter is also the key router for the dark pool orders. Some of the recent Jupiter activity reflects the hidden effect of HumidiFi, which operates directly, even without a front end. Jupiter still has significant inflows of meme token orders, but HumidiFi is the key source of SOL/USDC requests for routing. During the busiest days, HumidiFi takes up to 80% of SOL/USDC requests on Jupiter. SolFi is also highly active, along with smaller dark pools. Dark pool activity picked up as SOL briefly dipped under $200. In the new week, SOL recovered to $208.22, with additional USDC inflows in the past week. Demand for SOL/USDC trading increased as the stablecoin supply rose to 13.79B tokens, up 7.15% in the past week. Of those tokens, USDC supply is 9.65B , up around 10% in the past month.

In his latest Weekly Insight (Week 161, Sept. 27, 2025), the analyst opens with a blunt reset of stance: “I am bullish.” He acknowledges the psychological toll of recent chop and public pushback—“I am getting pushback from all sides for staying bullish… But I also do not really care”—yet he frames the current drawdown as the kind of fear-laced inflection that historically precedes a trend resumption higher. Why Is Everyone Wrong About XRP? The note situates the call against a noisy backdrop. He cites well-followed traders who either called a top or de-risked into weakness, and the victory laps of dominance-maxi voices after a bounce in Bitcoin dominance. The riposte is data-driven: sentiment gauges near “fear” readings of 40 or below, a zone that has repeatedly coincided with local lows or pre-reversal conditions. While he concedes that “we could see a slight further correction,” the weight of evidence, he argues, skews to upside. Related Reading: Demand For XRP On CME Explodes As Reports Show Over $18 Billion A key pillar is liquidity mapping. On Bitcoin, he highlights sizeable resting liquidity around $106,000—a pool that has persisted since mid-July and remains uncollected despite spot advances as high as $123,000. “I would expect this 106k area of liquidity to be taken, maybe even down to 104k with a wick,” he writes, emphasizing that a tag into that zone would not invalidate the higher-timeframe bull structure. Crucially, he says, the “largest amount of liquidity ever” sits above price, implying that if a major top were in, “market makers… would [not] allow that much liquidity to remain untouched.” By contrast, lower-side liquidity down around $70,000 is drying up, suggesting reduced gravitational pull to the downside as stale longs and shorts have been flushed or realized. That skew, he says, is even more pronounced across majors and large-cap alts. On daily time frames for ETH, Cardano, XRP, and SUI, “significant liquidity” has rebuilt above spot, while “minor” pockets remain below—an asymmetry that makes precise dip-buy levels hard to pre-declare yet keeps the “ultimate outcome” biased to a leg higher. The timing cue rests on two oscillators that often mark rotation windows: ETH is now as oversold on the 4-hour as it was at the exact cycle bottom around $1,400—a setup not seen again during its run toward $5,000—while Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has reached overbought on the 4-hour. “The last three times this happened, it marked either a local high, the exact high, or came just before a larger drawdown in Bitcoin Dominance,” he notes. Related Reading: Technical Convergence Puts XRP Profit Target Between $8.43 And $13.58 On the weekly, he expects the structural outcome to be an acceleration lower in dominance later in the cycle, and he leaves open whether that moment is now. The mosaic—ETH deeply oversold, BTC.D heavily overbought, liquidity stacked above alts—supports his conclusion that “very soon it is likely to be the altcoin show.” Within that rotation, XRP vs. ETH is his sharpest edge. On the 4-hour XRP/ETH chart, he sees a local bottom structure—“a series of lows, higher lows, and higher highs”—with a trigger level at 0.00071 ETH per XRP: “We are looking for closes above the 0.00071 level, and the larger the timeframe of the close above that level, the greater the likelihood of reversal.” On the weekly XRP/ETH, he sketches two Elliott-wave roadmaps: a conservative five-wave path back to the prior highs against ETH, and a higher-beta alternative that starts from the candle structure shift and implies “exponential growth” in relative terms this cycle. The combined thesis is explicit: “ETH looks poised to perform well… [and] XRP looks ready to outperform ETH on top of that. Use your imagination for what could happen if those two things play out together.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.86.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-october-19-could-be-xrps-mainstream-moment-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Ripple Van Winkle has directed attention toward October 19, framing it as a potential turning point for XRP and the broader digital asset market. On this date, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to deliver its decision regarding the 21Shares Core Spot XRP Trust. The outcome could establish the first U.S.-listed spot ETF for XRP, opening pathways for financial institutions, pensions, and retirement accounts to gain regulated exposure to the asset. October 19 isn’t just another SEC deadline. If the $XRP ETF is approved, billions in retirement funds + pensions get the green light. Think Bitcoin ETF flows — but with a token built for banking rails. This could be XRP’s mainstream moment. pic.twitter.com/IiIleZCFhj — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) September 28, 2025 Comparing XRP’s Prospects with Bitcoin’s ETF Path In both the attached post and video, Ripple Van Winkle pointed to the precedent set by Bitcoin ETFs . The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs led to substantial inflows in their first month, with leading asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity playing a pivotal role in mainstream adoption. He emphasized that the effect of an XRP ETF could be similar, but with the added distinction that XRP has already been positioned for cross-border payments and financial settlement use cases. According to him, the ETF framework serves as the bridge that connects traditional capital with digital assets. This connection, if extended to XRP, would represent a shift from retail-driven demand to a foundation built on structural inflows from major financial institutions. ETF Approval and Institutional Access Ripple Van Winkle detailed how approval would extend XRP’s accessibility to retirement funds, pensions, and the clients of financial advisors. These pools of capital have largely been restricted from direct crypto participation due to regulatory and compliance hurdles. Through an ETF structure, such restrictions would be eased, enabling large-scale participation. He underscored that this is not merely speculative enthusiasm but the introduction of a regulated pathway for institutional capital to enter the XRP market. By describing the decision as a potential “switch” for Wall Street, he highlighted the magnitude of change that a single approval date could represent. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Market Implications Ripple Van Winkle concluded by suggesting that if approved, XRP would undergo a transition from being primarily an asset of niche communities to one recognized as Wall Street-certified. Such recognition would, in his view, reposition XRP from what he called “underground” status to a financial product with mainstream credibility. He linked this directly to the structural demand that ETFs have historically generated across other asset classes, pointing to the Bitcoin example as a reference point. His assessment reflects a growing view that regulated investment products tied to digital assets could be central in bridging traditional finance with blockchain-based solutions. For XRP, the October 19 decision now stands as a date of heightened anticipation, with market participants closely watching whether the SEC will deliver the first green light for a spot ETF tied to the asset.

Key Takeaways: Aster led all DeFi protocols with over $25 million in daily fees, far surpassing rivals like Hyperliquid. Despite lower trading volume, Aster is gaining traction with its unique “hidden orders” feature and recent token launch. Backed by YZi Labs and endorsed by CZ, Aster’s valuation has soared to $15.1 billion since its rebrand and September token debut. The protocol is significantly ahead of competitors like Hyperliquid, which brought in $3.17 million over the same period. Despite ranking fifth in fees, Hyperliquid outpaces Aster in daily volume. Hyperliquid Triples Aster in Spot Volume, DefiLlama Data Shows DefiLlama data shows Hyperliquid logged $477.3 million in spot trading volume, while Aster recorded $199.96 million, placing it 13th overall. Notably, Aster does not yet appear on the aggregator’s daily revenue leaderboard. Aster, previously known as APX Finance, rebranded in March after merging with Astherus. The platform is backed by YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs) and has built its presence on multi-chain support, with an initial focus on BNB Chain. What sets Aster apart from other perpetual DEXs is its “hidden orders” feature, which allows traders to place completely invisible limit orders. This deviates from the transparency of most on-chain order books and has caught the attention of users seeking stealth execution strategies. The protocol saw a wave of new users following its token launch on September 17, during which its token price experienced a rapid surge. Momentum picked up further when Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao endorsed the project on X, confirming that YZi Labs holds a minority stake. “Few understand this,” Zhao posted. “Aster competes with Binance, but helps BNB.” Few understand this.

The token now commands a fully diluted valuation of $15.1 billion, an impressive climb from its $560 million valuation at launch. While volume and visibility metrics may vary, Aster’s spike in protocol fees positions it as a rising force in the on-chain derivatives space. Aster Reimburses Traders After XPL Price Glitch Triggers Liquidations On Friday, Aster reimbursed users in USDT after a sudden price spike in the XPL perpetual contract triggered forced liquidations. The anomaly, which occurred during the transition from pre-launch to live trading, saw the price of XPL briefly surge to over $4, well above its $1.30 average on other platforms. The exchange responded quickly, completing the first round of reimbursements within hours and compensating affected traders for liquidation and trading fees. While the exact cause remains unconfirmed, early speculation points to a misconfigured index price or missing sync with live market data. Aster has pledged to continue its investigation into the incident. The glitch followed the mainnet launch of Plasma, a stablecoin-focused Layer 1 whose native token XPL rapidly hit a $12 billion valuation. Despite the setback, Aster continues to gain momentum, recently surpassing Hyperliquid in daily perpetuals volume. Its unique “hidden orders” feature has also helped the platform stand out in a competitive market.

Interestingly, the hype’s well-founded this time. One of the most creative meme coin experiments of the year, this crypto presale combines virtual mining and GameFi mechanics with a multilayered reward structure. Let’s take a deep dive into the mine-to-earn crypto and understand why PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) could become the best meme coin that defines 2025. The Crypto Mining Crisis: Explained The early crypto history is filled with stories of geeks and shrewd investors who made a fortune from blockchain mining. So, it makes sense that crypto mining has intrigued investors for a very long time. But here’s the problem. Mining is ridiculously expensive and labor-intensive today; the sector is closed off to people without technical or financial capital. Serious mining requires ASICs (Application-specific Integrated Circuits) and high-end GPUs, which cost thousands of dollars each. The operation cost is not pocket-friendly either, with massive power consumption. In fact, some industrial mining set-ups are notorious for using up enough energy to power a small city. Crypto mining technology is also evolving rapidly, making it harder for small players to adapt and scale. Although cloud mining emerged as a no-hardware, no-hassle alternative to traditional mining, its popularity was short-lived. To begin with, high fees and low margins make it less appealing. But the bigger issue is the rampant Ponzi-style scams. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) sets out to make crypto mining more inclusive and less frustrating. PEPENODE: Mine-to-Earn Magic For All PEPENODE introduces a gamified virtual mining system where you can buy miner nodes, build rigs, and start earning attractive rewards from crypto mining. The simulated environment offers a fun and eco-friendly alternative to crypto mining rewards with interactive gameplay. And due to smart contracts, the ownership is smooth and transparent. The first thing you need to do is set up a virtual server room. In traditional crypto mining, a server room is a space with racks of servers that handle mining operations. Since the servers need to be cooled all the time, the room consumes a lot of electricity. But PEPENODE’s virtual server rooms are gamified dashboards, where you store your digital miner nodes. Their simulated hash rate translates to attractive rewards, paid in $PEPENODE tokens. And there’s no electricity to consume, no cooling problems, no hassle. To maximize your earning potential, you can try out different node combinations and even upgrade your facilities. The more hash power you accumulate, the faster you climb the leaderboard. And here’s something else to keep in mind: if you get a higher ranking on the leaderboard, you can get bonus meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN aside from $PEPENODE. Plus, the dashboard will show your mining progress and accumulated rewards, letting you tweak your game as you move ahead. The fun and addictive GameFi set-up is why PEPENODE has become a phenomenon among meme coin investors this season. Gaming tokens have also shown significant growth recently ( the market is nearing $17.5 billion now ). The PEPENODE Presale Window is Now Open $PEPENODE tokens are currently in the presale phase, selling at a very low price of $0.0010788 before their TGE. Once the token hits exchanges, investors will have to pay market prices to buy the tokens and join the mine-to-earn system. The presale is divided into multiple phases with an ascending pricing structure. So the earlier you join, the lower the entry point and the bigger your early-bird advantage. But there are more reasons to join early: Stake your tokens for over 800% APY (a $200 investment now could turn to $1,800 in a year’s time). Get stronger mining rigs with better node power, which can make a huge difference in your earning potential. Secure a higher position on the leaderboard, and earn bonus rewards in top trending cryptos like Dogecoin. For detailed instructions on joining the presale, read our ‘How to Buy $PEPENODE’ guide. Could PEPENODE Outperform Pepe in the Uptober Rally? Although meme coins are known for making millionaires out of small investors, it’s only a tiny fraction of the crowded market that tastes success. Most meme coins bite the dust seconds after their launch. And those that do win might ultimately fail to sustain the momentum, fuelled by speculation more than substance. For example, Pepe is now selling over 65% down from its all-time high , recorded ten months ago. PEPENODE is a rare exception. It comes with a Pepe tag, but it doesn’t rely on Pepe’s brand value to generate and sustain interest. Instead, it focuses on building a strong community using thrilling GameFi mechanics. With the GameFi market expected to reach $200.72B by 2034 – with a CAGR of 28.50% from 2025 to 2034 – it wouldn’t be surprising to see $PEPENODE outperform $PEPE in the next two to three years. But what about this year? According to our PEPENODE price prediction , the meme coin could climb to $0.0023 with a 114% gain, or slightly over a 2x return, by the end of the year itself. Once the token is live, holders can start building virtual server rooms, set up miner nodes, and earn rewards. Join the presale early to grab the token at $0.0010788 before the next price surge . But as always, do your own research before investing in crypto. This is not financial advice.

Renowned CEO Mike Novogratz admitted that he misjudged XRP's survival and praised Ripple's strength and community support. At this point, Novogrtaz said he believes XRP will not be able to weather the legal storm it experienced with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. However, Novogratz stated that this idea was wrong and that XRP had proven its strength and durability. Stating that XRP's power is backed by its loyal army, the famous CEO said that the community helped XRP recover. Novogratz praised Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and attorney John Deaton for their frontline leadership, noting that the XRP case is more than just a legal battle and proves how a loyal community can protect a crypto project. “XRP has one of the strongest communities that currently exist. “In this respect, it's similar to Bitcoin. The XRP example shows how crypto projects can weather tough times when their backers are strongly supportive of them.” Admitting that XRP has been one of the best-performing altcoins since November 2024, with the end of the Ripple SEC cases, Novogratz commented, “Who could have predicted this?” XRP has become one of the best-performing altcoins, with a 47.4% increase since November 2024. *This is not investment advice.

XWIN Research noted that Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization/Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has fallen to 2, indicating that it is exiting an overheated phase and entering a more stable range. According to the analyst, in previous cycles, this level served as a point where the bull run resumed after a medium-term correction. While recent volatility has investors on edge, on-chain data continues to show that Bitcoin's bull market is far from over. At this point, the MVRV ratio, which is at 2, has entered its strongest bullish phase after Bitcoin consolidated in past cycles. Similar to patterns in 2017 and 2020, the current correction could represent the middle phase of the broader bull market and the uptrend could continue, analysts said. XWIN Research also noted that selling pressure from long-term holders has decreased significantly, saying these two metrics suggest that “this cycle has not yet reached its final phase.” Analysts recently said that the recent consolidation in Bitcoin “could form the basis for the next major upward wave, suggesting that the bull market is alive and well.” Ethereum May Experience Sharp Rises! XWIN Research also released its analysis on Ethereum (ETH). He said that downside liquidity has been exhausted in the Ethereum (ETH) futures market, increasing the possibility of a short squeeze. Analysts stated that sharp increases could be seen at this point, and that with the recent declines, long positions have been exhausted, leaving only short positions remaining. “Following the volatility of recent months, both long and short positions have been largely liquidated. Only large short positions above the current price remain. In the current situation, even a small price increase could trigger gradual short-term liquidations and lead to a sharp rally.” *This is not investment advice.

Some overlooked coins could draw attention if trends reverse. As traders watch for hints of new momentum, certain tokens stand out despite recent weakness. Which risky bets could surprise everyone and stand in the spotlight as the month unfolds? The next few weeks could provide unexpected winners. Ethereum’s Next Leap: Why the Smart Contract Giant Still Shines Ethereum began as Vitalik Buterin’s bold idea in 2013 and went live in 2015. It lets anyone write tiny bits of self-running code called smart contracts, and thousands of apps now sit on top of it, from games to big money markets. In 2022 the network moved from energy-heavy mining to clean staking, rewarding users who lock coins to keep the chain safe. Extra layers like Arbitrum and Polygon make trades quick and cheap, while the coming sharding step should cut costs even more. Every move still needs ETH, giving the coin a steady, built-in role. Market watchers see fresh fuel ahead. Bitcoin’s halving next year often pulls the whole space higher, and Ethereum usually outruns most rivals once momentum starts. Based on past cycles, the forecast puts ETH in a $2,700–$6,580 range for 2025, climbing roughly each year to around $18,500 by 2030. Steady staking rewards, rising use of ERC-20 tokens, and growth on Layer 2s add extra push. While newer chains promise speed, few match Ethereum’s deep pool of apps and developers, so many traders view dips under $3,000 as a long-term chance rather than a threat. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.0055 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges UNI Rise: Why Uniswap’s Voice Token Could Lead the Next DeFi Wave Uniswap changed online trading in 2018 by letting people swap coins without giving up control of their wallets. In 2020 it added UNI, a coin that acts like a vote. Owners pick rules for fees, rewards, and new tools. The team dropped 150 million UNI on early users to beat a new rival, SushiSwap. Each early user woke up to 400 UNI, worth more than $1,000 on day one. That gift won quick loyalty and put UNI on the map. Today Uniswap ranks fourth in all of decentralized finance with over $3 billion locked. Its open code, free listings, and no order book model keep costs low and access wide. Many traders now prefer self-custody after last year’s big exchange failures, and that trend lifts UNI demand. While Bitcoin and Ethereum still set the tone, fresh cash often flows next into tokens that give real use. UNI ticks that box by turning holders into voters. If online finance heats up in this cycle, UNI could move from backstage to spotlight. Avalanche Surge: Why AVAX Is Racing Ahead in Crypto's New Season Avalanche, or AVAX, runs on its own eco-friendly network. It moves fast, settling deals in under two seconds and handling roughly 4,500 moves every second. Tiny fees keep wallets happy. The system has three linked chains that split up jobs like payments, apps, and record keeping. Users can even launch private ""Subnets,"" building their own mini blockchains without slowing the main road. A special mix of voting rules, borrowed from both old and new ideas, keeps everything safe. The AVAX coin powers it all, paying fees, rewarding stakers, and booting up new Subnets. The market is waking up after a sleepy year, and fast chains are in style. While Bitcoin steals headlines, fresh money often rolls next into smart-contract coins. Ethereum still feels crowded and costly, and rivals like Solana have faced stops and starts. Avalanche keeps ticking, offering speed with no drama. Big brands are testing gaming and asset projects on Subnets, a hint of growing demand. Staking also locks up many coins, squeezing supply. Recent analysis from crypto research firms, including platforms like cryptona , suggests AVAX could see significant momentum as institutional interest in high-performance blockchain solutions grows. If the cycle keeps heating, these points could lift AVAX higher. For traders eyeing the next sprint, Avalanche looks ready out of the blocks. NEAR: A Fast, Friendly Home for the Next Wave of Web Apps NEAR is a fresh network that wants to make building open apps as easy as using a website. It breaks its workload into small pieces, a trick called sharding, so many users can join at once without slowdowns. The core plan came from Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, and big investors gave them over $20 million to grow it. Tools such as Nightshade, the Rainbow Bridge, and Aurora link NEAR to Ethereum and cut fees, letting tokens move freely between the two worlds. Market watchers love speed and low cost, so NEAR fits the story of this cycle. While some older chains struggle when traffic spikes, NEAR stays smooth because each shard runs in parallel. That gives it a feel more like cloud storage than a scattered ledger. If the next wave of apps needs quick finality and cheap transfers, NEAR could capture attention much like Solana did last year. Prices still swing with Bitcoin’s mood, yet growing use and bridges to Ethereum hint that the coin may have room to climb. Conclusion ETH, UNI, AVAX, and NEAR look strong for Uptober, but First All-Sport Memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) fuses sports fandom with meme culture, eyeing outsized gains in the unfolding 2025 bull run.

What are Whales up to?,https://cryptopotato.com/is-a-mega-ripple-xrp-price-rally-coming-soon-what-are-whales-up-to/,"Recent on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows a major rise in activity from XRP whale addresses. The metric, which tracks wallets that moved large amounts of XRP within the past 24 hours, has climbed rapidly since late 2023. This is the highest level recorded since 2015. The price of XRP remains more or less steady in this period, notwithstanding the spike in whale transactions. Similar patterns in the past, where accumulation increased during a sideways price movement, have often been followed by powerful upward moves. Mikybull Crypto commented: Wow! The most aggressive $XRP accumulation is going on right now This is massively bullish https://t.co/jnfS6EWJbt pic.twitter.com/47ojxRmdhh — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) September 28, 2025 Familiar XRP Price Pattern Forms Again Charts shared by Mikybull Crypto show XRP forming a descending channel. The previous one appeared in mid-2024, before XRP rose from below $0.6 to nearly $3.6. The cryptocurrency was trading around $2.77 at press time. The same setup led to a major price increase earlier this year. The pattern looks nearly identical, and traders are watching for signs of a breakout from the current range. The chart also shows the phrase “XRP is dead” placed near past lows, calling attention to bearish market sentiment that appeared just before price surges. Bull Flag Setup Shows Possible Breakout Another daily chart, shared by Bitcoinsensus, outlines a bull flag setup. This is where price moves up sharply, then consolidates in a downward-sloping channel. In the current chart, XRP has bounced off the same support zone multiple times, while being rejected at the same resistance level. Source: Bitcoinsensus/X Meanwhile, the formation remains consistent, and a break above the trendline could open the door to higher prices. Bitcoinsensus suggests that if the pattern plays out, XRP could cross the $4 mark for the first time. A similar structure played out earlier this year, followed by a steep rise. XRP ETF Decisions Near Key Deadlines XRP is also facing a wave of decisions around exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings. The SEC is scheduled to respond to six XRP ETF proposals between October 18 and November 14, 2025. These include applications from firms such as Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton. Upcoming Decision Deadlines for XRP ETF Applications The first ETF to launch this year, REX-Osprey’s XRPR, began trading on September 18. With multiple deadlines approaching, XRP is entering a critical regulatory window that could bring more market attention. Crypto lawyer Bill Morgan raised questions about risk warnings in ETF documents. Referencing the Cyber Hornet S&P500/XRP ETF, he noted : “One of the risks mentioned is manipulation by XRP whales.” He added, “If an institutional applicant for an ETF acknowledges the risk of whale manipulation, then it should be considered a real risk.” The post Is a Mega Ripple (XRP) Price Rally Coming Soon?

According to a Bloomberg report , the move marks a significant shift in how the Middle East’s largest lender by assets handles cross-border transactions. Why did Qatar National Bank adopt Kinexys? By leveraging Kinexys, QNB becomes the first Qatari bank to adopt JPMorgan’s blockchain-powered payment rail for US dollar settlements, giving its business clients access to near-instant fund transfers regardless of traditional banking hours. The bank now offers payments in as little as two minutes, a development described by QNB’s head of transactional banking, Kamel Moris, as “a treasurer’s dream.” For corporate clients who have long dealt with the friction of legacy banking systems, often limited to weekday operations and delayed settlement times, the transition promises a meaningful upgrade. Faster, automated, and traceable payments can improve cash flow visibility and reduce the operational headaches associated with global treasury management. And for QNB, it’s not just about efficiency; the integration with Kinexys also positions the bank to remain competitive in an increasingly digital and decentralized financial environment. With this rollout, QNB joins a growing cohort of major MENA-region banks, including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Emirates NBD, and Saudi National Bank, that are already part of the Kinexys network. JPMorgan’s Kinexys system, which was launched in 2019, currently processes around $3 billion worth of transactions daily. While that figure is still a small slice of the $10 trillion in total daily flows across JPMorgan’s broader payments division, executives say the blockchain network is scaling fast . Among future plans, the bank’s long-term strategy hinges on opening Kinexys to other financial institutions, including those outside its direct client base, by tapping into its massive global correspondent banking network. This open architecture could allow more regional banks to tap into high-speed, on-chain infrastructure without building it themselves. “This is institutional-grade scale,” said Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys, speaking to Bloomberg. According to Mallela, blockchain adoption across banking remains slow but is reaching a tipping point as treasurers and corporate finance teams demand faster, more transparent alternatives to traditional systems like SWIFT. Qatar National Bank’s blockchain push QNB’s blockchain foray doesn’t stop with Kinexys, as the bank has quietly been exploring multiple blockchain and tokenization initiatives over the past few years. For instance, in 2021, QNB and Ripple launched a pilot for a blockchain-based cross-border remittance service via its Turkish subsidiary, Finansbank, using RippleNet . Then, in July this year, the bank introduced the first tokenized money market fund dubbed QCD Money Market within the Dubai International Financial Centre via a collaboration with DMZ Finance. QNB has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatar Financial Centre during Web Summit Qatar 2025, pledging to support fintech firms by offering access to its banking infrastructure. The development came just months after the Qatar Financial Center released a new regulatory framework for digital assets.

That run etched SHIB into crypto folklore and reminded everyone that timing can turn pocket change into fortunes in this market. But four years on, SHIB story is different. Its market cap has swelled into the billions, its upside potential is capped by size, and the days of 100x or 1,000x moves are gone. Investors seeking the next breakout are searching for a token with SHIB-like energy, but with the advantage of being early. Increasingly, that search is leading them to Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Why SHIB’s big moment has passed The community was hungry for alternatives to Dogecoin, and SHIB low entry price invited millions of retail investors to pile in. The result was one of the fastest ascents in crypto history. Today, though, SHIB is a much larger, slower-moving asset. With a massive market cap, any significant rise requires vast new capital inflows. While it remains a respected name with ongoing development in its ecosystem, SHIB is unlikely to recreate the big gains of four years ago. For investors, it’s a token that might grow steadily, but the dream of turning $1,200 into six figures belongs to the past. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the new contender Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE), the meme coin stealing attention in 2025. At first glance, it looks like another community-driven token built around meme culture. But under the surface, it’s charting a much bigger course. The initiative is developing an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain just for meme coins. It promises faster transactions, lower costs, and protection from sniper bots. LILPEPE aspires to be more than simply a meme; it wants to be the technology that powers the next generation of meme tokens. That story alone has excited people, but the figures behind its presale tell an even bigger story. Presale momentum proves investor confidence Currently in Stage 13 of its presale, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022 per token. It has raised over $26.1 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens. These are remarkable figures for a meme coin still in its early stages, showing strong belief from retail traders and whales. Unlike many meme tokens that launch with hype but little credibility, LILPEPE has already taken major steps to establish trust. It has been audited by CertiK and is listed on CoinMarketCap, two milestones that assure investors that this project is here to stay. Adding to the momentum are community-focused campaigns. The team is running a $777,000 giveaway where ten winners will each receive $77,000 worth of tokens, and there’s a special promotion for presale buyers between Stage 12 and Stage 17. Price forecasts and the $120,000 potential The real draw of LILPEPE is its upside potential. Analysts forecast that after exchange listings, the token could rally to $0.1 after exchange listings0, representing a 45x gain from its current presale price. Longer-term projections are even more ambitious, with many predicting LILPEPE could reach $1 to $3 by 2026. For an investor today, this is where the SHIB comparison becomes striking. A $1,200 stake in LILPEPE at the presale price of $0.0022 could be worth more than $54,000 if the token hits $0.10. If it climbs to $1, that $1,200 would balloon into over $540,000, surpassing the six-figure returns SHIB delivered in 2021. Conclusion The perfect time to flip $1,200 into $120,000 with Shiba Inu was four years ago. That opportunity has passed, and SHIB is now a large-cap token unlikely to repeat its historic run. But the meme coin space always evolves, and this year, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has emerged as the standout contender to deliver the next wave of life-changing gains. With its booming presale, CertiK audit, CoinMarketCap listing, viral promotions, and ambitious Layer-2 vision, LILPEPE offers the mix of affordability and upside that made SHIB a legend. For investors hunting the next great meme coin success story, the path forward is becoming clear: the profits of 2021 may have belonged to SHIB, but 2025 could belong to Little Pepe.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading this charge, steadily climbing from $0.01 in its early presale to $0.035 in Phase 6. With Phase 7 poised at $0.04, traders are witnessing a 15% upcoming increase, making MUTM the next crypto targeting $1 by 2026. This presale momentum is attracting attention, creating strong FOMO among early investors who want exposure before the price rises further. Presale snapshot and core mechanics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on a dual lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) strategies to maximize utility and adoption. The presale has already raised around $16.50 million during Phase 6, with over 16,650 holders securing positions in the 4 billion total supply. Currently priced at $0.035, half of the 170 million token supply for this phase has already been sold. Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.04, reflecting a 15% jump. The platform has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit, including manual review and static analysis, achieving a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. The project maintains strong social credibility with 12,000+ Twitter followers, an active $50,000 bug bounty pool, and an ongoing $100,000 giveaway . The P2C lending model is straightforward yet powerful. A depositor can lend $15,000 USDT to a stablecoin pool, receiving mtUSDT on a 1:1 basis. With average pool utilization generating 15% APY, the lender earns $2,250 annually, providing steady passive income. These mtUSDT tokens can also be used as collateral for borrowing other assets, boosting liquidity and enhancing the lending ecosystem. Stablecoin pools attract long-term lenders, ensuring MUTM maintains a solid liquidity foundation for growth. On the borrower side, users can leverage their ETH holdings. Locking $1,000 worth of ETH allows the borrower to access $750 in stablecoins at a 75% loan-to-value ratio, retaining market exposure while unlocking capital. The system is designed with robust collateralization and liquidation thresholds—ETH is set at 75% LTV with an 80% liquidation trigger, while more volatile assets have 40–50% LTV capped at 65% for liquidation. The stability factor ensures solvency across the protocol, shielding users from systemic risks and maintaining confidence. P2P lending caters to risk-tolerant investors. Meme coins like DOGE and PEPE are isolated in these pools, allowing lenders to earn higher returns without affecting the main stablecoin liquidity. This separation ensures the platform remains resilient while offering diversified earning opportunities. Driving demand through future catalysts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers multiple avenues for value growth that are set to increase demand in the coming months. The upcoming beta launch will allow investors to experience the full dual lending features that will drive the demand up and build user confidence. The integration of Layer-2 solutions will drastically reduce transaction costs and increase processing speed compared to Layer-1 alternatives. This technical upgrade will support higher adoption by making the platform more accessible for lenders and borrowers. Additionally, the stablecoin mechanics and dual lending model will provide consistent utility, ensuring that MUTM serves a real purpose beyond speculation. The platform’s roadmap includes potential listings on major exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC. These listings will increase visibility, allowing a broader audience to access the token and engage with its real-world applications. With more users testing and interacting with the lending and borrowing features, MUTM’s demand is likely to expand. The current dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard features firsthand, giving users the ability to track holdings, calculate ROI, and compete for bonus tokens. These interactive tools are expected to enhance engagement and foster community participation, creating more reasons for investors to acquire MUTM. People who bought $10,000 worth of MUTM at $0.01 in Phase 1 now have 1 million tokens that are worth $35,000 at the Phase 6 price. At $0.06, when it goes public, that investment will be worth $60,000. By 2026, it is predicted to be worth $1 each token, which would make it worth $1 million. Even new investors who buy in at $0.035 in Phase 6 can see their investment grow by over 28X by the target date, which makes the token even more tempting in a market that isn’t sure what to do. If you’re not sure if crypto is a solid investment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a convincing case for it. It has loan yields, P2P innovation, access to beta launches, Layer-2 integration, stablecoin pools, and new exchange listings on the way. People are still talking about the crypto meltdown today and making guesses about what will happen next.

If it were to proceed, the move could mark the first time a company simultaneously lists in New York and joins London’s benchmark FTSE 100, potentially giving the U.K.’s financial center a much-needed vote of confidence, the newspaper said. The London-based firm is said to be valued at around $75 billion and has amassed 65 million users globally, including 12 million in the U.K. It began as a travel-focused prepaid card and has since expanded into stock and crypto trading , hotel bookings, and business accounts. Data from TheTie shows that the firm has raised $3.77 billion since its launch. The company was reportedly looking to raise $1 billion at a $65 billion valuation earlier this year. CEO Nik Storonsky has pushed for an IPO to allow early investors to exit, and had previously dismissed London as a venue due to the U.K.'s 0.5% tax, known as stamp duty, on share trading. Storonsky's stance appears to be softening. New rules introduced this month allow large firms to enter the FTSE 100 within just five days of listing, a change that could unlock major demand from index-tracking funds and boost liquidity. Storonsky called the U.K. Revolut’s “home country” at the opening of its new headquarters in London last week, an event also attended by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Revolut Chairman Martin Gilbert, the Sunday Times said.

These coins remain crucial in cryptocurrency, but 2025 may offer new opportunities as lucrative as these high returns. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) stand out this time. They’re attracting attention due to their distinctive traits, which could boost industry growth. Bitcoin and Ripple: two significant cryptocurrencies with unique stories Famous cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and XRP are developing on opposite paths. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, has experienced steady growth, including a 1,800% surge in 2017. Bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency, attracts investors like MicroStrategy and Tesla because it is a secure way to deposit wealth. Because many people use it and there are only 21 million coins, it’s a popular alternative for long-term coin holders who want to avoid rising prices and uncertain economies. It’s the #1 crypto entry point due to its rising daily popularity. However, XRP promises to revolutionize the financial system by making international money transfers cheaper and more efficient. It rose 36,000% in 2017; however, it has encountered issues, including a lawsuit by the US SEC. XRP is a competitor, as it can be used for real-world payments and has partnerships with major banks. As more major investors show interest and the restrictions are removed, XRP could increase in value. Because of their tenacity, Bitcoin and XRP are probably going to continue to lead the constantly changing cryptocurrency industry into 2025. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the meme coin that’s picking up speed fast Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is turning into a big player in the meme coin world, ready to chase after hits like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), but with way better basics and room to grow. Its presale has brought in over $25.8 million and moved nearly 15.9 billion tokens, showing real buzz—and it might spike like Avalanche (AVAX) did, going from $0.33 to $5.61 after its presale. What makes Little Pepe special is its smart plan for Layer 2 technology to handle a large number of trades as more people join in. Plus, its 95% Certik check score adds trust and safety, making investors feel good about it. With more than 41,000 owners and 30,000 folks chatting in the Telegram group, Little Pepe has built a fired-up crowd that’s key for keeping things rolling. If Little Pepe keeps this momentum, people who get in early could see 35 times their money or more, making it one of the most fun meme coin bets for 2025. Its spot on CoinMarketCap boosts its reach, with over 103 million views in August 2025, and the community continues to grow. Hyperliquid (HYPE): a growing DeFi powerhouse with big backers Hyperliquid (HYPE) is another coin stirring things up in crypto, with the chance to match the huge rises of Bitcoin and XRP. As a spot for decentralized, endless trading, Hyperliquid has added some fresh tricks in DeFi, including integration with MetaMask for trading and a USDH stablecoin tied to BlackRock’s BUIDL fund. These moves make it a strong choice in the world of decentralized finance. A significant part of Hyperliquid’s success is the rapid onboarding of large groups. With increased interest from prominent financial institutions, such as Circle testing native USDC links and being listed on the Swiss exchange SIX, it’s becoming a top choice for serious investors. Additionally, the upcoming Hyperliquid V2 update and USDH launch will enhance its capabilities, making it even more appealing in DeFi and for large players. Currently, at $52.14, with a total value exceeding $17 billion, Hyperliquid has seen $346 million in trades in just 24 hours. Its smart setup—using 97% of fees to buy back tokens—keeps demand steady, and rewards for staking give people good reasons to stick around. Conclusion: the next hot spots in crypto While Bitcoin and XRP continue to influence the crypto market, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) are poised to shine in 2025. Little Pepe’s fun meme vibe, backed by a strong crowd and solid setup, looks set for huge payoffs. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s advanced trading spot, interest from big money, and new ideas make it a strong runner in DeFi. Both projects look great for anyone chasing big growth. Sure, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are set in stone, but Little Pepe and Hyperliquid are lined up for massive jumps and are worth a look if you’re eyeing the next crypto boom.

Overnight Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 17 points, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures stayed flat but firm. These came after a losing week on Wall Street where enthusiasm for artificial intelligence lost momentum. Nvidia’s $100 billion partnership with OpenAI led to investor skepticism about whether the business model could last. The S&P 500 dropped 0.3% last week, its worst since August 1, and is now 0.8% below its record high. The Nasdaq fell 0.7%, its weakest since early August. The Dow slipped 0.2%, ending a three‑week winning streak. In Asia, Sony Financial Group soared 36% on its market debut Monday after Sony Group completed a spinoff of the unit. The stock received a reference price of 150 Japanese yen per share, valuing it at about 1 trillion yen or $6.7 billion. Sony said the separation lets its financial arm, which includes Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank, raise growth capital while keeping its ties to the wider Sony ecosystem. Broader Japan markets moved lower after setting record highs last week, with the Nikkei 225 down 0.84% and the Topix down 1.57%. In contrast, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.71%. South Korea’s Kospi rose 1.25% after a steep fall Friday tied to uncertainty over trade talks with Washington. The small‑cap Kosdaq was up 1.29%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index opened 1.19% higher and the Hang Seng Tech Index gained 1.5%. Mainland China’s CSI 300 stayed flat. Asian and European markets record synchronized gains In Europe, the pan‑European Stoxx 600 added about 0.3% by 9:25 a.m. in London (4:25 a.m. Eastern time) with most sectors in the green. The FTSE 100 gained 0.4% while the DAX and CAC 40 each rose about 0.1%. These levels reflected broad early‑morning buying across European stock markets. Gold traded higher after logging a sixth weekly gain as traders assessed whether a possible U.S. government shutdown could delay the release of critical jobs data and cloud the Federal Reserve’s policy outlook. Bullion made yet another all-time high above $3,800 an ounce Monday. Prices rose 4.8% last week on inflows into bullion‑backed exchange‑traded funds and increased tensions between Russia and Europe. Gold has climbed 44% this year, marking successive peaks supported by central bank demand and renewed Fed rate cuts. It is on track for a third straight quarterly gain next week with holdings in bullion‑backed ETFs at their highest since 2022. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank have both projected the rally to continue. Precious metals, currencies and Bitcoin extend rallies Silver extended its rally after topping $45 an ounce last week for the first time in 14 years. Investors increased purchases of silver‑backed ETFs, drawing down stockpiles of freely available metal in London and creating tightness in supply. Lease rates, the cost of borrowing metal for short terms, jumped above 5% from normal levels near zero. Spot gold was 0.4% higher at $3,773.11 an ounce as of 8:11 a.m. in Singapore. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slipped 0.1%. Silver rose 0.6% to $46.4715 an ounce while platinum and palladium also gained. Asian currencies and emerging‑market equities advanced Monday as the dollar weakened and Chinese factory profit data signaled a stabilizing economy. The Bloomberg Asia Dollar Index rose 0.2% while a gauge of the region’s emerging‑market shares climbed 0.9%, its biggest gain in more than two weeks. The Korean won led currencies higher as foreign investors bought the nation’s stocks and Chinese tech shares drove equities higher. The yuan gained 0.2% against the dollar, its strongest move in a month. And the yen gain 0.3% to land at 0.0067. Bitcoin traded above $112,500 with a 2.5% gain in 24 hours, way below its all‑time high of $124,290.93 but still holding firm. Sadly, U.S. Treasury yields fell, as the 10‑year yield dropped more than 4 basis points to 4.143%, the 2‑year slipped 2 basis points to 3.625%, and the 30‑year declined over 5 basis points to 4.714%.

ETH has reclaimed the $4,100 level, and analysts now point to the $4,000 mark as a crucial line of defense. If bulls manage to hold above this support, the market could see a strong surge in the coming days, setting the stage for Ethereum to retest higher levels. Related Reading: Ethereum OI Suffers Its Biggest Cleanup Since Early 2024 – Details Adding weight to this outlook, a key report by CryptoQuant highlights that Ethereum supply on spot exchanges continues to decline. This trend often signals that investors are withdrawing ETH to self-custody or staking, reducing available sell-side liquidity on exchanges. Historically, such declines in exchange reserves have paved the way for rallies, as demand eventually absorbs the reduced supply. However, while the data is supportive, analysts caution that the real catalyst remains demand. Without strong inflows of new buyers, supply-side reductions alone may not be enough to push ETH significantly higher. The coming days will therefore be critical, with Ethereum’s ability to hold above $4,000 serving as a key indicator of whether the next leg of the rally is ready to unfold. Ethereum Outflows Point to Long-Term Bullish Setup According to the CryptoQuant report, recent Ethereum outflows from spot exchanges are largely tied to new buys, where investors purchase ETH and immediately move it into self-custody or staking. This behavior reduces sell-side liquidity and, over time, can create the foundation for price appreciation. Looking at past cycles, clear patterns emerge: Network Congestion & UNI Airdrops: During this phase, high gas fees and strong macro tailwinds fueled demand. Outflows accelerated, leading to a robust bull run as liquidity tightened. Late Bear Phase & FTX Collapse: At the peak of quantitative tightening (QT), the FTX crisis sparked a bank run, with older coins leaving exchanges. Despite fear, improving macro conditions soon restored demand, driving ETH higher. We see the same trend today: reserves are falling, yet prices remain flat as selling offsets new buying. Historically, once demand strengthens, these periods lead to rallies. Importantly, this is not a supply shock in the strict financial sense. Instead, it reflects reduced exchange reserves and lower sell-side pressure. The question is whether demand will accelerate. If rate cuts, slower QT, and rising global liquidity continue, ETH could be primed for a strong long-term move. In the meantime, price volatility is expected. If ETH dips below the accumulating whales’ realized price, it may offer a buying opportunity, just as it has in past cycles. This dynamic shows investor trust in Ethereum and reinforces the view that falling reserves prepare the ground for the next rally.

Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to stabilize after its sharp drop below the $4,000 level, with the latest chart showing a modest recovery to around $4,131. The bounce comes after ETH briefly tested lows near $3,900, suggesting that buyers are stepping in to defend this critical support area. On the 8-hour chart, ETH has reclaimed the 200-day EMA (red line), which is now acting as a short-term pivot point. However, the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages remain above the current price, creating overhead resistance between $4,250 and $4,400. A clean break and consolidation above these levels will be necessary for bulls to regain momentum and target higher ranges toward $4,600. Related Reading: 11 Wallets Receive 295,861 Ethereum ($1.19B) From Major Institutions: Accumulation Or OTC Shuffle? For now, ETH’s structure is fragile. The recent rejection from $4,600 and the subsequent breakdown highlight the intensity of selling pressure. Still, the rebound from sub-$4,000 levels signals that demand remains strong, particularly from accumulation wallets and whales, which have been absorbing supply. If ETH holds above $4,000 and pushes through $4,250, the market could enter a recovery phase. Conversely, failure to maintain this rebound may expose ETH to a retest of $3,800 or even lower support zones. The coming sessions will be critical in defining ETH’s short-term trend.

CRCL benefits from its partnership with Coinbase and earns revenue primarily from interest on US dollar reserves backing USDC. Despite high variable costs and volatility, the company's projected 40% annual growth and potential for operating leverage make its valuation reasonable. I am initiating coverage with a buy rating. Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) has been one of many tech IPO winners this year. Investors may be wondering if now is a good time to buy, given the stock still trades at a big premium to its IPO price tag. I am of the view that the answer leans positively, as the company's business model appears to suggest a growing pot of gold as the network grows. I caution that the stock is likely to trade with great volatility even after the expiration of the IPO lockup period. I am initiating coverage with a buy rating. CRCL Stock Price CRCL went public in June at $31 per share. Even after a fall from the highs, the stock still trades at multiples of that price. Data by YCharts CRCL Stock Key Metrics CRCL owns the stablecoin network behind USDC. USDC is pegged to the US dollar and thus is meant to have stable prices. USDC is the second-largest stablecoin in the world. USDC had a $61 billion market cap as of the second quarter, but as of recently that market cap has already jumped to nearly $74 billion. 2025 Q2 Presentation Stablecoins have come into the limelight, especially after the passage of the GENIUS act. 2025 Q2 Presentation Stablecoins appear to still be in the early innings, but there have already been rising use cases, perhaps the most notable being Coinbase ( COIN ) introducing a stablecoin- backed payment stack for use on Shopify ( SHOP ). COIN is a key partner for CRCL and has been instrumental in helping it get to the critical mass where it is now. 2025 Q2 Presentation CRCL primarily earns revenue from the interest earned on the US dollars backing USDC. The latest quarter saw the company post 53% YoY revenue growth to $658 million, which was roughly equivalent to the 4.3% yield of short-term US Treasuries. However, revenue less distribution costs ('RLTC' and the closest corollary to gross profits for the company) was only 38%, as the company has significant variable costs, with the most important being revenue sharing with COIN. 2025 Q2 Presentation CRCL is generating positive adjusted EBITDA, and I expect it to generate robust GAAP margins over the long term, given the company would not need to ramp up fixed costs as the network grows. I view the company as sort of acting like a ""tax"" on their digital currency, similar to the federal government. 2025 Q2 Presentation Management has given guidance for around 40% annual growth in USDC. 2025 Q2 Presentation I expect the company to see rapid but uneven growth, as growing adoption of USDC may need more time for fleshed-out use cases. Is CRCL Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold? As of recent prices, CRCL traded hands at around 11x sales. At first glance, that might seem like an outright steal given the projected 40% growth rate. Seeking Alpha However we mustn't forget the high variable expenses. After accounting for the low gross margins, CRCL trades for around 29x gross profits. Even at this higher multiple, the valuation looks reasonable if the company really can sustain 40% growth, with the stock trading at around 15x 2027 gross profits. I can see the company sustaining 50% net margins (based on gross profits) over the long term, placing the valuation at around 30x 2027e long-term earnings. Again, that assumption is based on the company being able to simply earn interest revenues on the reserves backing the network without seemingly having any obligation to increase fixed expenses in tandem. One could make an argument that CRCL deserves to trade at premium valuations over the long term due to it being able to simply earn interest revenues that grow in line with the size of the network. Perhaps one might believe that stablecoins like USDC may be to the US dollar what streaming is to watching TV. Stablecoins offer the promise of faster and cheaper transactions. Investors in crypto are undoubtedly familiar with the bullish thesis for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) regarding the potential upside if 1% of all corporate cash was invested in the digital asset. I note that I can see a similar argument being made for stablecoins given the aforementioned technological superiority to ordinary cash. I find the stock buyable at these levels but expect significant volatility as investors may be uneasy about the high valuations given potentially low conviction in the consistency of forward growth rates. CRCL Stock Risks It is admittedly difficult to attempt to explain why USDC would be the stablecoin winner of the future. One could envision a world in which every company has their own stablecoin to handle their specific day-to-day financial transactions (but perhaps a pushback would be the technological difficulty in implementing it). CRCL is quite exposed to interest rates and, ironically, may be a victim in the event of falling rates due to lower revenue earned on the reserves. CRCL is likely to trade with great volatility, especially due to the high valuation and lack of material GAAP profitability. CRCL Stock Conclusion It is possible, if not likely, that CRCL trades down sharply lower sometime in the near future. That said, this looks like the kind of business that can show significant operating leverage as the network grows. The critical question is, of course, why USDC may be the long-term winner. I believe the partnership with COIN is an important catalyst for long-term growth even if the company has to cede a lot of margin in compensation. I rate the stock a buy but caution on the high-risk profile of the investment thesis.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-29 09:35:39

The theft compounds security concerns plaguing Hyperliquid’s ecosystem following the $773,000 HyperDrive exploit and $3.6 million HyperVault rug pull within the same week. The rapid succession of attacks has intensified scrutiny of security practices across projects building on the decentralized exchange platform. Digital Cats Command Six-Figure Prices Despite Global Economic Pressures The Hypurr collection features generative art depicting cartoon cats with various traits, including sunglasses, wizard robes, and armor elements. Distribution allocated 4,313 NFTs to Genesis Event participants, 144 to the Hyper Foundation, and 143 to core contributors, including developers and artists. According to OpenSea data, over 1.3 million HYPE tokens were traded in the past 24 hours, equivalent to $61 million at current prices. The collection maintained 92.8% of supply held by 4,270 unique owners. Community reactions varied widely, with some celebrating life-changing windfalls while others criticized the wealth disparity. Creative director Alex Obymuralex praised the Hypurr design language as “timeless” rather than trend-driven, noting the collection’s simple forms and saturated colors lower intimidation barriers for mainstream adoption. He argued that recognizable silhouettes and joyful palettes create lasting brand equity beyond speculation cycles.

(@obymuralex) September 29, 2025 Early adopters who participated in November’s Genesis Event received the NFTs at no cost beyond their initial platform engagement. The event centered on the launch of Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token and HyperEVM programmability layer. Notably, DripTrade’s over-the-counter system enabled pre-launch trading through collateralized agreements requiring sellers to fulfill transactions within seven days of receiving NFTs or forfeit deposited security. This mechanism allowed price discovery even before official distribution. Security Breaches Threaten Ecosystem Credibility The Hypurr NFT theft follows three major security incidents targeting Hyperliquid projects within one week. HyperDrive DeFi lost $773,000 through router contract vulnerabilities that enabled arbitrary function calls, while HyperVault developers executed a $3.6 million exit scam after ignoring community warnings about fabricated audit claims. HyperDrive DeFi loses $773,000 in router vulnerability exploit as second major Hyperliquid ecosystem breach in 72 hours. #Hyperliquid #Hyperdrive https://t.co/fXGT0KkEQR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 28, 2025 Previous exploits include the March JELLY token manipulation, which cost $13.5 million, and the “ETH 50x Big Guy” trader, who netted a $1.8 million profit while causing $4 million in vault losses. This incident prompted a reduction in maximum leverage limits from 40x to 25x for major cryptocurrencies. Competition intensifies as ASTER DEX processes over $13 billion in daily perpetual futures volume, compared to Hyperliquid’s reduced activity. ASTER’s Trust Wallet integration provides 100 million users with direct access to perpetual contracts, challenging Hyperliquid’s market dominance. Arthur Hayes exited his entire HYPE position with a $823,000 profit, citing the massive token unlocks worth $11.9 billion that were set to start on November 29. He recently polled followers about re-entering after HYPE dropped 23% weekly to $35.50. However, community members have proposed blacklisting Hayes from purchasing HYPE, with some labeling his trades as the “ultimate sell signal.” Despite security challenges, Hyperliquid launched its USDH stablecoin , generating $2.2 million in early volume, while Native Markets secured the issuance mandate through a competitive governance voting process. The platform also activated HYPE/USDH spot trading following Native Markets’ commitment to stake 200,000 tokens for a period of three years. HYPE traded up 4.65% following the Hypurr launch, reaching $47.14 as community enthusiasm temporarily overshadowed ongoing security concerns and competition threats across the broader ecosystem.

In 2029, the coin could be worth between $21.48 and $25.29, with an average price of $22.08. In 2031, RPL will range between $44.88 and $53.15. Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool’s price reach $50?

The candlesticks are still below the middle Bollinger Band, and the lower band near $4.44 is acting as immediate support. The RSI is around 31, which is close to being oversold. This means that the selling momentum may soon run out. MACD values are still negative, which adds to the pressure on the downside. If support stays at $4.44, RPL might try to bounce back in the short term toward the $5.00–$5.90 resistance range. But if it stays weak below $4.44, it could drop even more. Overall, the mood is still bearish unless buying pressure comes in to keep prices above $5.00. RPL/USD 4-hour price chart analysis RPLUSD chart by TradingView On the 4-hour chart, Rocket Pool (RPL) is trading close to $4.85, which is a sign that it is stabilizing after a long downtrend. The price is testing the lower Bollinger Band, but it has started to move up toward the mid-band resistance at $4.95. There is a small bullish crossover in the MACD, which means that momentum is starting to come back. The Balance of Power, on the other hand, is still negative, which means that buyers haven’t completely taken back control yet. The next goal is $5.20 if the price goes above $4.95. On the other hand, if RPL can’t keep up the upward pressure, it might go back to support near $4.73. Short-term sentiment is still cautiously bullish but not very strong.

Rocket Pool (RPL) is still under bearish pressure, trading at about $4.85 with little upward momentum. The RSI is close to being oversold, which means that the token might be about to get a short-term bounce. MACD shows a weak bullish crossover on shorter timeframes, which could mean that the market is trying to recover, but volume is still low. Resistance right now is at $4.95, and if the price breaks above this, it could go to $5.20. On the other hand, strong support is around $4.45. If bears stay in charge, the price is likely to drop to this level. Overall, RPL is stabilizing, and a short-term recovery is possible, but traders are still cautious until resistance levels are broken. Is Rocket Pool a good investment? Rocket Pool (RPL) presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its innovative decentralized Ethereum staking model, offering potentially high returns through staking rewards. However, investors should consider market volatility and competition within the DeFi space. Conduct thorough research and assess personal risk tolerance before investing in RPL. Will Rocket Pool reach $50? Rocket Pool (RPL) reaching $50 appears possible but is uncertain. Predictions suggest a range of $44.88 to $53.15 for 2031 if market conditions are favorable and investor sentiment improves. However, significant upward momentum is required to achieve this target soon. Will Rocket Pool reach $150? Reaching $150 for Rocket Pool (RPL) seems highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Our Rocket Pool forecast suggests that RPL may peak at around $74.65 by 2031. Is Rocket Pool a safe investment? Rocket Pool is generally considered a secure investment due to its decentralized structure, robust security audits, and significant total value locked (over $4.4 billion), reflecting user confidence.

Despite early challenges in 2020, with prices as low as $0.3813 in March, Rocket Pool demonstrated resilience and ended the year on a positive note, closing at $4.27 in December. Notably, Rocket Pool experienced a surge in trading volume during the latter half of 2020, indicating increasing investor interest and confidence in the company’s prospects. 2021 showcased volatility in Rocket Pool’s price, with highs of $51.27 in November amidst a peak in trading volume. However, it faced significant lows earlier in the year, dipping to $4.27 in January. The year 2022 reflected a mixed sentiment, with Rocket Pool experiencing peaks and valleys. It started the year at $27.57, showing promise, but ended with a decline to $10.50 by June. In 2023, the stock witnessed a bullish trend, reaching its peak in March with a high of $64.29. However, it experienced a sharp decline thereafter, closing the year at $27.57, indicating a substantial downturn. In 2024, RPL peaked at $38 in March before dropping to $18 by May, then fluctuated between $13 and $28 through July.

Unusually low daily trading volume for months could indicate an exhaustion in buying interest. Gold has outperformed Bitcoin by a large degree in 2025 and proven a better investment since November 2021 for price gains. Peer cryptocurrencies have lagged badly this year, which could be a warning of future trouble for Bitcoin. I want to start off this article by saying that I have never owned Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) long. I have shorted it on occasion, like I have done over the past few weeks. I am currently holding the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF ( BITI ), which I discussed in an article during February here . You can take advantage of contract premiums (contango) sold in the futures market through BITI, where you essentially pocket extra proceeds given a flat Bitcoin spot quote. Plus, if the world's top cryptocurrency declines, investing income will be your bonus reward. At the core of my decision-making process to avoid cryptos is I don't understand how you put a value on them for price. For example, is Bitcoin worth $1 or $100,000 (and why)? I have yet to find a satisfactory answer to this basic question. So, I generally just avoid the sector. Yet, I do enjoy trading assets using technical charts and underlying momentum indicators to gauge the health of any investment. In my research, using 39 years of trading experience, Bitcoin's weak momentum price advance during the middle of 2025 looks doomed to fail. How much lower will Bitcoin decline in the months ahead? I honestly do not know. What my research suggests is a lower price regime is coming, perhaps even a major dump in value. (As a trader, you can take quick gains in BITI, like I did during Bitcoin's correction phase during late February and March.) Anyway, let me explain my latest bearishness on Bitcoin after reviewing a number of chart-related ideas. In terms of a peak in crypto excitement with President Trump pushing the sector this year, it's entirely possible we are outlining a long-term top in Bitcoin. Consequently, I am shifting to a Sell rating on this leading crypto invention for a 12-month outlook. Fading Buy Momentum On a daily trading chart, the first thing you will notice is the monster drop in volume each session, starting in May (boxed in blue below). As opposed to the high-volume buying advance after the November election into early February, the absence of follow-through is a major warning flag to me. Markets (especially booms) tend to run out of gas on low volume like this summer. Other momentum concerns are found in a variety of momentum indicators. I have circled in gold high readings in the Negative Volume Index , On Balance Volume , and the 13-day Force Index . All reached their buying pressure zeniths between November and February. The conclusion is we have all kinds of non-confirmation (divergent) signals vs. the price highs achieved since June. StockCharts - US$ Bitcoin, Daily Price & Volume, 2 Years, Author References Another issue is Bitcoin's performance has been fading vs. hard money gold since 2021. When we draw a chart comparing price performance between the two asset classes (both considered alternative money to paper currencies), gold has rather sharply ""outperformed"" Bitcoin since December. In other words, investors are rushing to gold, not the world's main cryptocurrency, in 2025's turbulent geopolitical backdrop. StockCharts - US$ Bitcoin vs. Gold, Relative Daily Price Change, 5 Years When we look purely at the volume necessary to move price a set amount (largely ignoring time increments), a standard 1-year Renko chart design also highlights a rather stark lack of net buying interest since late May. I have boxed in gold the situations where up vs. down volume has not made any real ""net"" progress. The last instance of greater selling volumes vs. buying took place between December and April (also boxed in gold). Price corrected -25% during this span. StockCharts - US$ Bitcoin, Standard Renko Chart, 1 Year, Author References Finally, when we review price alone, ignoring volume and time movements, the point and figure chart outlined a sell signal last week. With Bitcoin's price dropping below US$112,000, something of a vacuum for support may now exist. StockCharts - US$ Bitcoin, Point & Figure Chart, Since June 2025 Final Thoughts Bitcoin has been one of the top cryptocurrencies to own since the November 2021 peak for the sector and again since Trump 2.0 was inaugurated in January. If the sector had decided to turn lower now, after failing to break the highs of four years ago as a group, we have another drag on Bitcoin's future performance to contemplate. YCharts - US$ Bitcoin vs. Major Cryptocurrencies, Price Change, Since November 1st, 2021 YCharts - US$ Bitcoin vs. Major Cryptocurrencies, Price Change, Since January 21st, 2025 Many of my regular readers know I am something of a gold bug, advocating for a return to hard money for currency protection (with stable inflation rates closer to ZERO as a goal). Bitcoin has no real backing whatsoever. In the battle for safety and wealth preservation, gold has a history of thousands of years of success. Bitcoin remains relatively untested after less than 17 years in existence. Gold needs no internet or electricity or computer or encryption or password to function as money accepted all over the world; Bitcoin does. My momentum-based research highlights Bitcoin as a Sell currently, where any mass liquidation event (caused by an encryption hack, or a liquidity crisis in the financial markets including escalating selling of cryptos, or a simple change of heart by investors/holders of Bitcoin) could send the U.S. dollar exchange price dramatically lower. I am short Bitcoin through BITI, but only in minor amounts of my portfolio. I believe selling/limiting your exposure to Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) may be the prudent course of action into early 2026. The lack of buying interest/volume to confirm this summer's price highs should have serious holders of Bitcoin more than a little worried that incredibly bullish sentiment and all-time high prices are susceptible to a wave of selling. Of course, with the financial sector's plunge into cryptocurrencies over the past 15 years, further upside is possible, assuming the U.S. dollar's days are numbered as the globe's ""reserve"" currency. Movements of central bank holdings into gold, and perhaps Bitcoin, could keep the price above $100,000 for years to come. This more bullish scenario might arise after a short-term correction of -10% to -20% over the coming months. Thanks for reading.

While both platforms offer investors access to different projects, Falcon Finance (FF), in particular, will start trading on both exchanges on the same day. Upbit launched three different projects to investors on the same day. The first, Orderly (ORDER), will begin trading on the Ethereum network for BTC and USDT pairs. Orderly offers an orderbook-based trading infrastructure that aims to aggregate cross-chain liquidity. The project's native token, ORDER, will be used for staking, governance, and liquidity incentives within the ecosystem. The second listed product, SuperVerse (SUPER), will begin trading on the Ethereum network in KRW, BTC, and USDT pairs. Focused on the Web3 gaming ecosystem, SuperVerse combines diverse games and services onto a single platform, providing players with the integration of NFTs, token economies, and in-game experiences. Related News: Are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Still in a Bull Market, or Has the Bull Market Ended? Analysis Firm Explains! The third project Upbit will list on the same day is Falcon Finance (FF). FF, which will be traded on the Ethereum network in KRW and USDT pairs, stands out as an over-collateralized DeFi protocol. Falcon Finance creates a synthetic stablecoin called USDf and a yield-generating token called sUSDf, allowing users to implement different investment strategies within the DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bithumb announced on the same day that it would list Falcon Finance (FF) on the Korean Won (KRW) pair. Trading on Bithumb will begin at 10:00 PM on September 29, 2025. Furthermore, to encourage investors, the exchange announced that it will not charge commission fees on FF transactions until the morning of October 2, 2025. This marked a significant debut for Falcon Finance, as it was simultaneously listed on both major South Korean exchanges. *This is not investment advice.

The ongoing demonstrations arose on Thursday last week, accompanied by the dismissal of the energy minister and an imposed dusk-to-dawn curfew. Bitchat, a peer-to-peer messaging app, has seen increased downloads following protests in Madagascar. The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar shared a demonstration alert message as demonstrators clashed with police and looted. The government responded by sacking the energy minister and imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew to quell unrest. Bitchat search hit pick popularity amid unrest in Madagascar According to Google Trends data , Bitchat searches increased from 0 to 100 on Friday, with Antananarivo, the capital city, leading search activity. The data highlighted queries such as Bitchat download and how to use Bitchat, among the top five related searches flagged as related topics. Chrome-Stats showed that Bitchat had been downloaded 365,307 times since the beta launch in July, with 21,000+ downloads in the past 24 hours and more than 71,000 in the past week. Google Trends specified regional breakdowns highlighting that Madagascar was the main driver of the latest surge. Bitchat has been designed to enable peer-to-peer communication via Bluetooth mesh networks. It allows users to exchange messages without internet access or centralized servers. It also does not require an account, email address, or phone number, making it the preferred solution for avoiding monitored networks. In early September, Bitchat downloads skyrocketed in Nepal after the government banned at least 26 social media platforms, including Facebook and WhatsApp, due to widespread protests over corruption. Downloads for the application jumped from 3,300 to 48,000 in just a week, making the app the primary coordinator for protestors. At least 34 people died in the Nepal demonstration crisis, with the resignation of the country’s Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli following. Indonesia also saw a surge in Bitchat app downloads during the protests against parliamentary allowances earlier this month. More than 11,000 downloads were recorded. Citizens opted for the app to avoid being monitored while coordinating the demonstrations. Madagascar has low internet penetration, further increasing the need for a decent offline application in times of crisis. DataReportal showed that the country has nearly 32 million people, but only about 6.6 million had access to the internet by the start of 2025. At least 18 million devices had active mobile connections, but many only utilized voice and SMS services without internet access. Bitchat’s Bluetooth mesh functionality allowed users within a 300-meter radius to communicate, offering a rare opportunity in areas with limited network coverage. Privacy-focused and censorship-free technologies continue to gain adoption, especially in areas experiencing physical unrest. Such decentralized platforms offer alternative communication tools when access to Mainstreet social media or mobile internet is restricted. Crypto advocates say EU bill could drive adoption of decentralized tools Regulatory efforts in other parts of the world have raised concerns over tools with similar features to Bitchat. In the European region, a Chat Control bill has been proposed seeking to mandate pre-encryption scanning of messages. The law would undermine encrypted messaging, requiring platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Signal to allow regulators to scan messages before they are encrypted and sent. Diode CEO Hans Rempel and Brickken’s Elisenda Fabrega, a crypto advocate, have predicted that the proposal may point users towards decentralized Web3 platforms designed for privacy by default. Currently, the bill has support from 15 EU member states, which is still lower than the 65% population threshold required to pass it into the next stage. Germany, holding the pivot role, has yet to decide on the law; if the country votes in favor, the bill is expected to pass, while the opposite may see the bill fail.

While the rebound has sparked cautious optimism among traders, many analysts warn that BTC could continue to lose momentum if selling pressure persists. The broader market has entered a fragile phase where investor sentiment is mixed, and short-term direction remains uncertain. Top analyst Darkfost highlights a critical on-chain development: the number of transactions coming from wholecoiners—investors holding at least one full BTC—has dropped to its lowest level of the current cycle. This cohort has long been viewed as a significant gauge of market conviction, given the symbolic and economic weight of holding a full Bitcoin. On Binance, wholecoiner inflows have sharply declined, falling from a peak of nearly 11,500 BTC in November 2023 to around 7,000 BTC today. The same trend is visible across all major exchanges, where average annual deposits from wholecoiners have dropped from 45,000 BTC in May 2024 to about 30,000 BTC now. This decline underscores weakening activity among long-term investors and adds to the uncertainty facing Bitcoin. With supply tightening and conviction tested, the coming days could prove pivotal for BTC’s next move. A Unique Signal For Bitcoin Market Psychology Darkfost explains that the behavior of wholecoiners is a unique and highly valuable indicator for understanding Bitcoin’s market psychology. Unlike short-term traders, this group represents investors who have managed to accumulate at least one full Bitcoin, a feat that has become increasingly challenging as BTC’s price has risen over the years. Holding one full coin carries both symbolic and economic weight, making wholecoiners a class of investors worth monitoring closely. An increase in their exchange inflows often signals a shift in conviction. It can suggest that these investors are more willing to take profits or reduce exposure during uncertain market conditions, adding potential selling pressure. On the other hand, when deposits from wholecoiners decline, it typically reflects stronger conviction to hold. This mechanical reduction in supply available on exchanges helps to ease selling pressure and can create a more stable environment for BTC. This dynamic ties directly to Bitcoin’s scarcity effect. As adoption grows and the supply becomes more distributed, the total number of wholecoiners tends to stabilize or even decline. Each whole Bitcoin becomes increasingly rare to acquire, further magnifying the influence and symbolic importance of this group. For analysts, tracking wholecoiner flows provides an essential lens into the conviction and sentiment driving long-term market trends. Holding Above $112K, But Resistance Looms Bitcoin is currently trading around $112,242, showing a slight recovery after testing the $110K support zone earlier this week. The chart reveals that BTC has managed to bounce off its recent lows, indicating short-term resilience. However, momentum remains capped by resistance levels overhead. The 50-day moving average (blue line) is trending near $114K, aligning as immediate resistance. This suggests that bulls will need strong buying pressure to reclaim higher levels. Beyond that, the key hurdle sits around $123,217, the recent peak marked in mid-August. A breakout above this level would likely confirm bullish continuation and could open the door toward retesting $125K–$127K levels. On the downside, the 100-day moving average (green line) near $111K is providing a cushion. A failure to hold above this level would expose BTC to deeper corrections, with the 200-day moving average (red line) around $104K acting as the next significant support.

In a recent video shared by crypto proponent Amelie, Thompson revealed that several of his teammates talk about buying more XRP and other digital currencies. This indicates that conversations about cryptocurrency are moving beyond traditional finance circles and into high-profile industries such as sports. WOW! NBA star Tristan Thompson confirms NBA players are discussing about buying more #XRP XRP IS GOING MAINSTREAM! Vid credit: @digitalassetbuy pic.twitter.com/MMpYzaPceH — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 28, 2025 Thompson’s Remarks on Player Discussions According to Thompson, players have begun actively engaging with the idea of acquiring XRP . He noted that teammates frequently message him about price activity, exchange updates, and whether they should continue buying or holding for the long term. In his comments, he explained that group chats among players now include discussions about XRP’s potential and that many athletes are weighing strategies to increase their exposure. Thompson drew a comparison between an athlete’s mindset and investment in digital assets. He suggested that just as players bet on themselves to reach the NBA, a similar commitment is needed when entering the digital finance space. His emphasis was on long-term thinking rather than short-term trading, highlighting the importance of viewing cryptocurrency as an investment in future financial systems rather than a fleeting opportunity. Broader Perspective on Digital Finance Beyond specific references to XRP, Thompson also commented on the wider role of cryptocurrency in shaping the future of money management. He expressed a belief that traditional banking institutions may become less central in the coming decades, with digital wallets and decentralized systems replacing many of the functions banks currently provide. According to his remarks, future generations are likely to grow up in a financial world that is managed entirely online through personal wallets rather than through banks and physical institutions.

Instead, it is being acknowledged by athletes with global recognition and influence. The fact that XRP specifically was mentioned by name is particularly noteworthy, as it signals that certain digital assets are gaining traction in spaces with a wide cultural reach. Amelie’s coverage of this video amplifies the message that XRP is reaching a broader audience. With NBA players discussing the asset in their personal circles, the visibility of XRP continues to expand beyond financial communities. For many in the digital asset market, endorsements or mentions from public figures serve to validate the idea that adoption is steadily increasing.

The platform said it would appeal the ruling from Karnataka’s High Court, which last week rejected X’s attempt to shut down India’s content removal processes. X is deeply concerned by the recent order from the Karnataka court in India, which will allow millions of police officers to issue arbitrary takedown orders through a secretive online portal called the Sahyog. This new regime has no basis in the law, circumvents Section 69A of… — Global Government Affairs (@GlobalAffairs) September 29, 2025 At the center of the dispute is an online portal named Sahyog, which gives police officers authority to request content removals by simply claiming material is illegal. X said the system operates without court oversight or legal protections for people whose posts get flagged, and companies face criminal charges if they don’t comply. This isn’t the first time X has clashed with Indian authorities. The company has previously described government content controls as censorship. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration says the system helps address illegal online material and creates responsibility on the internet. X’s owner Elon Musk, who calls himself a strong defender of free speech, has disagreed with governments in multiple countries over following rules and removing content. But the Indian case targets the fundamental structure of internet regulation in the world’s largest country by population. India expanded online policing since 2023 under Modi Modi’s government increased online policing starting in 2023, letting far more officials file removal orders and send them straight to technology companies through a website that launched in October. Government officials previously used Section 69a of the Information Technology Act from 2000 to make social platforms remove content. That section lets the government block online information for reasons including national security, sovereignty, or public order by sending orders to companies. The government has faced growing criticism for not being transparent about removal orders and has gone to court many times. India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2015 and 2020 that Section 69a is legal but said blocking orders must be specific, follow proper procedures, and not create sweeping bans. With Sahyog, Modi’s government started using a different legal rule, Section 79 of the IT Act. The platform works under Section 79(3)(b), which says companies lose legal protection if they don’t remove illegal content when the government tells them to. Technology policy experts and lawyers note that courts haven’t reviewed this provision yet, letting the government avoid the protections the Supreme Court required for Section 69a. 72 companies joined Sahyog platform except X The government requires all social media platforms to join Sahyog and assign someone to handle takedown requests. At least 72 companies have signed up for the government platform, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Apple, LinkedIn, Google, Telegram, and Snapchat, according to Manish Garg, who directs the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre, an agency under India’s Ministry of Home Affairs. Officials from that agency run Sahyog, Garg said in response to an information request from Al Jazeera. X hasn’t joined the platform and instead sued Modi’s government, arguing that Sahyog functions as a censorship portal. In court documents, the company said thousands of unnamed officers can single-handedly decide information is illegal and block it across India without the checks and balances required under Section 69a. Government agencies still send X takedown requests through the platform. Many requests have nothing to do with national security. Mishi Choudhary, a technology lawyer who started the Software Freedom Law Center in New Delhi, said the name Sahyog means collaboration in Hindi and reveals years of close cooperation between officials and platforms that have helped make censorship effective while talking about free speech globally. She called the platform the latest attempt by Modi’s government to expand censorship authority, saying that giving police officers this power creates unlimited discretion and allows unrestricted censorship. The Software Freedom Law Center has also filed a case in Delhi High Court challenging whether Sahyog is constitutional. Get seen where it counts.

Promoted as a Bitcoin Layer-2 project with ZK-rollup technology and a Solana-compatible framework, it has raised more than $18 million in just a few months. Investors are lured by promises of bringing DeFi and smart contract functions into the Bitcoin ecosystem, alongside presale staking rewards of up to 65% APY. But while Bitcoin Hyper captures attention with scale and hype, other presales are targeting long-term sustainability through more defined mechanics. One of those is XRP Tundra, a dual-token system that integrates yield, governance, and liquidity protection. For investors comparing options, Tundra offers a structure designed to give retail holders more than speculative exposure. Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale Mechanics HYPER tokens are offered across multiple blockchains (Ethereum ERC-20 and BNB Chain BEP-20) at a current presale price of roughly $0.0129. The total supply is capped at 21 billion HYPER, with allocations including 30% to development, 30% to treasury, 25% to marketing, 10% to listings, and 5% to rewards. A distinctive feature is that staking is already available during presale, advertised at 65% APY. However, tokens staked cannot be withdrawn until seven days after the Token Generation Event (TGE), leaving participants exposed to lock-up risk. Reports suggest large whale transactions—one exceeding $69,000—have entered the sale, underscoring institutional-level participation. HYPER’s roadmap promises governance rights, reduced gas fees, and wrapped BTC for use in dApps once its layer-2 is live. Still, execution of its ambitious design remains a key variable. XRP Tundra: A Dual-Token Alternative While Bitcoin Hyper focuses on extending Bitcoin’s ecosystem, XRP Tundra is built around providing retail investors with yield and stability. Its presale, currently in Phase 4, prices TUNDRA-S at $0.068. Each purchase includes a 16% bonus allocation and a free distribution of TUNDRA-X on XRPL, valued at $0.034. TUNDRA-S, deployed on Solana, is the utility and staking token. TUNDRA-X, issued on XRPL, anchors governance and reserves. Launch prices are already fixed at $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X, giving presale participants a clearly defined upside target. Unlike many offerings, pricing and launch values are published in advance. Staking Through Cryo Vaults For XRP holders, the most notable feature of Tundra is the introduction of Cryo Vaults. These staking pools allow tokens to be locked for durations ranging from seven to ninety days, with yields reaching up to 30% APY. To provide flexibility, the project includes Frost Keys, NFT-based tools that either shorten lock-ups or amplify yields. While staking has not yet launched, presale participants gain guaranteed access when the vaults go live, ensuring they can capture rewards ahead of secondary market buyers. One of the most common presale risks is sharp volatility once tokens list. XRP Tundra mitigates this by using Meteora’s DAMM V2 liquidity pools for TUNDRA-S. Fees begin prohibitively high — around 50% — then taper gradually. This design blocks bots and discourages early dumping. Collected fees are redirected into Cryo Vault staking pools, turning early market activity into yield for long-term participants. In effect, XRP Tundra converts launch volatility into a mechanism that benefits holders, rather than punishes them. Verified Transparency Unlike many presales, Tundra has opened its code and team to public review. Independent audits are published by Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins . Team identity is also confirmed via Vital Block KYC . This level of disclosure contrasts with the anonymity that often surrounds presales. It gives investors artifacts they can review before committing capital. Growth vs Structure Bitcoin Hyper’s rapid fundraising underscores the appetite for bold presale narratives. Its promise of extending Bitcoin through a Layer-2 solution has attracted whales and retail alike, but its execution risks remain unresolved until launch. XRP Tundra mirrors the growth ambition but with a structure tailored to retail investors: dual-token allocations, defined launch targets, staking access, and liquidity safeguards. As Crypto Infinity observed in a recent feature, it represents a shift from hype-driven offerings toward measurable, verifiable mechanics. At $0.068 entry with targets of $2.50 and $1.25, plus guaranteed staking rights, XRP Tundra gives retail buyers a presale that blends growth potential with safeguards. In a year dominated by mega-raises like Bitcoin Hyper, Tundra provides an alternative path where structure matters as much as ambition.

Elon Musk’s Grok Fuels Dogecoin Rally as Maxi Doge Emerges as the Next Crypto to Explode September 29, 2025 • 10:00 UTC On September 28, 2025, Elon Musk’s Grok received approval for Federal Government use which increased Dogecoin’s price by 4.5%. As GROK’s approval strengthens Musk’s political and commercial influence, the same was evident in Dogecoin’s market performance over the past 24h. The news further ignited DOGE futures OI, which climbed to approximately $3.9B , indicating traders are opening new positions rather than closing old ones. These numbers also reflect investors’ growing conviction in Dogecoin as they position themselves for a potential breakout in token’s next move. Market trackers also showed deployment of over $110M in new bullish derivatives exposure . Historically, an uptick in leveraged positions often precedes sharp price pops. The strong Musk story, coupled with $110M futures/inflow, presents a fertile ground for Dogecoin to rally in the coming days. The growing momentum around Dogecoin is spilling over into other doge-themed assets, such as the Maxi Doge’s ($MAXI) presale, which has already raised $2.5M. Dogecoin’s growing momentum is spilling over newer meme-coin projects such as the Maxi-Doge ($MAXI), which is built for true degens chasing outsized gains.

Terrible September About to End Soon, as Q4 is Bullish for Altcoins and Maxi Doge September 29, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Dutch crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe rings the bell for the end of the ‘terrible September’ with generalized losses across the entire altcoin market. Ethereum alone lost nearly 9% this month. As he explains it, ‘Q4 is almost always positive’ historically speaking, which means we could see a sustained rally for most altcoins. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is also on the front foot, with the $2.5M presale already turning heads. Maxi Doge’s meme appeal comes from its unhinged trading behavior and the ‘full pain, full gain’ attitude, making it the perfect pick for degen traders. Learn how to buy $MAXI right here.

Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Sunday proved very fruitful for Bitcoin as it gained nearly 2.29%, recovering all the losses from the massive 3.8% dump we saw on Thursday. So far today, the token hasn’t put up any decisive action, which is perhaps a good sign given that it’s coming off a very bullish day yesterday. Bitcoin pausing here could suggest it’s building momentum to rise higher. Another reason for optimism is that the token has reclaimed its 100 EMA on the daily chart. The last time this happened – in early September – Bitcoin rose another 6% after reclaiming the 100 EMA. A similar move this time would put the token near the $120K level, well above the key $117K resistance. However, to get there, Bitcoin would first have to break through that $117K barrier, which triggered its last two downward shifts: one in late August and the other just two weeks ago. On the weekly chart, things look even more positive. Bitcoin closed last week with a strong rejection candle on the 0.5 Fibonacci level – a classic continuation signal. In a broader bullish market, this usually suggests the correction phase is complete. With this rejection in place, there’s now a high chance Bitcoin continues higher, with the next target being the Fibonacci high, which also happens to align with its all-time high. Analyst Predicts a $150K Bitcoin Pump Before Bears Set in, Fueling Bitcoin Hyper’s $18.7M September 29, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO predicts a $150K-$175K Bitcoin pump before the next bear phase. As he points it out, the bull momentum remains so long as $BTC holds above $103K. This prediction comes just as whales start stacking $BTC, with over 30,000 Bitcoins purchased recently .

52426171,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84727,1759140044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"MUTM Sold Out 55% This Phase, Analysts Call It the Best Crypto to Buy Now for 40x Gains",https://timestabloid.com/mutm-sold-out-55-this-phase-analysts-call-it-the-best-crypto/,"In a market where many investors are still asking why crypto is down and whether it is the right time to enter, one presale is standing out with undeniable momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already sold out 55% of its Phase 6 supply at a presale price of $0.035. The project has raised over $16.50 million with more than 16,650 holders now onboard. With Phase 7 around the corner, the entry point will rise to $0.040, representing a swift 15% increase for anyone waiting on the sidelines. This speed of sell-through shows that investors understand timing is critical when investing in crypto, especially in early-stage projects with well-defined mechanics. Short-term investors are seizing this moment because once Phase 6 closes, the higher entry price limits instant upside. A buyer entering in Phase 6 now will already be in value gain as soon as Phase 7 launches. Those who joined during Phase 1 at $0.01 already turned their $10,000 allocation into $25,000 on paper, and analysts forecast Phase 6 buyers are aligning for 40x gains at listing if this trajectory continues. The Dual Lending Model That Redefines Capital Efficiency While most crypto coins try to rely on hype or narrow use cases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a lending system that maximizes capital efficiency. Its Peer-to-Contract pools will allow mainstream assets like USDT, ETH, and BTC to be deposited and borrowed under dynamic interest rate conditions. For example, when liquidity is abundant, rates remain low to encourage borrowing, and as utilization rises, rates adjust upward to attract new suppliers. This mechanism not only grows treasury revenues but also sustains a balanced ecosystem. Alongside this, Peer-to-Peer pools will support assets like SHIB, and FLOKI. These direct agreements between lenders and borrowers cater to tokens outside the core liquidity markets, giving traders more room to negotiate yields while isolating risks from the central liquidity framework. This dual structure balances stability with opportunity in a way traditional platforms rarely achieve. What makes this framework stand out is its built-in collateral flexibility. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency and adaptive loan-to-value ratios will empower users to borrow more against stable assets without jeopardizing systemic health. Deposit and borrowing caps will prevent manipulation, while a reserve factor ensures sustainability across market cycles. By combining predictable mechanisms with dynamic flexibility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as one of the most efficient lending platforms to enter the market in 2025. Security, Roadmap, and the Road to Mass Adoption for 40X No serious investor in today’s market overlooks the importance of security. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already undergone a CertiK audit, receiving a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. Its bug bounty program allocates 50,000 USDT with rewards up to $2,000 for critical findings, ensuring community-driven defense. Alongside this, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway is building grassroots awareness and rewarding early adopters. The roadmap also provides clear near-term catalysts. Phase 2 established the foundation of smart contracts and infrastructure. Phase 3 will bring beta testing on testnet with a functional demo, security checks, and exchange listing preparation. By Phase 4, the live launch and token listings will activate, alongside the claim system and multi-chain expansion. These milestones will give investors multiple windows of momentum before and after the presale closes, amplifying demand further. Why MUTM Is the Must-Buy Right Now The urgency is clear. With 55% of Phase 6 already gone, only 45% of supply remains at the $0.035 level. Once Phase 7 begins, latecomers will face a higher cost basis, limiting their ability to maximize short-term upside. For those serious about investing in crypto with both immediate and long-term opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents one of the most compelling cases. This project is picking up speed because it has real mechanics, a lot of presale demand, and security features that keep investors safe. This is different from traditional tokens, which are caught in regulatory bottlenecks. Analysts claim that early purchases are already generating money before the IPO, and Phase 6 investors are expected to follow this route to 40x growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing that structured innovation combined with significant presale momentum may provide the proper balance of short-term profits and long-term value in a market where retail investors sometimes chase short-lived rallies. This season, if you’re interested in crypto coins, the best thing to do is to buy your share now before the remainder of the supply runs out.

Singapore achieved a perfect composite score of 100, driven by a sharp increase in cryptocurrency ownership and public interest. The country won the top global score for crypto adoption with a perfect score of 100, and the UAE came right after it with 99.7. According to the ApeX Protocol report, 24.4% of Singapore’s population holds digital assets—twice the 11% recorded just a year earlier. Singapore and the UAE stood out because many people own digital assets, governments created clear rules to support the industry, and public interest grows through online searches and daily use. The US, Canada, and Turkey were among the most active markets, scoring 98.5, 64.7, and 57.6, respectively. Singapore creates clear rules to increase crypto adoption Singapore is now the number one country worldwide that has adopted cryptocurrency. At the same time, people in Singapore are spending more time trying to understand cryptocurrency, as the country holds the highest level of online search activity for crypto worldwide. It has about 2,000 searches for every 100,000 people, which shows that the public is very curious, active, and interested in learning about digital assets. One of the biggest reasons Singapore has grown this way is that its government has made clear and strong cryptocurrency rules. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is both the central bank and the country’s main financial regulator , and handles this framework. MAS created a system where companies that want to provide crypto services must apply for a license, and they can only get it if they follow strict requirements. MAS also created stronger consumer protection measures, like banning confusing advertisements, to make it safe for people in Singapore to use cryptocurrency. Singapore has grown quickly because it has fast internet, a supportive government, and people who were already skilled in digital services. Ordinary citizens, businesses, and large institutions feel safe handling crypto in the country because it can balance safety and growth at the same time. Despite the volatility in international markets, Singapore’s consistent regulatory approach and robust technology infrastructure make it an important centre for digital finance within Asia. They say this combination of clearly defined rules and promotion by a curious public offers a path to continued adoption and industry growth, regardless of how the broader economy is faring. UAE boosts growth of crypto with government support The United Arab Emirates has become a hotbed for cryptocurrencies in just a few years. The country has high public interest, obvious government support, and strict rules that ensure people trust the system. The second place in terms of crypto adoption was taken by the United Arab Emirates, with 25.3% of its citizens possessing cryptocurrencies. Crypto adoption in the UAE has increased by 210% over the past few years, driven partly by government efforts to promote blockchain technology and attract foreign exchange platforms. The Dubai government created the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) to give licenses to crypto companies and check that they follow the rules. Crypto also provides a much faster and cheaper way for expatriates in the UAE to send money back home to support their families . A report by Chainalysis showed that the Asia-Pacific region is currently the fastest-growing part of the world in terms of crypto. Countries like India, Pakistan, and Vietnam are pushing total transactions in the region from 1.4 trillion dollars to 2.36 trillion dollars in only one year. Though regulatory questions persist, the uptick in ownership and search interest reflects an increasing faith among the public market that digital currencies are suitable for investment under the umbrella of a diversified financial portfolio.

Here’s What It Means",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-investors-green-ball-then-blast-to-33-heres-what-it-means/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has once again shared an in-depth technical outlook on XRP, presenting a strong case for significant price appreciation in the upcoming cycle. His latest analysis is supported by both chart patterns and historical data, while also being framed within a broader discussion of patience and perseverance drawn from religious and philosophical references. #XRP – Green Ball and Then Blast ($17 – $27 – $33): Many of you send me DMs or leave comments asking, ""Aren't you tired of stating and showing different ways to reach these targets?"" My answer is simple: I am a believer in God, and I pray every day. I don’t stop praying. For… pic.twitter.com/zAYMkUgPQH — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 28, 2025 Historical Patterns and Technical Insights Egrag’s chart highlights a consistent trend that XRP has followed in previous cycles. On the two-week timeframe, XRP has historically touched the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) before experiencing major upward surges. This behavior was evident in 2017 when the asset rallied 1,250% after reaching the 21 EMA. Similarly, in 2021, a 560% increase followed the same pattern. Drawing from these precedents, Egrag suggests that XRP is once again nearing this critical point, marked by the “green circle” in his chart. If history repeats, the next breakout could propel XRP to levels between $17 and $33. His projections include three possible Fibonacci extension targets: $8.36 at the 1.272 level, $13.56 at the 1.414 level, and $27.16 at the 1.618 level. However, Egrag points to $27 as a reasonable mid-point estimate based on the average of past rallies. The calculation combines the 1,250% surge from 2017 and the 560% move from 2021, which together average out to a 905% gain. Applying this figure to the current market structure, the analyst concludes that XRP could realistically achieve a $27 price in the next bullish leg. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Patience as a Core Message Beyond technical indicators, Egrag emphasizes patience as an essential trait for investors. He draws on references from the Bible, Torah, and Quran to reinforce his perspective that waiting through challenges is often required before reward is achieved. According to the analyst, XRP’s long-term holders have endured many difficulties, including price stagnation and volatility, but perseverance could ultimately result in substantial gains if his analysis plays out. He stresses that just as patience is praised in spiritual teachings, it also holds critical importance in trading and investing. In his view, enduring the current period of consolidation may be necessary before XRP delivers the kind of price expansion seen in past cycles. Egrag’s analysis provides three main targets that stand out: $17, $27, and $33. Each represents a significant increase from XRP’s present levels near $2.79. He views these levels not as arbitrary figures but as outcomes aligned with previous market behavior and supported by Fibonacci extensions.

From streamlined peer-to-peer transfers to new models for cross-border settlements, blockchain is redefining how value moves. This article explores the evolving landscape, highlighting practical use cases, regulatory considerations, and what these changes mean for individuals and businesses navigating the future of payments. Innovation in Blockchain Networks and Payments Blockchain’s promise lies in its ability to offer secure, transparent, and near-instant settlement of funds. In the UK, established banks and fintech startups alike are piloting blockchain-based payment rails. These networks enable direct transfers without the need for intermediaries, reducing both costs and processing times. For example, international remittances that once took days can now be completed in minutes, with full traceability for all parties involved. Beyond speed, blockchain introduces programmability into payments. Smart contracts can automate complex settlement conditions, making them ideal for recurring transactions or escrow arrangements. This flexibility appeals to both retail users and enterprises seeking greater efficiency and reliability in their financial operations. How Blockchain Expands Access to Financial Services One of the most compelling aspects of blockchain-powered payments is the potential to broaden access to financial services. Traditional banking infrastructure, while robust, does not always serve every community or use case. Blockchain platforms are increasingly providing alternatives, especially for those seeking services outside conventional frameworks. For instance, users searching for UK casinos not on gamstop might also explore blockchain-facilitated decentralised payment channels that bypass conventional restrictions, illustrating how these networks can support a wider range of financial activities. Moreover, blockchain’s borderless nature makes it easier for UK residents to transact with global partners. This is particularly relevant for freelancers, small businesses, and those participating in the growing gig economy, who benefit from lower fees and faster access to funds. As blockchain adoption widens, expect to see further innovation in mobile wallets, contactless payments, and merchant solutions tailored to diverse user needs. Understanding the Regulatory Landscape and Market Trends The rapid evolution of blockchain payments has prompted UK regulators to refine their approach. Authorities are working to balance innovation with consumer protection, focusing on anti-money laundering measures and clear guidelines for service providers. This regulatory clarity is crucial for building trust and encouraging responsible adoption across the sector. Market sentiment remains closely tied to broader cryptocurrency trends. A recent Bitcoin price analysis highlights the cryptocurrency's recovery past the $115,000 mark and explores market factors influencing its next moves, providing valuable insight for investors monitoring market trends. As confidence in blockchain assets grows, more businesses are integrating these networks into their payment infrastructure, further legitimising their role in the UK’s financial ecosystem. What the Future Holds for UK Payments The future of payments in the UK is being shaped by blockchain’s unique capabilities. While challenges remain—particularly around interoperability and regulatory harmonisation—the momentum is undeniable. As more organisations experiment with blockchain-based solutions, the lines between traditional and decentralised finance will continue to blur. For individuals and businesses alike, staying informed about these developments is key to leveraging new opportunities and navigating an increasingly interconnected payments landscape.

The buying spree, highlighted by on-chain analyst Ali Martinez and on September 29 and verified by Finbold, reveals the growing confidence that the token’s recent pullback may have run its course as whales (large scale investors) bought the dip. “120 million XRP bought by whales in the last 72 hours!” the crypto expert wrote, pointing to fresh accumulation activity just as the asset defends its multi-week support. 120 million $XRP bought by whales in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/bXDjTG5mZX — Ali (@ali_charts) September 29, 2025 The update followed a technical call suggesting that, if support holds, XRP could stage a rebound to $3 or even $3.15. XRP price rebound. Source: Ali_charts XRP price analysis At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.88, recovering from last week’s dip that briefly pushed the price below $2.80. The move comes on the heels of a broader market inflow that saw XRP’s capitalization expand by more than $6 billion overnight, as reported earlier by Finbold. Together, whale accumulation and renewed market depth highlight how capital continues to circle back into the token despite bouts of volatility. The whale bid adds fuel to XRP’s resilience narrative. While the broader crypto market has been rocked by Bitcoin’s drop from $116,000 to near $109,000, XRP whales appear to be positioning for a fresh leg higher. XRP’s ability to defend support comes at a critical juncture. The token’s market cap currently sits above $172 billion, with trading volumes surging nearly 40% in 24 hours. That combination of heavy whale inflows and renewed technical footing could help XRP recapture the psychological $3 level in the days ahead. For now, the focus is whether whales continue to add and whether XRP can sustain momentum against stiff resistance at $2.94 and $3.18. Martinez’s roadmap implies that if those levels are cleared, a larger rally could unfold heading into October.

He indicated that this was very bullish for the altcoin, providing insights into how high it could rally. XRP Price Set To Close Fourth 3M Candle Above In an X post, Bobby revealed that the XRP price is about to close its fourth 3-minute candle above the highest 3-minute candlestick close of its prior bull cycle. He added that the altcoin is also on track to close a 3-minute candle body above the previous 3-minute candle wick high amid a highly fearful market and even without reaching a 1.618 extension. Related Reading: XRP Price Is ‘Firing On All Cylinders’ As Super Rare Bullish Setup Emerges Based on this, he urged market participants to “think bigger,” possibly alluding to the projections for the XRP price in this market cycle. His accompanying chart showed that XRP could rally to as high as $13, representing a gain of over 400% from its current price level. Meanwhile, Bobby highlighted the candle closes above the April 2021 high as another reason he is bullish on XRP. His analysis comes amid a market downtrend, which has seen the XRP price drop below crucial support levels. Bobby suggested that the current downtrend was nothing to worry about. He stated that a golden pocket retest for XRP, from its latest low to its swing high, would be between $2.50 and $2.55. However, he declared that a drop to this range wouldn’t change a “single thing” about where the altcoin is heading. Instead, the crypto analyst believes that this would help weed out paper hands, who don’t deserve to benefit from what is to come for the diamond hand holders. He added that strategy and patience are needed amid the wait for the XRP price to reach new highs. XRP Could Reach As High As $33 Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has predicted that the XRP price could reach as high as $33 in this market cycle. He explained that, within the 2-week timeframe of the last leg in previous cycles, XRP always touched the 21 EMA before it blasted off. In 2017, the altcoin touched the EMA and then surged 1,250% while it rallied 560% in 2021. Related Reading: XRP Analyst Says ‘We Will All Be Surprised’ By October With This Breakout Egrag Crypto noted that if history repeats, the XRP price could rise to as high as $33 or $17, based on the gains from the previous cycle. Meanwhile, XRP could also record an average rally of 905%, which would put its price at $27. The analyst added that he doesn’t see how XRP won’t reach these targets. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.85, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The report, which originated from the respected crypto account BankXRP on X, alleges that Portnoy purchased 1 million XRP. This has sparked significant discussion across the digital-asset space. 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP’s Post Sets the Stage The story began when BankXRP posted that Portnoy had executed a million-token buy on Kraken and publicly aligned himself with XRP’s passionate investor community. Within hours, the post went viral, drawing the attention of traders, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts eager to see whether one of the industry’s most colorful personalities had indeed returned to the XRP market. Dave Portnoy bought 1 Million $XRP on Kraken. Says he’s part of the $XRP Army @stoolpresidente pic.twitter.com/aqmN7EoTO1 — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) September 28, 2025 What We Know, and What We Don’t As of now, Portnoy has not published a direct statement on his verified accounts confirming a fresh purchase. His public timeline still features past comments about selling his earlier XRP holdings and expressing regret over missing subsequent rallies. Those admissions add intrigue to the current story, suggesting that if the new claim is accurate, it would represent a notable shift in his crypto strategy. Adding another layer, Kraken previously released promotional material that depicted Portnoy “buying $1 million of XRP in minutes” as part of a marketing campaign. Some of the visuals circulating today are traceable to that earlier content rather than a live transaction. Until Portnoy or Kraken issues a clear confirmation—or blockchain data links a wallet to a recent million-token buy—the report remains unverified. Why the Claim Still Matters Even without ironclad proof, the possibility of a high-profile figure re-entering XRP carries weight. Portnoy’s reputation as a media personality and active trader means his involvement can influence sentiment well beyond his personal holdings. In a market where perception often drives momentum, talk of his return energizes the “XRP Army” and invites fresh scrutiny of the asset’s near-term prospects. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For the XRP community, the narrative itself is a morale boost. This reinforces the notion that influential investors remain bullish on XRP, anticipating growth of the broader crypto market with new institutional products and clearer regulations. Potential Market Impact If Portnoy did, in fact, acquire 1 million XRP through Kraken, the trade could have modest but meaningful effects. A purchase of that size—depending on whether it was executed as a single block or spread over multiple orders—can add to demand and spark follow-on buying from speculators who track celebrity moves. Just as important, confirmation of such a transaction would enhance Portnoy’s standing as more than a casual commentator, underscoring his willingness to commit significant capital to the market. The Path to Confirmation To confirm this story, we’ll need one of three key signals: a direct statement from Portnoy, official confirmation from Kraken, or verifiable evidence from on-chain or exchange records. Until then, the crypto community will continue to watch closely, dissecting every hint and repost. Regardless of the outcome, BankXRP’s post has already achieved something notable: it has reignited interest in XRP, put Dave Portnoy back in the center of the conversation, and reminded investors how quickly a single claim can capture the market’s imagination.

Analysts Explain! ""$112,000 Milestone!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-next-for-bitcoin-analysts-explain-112000-milestone/,"Bitcoin and altcoins have been wreaking havoc on the market with sharp declines over the past week. While bullish predictions for BTC and altcoins continue, some are predicting a long-term uptrend like gold, while others are focusing on short-term bullishness and altcoin season. First, gold advocate and Bitcoin hater Peter Schiff reignited the BTC-gold debate. Schiff harshly criticized Strategy's Bitcoin accumulation strategy, saying, “Gold can accommodate multi-billion dollar sell-offs without experiencing a significant market shock, but selling the same amount of Bitcoin could lead to a sharp price drop and cascading liquidations.” With this comment, Schiff claimed that gold's market depth provides more flexibility to large investors and argued that gold is much more advantageous than Bitcoin in terms of liquidity, saying that billions of dollars in outflows can be absorbed much more easily in the gold market. Corrections are Normal! At this point, analyst James van Straten said that Bitcoin's market structure has changed with the resurgence of gold. The analyst said that Bitcoin may sometimes lag behind gold and sometimes surpass it, but Bitcoin will still lead in total returns over a full cycle. However, the analyst stated that Bitcoin follows a similar path to gold in the long term, adding that a new rise is on the way, but 10-20 percent corrections are inevitable in this process. Bitcoin will continue its cascading rally, supported by ETF inflows, but intermittent corrections of 10-20% may accompany it. This is similar to how gold went on a long-term uptrend in the early 2000s and then went through healthy correction periods. Even if Bitcoin lags behind gold in the short term, it will still show an advantage in long-term returns. $112,000 Critical in Bitcoin! Finally, popular cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe stated that $ 107,000 gold has a strong buying shadow, saying, “The area below $ 107,000 is a strong buying zone, and if $ 112,000 is broken and the daily close occurs, the return of capital to major altcoins will accelerate.” Accordingly, experts assessed that “If the $112,000 level recovers and holds, upward momentum may revive, but if this momentum cannot be maintained, a period of consolidation in the range is likely.” *This is not investment advice.

While Wall Street debates the sustainability of AI-driven stock gains, major global investors are looking beyond the AI boom toward long-term government spending trends. These spending patterns, driven by geopolitical, technological, and demographic pressures, are expected to reshape markets in the coming years. Asset managers are diversifying their investments across infrastructure, energy transition, healthcare, and defense sectors . Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, which oversees $4.5 trillion in assets, said many investors “underestimated the impact that (stimulus) could have on real and financial assets.” Speaking to the Reuters Global Markets Forum, Haefele described how his firm is aligning its thematic investments with government spending, focusing on power, resources, healthcare, and defense sectors. Government spending initiatives in the U.S. and Europe are fueling this investment shift. In July, the United States enacted a significant tax-cut and spending package that will increase government debt by trillions. The law extends tax reductions from President Donald Trump’s first term while boosting border security and defense spending. It also reduces Medicare and Medicaid funding. Equally bold programs are emerging from European governments Germany has introduced a 500-billion-euro ($586 billion) infrastructure fund designed to bypass its tight fiscal constraints. Separately, NATO countries have agreed to boost defense spending to 3.5% of GDP. Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Asset Management, which manages $430 billion in assets, said these fiscal commitments are unusual in their scale and duration. “Fiscal stimulus is always a big element of the performance of the financial markets,” Cavarero noted. He added that the structural changes these programs create would continue for years, though “it takes time before those moneys actually percolate (through) the system … before you see them becoming reality.” Cavarero identified nuclear power, energy infrastructure, biotech innovation, and defense as industries that “cannot be ignored by the market.” However, he cautioned that “at some point, we will need to deal with these debts.” Defense stocks tell a different story The S&P 500 index has climbed nearly 14% this year, outpacing Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index, which gained 9.5%. But the aerospace and defense index has jumped almost 68%, demonstrating how government priorities are lifting defense and industrial companies despite AI’s broader market dominance . Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, which manages $1.3 trillion in assets, expects stock gains to spread beyond U.S. technology companies to cyclical sectors, small-caps, and value stocks. “U.S. outperformance is not the only game in town this year, thanks to a weaker dollar,” she said. Malik recommended investors maintain balanced portfolios with a tilt toward U.S. markets. He said investors shouldn’t concentrate exclusively on American assets while ignoring other opportunities, but they also shouldn’t take positions against the United States. She also highlighted opportunities in infrastructure , utilities, and waste management, calling them resilient options that protect against inflation. Both UBS and Nuveen emphasized active management strategies over passive index investing. Haefele suggested that investors should focus on active strategies instead of relying on overall market performance.

Ether fell 10.1 percent and Solana dropped 14.3 percent, reinforcing the broad risk-off tone across majors. Yet, selective rotation into speculative altcoins persisted, reflecting investors’ continued search for higher-beta opportunities even as total market capitalisation contracted 5.9 percent on the week to $3.7 trillion, down 12.6 percent from recent highs. Open interest also declined 13.7 percent from its September peak, signalling a broad reduction in speculative leverage. From a cycle perspective, realised capital inflows highlight the structural scale of the current bull market. Since January 2023, Bitcoin has absorbed $678 billion in net inflows, 1.8 times the size of the entire prior cycle driven by institutional adoption and deepening liquidity. Unlike earlier cycles, this one has advanced in three distinct multi-month surges, each punctuated by heavy profit-taking when more than 90 percent of coins moved were transacted in profit. Long-term holders have already realised 3.4 million BTC , surpassing all prior cycles and underscoring the unprecedented maturity of this cohort and the depth of capital rotation underpinning today’s market. With the third wave of distribution now fading, conditions favour a cooling phase as realised gains are digested before the next structural leg higher. The US economy is showing a complex mix of resilience and strain. Consumer spending remains strong , with households boosting outlays on services, travel, and goods, helping drive second-quarter GDP growth to its fastest pace in nearly two years and keeping third-quarter projections close to 4 percent. This momentum, however, is unevenly distributed : higher-income households, supported by rising wealth, continue to spend, while lower-income families are increasingly relying on savings as wages stagnate and essential costs like food and energy climb. Inflation remains stubborn, with the Fed’s preferred measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index , rising 2.7 percent year-over-year in August and core inflation holding at 2.9 percent, driven by persistent service-sector and goods price pressures. The Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points on September 17th to 4–4.25 percent, aiming to balance slowing job growth with inflation control. Yet this easing highlights a delicate tension : while short-term yields have fallen, long-term Treasury rates remain elevated as investors demand compensation for fiscal risks. National debt has surged to $37.3 trillion, with annual interest costs exceeding $1.1 trillion, making debt service the government’s second-largest expense . This backdrop has steepened the yield curve, leaving mortgage rates stuck near 7 percent and borrowing costs high for households and businesses. The cryptocurrency landscape is being shaped by a mix of political risk, regulatory shifts, and financial innovation across major economies. In the United States, a looming government shutdown on September 30th, the end of the fiscal year, underscores deep political polarisation . While short shutdowns have historically had little impact on markets, today’s backdrop of fiscal strain and global fragility could amplify risks. Equities may face pressure from delayed data releases, bond yields could swing on deficit concerns, and crypto may draw renewed attention as investors question Washington’s stability. Across the Atlantic, the UK is beginning to take a more constructive path to crypto adoption, with leading banks including Barclays, HSBC, and NatWest launching a live pilot for tokenised sterling deposits . Running through mid-2026, the program will test use cases such as peer-to-peer payments, faster mortgage processing, and digital asset settlement, all within existing regulatory protections. Meanwhile, Australia has moved to tighten its regulatory perimeter. Draft legislation released by the Treasury would require crypto exchanges and custody providers to obtain financial services licenses, aligning them with traditional intermediaries under the Corporations Act.

That's the difference between its prices when the CME market closed for the week on Friday and reopened on Sunday. Ether (ETH) is showing a similar setup. That has gained 3.4% and left a futures gap starting around $4,000. The thing about CME futures gaps is that they tend to get filled. With the two largest cryptocurrencies currently trading higher, that means they both — at some point — are likely to drop back and retest those lower levels. Bitcoin’s monthly low often tends to occur within the first 10 trading days, meaning this dip could arrive within the next two weeks. That's even though October, often referred to as “ Uptober ,” is historically its second-best performing month with an average return of 22%. More broadly, the CoinDesk 20 Index has gained 3.2% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green. Outside of crypto, precious metals remain firm, with gold climbing 1.5% on Monday to $3,815 and silver approaching all time highs at $47, with the next breakout level at $50. Macro markets are focused on Friday’s highly influential U.S. jobs report, with nonfarm payrolls, a measure of new jobs excluding farm work and certain categories, expected at 39,000 alongside a steady 4.3% unemployment rate. ISM Services PMI is forecast at 52, indicating continued expansion of the world's largest economy. For bitcoin to break out of its current $110,000 to $120,000 trading range, volatility and sentiment will need to return. The fourth quarter, which starts on Wednesday, could provide the catalyst.

Conferences Sept. 29: CoinFerenceX Singapore Day 1 of 2: Sonic Summit 2025 (Singapore) Token Talk By Oliver Knight Plasma’s native token, XPL, is beginning to cool off following its red-hot trading debut. The Tether-backed token is changing hands at $1.29, down 12% over the past 24 hours, as daily trading volume slipped 9% to $2.3 billion. On-chain activity, however, tells a different story, with deposits rising 13.7% to $5.5 billion in the same period. Much of that capital is flowing into yield-generating products like Plasma Saving Vaults, which currently offer around 20% annualized returns on lending vaults. The combination of attractive yields and rapid inflows has helped Plasma quickly climb the blockchain rankings, already overtaking Coinbase-backed Base in terms of total value locked, according to data from DeFiLlama . While trading activity for XPL has cooled, inflows suggest strong investor appetite during a relative lull in the wider crypto markets as assets like BTC and ETH fell back to respective levels of support at the tail end of last week. It remains to be seen how well Plasma and its protocols fare during a bullish market phase, but the stablecoin-focused blockchain has already earned its fruits when the market is under pressure. Derivatives Positioning Overall BTC futures open interest has dropped to roughly $29 billion from a recent high of $32 billion, indicating that traders are reducing their exposure. At the same time, the three-month annualized basis remains compressed at around 6%, making the basis trade less profitable. In essence, the market is showing a clear shift from a bullish bias as traders unwind their long positions and a growing number of shorts enter the market. In options, the BTC Implied Volatility Term Structure shows an upward-sloping curve while the 25 delta skew for short-term options (1-week, 1-month) has increased, suggesting that some traders are paying a premium for calls over puts, indicating a bullish bias. This is directly contradicted by the 24-hour put-call volume, which shows puts dominating with 58.43% of contracts traded, a sign that a large number of traders are still seeking downside protection. The divergence suggests a highly polarized market where some are betting on a short-term rally while others are actively hedging against further declines, leading to a state of indecision and mixed sentiment. BTC funding rates have recently turned negative, suggesting a growing bearish sentiment. After holding steady for most of the week, the annualized funding rate on Hyperliquid dropped significantly to a negative -6%. This indicates a strong conviction from traders who are shorting BTC on that platform. Meanwhile, funding rates on major venues like Binance and OKX remain near neutral. The overall trend, particularly the sharp drop on Hyperliquid, suggests that traders are actively taking risk off the table and positioning for a decline in BTC prices. Coinglass data shows $350 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 24-76 split between longs and shorts. ETH ($130 million), BTC ($52 million) and SOL ($37 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. Binance's liquidation heatmap indicates $113,000 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise.

While this recovery signals resilience, the short-term trend remains tilted to the downside, with the 50-day EMA — currently near $4,210 — acting as immediate resistance.

Events like that can cause short-term volatility, eventually setting up the market for new accumulation. BTC short-term holders felt the pinch of the current downturn. The latest cohorts of buyers are not necessarily panic-selling, but their pressure point is above $111,000. The recent dip of BTC to $109,000 set up conditions for a minor capitulation. Based on Glassnode data , the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) index for short-term buyers has shifted to a small loss, suggesting some traders may decide to sell and eventually buy lower. In the past months, steep drops in the NUPL metric coincided with a market local bottom, usually preceding a recovery following the redistribution of coins. BTC continues to go through a cycle with 25% drawdowns and fewer capitulation events on the spot market. The crypto fear and greed index is at 50 points and is neutral after a few days of fearful trading. However, the index shows the attitude of derivative traders, while holders show more resilience. Are BTC holders ready to capitulate? Despite the NUPL metric turning worse for the latest buyers, in general, BTC holders are very far from capitulation. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , the current market cycle has spent more than a year without a big capitulation event, only with short-term liquidations and deleveraging. Short-term BTC buyers may be underwater, but on average, holders are not feeling anxiety and are in the money. | Source: Bitcoin Magazine Pro At current valuations, on average, holders are not even in the anxiety zone, boosted by previous accumulation in the past year. BTC gains support from an ongoing push to hold more coins, avoiding capitulation. Market downturns usually lead to large-scale position liquidations, but BTC owners are not eager to sell, expecting more value from BTC as a reserve. Based on HODL waves data, wallets aged over one month have only expanded their reserves. Shark wallets went through rapid accumulation, with no signs of preparing to sell. In the past year, shark wallets added more than 1M BTC , accumulating even during periods of market panic. Direct dumping on the market is now rarer, as DeFi offers additional opportunities to tap the value without crashing the BTC price. Will BTC miners capitulate? BTC miners have always faced the threat of capitulation. At the current market price, most miners are profitable. Based on the hash ribbon metrics, miners are currently not producing coins at a loss and are not in distress. Miner sell pressure diminished in the past year and is near all-time lows, despite the highly competitive mining sector. | Source: BGeometrics Miners, just like long-term holders, are now more cautious when divesting BTC. Miners retain reserves of 1.89M BTC, close to their usual level. Miner sell pressure has actually fallen since the end of 2024, and is close to all-time lows. While miners sell strategically, mass inflows to open markets are much rarer. Newly mined coins are also valuable as they lack a history of involvement with illegal activities. With the rise of treasuries, miners also have another motive to store their BTC, especially for publicly traded mining companies.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $1.04. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.69 with an average trading price of $1.62. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

The cryptocurrency lost 3.38% of its value. The DOGE coin is expected to find support around $0.221. On September 29, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a bearish trend for the meme coin. The coin’s price decreased to $0.229 today, representing a 3.38 percent loss since it closed at $0.237 yesterday. Today’s bearish trend indicates a highly negative sentiment in the market, as losses are significant for the day; however, the coin may get some cushion around the $0.221 support zone, as the coin keeps falling towards the said level, which will reignite the buying interest. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin indicated a downward trend in the market, as sellers are in the leading position. The cryptocurrency’s value decreased to $0.229 today. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify renewed selling pressure.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.295, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.215. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 43.94 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a sell indication as it moves downwards, as the overall market sentiment is negative today. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin also shows a bearish trend in the market, as selling pressure has formed above the SMA, which is evident from the last few red candlesticks. The DOGE/USD price has been facing decreasing volatility toward the $0.229 level on an hourly basis. The decreasing volatility signals a lower chance of a trend reversal and less volatile price movements in the coming hours.

The RSI indicator is trending in the neutral region. Its value has decreased to 44.64 in the past four hours. This situation hints at seller dominance, and further depreciation seems possible.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.229 in the past 24 hours. If sellers maintain their momentum, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and sink to the $0.221 level. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.475946–$0.605749 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.229 over the last 24 hours as sellers tried to maintain resistance around $0.237 and succeeded. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.324508 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,305 DOGE in September; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.69 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinions on Dogecoin Cryptopolitan reported that Elon Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, will chair a new public company that will raise $200 million backed by Dogecoin. Although the company is still in the pitch stage and lacks specific details, it aims to provide investors with exposure to Dogecoin without requiring them to hold it directly.

Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214.

Even though MUTM is only priced at $0.035 during its presale Phase 6, it has already amassed over $16.52 million and gained over 16,640 holders. Mutuum Finance can get to $0.50 in 2025, and this will be the investment with huge returns for early users. With a 90/100 score by CertiK audits and an imminent USD-pegged stablecoin launch, Mutuum Finance will be a player to watch out for in the DeFi community. Solana’s recent price fluctuations and high-transaction volumes, on the other hand, are reflective of the risks of investing in established cryptocurrencies. For a high-upside play below $1, MUTM is a thrilling selection. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Stabilization Suggests a Bounce Solana (SOL) encountered resistance at the $250 level recently, leading to a reversal into the green demand zone near the upper support line and the $200s pocket. Price action is stabilizing with reduced candles and increasing highs being established in this shallow correction. As long as SOL is in the $190–$184 range, the bounce thesis holds, and a likely reversal into $205–$215 is in the offing. A break of this target range may lead to another test of $225 as the uptrend gathers speed. As SOL patiently bides its time and prepares for its move, investors also consider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for early-stage investments.

For people looking for returns in the long term and high value, Mutuum Finance’s expanding ecosystem is a suitable investment platform. Security is also one of Mutuum Finance’s vision pillars. In a bid to establish a safer and solid ecosystem, the project has partnered with CertiK to launch a formal bug bounty program with an initial reward pool of $50,000. Four types of vulnerabilities such as critical, major, minor, and low have been introduced in the program to offer a complete detection and prevention solution for suspected threats prior to their occurrence among users. Mutuum Finance is supported by the active LTV and liquidation infrastructure, which adapts according to volatility of collateral in real-time. Reserve multiplier function on the platform also has a buffer of 10%, increasing to 35% for risk-prone collateral types. This precision-driven infrastructure bases security and transparency on the extent, offering a stable, secure, and solid DeFi platform. Best Crypto to Buy Now Whale investors are actually exhibiting their trust in Mutuum Finance since the project has raised over $16.52 million and welcomed over 16,640 holders during presale. Sold for only $0.035, MUTM is a thrilling entry point with estimates having it break out to $0.50 in 2025. Having a hefty CertiK audit rating of 90/100, a new USD-pegged stablecoin forthcoming, and sound security design, Mutuum Finance is proving itself to be one to watch in DeFi.

During this time, it will match data on unpaid bills with data from domestic crypto exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb. If authorities find that any of the residents with unpaid bills have crypto holdings, they will send official warnings. If residents fail to respond to these warnings, the city will then confiscate coins and move to liquidate them. The city said it will initially focus on individuals who have amassed unpaid water bills of over 500,000 won ($360). These individuals represent 34% of the city’s unpaid tax bill total. They owe Incheon an estimated combined total of 813 million won ($580,260), a city official said.

Team XRP: The Speed Demon • 3-second settlements vs SWIFT’s 1-3 days • 70% cost reduction for remittances • 80% of global remittance markets already… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) September 28, 2025 XRP’s Position in Global Remittances Barron emphasizes XRP’s clear advantage in speed and cost efficiency. Settlement times on the XRP Ledger average three seconds, a sharp contrast to SWIFT’s traditional one-to-three-day processing window. This time advantage directly translates to lower costs, with remittance fees reduced by around 70% compared to conventional methods. The journalist also underlined XRP’s already extensive footprint in international markets. He notes that the technology covers roughly 80% of global remittance corridors and has seen strong adoption in regions such as Brazil, Nigeria, and the Philippines, where growth rates have reached triple digits. These emerging markets, which often experience higher remittance fees under legacy systems, represent critical testing grounds for efficiency-driven payment solutions. Another aspect of XRP’s advantage is its growing institutional presence. Over 300 financial and payment institutions have integrated the technology, a figure that continues to rise. This signals a shift from speculative use toward utility-driven adoption in real-world economic systems. SWIFT+Linea’s Established Network and New Technologies On the other side of the competition, Barron describes SWIFT+Linea as a formidable force due to its entrenched infrastructure. The SWIFT network already connects over 11,000 institutions worldwide, giving it unparalleled reach. This existing framework allows financial institutions to participate in trials and future adoption with minimal adjustments, a factor Barron points out as a significant operational advantage. High-profile institutions such as BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon are participating in SWIFT’s pilot program with Linea. The pilot also introduces enterprise-grade privacy protections through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, an increasingly important feature as financial institutions balance regulatory compliance with data confidentiality. The sheer scale of SWIFT’s daily operations is another defining strength. With an average of $6 trillion in transactions processed daily, the network demonstrates unmatched volume capabilities. Combined with its long-standing reputation for reliability, this positions SWIFT+Linea as a contender that prioritizes trust and scale over the speed-driven model emphasized by XRP . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Timing and Strategic Head Start Barron’s conclusion stresses timing as a decisive factor in this rivalry. While XRP is already operational across key global corridors and building institutional partnerships, the SWIFT+Linea pilot will not move into full deployment until late 2025. This gives XRP what Barron calls a 12-month lead in real-world usage and adoption. In an industry where speed and cost savings are immediate advantages for financial institutions and remittance providers, that head start could shape future market preferences. The journalist frames the comparison in clear terms: XRP dominates in efficiency, while SWIFT+Linea commands scale and trust. Which of these factors ultimately determines leadership in the cross-border payments sector will depend not only on technological capacity but also on how quickly institutions embrace change.

On September 26, the exchange filed its last written statement, following the court-mandated deadline in the restructuring case that was attached to the cyberattack. The previous deadline from the creditors to correct affidavits expired on September 19, which was followed by Zettai Pte Ltd’s response on September 22nd. Also, both WazirX’s Singapore entity and non-party creditors had due dates to file their last submissions by September 26. The court will now examine these filings and will schedule hearings. WazirX said it will abide by any legal pronouncement and will continue to keep its customers updated in the process. WazirX hack fallout leads to legal restructuring The July 2024 breach was a major turning point for the exchange. Hackers targeted the Safe Multisig wallet and stole assets worth almost $235 million; subsequent investigations blamed North Korean hackers for the attack. In the aftermath, WazirX froze both cryptocurrency and Indian rupee withdrawals. To limit the financial impact, the exchange is pursuing a scheme of arrangement under the supervision of the courts in Singapore. The process is intended to restructure obligations without interfering with operational continuity. WazirX’s legal proceedings in Singapore are central to the case and involve the Singaporean entity that operates as WazirX, Zettai Pte Ltd, which is in charge of the crypto-to-crypto market. Additionally, non-party creditors have been invited to make their position known as the restructuring plan rolls out. This court decision also emphasizes regulatory oversight, as judges asked some of the creditors to resubmit affidavits after their initial filings did not satisfy regulatory requirements. Next steps in the court process With all submissions now filed, the High Court is likely to fix a hearing date. The decision will impact the future of WazirX’s restructuring strategy, which aims to balance creditor claims with the exchange’s ability to recover and rebuild. In a recent update, WazirX reported that 95.7% of scheme creditors and 94.6% of approved claims voted in favor of its amended restructuring proposal. The results were also independently confirmed by Alvarez & Marsal (SE Asia) Pte Ltd’s Joshua Taylor and Henry Anthony Chambers, who found there to be solid support for the adjusted plan. The revised timetable reflects the court’s attempts to simplify the process so that creditors and WazirX have an even playing field to present their cases. For customers, the next phase will allow clarity on the extent to which compensation or recovery measures can be put in place under the scheme of arrangement. Despite the ongoing legal proceedings, WazirX has emphasized its commitment to rebuilding user trust. The exchange noted, “We truly value your patience and support.

The report opens with a quote saying: ""Options are now the dominant derivatives instrument by open interest, being over $90 Billion in size, and eclipsing the futures markets at $80 Billion"". Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has seen around $61 billion in net inflows over 18 months, making it one of the most successful ETF's of all-time. However, the dominance accelerated following the launch of ETF options in November 2024. The options market, which gives investors the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a set price within a certain timeframe, has dramatically reshaped flows, with IBIT attracting $32.8 billion in inflows while competitors have remained flat since the options began trading. The report states that IBIT now controls 57.5% of all bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM), up from 49% in October 2024, with roughly 40 cents of options open interest for every dollar of bitcoin held in the fund. By contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC, the second largest ETF, is about 25 times smaller than IBIT in options open interest, with around $1.3 billion. This level of activity has made IBIT a rival to Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchanges, where daily trading volumes typically run between $4 billion and $5 billion, according to the report. The report also points to 13F filings, the quarterly disclosures required by the SEC for investment managers with over $100 million in assets. These filings show institutions holding ETFs, allowing others to use the options market to be able to short or use arbitrage methods for hedging volatility. Overall, the report concludes that bitcoin’s volatility profile has shifted meaningfully in this cycle, with ETFs and their options markets serving as a major driver of that change. ""In our view, the launch of options on top of the spot ETFs is thus far an under-discussed, but highly important change in Bitcoin’s recent market structure"", the report said.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Options|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-29 11:42:31

The company announced that the common ledger solution it will integrate into its infrastructure will initially focus on 24/7 real-time international payment transactions. This ledger, designed based on a “concept prototype” developed by Swift in collaboration with Consensys, will enable the secure and instantaneous transfer of regulated tokenized assets. Transactions will be recorded, sequenced, and verified via smart contracts. Swift asserted that this system will be compatible with both existing and next-generation financial infrastructures while maintaining its own stringent compliance standards.

According to the company's statement, more than 30 financial institutions, including giants such as Banco Santander, Bank of America, BNP Paribas and HSBC, are collaborating to provide feedback on the project and support its future implementation. Last week, reports suggested that Swift was testing porting its system onto Consensys' Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Linea. “With this first-ever ledger concept, we are leading the way in taking the payments experience for financial institutions to the next level.

The Reserve, run by Silver Bullion, started operations last year in Singapore and was built to store 10,000 tonnes of silver and 500 tonnes of gold for private banks and family offices serving ultra-wealthy clients. Despite soaring gold prices and global tension, the vault currently holds only a small part of its full capacity. “London took 200 years to build the infrastructure to become the centre of the world gold market,” said Albert Cheng, chief executive of the Singapore Bullion Market Association. “We have lots of work to do, but it won’t take us that long.” Gold demand is shifting east. As Singapore and Hong Kong push to challenge London , New York and Switzerland, both have launched gold futures contracts this summer and expanded warehousing and refining capacity. These moves are aimed at capturing business from investors unsettled by supply chain risks and trade disruptions. “The centre of gold trading is increasingly moving east,” said David Greely, chief economist at Abaxx Exchange, a Singapore-based bourse that launched a gold contract earlier this year. “There is a big untapped demand for an Asian trading hub.” Hong Kong increases storage and launches new contracts Recent confusion over U.S. tariffs on gold spurred more interest in Asian storage hubs. In August, U.S. customs said tariffs would apply to gold bars, rattling the bullion market, but President Donald Trump reversed the policy days later. “There is a window for these hubs to explore ramping up their product availability,” said Nicky Shiels, head of research at MKS Pamp, a Swiss refinery that has just opened its regional headquarters in Hong Kong. While Singapore has been working for over a decade to build its status as a global gold hub, Hong Kong has accelerated its plans in recent months. In his annual policy address on September 17, city leader John Lee said Hong Kong would expand its gold storage capacity to more than 2,000 tonnes in three years, up from its current 200 tonnes, calling it a “regional gold reserve hub.” Hong Kong’s proximity to mainland China, the largest consumer and producer of gold, makes it attractive for traders. The Shanghai Gold Exchange is using Hong Kong to promote its renminbi-denominated gold contracts to international investors. In June, SGE opened its first offshore vault in Hong Kong and launched two renminbi-denominated contracts there. Several international refineries have already set up in Hong Kong, including Heraeus and Metalor, while MKS Pamp joined the launch of the new SGE contracts. But some traders warn about political risk. “There is always this fear — is it a true international market, or is it something where, if the Chinese government didn’t like the result, they could change the rules?” said Robert Gottlieb, a former gold trader at JPMorgan and HSBC. Singapore expands vaulting and keeps neutral ground Singapore’s political neutrality drew BullionVault to pick the city-state over Hong Kong, said Adrian Ash, head of research at the trading platform. Both markets still need to improve liquidity, storage, custody and settlement services to compete with older centers, said Gregor Gregersen, founder of Silver Bullion. “What really matters in this industry is building up liquidity,” he said. Hong Kong still trails Singapore in warehouse capacity. The 30,000 sq m Le Freeport, opened in 2010 and often called “Singapore’s Fort Knox,” was originally built to hold fine art but now stores luxury cars, wine, jewelry and precious metals. Specialist storage firms like Brink’s and Loomis use the facility. “On the vaulting side, we are ahead in Singapore; on trading, I would say Hong Kong is ahead,” said Gregersen. “Both hubs have realised that the world is changing and they need to revisit their role when it comes to gold.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Specifically, the count stands at approximately 99.1 million, having experienced steady growth in recent months, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from CryptoQuant on September 29. XRP Ledger count. Source: CryptoQuant The ledger count has steadily risen since late 2022, reflecting greater use of the XRP Ledger, with the growth closely tracking notable XRP price movements. In this case, XRP traded below $0.40 for much of 2023 as the ledger count climbed. With network activity accelerating in 2024, XRP broke out from under $0.50 to above $2, marking one of its strongest rallies in years alongside rapid ledger growth. In 2025, the token has held a higher range between $2 and $3, with steady ledger expansion supporting stronger price stability. Overall, reaching 100 million ledgers will be a symbolic milestone, highlighting XRP’s resilience and adoption amid rising blockchain competition. Meanwhile, as the ledger count rises, XRP continues to attract significant interest despite trading below $3. Notably, whale investors have accumulated approximately 120 million tokens over the past three days. At the same time, market participants are watching the Securities Exchange Commission for approval of pending spot XRP ETF applications, which is expected later next month. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.86 after rallying almost 3% in the past 24 hours, while gaining about 1.4% on the weekly timeframe. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current valuation, the token is just below its 50-day SMA of $2.96, suggesting mild short-term weakness after XRP market value drop. However, it remains comfortably above the 200-day SMA of $2.59, indicating that the broader bullish trend is intact. On the other hand, the 14-day RSI at 45.95 points to neutral momentum, showing neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Overall, XRP appears to be consolidating, with price action balanced between short-term resistance and long-term support.

In 2025, attention is shifting toward both established names and new crypto presales. Projects like $FLOKI and $PEPE continue to command interest, while Zaddy Coin ($ZADDY) stands out as one of the best crypto presale tokens launched this year. Each project brings different strengths, from technical setups to cultural value and ecosystem innovation. For anyone following their preferred crypto presale list, the momentum around token presales signals a growing interest in both meme coins and utility-driven tokens. FLOKI: Technical Patterns Driving Market Interest $FLOKI has drawn significant interest due to its chart structure and technical setup. Analysts point to a Cup and Handle pattern on its daily chart, which many consider a bullish continuation signal. If this formation holds, $FLOKI may sustain its upward trajectory as long as support zones are respected. The neckline has already been retested with strong trading activity, which adds weight to this pattern’s credibility. With a current market cap of $781 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $57 million, $FLOKI is positioned among the top 120 crypto assets by size. For those exploring new crypto token presale opportunities, $FLOKI’s momentum shows how strong technical formations can attract both retail traders and long-term investors. Zaddy Coin: A New Presale with Multi-Layered Utility Zaddy Coin is already one of the most talked-about projects in 2025. Positioned as a multi-utility token, $ZADDY blends meme culture, decentralized finance, and lifestyle branding under one ecosystem. The project aims to unite XRP and Ethereum communities while offering generous staking reward programs, digital collectibles, and even fashion-inspired merchandise. For investors reviewing presale tokens, Zaddy Coin stands out because of its built-in strategic reserve, which comprises $XRP, $ETH, and stablecoins. This adds a layer of sustainability uncommon among most meme-driven projects. Alongside this, security measures such as KYC verification and smart contract audits bring transparency to its presale crypto process. The Zaddy Army, the project’s growing community, plays a crucial role in generating momentum. Beyond trading, Zaddy Coin is tied to a social mission by pledging a portion of its token supply and revenue to men’s health organizations. The $ZADDY presale is currently underway, with the next price increase scheduled in less than five days. So far, $5,038.63 has been raised toward its goal. The current price of 1 $ZADDY token is $0.00039. As a new token presale, $ZADDY is drawing attention not only as a cultural statement but also as one of the best crypto presale projects offering practical rewards, governance features, and ecosystem growth. PEPE: Meme Culture with Long-Term Staying Power $PEPE, built on Ethereum, has carved out a strong identity in the meme coin market. Inspired by the well-known frog character, it has created a loyal community base that keeps trading activity high. One of its core strengths lies in tokenomics, featuring a burn system that gradually reduces supply and redistribution mechanics that benefit holders directly. The coin’s zero-tax approach has also kept transactions simple and accessible, reinforcing trust among traders. Even with the ups and downs typical of meme assets, $PEPE continues to show resilience. For many investors, it remains one of the notable crypto coins on presale lists in previous cycles and a symbol of meme culture’s lasting influence in digital assets. Conclusion Looking at 2025, token presales are reshaping conversations about where value and culture intersect in crypto. $FLOKI shows the impact of a strong technical foundation, while $PEPE highlights the endurance of meme-driven tokens. Both remain key points of reference for investors analyzing cryptocurrency presales. At the same time, Zaddy Coin’s position as a new crypto token presale adds a different layer to the mix. With its ecosystem that blends DeFi, NFTs, and community-driven rewards, $ZADDY presents itself as one of the top presale crypto projects to watch closely. For investors building strategies around presale crypto tokens , 2025 will not be defined by one narrative alone. Instead, it is marked by how projects like $FLOKI, $PEPE, and Zaddy Coin shape their ecosystems while meeting the expectations of the broader crypto community.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-could-bounce-to-3-or-even-3-15-heres-why/,"XRP is standing at a pivotal moment. After weeks of choppy price action, the cryptocurrency is showing a balance of caution and underlying strength. Daily closes may appear indecisive, but a deeper analysis of liquidity and market structure suggests a firming base. This quiet consolidation is drawing attention because it often precedes significant moves, and analysts now see a rebound toward the $3 region as increasingly likely. Ali’s Bullish Outlook Respected crypto analyst Ali recently highlighted on X that XRP’s key support levels are holding steady. According to him, if this stability continues, the token could climb to $3 and possibly as high as $3.15 in the near term . His observation has captured the interest of traders who have been closely monitoring the mid-$2 support area for a potential breakout. Support is holding! $XRP could bounce to $3 or even $3.15. pic.twitter.com/yUSEWr28nA — Ali (@ali_charts) September 28, 2025 Technical Case for $3 The argument for a push toward $3 is built on clear technical evidence. XRP has repeatedly defended the $2.60–$2.70 zone, establishing a reliable floor for upward movement. On-chain data shows relatively light holder activity between $2.51 and $2.73, a zone that often acts as a launchpad rather than a magnet for extended selling. Momentum indicators, including a sustained bullish MACD signal, reinforce the view that buying pressure is gradually increasing. Together, these factors create a solid foundation for a measured advance toward the psychological $3 mark and the slightly higher $3.15 resistance. Supportive Market Environment Broader market conditions add weight to the bullish case. As of report time, trading data places XRP in the high-$2 range, keeping it within striking distance of $3. Other major cryptocurrencies have also posted moderate gains, contributing to a more positive sentiment across the sector and improving the odds of a sustained rally if momentum continues. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risks to Consider Despite the encouraging signals, the outlook is not without risk. A daily close below $2.65 would weaken the current support structure and could trigger fresh selling . A rally lacking strong trading volume might indicate a false breakout, while unexpected macroeconomic or regulatory developments could quickly shift sentiment. Market participants should remain alert and disciplined as the next phase unfolds. Outlook Ali’s analysis underscores a market that is cautiously optimistic yet technically strong. With solid support, limited nearby supply, and improving momentum, a controlled move to $3—and potentially $3.15—is a realistic possibility if buying interest holds. The coming days will reveal whether this setup marks the start of a lasting advance or merely a brief pause before the next major price swing.

This milestone came after the price of gold soared past $3,824.50 per ounce on Monday, recording a 45% rally this year, according to data from Bloomberg. The Treasury still lists the stash at just $11 billion, because the official value is tied to the outdated $42.22 per ounce price Congress locked in back in 1973. The U.S. controls the world’s biggest pile of gold, and its value has been exploding as investors pour in during a period of turbulence. The surge has been linked to trade wars, geopolitical flashpoints, and growing fears of a funding crisis in Washington. The rush has been strengthened by inflows into exchange-traded funds and the Federal Reserve’s decision to resume interest rate cuts , driving more investors into safe assets like gold. Treasury considers impact of revaluing gold holdings In early 2025, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent threw fuel on market speculation after making a casual remark about marking the government’s gold reserves to current market prices. Analysts jumped on the idea, calculating it could unleash hundreds of billions of dollars in new room for government spending. Days later, Scott backtracked, calling the chatter unfounded, and Bloomberg reported that no serious plan exists to push the revaluation forward. The U.S. system for handling reserves is different from most nations. The Treasury holds the physical gold, while the Federal Reserve only carries gold certificates that match the Treasury’s balance. In return, the Fed credits the government with dollars. If the government decided to update the value of its holdings to the market price, about $990 billion could be injected into the Treasury’s coffers. Under today’s tight debt ceiling, such a windfall would be tempting, but it could also flood the system with liquidity and interfere with the Fed’s ongoing efforts to shrink its balance sheet. Other countries have taken that step. Germany, Italy, and South Africa have all revalued their reserves in recent decades, as highlighted in an August note from a Federal Reserve economist. The United States has resisted, leaving the official numbers frozen in a 1970s time capsule while the market value rockets past the trillion-dollar line. Fort Knox and rising conspiracy theories The Treasury’s gold hoard is vast, totaling about 261.5 million ounces. More than half of it has been sealed away for decades in deep storage inside the famous vault near Fort Knox, Kentucky, where the stock was transferred during the 1930s from New York and Philadelphia to shield it from possible foreign attacks across the Atlantic. The rest is split between facilities in West Point, Denver, and an underground vault about 80 feet (24 meters) beneath the Federal Reserve building in lower Manhattan. Despite the tight security, questions about the reserves have refused to go away. In February 2025, conspiracy theories picked up steam when President Donald Trump and Elon Musk both questioned whether the stash at Fort Knox really exists as claimed. Trump told reporters, “We’re going to go to Fort Knox — the fabled Fort Knox — to make sure the gold is there. If the gold isn’t there, we’re going to be very upset.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Economy|Federal Reserve|Gold|Treasury Department|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-29 12:05:58

Paul made the statement in an opinion article published on Monday by the Financial Times, where he said he is examining the option of letting companies report financials every six months instead of every three. “The government should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation needed to protect investors while allowing businesses to flourish,” Paul wrote. The move signals a direct reversal from the regulatory style of his predecessor Gary Gensler , who had built an ambitious framework during the Biden administration. Paul said the Trump administration wants a more business-friendly approach and is also seeking tighter control over federal agencies. One of the most notable changes already underway is the SEC’s approach to crypto, which Paul has welcomed rather than challenged, in contrast with Gary’s aggressive enforcement record. The easing of rules for listed companies, he explained, is part of the same wider strategy. Paul Atkins attacks European disclosure rules In the same article, Paul criticized the European Union’s new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, saying they require the release of information “that may be socially significant but are not generally financially material.” He added that such requirements “risk imposing costs that fall on American investors and customers, while doing little to enhance the information that steers capital decisions.” Paul warned against disclosures that he said were “driven by political fads or distorted objectives.” He said that if Europe wanted to strengthen its capital markets and attract new listings, it should look at “reducing unnecessary reporting burdens.” He stressed that his own goal is to ensure that in the United States, the SEC keeps the focus on protecting investors instead of following what he called “ideologues.” The European Commission declined to respond immediately when asked about his comments. Earlier this year, the SEC voted to end its defense of a climate-risk disclosure rule that Gary had promoted as a central part of his agenda. The measure, which was challenged in federal court, would have forced companies to report climate-related risks for the first time. Paul wrote that “rules written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximising the financial return on their investment … fail investors.” He added that in recent years the SEC had “drifted from the precedent and predictability that sustain [trust in capital markets] — and from the clear mandate that Congress set for the agency over 90 years ago.” SEC prepares to end quarterly company reports Paul also confirmed he is following Trump’s call to remove rules that force public companies in the U.S. to disclose their results every quarter. He said: “It is time for the SEC to remove its thumb from the scales and allow the market to dictate the optimal reporting frequency based on factors such as the company’s industry, size and investor expectations.” Investor advocacy groups have pushed back, warning that ending quarterly reporting could hurt transparency and put smaller investors at a disadvantage. They argue that such a move would damage the efficiency of the U.S. markets. Paul responded by saying that dropping quarterly reports is not a new idea. He pointed to the UK, which switched back to semi-annual reporting in 2014, noting that some of its largest companies still chose to continue reporting quarterly. “Giving companies the option to report semi-annually is not a retreat from transparency,” wrote Paul.

Trading Activity Surges Across the Board Hyperliquid’s total trading volume has reached $84 billion, with daily activity now above $6 billion, per BlockchainBaller.

Open interest, however, only went up by 1% to $2.28 billion. Such a gap between volume and open interest suggests that most traders are opening and closing their positions within a short span of time. Very few long-term positions seem to exist, meaning that short-term positions are accounting for present circumstances. New NFT Collection Launches on HyperEVM On September 28, Hyperliquid released its Hypurr NFT collection. A total of 4,600 cat-themed NFTs were created. Of these, 4,313 went to early users who took part in the Genesis Event held in November 2024. The rest were allocated to developers, artists, and the project’s foundation.

Many traders ask themselves this every day as they watch others turn small investments into life-changing fortunes. The truth is that timing matters, and those who position themselves early often reap the greatest rewards. Dogecoin is the prime example. Once seen as a joke, it went on to reward its early community with massive gains. Those who bought late were left chasing the hype, wondering why cats always seem to land on their feet while they’re stuck sliding around like penguins on ice. The popularity of meme coins shows no sign of slowing down, and a new contender is now stepping into the spotlight. The MoonBull ($MOBU) presale is live, and it’s drawing attention from both casual traders and seasoned analysts. For anyone looking for early access 1000x cryptos 2025, this project could be the chance to catch lightning in a bottle. MoonBull ($MOBU) Presale: Grab Your Second Chance at 1000x Cryptos MoonBull has launched with a bang, offering a 23-stage presale that rewards those who move quickly. Stage 1 tokens are priced at just $0.000025. By Stage 23, the price will climb to $0.00616. That’s a jaw-dropping projected ROI of 24,540%. Investors who put in $2000 at Stage 1 receive 80 million tokens, which would be worth nearly half a million dollars by the final stage. It’s a once-in-a-generation second chance at a 1000x opportunity. The tokenomics are designed for balance and growth. Out of its total 73.2 billion supply, half goes to the presale, while 20% fuels staking that delivers a staggering 95% APY starting at Stage 10. Eleven percent powers referrals, giving both referrers and referees 15% bonuses. Meanwhile, liquidity is locked for two years to prevent rug pulls, and smart contract audits confirm the code is secure. Reflection rewards, continuous burns, and auto-liquidity further support the price floor. Why MoonBull Presale Packs More Punch Than Peanuts The presale system builds urgency by increasing the price with every stage. Those who act early secure maximum upside, while latecomers pay more for the same tokens. This built-in FOMO pushes demand and ensures momentum grows with each phase. Security is also at the core. MoonBull has completed an audit and implemented liquidity locks, giving investors peace of mind. These steps protect against common risks like insider withdrawals, which have harmed many meme projects in the past. MoonBull adds utility through governance, starting at Stage 12, where holders gain real voting power on proposals such as burns, marketing campaigns, and incentive allocations. Every token equals one vote, ensuring decisions reflect the community’s voice. Combined with staking, referrals, reflections, and burns, MoonBull isn’t just another hype-driven coin. It’s positioned as MoonBull next 1000x meme coin, offering investors both excitement and sustainable mechanics. Dogecoin: From Meme to Market Legend Dogecoin started as a playful experiment, based on an internet meme featuring the Shiba Inu dog. Yet what began as a joke transformed into a cultural and financial phenomenon. Communities rallied, Elon Musk tweets poured gasoline on the fire, and a token with no real roadmap suddenly became a household name in crypto. The coin proved how humor, relatability, and internet culture could fuel market growth. Early adopters laughed all the way to the bank, while many others were left holding small bags, feeling like they brought peanuts to a bull fight. Dogecoin’s story reminds everyone how critical timing is in crypto. But Dogecoin also showed its limits. With little more than its community and hype, it lacked features like staking, governance, and structured presales. For long-term growth, these elements matter. That’s where MoonBull seeks to go beyond Dogecoin’s model — combining meme coin energy with stronger fundamentals and investor protections. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, MoonBull ($MOBU) presale is more than just another meme project. It’s a structured, secure, and community-driven presale that offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor of what could be one of the next 1000x cryptos. With audited contracts, liquidity locks, staking rewards, and community governance, it blends safety with explosive growth potential. The presale is live now, and Stage 1 offers the lowest entry point. Waiting means higher prices and smaller upside. Investors who missed Dogecoin have a second chance here, and the numbers speak volumes. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers — MoonBull could be the bull run that changes everything.

According to NBA star Tristan Thompson, NBA players are actively discussing XRP in private text groups, debating whether to increase their holdings. This growing chatter suggests that the cryptocurrency is capturing the attention of high-profile athletes who are closely watching market trends. XRP has long been a favorite among institutional investors due to its utility as a bridge currency in cross-border transactions. Now, it appears the token is crossing into the realm of mainstream pop culture, gaining visibility among athletes whose financial influence extends far beyond the court. Thompson’s revelation indicates a subtle yet significant trend: professional athletes are not only investing in crypto but are also collaborating informally to gauge market sentiment. Digital Asset Investor highlights that this insider-level attention could have broader implications for XRP. When high-profile figures show interest, it can attract retail investors seeking to follow their lead, potentially amplifying price movements. Notably, the mere discussion among NBA players signals confidence, or at least curiosity, in the token’s long-term prospects. Thompson emphasizes that the NBA itself is aware of these conversations with this acknowledgment hinting at the growing recognition of digital assets as part of athletes’ financial portfolios. With athletes increasingly exploring alternative investments, XRP’s presence in these conversations could signify a broader shift in how high-net-worth individuals approach cryptocurrency. Therefore, this intersection of sports and digital assets highlights a unique dynamic in the crypto world. This is because athlete-driven discussions represent a real-time, peer-influenced sentiment that can sway smaller investors and create market momentum. For XRP, being on the radar of NBA stars could translate into heightened visibility, increased adoption, and a stronger foothold in mainstream culture. XRP Eyes Critical $3 Level as Market Waits for Direction According to market expert CryptoMentor, XRP is currently consolidating between established support and resistance levels, showing no definitive breakout in the near term. This consolidation phase reflects the market’s indecision, as traders weigh technical signals and broader market sentiment before committing to a direction. CryptoMentor notes that until XRP successfully reclaims the $3 mark, the likelihood of a short-term downward move remains significant. Specifically, the market expert leans toward a wave-(C) decline to complete the ongoing corrective structure. This perspective aligns with Elliott Wave principles, which suggest that corrective waves often finish before a renewed trend can emerge. For XRP, the completion of wave-(C) could mark the final stage of a pullback, potentially setting the stage for a stronger recovery once key support levels hold. Technically, XRP is consolidating in a tight range, with buyers defending lows and sellers testing $3 resistance. RSI and moving averages show muted momentum, indicating potential short-term sideways movement or a minor pullback as the market digests recent gains. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.85, according to CoinGecko data . Conclusion As NBA players quietly eye XRP, the token is crossing into mainstream culture. Their interest signals potential influence on broader investors, boosting adoption and cementing XRP’s status as both a digital payment solution and a high-profile asset. Meanwhile, XRP sits at a critical crossroads because $3 is the decisive level for its short-term trend.

Spot prices remained stable over the weekend, despite significant ETF outflows last Friday, suggesting that selling pressure was absorbed more strongly than expected. QCP Capital argued that quarter-end liquidations were the main driver of these outflows and that this week's ETF flows will determine the direction of institutional demand. Related News: Listing Storm on South Korean Exchanges: 3 Altcoins Listed Simultaneously! The report revealed that despite a challenging month, Bitcoin closed September with a gain of more than 3%. Analysts noted that the market is preparing for the seasonal rally known as “Uptober,” and that it is critical for BTC to surpass the $115,000 level to confirm the uptrend. Cautious optimism is prevailing in the options market. According to QCP Capital, investor confidence is slowly returning, bearish sentiment is diminishing, and open interest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum is beginning to stabilize. This suggests that a potential October rally is starting to be factored in among investors, according to the analyst firm. *This is not investment advice.

Namely, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing to make its final decisions on no less than 16 cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) in October. These proposed applications span a range of major altcoins, including Solana ( SOL ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Cardano ( ADA ). The first decision deadline is October 2 for Canary’s Litecoin ( LTE ) ETF, followed by Grayscale’s Solana and Litecoin trust conversions on October 10, and finally WisdomTree’s XRP fund on October 24. However, the approvals could come at any time before these deadlines, as noted by NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci, who expects “enormous next few weeks for spot crypto ETFs.” *Enormous* next few weeks for spot crypto ETFs… SEC final deadlines approaching on numerous filings. Starts this week w/ deadline on Canary spot ltc ETF. Will be followed by decisions on sol, doge, xrp, ada, & hbar ETFs (though SEC can approve any or all of these whenever). — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 28, 2025 Is another altcoin rally coming? The SEC has delayed multiple decisions this year, but it has also made some moves to streamline approval timelines as it adopted a more crypto-friendly approach. For example, on September 17, the agency approved a new listing standard for commodity-based trust shares, potentially shortening the process for future spot crypto ETFs. If Geraci’s words come true, sudden new fund approvals could spark a new altcoin rally following increased retail participation. Right now, the market appears most interested in the six XRP applications, as the odds of approval on crypto-focused betting platform Polymarket have skyrocketed to over 99%. Ripple ETF approval chance. Source: Polymarket Recent whale activity is also addding to the optimism, as 120 million tokens have been soaked up by large-scale investors over the past 72 hours. This suggests the token’s recent pullback, which caused a notable XRP market value drop this month, is about to reverse now that whales have bought the dip. Finally, Ripple’s application for a national bank charter is also under review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), with a decision expected in October. Approval here would likewise enable XRP Ledger to expand its services to institutional clients and provide regulatory clarity, further strengthening its position in the U.S. financial system and adding steam to potential ETFs.

Blockchain data reviewed by Finbold from Etherscan shows that on September 28, Buterin’s wallet, vitalik.eth , sold 150 billion PUPPIES tokens for 28.58 ETH, worth approximately $114,700 at the time of the transaction. In a separate swap, he also unloaded 1 billion units of an ERC20 memecoin for 13,889 USDC, securing just over $13,800. Vitalik Buterin’s recent transactions. Source: Etherscan Details of Buterin’s transactions The transactions, which took place within hours of each other, highlight a familiar pattern. Buterin has historically distanced himself from unsolicited memecoin allocations, often referred to as “airdrops,” by liquidating them quickly. His sales are typically interpreted less as a market call on the tokens themselves and more as a statement that he does not wish to hold speculative assets he never asked for. The timing comes amid heightened scrutiny of Ethereum markets. ETH currently trades around $4,100, while the broader crypto market has faced a turbulent week, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) at one point slipping under $110,000. While the dollar amounts in these sales are modest compared to Ethereum’s nearly $495 billion market capitalization, Buterin’s transactions draw significant attention because of his central role in the crypto ecosystem. Each movement from his wallet sparks debate about meme coin sustainability, Ethereum’s positioning, and broader retail speculation. As Finbold previously reported, large on-chain moves by high-profile wallets, including XRP whale accumulations and Bitcoin millionaire shakeouts are shaping narratives in volatile markets.

""The Fed's Job Is Getting Harder, Regarding Interest Rates…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/fed-member-warns-the-feds-job-is-getting-harder-regarding-interest-rates/,"The Fed recently made an expected 25 basis point cut. However, in a statement after the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that the road ahead would be challenging. Powell, in his speech on September 23, stated that the two-sided risk remains, saying, “The short-term risks to inflation are to the upside, and the risks to employment are to the downside, and that's a challenging situation.” The Fed is Going Through a Difficult Period! Following Powell's statements, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack also made similar statements. Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box, Hammack said the Fed faces challenges trying to balance fighting stubborn inflation with protecting jobs. Hammack stated that the FED is going through a difficult period and that the institution is stuck between inflation and the job market. “The Fed is working to reduce inflation to its 2% target while continuing its mission to improve the labor market. The Fed is stuck between its two tasks.” At this point, the FED member stated that they are going through a difficult period in terms of monetary policy and said that they need to maintain a restrictive policy stance in order to bring inflation back to the 2 percent target. Hammack, who recently stated that they have not been able to reach the 2 percent inflation target for 4.5 years, expressed his concern about inflation. When asked whether cutting interest rates was a mistake, he said, “We have a 2% inflation target, but we still haven't reached it in 4.5 years. I have concerns about this. There's no clear answer yet to the question of whether cutting interest rates was a mistake. We're going through a difficult period.” Hammack recently predicted that the Fed's 2% inflation target would likely be reached by the end of 2027 or early 2028, with inflation remaining above target for the next one to two years. *This is not investment advice.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.6 (+0.9%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.613 24-hour low $0.592 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.6 Price Prediction $ 0.445315 (-25.25%) Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 6.12% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.631628 200-Day SMA $ 0.61916 14-Day RSI 45.1 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced a bullish pressure toward $0.6 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced a buying pressure toward $0.6 Resistance for dYdX is at $0.6266 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.5518 The dYdX price analysis for 29 September confirms that dYdX faced a surge as sellers lost confidence. Currently, buyers are dominating, resulting in an upward push above $0.6. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price surges toward $0.6 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price attempted a surge above immediate Fib levels. As a result, buyers are now aiming for a hold above the $0.6 mark. The 24-hour volume surged to $2.99 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.6, surging by over 0.9% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around 45, hinting that buyers are gaining momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bulls strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are holding the price above the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.43, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.60699 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.613157 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.632001 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.648051 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.631628 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.585435 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.61916 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.605852 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.611869 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.623413 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.631191 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.621879 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.622395 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.712527 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6266, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.7387. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5518, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4911. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bullish as buyers are holding the price above $0.6. This has resulted in a strong accumulation among buyers. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.65 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX has updated its 2025 roadmap, outlining plans to launch a Telegram trading integration as the platform faces declining earnings. According to the roadmap, dYdX plans to roll out a series of software upgrades that include a partner fee share, scale and TWAP orders and designated proposers, targeting the reduction of end-to-end trading latency. dYdX price prediction September 2025 August was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin surged toward $0.76 but failed to maintain its buying momentum. As a result, dYdX dropped below $0.6. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.75 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $0.9, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction September 2025 $0.45 $0.75 $0.9 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June. By the end of June, dYdX had declined toward $0.41. In July, the token surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain buying demand and dropped below $0.6. In August, dYdX again surged toward $0.76 but declined later toward $0.6.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,TRADING|DYDX|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|WLD|ALTCOIN|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-29 13:13:18

According to a report released Monday by Bloomberg Intelligence, the expansion will add 53 gigawatts of new capacity to the existing fleet and bring total U.S. nuclear generation to 159 gigawatts. The main reason behind this growth is the surge of artificial intelligence data centers that need far more electricity than the grid currently delivers. Bloomberg Intelligence said the country’s push is driven by a demand for carbon-free fission power as utilities scramble to keep up with the coming wave of electricity consumption. The report also noted that building new nuclear projects in the U.S. still faces heavy costs, slow construction schedules, and shortages of skilled workers, fuel supply issues, and regulatory barriers. The study pointed out that only three traditional reactors have been completed in the U.S. this century, and none are under construction now. Despite those barriers, the report said plainly, “U.S. nuclear power is primed for a resurgence.” AI energy demand fuels $350 billion nuclear investment The research explained that this projected rise in nuclear output, though large, still falls short of official targets. The Biden administration last year set a goal to triple national capacity by 2050, while President Donald Trump issued executive orders in May aiming to quadruple output from reactors. Bloomberg Intelligence stressed that these government targets are far above its current forecast. The report explained that most of the new capacity will come from small modular reactors, or SMRs. These are a new type of nuclear technology designed to be cheaper and faster to install than traditional plants. Dozens of companies are developing SMR designs, but none have yet been built inside the U.S. Bloomberg Intelligence forecasted that the scale-up will begin slowly, with only 9 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity, of any kind, coming online in the next decade. It projected that widespread SMR deployment will not begin until after 2035. This data shows a major shift for an industry that has been largely stagnant for decades. Yet it also underlines the gap between official ambitions and what the market analysis expects to happen. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the combination of AI-driven demand , unproven SMR technology, and existing infrastructure problems means the U.S. will move ahead but at a measured pace. Every figure in the report points to a massive but complex nuclear effort that will change how the country produces electricity over the next 25 years. Get seen where it counts.

That’s very bullish for the first cryptocurrency’s long-term future prospects. But resistance at $120,000 has been fierce. Bulls have not shown the will to break through that line. Meanwhile, daily trading volume surged to meet profit-takers and buy the dip, for example, the first week in September and during the last ten days of this month. That has helped maintain key support for BTC at a level slightly above $110,000. But when will Bitcoin rally to the 2025 high prices expert crypto analysts have predicted for this year? Many have called for $150,000 BTC in 2025. Moreover, some even expect $200,000. With over 1.4 million followers on the X app, popular YouTube crypto market analyst Lark Davis said on Saturday, 9/27, “The absolute worst time to get shaken out is now.” Source: X Here are some quick reasons why social sentiment for Bitcoin is trending bullish as the little Internet currency consolidates its August high prices to close out Q3. Trump Predicts ‘Unbelievable’ BTC Rally The Trump family went all in this year with support for cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, riding on the coattails of US President Donald Trump’s foray into the industry. In a New York Post interview with NYNext’s correspondent, Lydia Moynihan, published on 9/26, the president’s son, Eric Trump, said he believes Q4 will be “unbelievable” for Bitcoin prices. Trump’s analysis? He told Moynihan this past week that “The money supply around the world is skyrocketing right now.” He also said that eventually Bitcoin’s price will “surpass a million dollars.” “Fourth quarter has always been the best quarter for cryptocurrencies,” he added. Eric Trump is the executive VP of the Trump Organization and co-founder of blockchain firm World Liberty Financial. Soon after that interview, Altcoin Gordon, a popular degen crypto market analyst on X (814K followers) said , “My source at the Whitehouse says Q4 will be HUGE for crypto.” In addition to Mr. Trump, several other key expert analysts for crypto markets are bullish for a strong finish to this year. Zap founder and CEO Jack Mallers (502K followers on X) believes Bitcoin’s price will go “nuclear” before we run out of 2025. Moreover, Standard Chartered, VanEck, and Bernstein, among others, remain bullish for a $180k – $200k BTC price this side of 2026. Gaza Peace Dividend Trump Bump? Meanwhile, hype is building on social media around an imminent Gaza peace plan out of the Trump White House to end the fighting between the State of Israel and Hamas militants in Palestine. Posting to 2.5 million followers on X, Unusual Whales, wrote on Saturday, 9/27, “BREAKING: Trump administration plans to end Gaza war with immediate halt to all military operations, per WaPo.” Geopolitical uncertainty surrounding Ukraine and Israel has been a drag on market prices for stocks and cryptocurrencies over the current Bitcoin supercycle. Financial markets tend to abhor conflict and uncertainty. But when matters are settled, they often rally in what is popularly termed a “peace dividend.” In addition to the geopolitical wheel turning, there are also the typical yearly “Uptober” seasonality and the “ Santa Claus rally ” to look forward to in the stock and crypto markets. US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Meanwhile, as the Trump administration and family crypto business pump a potentially “yuge” Q4 rally for Bitcoin prices, the US government and Federal Reserve are making moves that support more gains. The US Digital Asset Stockpile and Strategic Bitcoin Reserve established by the White House by executive order in March is a key support for BTC markets looming on the horizon. In fact, during an interview with Business Insider at the World Economic Forum back in January, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said: “For store of value, I think it’s going to be important for governments to hold this over time. It might start with being 1% of their reserve. But over time, I think it will come to be equal to or greater than gold reserves.” The White House and Treasury Department haven’t made any big headlines on this since Q1, but it’s just hanging there as a major bullish factor in the minds of Bitcoin bulls. Galaxy Digital published a white paper on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, highlighting that the US owns about 200K BTC and is committed to hodling them and not selling. That’s about 1% of all BTC in existence.

Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC led the surge, while Ethena’s USDe emerged as a fast-rising player. Ethereum remained the dominant network for stablecoins, followed by Tron. Despite the sharp increase in supply and demand, usage metrics showed a slowdown. Stablecoin Inflows Jump Stablecoins saw a remarkable surge in demand over the past quarter, with more than $46 billion in net inflows recorded over the last 90 days. This is according to data from RWA.xyz . The growth sheds some light on the increasing appetite for US dollar-pegged assets in the crypto sector, particularly as investors look for stability amid market volatility. Tether’s USDT led the charge with $19.6 billion in inflows, cementing its role as the dominant player in the sector. Circle’s USDC followed closely with $12.3 billion, which was a sharp rebound from just $500 million in net issuance in the previous quarter. Ethena’s synthetic stablecoin USDe also made waves by attracting $9 billion in inflows after recording only $200 million in the prior quarter. Top stablecoin net flows (Source: RWA.xyz ) Other issuers also contributed to the surge. PayPal’s PYUSD recorded $1.4 billion in inflows, while MakerDAO’s USDS added $1.3 billion. Ripple’s RLUSD and Ethena’s USDtb, although smaller, posted steady growth. In total, stablecoin inflows grew by over 324% compared to the second quarter, with $56.5 billion flowing in over the past six months, of which just $10.8 billion came in Q2. The third quarter alone accounted for the bulk of the gains. Ethereum still dominates as the leading network for stablecoins, hosting $171 billion in circulating supply, while Tron holds the second spot with $76 billion. Other chains, including Solana, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain, collectively host around $29.7 billion. In terms of token dominance, USDT controls nearly 59% of the stablecoin market, with USDC at around 25% and Ethena’s USDe quickly rising to nearly 5%, according to DefiLlama . Stablecoin market cap by network (Source: RWA.xyz ) Overall, the stablecoin market cap expanded to roughly $290 billion in the past month. However, not all metrics reflected growth. RWA.xyz reported that monthly active addresses fell 22.6% to 26 million, while transfer volumes slipped 11% to $3.17 trillion.

A recent chart shared by analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) highlights a significant development tied to the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. The index currently reads 33, placing it within the fear zone. According to the chart, the levels have historically aligned with price support areas, suggesting that XRP may be presenting an attractive entry point . Steph stated that the asset is currently flashing a 100% accurate buy signal, showing strong conviction that conditions are aligning for a potential rebound. 100% accurate #XRP buy signal is flashing NOW! pic.twitter.com/nclzwV2zTw — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 27, 2025 The Fear and Greed Index The Fear and Greed Index tracks overall sentiment across the digital asset market. It ranges from extreme fear to extreme greed, offering a gauge of whether traders are overly cautious or excessively optimistic. The latest reading shows a sharp decline into fear territory, marked on the chart with a downward arrow. Historically, these low levels have often been followed by reversals as markets transition from weak hands selling into stronger accumulation phases. Technical Position of XRP Earlier rallies took the asset above $3.5, before settling closer to $3 in recent months. The current retracement has coincided with the decline in sentiment indicators, bringing attention to the alignment between market psychology and technical price zones. The chart suggests that XRP may have reached a local bottom, as the Fear and Greed Index sits near levels last seen during earlier corrections in 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Where is XRP Going Next? Each of those periods precedes renewed upward movement. If XRP sustains support at current levels, analysts often look toward prior resistance points for upward targets. The first key level stands around $3.33, which has been highlighted in past analyses as an important threshold . A move above this point could confirm renewed bullish momentum. The last notable decline in the Fear and Greed Index came in May, and XRP surged to a new all-time high of $3.65 in July following a swift rebound. If the asset repeats this trajectory, it could reach and even surpass $4 in the coming months, closing 2025 at new heights. For longer-term traders , maintaining momentum above $4 could also create conditions for attempts toward higher valuations. While the timing of such moves depends on broader market factors, the alignment of sentiment and technical structure suggests that XRP is positioned for renewed activity once buying pressure returns.

The latest purchase happened as MSTR share prices still held above $300. Strategy continued its buying streak of small additions, with another 196 BTC put away in its treasury. The purchase was expected, as Executive Chairman Michael Saylor signaled on social media late on Sunday. The latest weekly purchase meant Strategy was “ buying the dip ” as BTC sank as low as $109,000. Following the announcement, BTC traded at $112,222, as the crypto market attempted a recovery. Strategy acquired the new batch at an average price of $113,048, closing in on an average price of $74,000 per coin. Strategy has acquired 196 BTC for ~$22.1 million at ~$113,048 per bitcoin. As of 9/28/2025, we hodl 640,031 $BTC acquired for ~$47.35 billion at ~$73,983 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/kZj8Y07Zfb — Strategy (@Strategy) September 29, 2025 Strategy has bought smaller BTC batches for three weeks in a row, an unusually long streak. The purchase is the smallest since August 11, when Strategy added only 155 coins. In the coming weeks, Strategy may also skip a week as it prepares for the Q3 report roundup. Strategy uses MSTR again To complete the current purchase, Strategy issued more MSTR common stock despite the lowered price. Based on the recent filing, the company raised $116.4M from MSTR common stock issuance. The company also raised $400K in STRD preferred shares. The current weekly raise is for a total of $128.1M, though only $22.1M went toward BTC purchases. In previous weeks, Strategy invested all its proceeds into BTC. However, based on its new issuance rules, the company can also issue some of its common or preferred shares for operational costs. The company must still cover mandatory dividends for its preferred shares. Following the latest stock issuance, MSTR shares traded at $306.09. The mNAV asset value recovered to 1.44, though still not above the 2.5 limit, which would indicate much better health. Strategy is now trying to extend its purchases while lacking the initial enthusiasm for its MSTR shares. However, BTC purchased at earlier stages is now significantly more valuable, despite the drop in share prices. When it comes to the preferred shares, only STRF trades at $109, while STRK, STRD, and STRF trade under $100, offering a discount and varying levels of risk. Can Strategy recover its MSTR price levels? MSTR managed to retain the $300 level, setting up expectations for recovery by the end of 2025. MSTR bounced from its one-month lows and is trading around the middle of its range for the past six months. MSTR bounced from its lows just above $300, after Strategy announced another small BTC purchase. | Source: Google Finance The common stock dipped to a recent low of $300.70, while BTC was also trading under $110,000. MSTR thrives best during periods of exuberant trading, where demand for more BTC keeps the share prices high. Even outside Strategy’s buying, smaller companies are still adding BTC to their balances, even with sporadic purchases. The DAT company trend has lost some momentum, and companies have also erased a significant part of their market value, as Cryptopolitan reported . However, even the presence of treasuries helps with the long-term holding trend for BTC.

According to CoinShares , Bitcoin and Ethereum bore the brunt of selling pressure with $719 million and $409 million in outflows, respectively. Year-to-date inflows remain strong at $39.6 billion despite the weekly reversal. Bitcoin and Ethereum lead $812M weekly outflows Bitcoin investment products faced $719 million in outflows during the week, seeing the largest single-asset redemption. The selling pressure followed revised GDP and durable goods figures that exceeded expectations, reducing market conviction around aggressive Fed rate cutting. Notably, short-Bitcoin product demand showed no increase. Month-to-date Bitcoin flows stand at $3.184 billion positive despite weekly weakness, while year-to-date inflows reach $23.98 billion. Assets under management total $170.748 billion across Bitcoin investment products. Source: CoinShares Ethereum suffered $409.4 million in weekly outflows and brought September’s monthly total to just $86.2 million in inflows. The slowdown contrasts with year-to-date inflows of $12.174 billion accumulated through August. Total Ethereum product AUM stands at $34.665 billion, reflecting sustained interest despite recent weakness. Multi-asset products recorded $83.5 million in weekly outflows, with month-to-date redemptions reaching $118.7 million. Year-to-date flows remain slightly negative at -$2 million despite $7.428 billion in AUM. US dominates outflows while European markets show resilience The United States led regional outflows with $1.037 billion in weekly redemptions and accounted for more than the total global outflow figure. Month-to-date US flows remain positive at $3.503 billion while year-to-date inflows reach $37.229 billion. Total US AUM stands at $154.413 billion, which is approximately 70% of global digital asset investment product market. iShares ETFs posted $68 million in weekly outflows despite maintaining $99.283 billion in AUM and $33.203 billion in year-to-date inflows. Grayscale Investments suffered $300 million in weekly redemptions, bringing month-to-date outflows to $344 million. The legacy provider’s year-to-date outflows total $1.954 billion from $32.982 billion AUM. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund recorded $738 million in weekly outflows, which is the largest single-provider redemption.

Bitwise Funds Trust posted $169 million in weekly outflows while ARK 21 Shares saw $123 million in redemptions. Switzerland showed strong positive flows with $126.8 million in weekly inflows and suggested European institutional conviction despite US weakness. Month-to-date Swiss flows reach $85.2 million while year-to-date totals $364 million from $7.334 billion AUM. Canada contributed $58.6 million in weekly inflows with month-to-date flows of $97.8 million. Year-to-date Canadian inflows total $532 million from $6.769 billion AUM. Germany added $35.5 million weekly with month-to-date inflows of $330.6 million and year-to-date contributions of $1.492 billion from $6.963 billion AUM. Sweden posted modest $13.4 million in weekly outflows with month-to-date redemptions of $46.1 million. Year-to-date Swedish outflows reach $617 million from $3.659 billion AUM. Solana and XRP attract inflows ahead of ETF launches Solana has stood out as the standout performer with $291 million in weekly inflows. This was primarily driven by the anticipation of upcoming US ETF launches . Month-to-date Solana flows reach $628.1 million while year-to-date inflows total $1.869 billion. Total AUM stands at $3.645 billion. The Solana inflow timing coincides with multiple ETF applications progressing through SEC review processes under new streamlined approval standards. The $291 million weekly figure is approximately 8% of total Solana product AUM. XRP products attracted $93.1 million in weekly inflows with month-to-date flows of $210.8 million. Year-to-date XRP inflows reach $1.608 billion from $2.722 billion AUM. Sui posted modest $2.9 million in weekly inflows with month-to-date flows of $19.5 million.

Canaccord reiterated its buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to $16 from $12. The shares rose 1.2% in early trading to around $11.60. While the market had been expecting Cipher to secure an AI data center partner for Barber Lake before year-end, last week’s announcement went further than anticipated, the report said. CIFR inked an agreement with Fluidstack, backed by Google , confirming its place in the “miner pivot-to-AI” trend that is sweeping the industry. Crucially, the deal arrived in during a flurry of hyperscaler and GPU cloud provider contracts, helping to validate demand for large-scale AI compute and putting to rest some concerns about market size, at least in the near term, analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. The positive sentiment around Cipher's prospects has been reflected in its share price over the past several months, giving the company a stronger currency for capital raising, the analysts noted. The $1.1 billion convertible note priced last week at a 0.00% coupon, an unusually attractive cost of capital, and is expected to allow the company to retain 100% ownership of Barber Lake, Canaccord said. Management had earlier signaled that it might be willing to sell a stake in the project to reduce leverage. With improved equity pricing and stronger market fundamentals, the company appears positioned to fund Barber Lake without giving up equity. More AI deals are likely. The Barber Lake agreement does not cover the entire facility, leaving meaningful capacity available for future contracts. With a 2.6 gigawatt (GW) development pipeline, energized sites like Odessa and the ramping Black Pearl could also see AI co-location deals in the future, the report added.

That’s because Bitcoin is down nearly 10% from its all-time high of $ 124,000 last month, currently trading around $112,000. Overall, Bitcoin remains one of the best-performing assets in history. However, lately, it seems to be stuck in a slump. Is this a bug in Bitcoin’s code? At least one analyst, Jordi Visser, believes the pullbacks are actually part of steady growth and warns that more pullbacks could become common even as Bitcoin continues to rise. The Nvidia Parallel Visser compares Nvidia, the semiconductor giant whose stock skyrocketed during the AI boom. Less than three years after ChatGPT’s rise, Nvidia’s stock surged by over 1,000%. Yet during that ascent, it weathered five corrections of 20% or more before reclaiming higher highs. The comparison makes sense, according to Visser, because Bitcoin isn’t just a digital currency or a speculative investment – it’s becoming part of the larger AI and tech conversation. As AI transforms traditional industries and replaces old business models, investors may start to view $BTC as both a hedge against disruption and the native digital store of value for the next wave of innovation. Visser has written about this before , highlighting how AI and crypto innovation aren’t simply a progression of technology, but a fundamental reworking of core institutions, such as banking (through crypto) and production itself (through AI). In that telling, capital might flow into Bitcoin alongside AI-favored equities, tying its trajectory to momentum in the tech sector. Possible Pathways Forward Visser’s outlook doesn’t preclude further upside; his prediction about Bitcoin’s connection with AI actually adds weight to Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Still, Visser warns that deep pullbacks may punctuate the rally. On the technical side, EMAs still paint a bullish picture, despite recent narrowing. A similar narrowing of the EMA bands occurred before the surge in $BTC’s price in July, building up to August’s ATH. Stablecoins, Bitcoin, DeFi – crypto’s many use cases increasingly point to a continued crypto revolution. Corrections aside, Bitcoin could be set for continued long-term growth as blockchain and AI tech feed on each other. That makes projects like Bitcoin Hyper, with a problem-solving Bitcoin Layer 2, even more critical. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Faster, Cheaper Bitcoin Transactions for Ecosystem Growth Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) tackles some of Bitcoin’s biggest limitations head-on. Bitcoin processes an average of 7 transactions per second; by leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine, Hyper processes several thousand. Bitcoin suffers from congestion and low throughput, but Hyper relies on Solana’s greater scalability. With the SVM and a Bitcoin Canonical Bridge, all the tools and features that investors typically find on Solana are now open to Bitcoin. That means meme coins, DeFi, native staking – the whole works. Bitcoin Hyper actually provides a hybrid architecture, utilizing a bridge to the SVM for wrapped Bitcoin, while reserving final transaction settlement for Layer 1. You can learn how to buy $HYPER with our guide. Given the broader market and some traders’ frustration with Bitcoin’s performance, it’s not surprising that $HYPER is attracting significant presale investment as investors learn more about what Hyper is . The presale has already surpassed $18.8M, with tokens priced at just $0.012995. Don’t overlook Bitcoin Hyper’s potential – read more at the official website. Jordi Visser offers a bullish Bitcoin picture, at least for the long term. Corrections won’t derail an ongoing bull run – they’re likely vital components of it. Suppose Bitcoin follows the pattern of Nvidia and undergoes multiple steep pullbacks en route to higher highs. In that case, it won’t necessarily herald a collapse, but could actually indicate just how far Bitcoin Hyper —and Bitcoin itself—could go. As always, do your own research. This isn’t financial advice.

This week, with the start of October, while ETF decisions for altcoins such as XRP and Solana (SOL) are awaited, CoinShares published its weekly cryptocurrency report and stated that there was an outflow of $812 million last week. “Cryptocurrency investment products saw outflows of $812 million last week, but year-to-date inflows remain strong at $39.6 billion, close to last year's record.” Bitcoin Saw the Biggest Uptrend! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While Bitcoin experienced an inflow of $719 million, Ethereum (ETH) experienced an inflow of $409 million. When we look at altcoins, the positive atmosphere is seen, with Solana (SOL) experiencing an inflow of $291 million, XRP $93.1 million, and Sui (SUI) $2.9 million. “Bitcoin recorded $719 million in outflows for the week. Ethereum saw $409 million in outflows last week, virtually halting the $12 billion in inflows since the beginning of the year. September inflows have now fallen to just $86.2 million. Solana was among the standout performers with $291 million and XRP with $93.1 million, likely part of the eagerly anticipated upcoming US ETF launches. When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, the USA ranked first with an outflow of $1 billion. After the United States, Sweden came in second with an exit of $13.4 million. In comparison to these outflows, Switzerland experienced an inflow of $126.8 million and Canada $58.6 million. *This is not investment advice.

Despite the pullback, year-to-date inflows remain substantial at $39.6 billion, close to 2023’s record inflows of $48.6 billion. On a monthly basis, inflows total $4 billion, suggesting that overall demand for digital assets remains resilient. Regional Divergence: U.S. Outflows vs. European Strength The U.S. accounted for the bulk of the negative flows, registering $1 billion in outflows. However, the weakness was largely confined to the American market. Other jurisdictions, including Switzerland, Canada, and Germany, demonstrated more positive sentiment. Switzerland led with inflows of $126.8 million, followed by Canada with $58.6 million and Germany with $35.5 million. This divergence suggests that while U.S. macroeconomic uncertainty is dampening institutional flows, global demand for digital assets remains broadly intact. Bitcoin and Ethereum Under Pressure Bitcoin bore the brunt of the outflows, losing $719 million last week. However, CoinShares notes the absence of significant demand for short-bitcoin products, indicating that the bearish positioning may be low conviction and temporary. Ethereum also faced headwinds, with $409 million in outflows during the week. This sharp reversal brings Ethereum’s YTD inflows of roughly $12 billion to a near standstill, with September contributing only $86.2 million. The data suggests that while both Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant digital assets, near-term investor sentiment has softened as markets recalibrate expectations around monetary easing. Solana and XRP Buck the Trend Amid the broad outflows, Solana stood out as a bright spot, attracting $291 million in inflows. XRP also saw a strong performance with inflows of $93.1 million. CoinShares attributed the positive momentum to growing anticipation of upcoming U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches, which are expected to expand investor access and boost institutional participation in alternative digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana’s inflows highlight the growing confidence in the network’s role as a scalable, efficient blockchain platform, while XRP’s demand reflects renewed institutional appetite ahead of potential regulatory clarity in the U.S. While the short-term picture was dominated by large outflows, the sustained YTD inflows suggest continued institutional engagement in the sector. If momentum persists, 2025 could still rival or surpass the record-breaking inflows of the previous year.

The Semicon Coalition was launched in March by the Netherlands and eight other EU states. Today, the group, representing all 27 member states, handed its declaration to the European Union Commission. Nvidia and ASML back the EU semiconductor coalition for policy overhaul Vincent Karremans, Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, revealed that the initiative highlights the urgency with which Europe’s industrial sector needs to adapt to shifting global conditions. He said that all EU ministers agreed that Europe’s industrial strategy should adapt to increasing geopolitical tensions. All of the European Union member states have agreed on the Chips Act 2.0 led by Dutch minister Vincent Karremans 🇪🇺 This will mean more funding, sped-up approvals, and increase Europe's sovereign capability to produce chips here, at home. In line with Draghi's plan, we see… pic.twitter.com/uTUbQJPoBS — NXT EU (@NXT4EU) September 29, 2025 According to the coalition, the EU’s current semiconductor policy requires a sharper focus beyond the current goal of securing 20% of the global chip market by 2030. The group has called for reforms to enhance critical technology development, fast regulatory approvals, deep talent pools, and strong financing across the semiconductor industry . The European Union’s original Chips Act encouraged chipmaking to be localized in the region but failed to attract advanced manufacturing. The setback was mainly due to Intel’s failed plans to build a large fabrication plant in Germany, casting doubts on the Act’s effectiveness in meeting its goals. SEMI, a semiconductor industry group, confirmed on Monday that it signed the coalition’s declaration alongside more than 50 semiconductor companies in the EU region. Major signatories included firms such as Nvidia , ASML, Intel, STMicroelectronics, and Infineon. SEMI reiterated that the EU should establish a dedicated semiconductor budget. The group had also initially urged Brussels to increase public spending on chips, arguing that the existing level of financial support was insufficient to compete with the U.S. and Asia’s efforts in investing in the industry. The European Court of Auditors published a report in late March, warning that the EU’s objective to gain access to at least 20% of the global chip market share by 2030 was not achievable under the present policies. The auditors projected that the EU’s market share would reach roughly 11.7% by 2030, compared to 9.8% in 2022. Semicon coalition warns EU chip goals at risk without structural reforms The Semicon coalition’s report aims to address the projected shortcomings by building consensus among EU states and industry partners. The proposal aligns with the concerns that Europe’s semiconductor industry goals may not be achieved if structural bottlenecks, including a shortage of skilled workers, lengthy regulatory procedures, and weaker financial frameworks, are not addressed. The European Commission is expected to review the proposal as discussions move towards a potential Chips Act 2.0 framework. ASML Holdings received an overweight rating from an equal-weight rating by Morgan Stanley just two weeks ago, attributed to the demand for the AI boom and signs of recovery in the broader semiconductor industry. The investment bank also raised the price target for the Dutch chip maker to €950, up from €600, showing a potential 20% upside. Cryptopolitan covered the story , highlighting that the ASML stock jumped 3.7%, pushing the firm’s valuation to €322 billion ($379 billion), effectively making ASML Europe’s largest semiconductor firm ahead of SAP SE and LVMH. However, Christophe Fouquet, ASML CEO, warned that trade tensions and global uncertainties may impact growth going into 2026. ASML is the sole producer of advanced lithography machines, which are vital for Apple and Nvidia, and it balances the AI boom with the challenges posed by geopolitical risks. According to KPMG’s 20th annual Global Semiconductor Outlook, geopolitical risks were expected to weigh heavily in the 2025 semiconductor industry. The Global Semiconductor Alliance conducted a survey , showing that 92% of executives were confident about overall growth in 2025, with most projecting revenue increases of 10% or more. The report cited a strong demand for chips to power AI, cloud computing, data centers, and automotive technologies as the main drivers for the projections.

This also follows his earlier endorsements of the decentralized exchange, which has provided increased competition to the likes of Hyperliquid. Binance Founder CZ Explains Role In Aster DEX CZ mentioned in an X space that he serves as an advisor for the Aster DEX, advising them explicitly on product and technology, but not on regulatory issues. He also revealed that some former Binance employees are now working for the DEX. The Binance founder opined that Aster is a very strong project. Meanwhile, CZ also noted how the Aster DEX has stayed close to the BNB Chain ecosystem, which he admitted has helped BNB. Notably, the BNB price rallied to new highs amid the decentralized exchange’s emergence in the spotlight over the past few weeks. CZ mentioned that Aster did exceptionally well in their token generation event (TGE). During the X space, CZ discussed how he is focusing more attention on the BNB chain and projects like the Aster DEX, as he is no longer in charge of Binance following the agreement with U.S. authorities, which required him to step down as CEO as part of the settlement. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that CZ’s family office, YZi Labs , has a minority stake in Aster. Before now, CZ had openly endorsed Aster DEX on several occasions. On one occasion, he shared the Aster token chart and commended the team while urging them to keep building. At the time, the token was trading at just around $0.17. Since then, Aster has recorded a rally of around 2,000%, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $2.4 in the process. On another occasion, CZ stated that the Aster DEX wasn’t a BNB Chain exclusive perp DEX and that it supports multiple chains natively. He added that the DEX also supports hidden orders, which he noted makes it different from other perp DEX designs. Trading privacy on DEXs is something that the Binance founder has advocated for following the James Wynn saga , in which the infamous trader lost around $100 million on Hyperliquid trades that were visible to everyone. Aster Ranks Second In Fees DeFiLlama data shows that the Aster DEX has generated the second-largest fees in the last 24 hours and seven days, trailing only USDT issuer Tether . The DEX has earned $14.33 million in the last 24 hours and $69.56 million in the last seven days. The team has confirmed plans to conduct buybacks, which would likely be done with these fees generated. However, Aster DEX still trails behind in terms of DEX trading volume. Further data from DeFiLlama shows that the DEX is 12th in terms of 24-hour trading volume, although it ranks higher based on the 7-day trading volume , recording $3.3 billion in trading volume over the last week. At the time of writing, the Aster token is trading at around $1.92, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Binance|Aster DEX|binance|BNB|BNB Chain|bnbusd|bnbusdt|Changpeng “CZ” Zhao|Coinmarketcap|defillama|Hyperliquid|Tether|TGE|Token Generation Event|USDT|YZi Labs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|EXCHANGE|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-29 14:00:52

For the XRP price, however, the picture looks very different. A closer look at its history shows a mix of big wins and painful losses, making October far less predictable. Removing the extreme years shows that the data points to flat or negative results, which means investors counting on an explosive rally may end up disappointed. Although the last quarter of the year has brought substantial gains in some cases, the overall record remains inconsistent, suggesting that “Uptober” may be more of a myth than a promise for XRP holders. Historical Data Challenges The “Uptober” Hype For XRP Price Every October, the crypto community hopes that coins will rise, and while Bitcoin sometimes lives up to this expectation, XRP’s history tells a different story. Data from CryptoRank shows that XRP has experienced some notable fluctuations in October over the last decade. In 2013, the token soared by more than 94%. In 2014, it jumped 130%. In 2020, it even delivered an explosive rally of nearly 179% in just one month. Related Reading: Pundit Says Bitcoin Is Still In A Bull Market Despite Price Crash; Here’s Why But these massive rallies are rare. In many other years, the results were disappointing. For example, the XRP price suffered double-digit losses in October of 2018 and 2021. In other years, gains were delivered only in tiny amounts, far below what traders had hoped for. Stripping away the highs and lows makes the overall trend clear. The median October return for XRP is actually a slight loss of 1.79%, and the average return is even worse at -4.58%. This data suggests that October is far more likely to bring disappointment than explosive growth for XRP holders. While the idea of “Uptober” may sound exciting, the history of XRP shows its performance in October is scattered, unpredictable, and often hostile. Q4 Patterns Show Risk Of Relying On Seasonal Myths Some traders argue that even if October is not always a great month, the XRP price usually performs well in the final quarter of the year. Indeed, the last quarter has sometimes delivered big rallies, and the average Q4 return for XRP is nearly 88%. But these results are heavily skewed by a few extraordinary years. When the numbers are balanced, the median return for Q4 is actually a loss of 4.32%. Related Reading: XRP Holders Could Lose Millions Of Dollars In 10 Days, Here’s Why The negative median Q4 return shows that the perception of Q4 strength is not as reliable as many believe. The standout rallies do not represent the typical outcome. Instead, most years end up modest or even negative. The pattern points to risk, not certainty, for those who assume every Q4 will bring green candles. Past data proves that while extraordinary runs are possible, they are rare, and the more common result is far less exciting. XRP could still surprise to the upside, but history warns against treating October as a guaranteed month of gains. Believing the hype without considering the risks may leave investors unprepared for disappointment.

Data from analyst TedPillows shows that companies now collectively hold over 20.9 million SOL, which accounts for nearly 3.64% of the token’s total supply. This growing interest positions Solana as the third preferred asset for institutions, after Bitcoin and Ethereum. The concentration of treasury holdings highlights its rising credibility within the broader crypto market. Breakout Signals and Bold Forecasts As of press time trading around $207, the price of Solana has rebounded strongly after confirming a breakout from long-term resistance levels. According to analyst CryptoCurb, the decisive move above $200 has shifted market dynamics, with fresh support forming between $150 and $200. If momentum continues, the analyst projects a potential rally toward $1,000 by December. This aligns with historical parabolic runs that followed accumulation phases. Furthermore, CryptoCurb suggests that after short-term consolidation near $1,300, Solana could extend its rally toward $2,000 by May, fueled by institutional inflows and broader network growth. Dominance Trends Support the Case Analyst AltcoinGordon highlighted Solana’s dominance chart, which shows an ascending triangle pattern. This structure suggests a bullish continuation, with support established near 2.4% and resistance at 4.8% to 5%. Current dominance stands at 2.94%, consolidating after a rebound from trendline support. Source: X If buyers maintain control above the lower threshold, Solana could attempt a breakout beyond 5% dominance. Such a move would imply SOL outperforming the broader crypto market and potentially support the $1,000 target. Key Catalysts Ahead Besides the technical outlook, fundamental drivers may shape Solana’s performance in the coming months. Several ETF applications face key deadlines in October, with Canary’s final decision due on October 7 and VanEck’s on October 15. Additionally, Franklin’s Solana ETF and Grayscale’s conversion proposal both reach decision points on October 16. Positive approvals could ignite fresh capital inflows, providing further momentum. Another significant catalyst is the upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, scheduled for late this year or early next year. This upgrade is expected to reduce block finality from 12 seconds to under 150 milliseconds. Such speeds would outperform Google and Visa, strengthening Solana’s position as a scalable blockchain solution.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-29 14:02:28

Today, some prominent crypto commentators are reviving that metaphor to warn of a potential Bitcoin collapse. Their argument is not merely about a sudden crash, but about what could follow: an initial market-wide plunge that eventually sees XRP recover and rise to prominence. How the Conversation Began This debate was reignited by a widely shared X post from (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho, who highlighted a scenario where Bitcoin’s dramatic decline drags the broader crypto market down before XRP stages a powerful comeback. The post references striking price levels and draws on views from several analysts, giving the theory added weight. Tulip Bubble & XRP. If the BTC bubble bursts, it will probably look like the picture below. ing… 2020.3.13. $0.114 2025.10.~12. $26.6(1.618level) 2026. Black swan Collapse $0.64 2026. Overnight $1,000 Three or more people are saying the same thing.… https://t.co/MKpPkiT1DM pic.twitter.com/zaCmb7n3Zf — (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho (@Cryptobilbuwoo0) September 28, 2025 Leading Voices Converge Among those sharing similar perspectives is Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao , who likened a Bitcoin meltdown to the sinking of the Titanic: “When the Titanic sinks, little floats near it get dragged down too. But the floats will eventually come back up if they are untethered.” His analogy captures the idea of a short-term market contagion followed by selective recovery. Other market watchers, including MarvinGaye and BABA, have echoed this sentiment, pointing to XRP’s potential resilience in the aftermath of a major downturn. Why the Tulip Analogy Has Limits Although the tulip mania reference is dramatic, experts caution against a direct comparison. Unlike the 17th-century tulip bubble, which centered on luxury flowers, today’s cryptocurrency ecosystem is a global financial network built on advanced blockchain technology and increasingly adopted by institutions. Equating Bitcoin to tulips oversimplifies a far more complex and mature market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Factors in Play The discussion also notes Fibonacci price extensions—especially the 1.618 level—used by traders to identify potential market turning points. While such tools can highlight areas of investor interest, analysts stress that these signals are only one component of technical analysis and cannot predict future prices alone. XRP’s Distinct Role In past market downturns, altcoins have typically followed Bitcoin’s decline due to high correlation within the market. Supporters of XRP’s recovery thesis argue that its established role in cross-border payments, expanding DeFi applications, and integration with stablecoins could allow it to rebound faster than other digital assets once market sentiment stabilizes. Historically, tokens with clear utility and liquidity can recover more quickly after broad declines. In conclusion, the scenario outlined by (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho— a Bitcoin crash followed by an XRP resurgence —has drawn attention from major industry voices, including CZ. This is an interesting idea, but it remains speculative. Investors should view it as a call for careful risk management and thorough analysis rather than a guaranteed outcome. Market metaphors and technical indicators can spark debate, yet sound strategy and an understanding of market fundamentals remain the most reliable guides through any turbulence ahead.

These rules remove major regulatory hurdles and place assets like Shiba Inu in direct contention for ETF approval. The development is thrilling to those who support digital asset investment products, and this competition is expected to intensify. SEC Guidelines Position SHIB for ETF Eligibility The SEC’s guidelines allow exchanges to list crypto ETPs without a lengthy approval process if the underlying asset has a futures contract traded for at least six months on a CFTC-regulated exchange. This shift streamlines the approval structure, signaling a new phase for crypto-based investment products in the United States. Shiba Inu qualifies under these standards. According to a market notice from Coinbase Derivatives, “1k Shib (SHB)” futures began trading on July 15, 2024. Having surpassed 14 months of trading activity, SHIB futures exceed the SEC’s six-month mandate. This places the token in the same category as assets such as Solana and Polkadot, which also meet eligibility requirements for spot ETF consideration. For the Shiba Inu community, which has consistently pushed for wider institutional recognition, the SEC’s decision marks an important milestone. A spot SHIB ETF is now a regulatory possibility, moving closer to reality after years of advocacy. However, industry participants caution that the new framework does not guarantee long-term success for every product that makes it to market. Market Competition Raises Investor Concerns Greg Benhaim, Executive Vice President of Product at 3iQ , addressed the implications of these developments in a note shared with The Shib Daily. Drawing from his company’s experience as an ETF issuer in Canada, Benhaim said the landscape could become more challenging for both issuers and investors. “ At first glance, this seems bullish for the industry ,” Benhaim stated. “ However… it may be challenging for issuers to raise capital when new products are being listed every single day .” He warned that the sheer number of ETFs entering the market could overwhelm retail participants. Benhaim added that investors may struggle to understand the differences between various offerings. “ For example, an AVAX ETF and an ADA ETF are very different, but the investor may not appreciate this fully ,” he explained. He noted that distinguishing between assets in an ETF format requires a level of market knowledge that many retail investors may lack. The SEC’s changes shift responsibility from regulators to the market itself. As Benhaim observed, competition will now determine which assets succeed in attracting significant retail interest. The proliferation of ETFs, he argued, will ultimately “ pave the way for the industry to identify which assets have significant retail appeal in ETF format and which don’t. ”",News|Reports,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-29 14:06:46

(NASDAQ: ORBS) today unveiled its ‘Power of 8’ initiative, targeting 800 million Worldcoin (WLD) and 8 billion verified humans. Since launching its Worldcoin treasury strategy on September 8, World has added over 1.9 million verified humans, bringing the total to 16.9 million, with a goal of reaching 100 million within the next 12 months. “World is the single sign-on for the AI era, making it possible to trust and transact anonymously online for the first time,” said Dan Ives, newly appointed Chairman of Eightco Holdings Inc. (ORBS). “In the AI value chain, LLMs are valued at $3 trillion, hyperscalers $3 trillion, cybersecurity $1-2 trillion and the most important of these, ‘Proof of Human,’ or human cybersecurity is $10 billion. Over time, ‘Proof of Human’ verification should easily match the value of a single LLM, or have a value of $200 to $300 billion, implying the Worldcoin value of $20 to $30 per WLD coin.” Ives continues, “We believe in the ‘ Power of 8 ‘: ORBS reaching 800 million WLD tokens and verifying 8 billion humans. The momentum of the past few weeks is only the beginning.” The issue of trust in the agentic age and the urgent demand for digital verifications systems is more important than ever before, recently voiced by President Trump in his address to the United Nations announcing that he’ll be “meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust.” “We also talked a lot about the need to include a financial network of some sort. It was clear to us that authentication and proof of humanity was an important component,” said Sam Altman, Co-founder of World and OpenAI, on the creation of World. “But it was also clear that one of the most important problems, one of the reasons you needed this was for people to be able to exchange value, for people and AI’s to exchange value, someday for AI’s and AI’s to do it.” Blockchain technology enables the safest solution to secure human verifications in the digital age, echoed by industry leaders, “The internet-native money is crypto. It’s a bearer instrument,” said Ben Horowitz, Co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, “So crypto is kind of like the economic network for Al.” Eightco Holdings Inc. (ORBS) is committed to establishing a universal foundation for digital identity. World’s proprietary verification Orb technology is designed to meet the security and identity challenges of the future, offering a path to a universally trusted digital identity and the foundation for the next generation of online trust, verification and economic exchange. The Orbs are the hardware backbone of Worldcoin, verifying unique humans, distributing tokens fairly, and creating a trusted digital identity system. World will be the leading verification platform for consumers around the world. ABOUT EIGHTCO HOLDINGS INC. Eightco Holdings Inc.

(“DNA”), a digital asset investment and advisory firm, today announced its role as strategic advisor, consultant, and investor in a landmark $344.4 million capital formation strategy that establishes the foundation for a Strategic Compute Reserve, a first-of-its-kind model designed to democratize access to enterprise-grade artificial intelligence infrastructure. The transaction represents one of the first times Wall Street capital has been directly aligned with decentralized AI infrastructure, creating a blueprint for how traditional markets can converge with tokenized economies. Anchored in ATH, the utility token of the Aethir decentralized GPU network, the deal creates a pathway for public companies, institutional investors, and consumers to participate in owning a share of the backbone of AI itself. Structure and Mechanics The capital strategy was structured as two concurrent private placements in public equity (“PIPEs”) with an aggregate value of approximately $344.4 million. The financing included both a cash PIPE and a crypto PIPE involving in-kind contributions of ATH tokens. The pre-funded warrants issued in the crypto PIPE will become exercisable immediately following shareholder approval, and both PIPEs are expected to close concurrently on or about October 2, 2025. While the issuer is a Nasdaq-listed company, the transaction’s significance lies in its design: a hybrid capital markets structure that brings digital asset infrastructure directly onto the balance sheet of a public company. DNA’s Role DNA Holdings acted as the strategic advisor and structuring lead for both the traditional and crypto PIPEs. The firm played a central role in conceptualizing the hybrid structure, facilitating alignment across public market investors, digital asset contributors, and ecosystem partners. “Partnering DNA with Aethir on this Digital Asset Treasury deal has been an incredible honor. I’ve always believed in the transformative power of decentralized AI, and Aethir embodies that vision in a way that is both innovative and inspiring. Working with the Aethir team throughout this process has been a privilege, and together we’re not just moving capital, we’re shaping the future of technology and finance. This marks a significant milestone for both DNA and Aethir, and I couldn’t be more optimistic about the waves we’re making in the space of decentralized AI,” said Christopher Miglino, Co- Founder of DNA. In addition to its advisory function, DNA also participated as a cash investor, further demonstrating conviction in both the issuer and the underlying ATH token strategy. DNA’s model for combining institutional-grade financing mechanisms with token-based infrastructure exposure reflects a broader thesis on how public companies can engage meaningfully in the digital asset economy without compromising regulatory discipline or operational focus. Strategic Significance This deal represents a first-of-its-kind bridge between Wall Street and decentralized AI. By leveraging Nvidia-powered GPUs distributed worldwide through the Aethir network, ATH is creating a global Strategic Compute Reserve. This reserve gives both investors and enterprises the ability to participate in decentralized infrastructure that underpins AI, gaming, and enterprise cloud, all while providing access at 40–80% lower cost than traditional providers. By linking financial capital with operational compute power, the model redefines what it means for public markets to invest in infrastructure. It democratizes access to advanced GPU networks and positions decentralized compute as a new category of corporate treasury asset — one that could become as strategic as energy reserves in the global economy. Key Advisors and Partners DNA Holdings Venture Inc. served as strategic advisor, consultant, and investor. H.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as exclusive placement agent. Legal counsel was provided to the issuer by DLA Piper LLP (US) and to DNA by Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP. About DNA Holdings Venture Inc. DNA Holdings Venture Inc . is a digital asset investment and advisory firm specializing in token ecosystem design, hybrid capital formation, and institutional integration into Web3 infrastructure. The firm partners with leading protocols, public companies, and capital allocators to structure and execute cross-market strategies bridging digital and traditional finance. About Aethir Aethir is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) that provides GPU-as-a-Service at enterprise scale. The Aethir network spans over 435,000 GPU containers across 93 countries, offering compute access for AI workloads, gaming, and cloud infrastructure with significant cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers. ATH is the native utility token used across the Aethir ecosystem for staking, access, and ecosystem incentives.

52435646,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=828576,1759159809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52435646.jpeg,"Bitcoin Could Go To Zero, Hedge Fund CEO Warns",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-could-go-to-zero-hedge-fund-ceo/,"Charles Edwards, founder and CEO of Capriole Investments, has issued his starkest warning yet on quantum computing, arguing that Bitcoin must migrate to post-quantum signatures on an accelerated timeline or face existential risk later this decade. “We need to upgrade Bitcoin to be Quantum proof next year. 2026. Otherwise we are fucked,” Edwards wrote on X early Monday, escalating a series of posts in which he contends “Q-Day is this decade.” Could Bitcoin Crash To $0? Edwards’ thesis hinges on the rapid compression of resource estimates required to run Shor’s algorithm against Bitcoin’s elliptic-curve digital signatures (ECDSA/Schnorr on secp256k1). Pushing back at skeptics who “handwave Quantum as being 20+ years away,” he argued that only “~2,000 logical qubits” may be sufficient to break ECC-256 within a practical time window, placing a credible attack in “2–6 years.” In a separate exchange he framed the stakes bluntly: “Do you want $1M Bitcoin in 5 years, or $0?” Related Reading: Bitcoin To $200K? Galaxy Digital CEO Reveals The ‘Biggest Bull Catalyst’ Edwards’ timeline closely tracks a fresh line of research and industry messaging from Pierre-Luc Dallaire-Démers, founder of Pauli Group, a startup focused on quantum-resistant money. In an August research preprint and public thread, Dallaire-Démers and co-authors introduced graded ECDLP challenges on Bitcoin’s curve and, after translating logical circuits to physical costs across several error-corrected architectures, placed “cryptanalytically relevant” ECC-256 attacks in a “roughly 2027–2033” window—emphasizing wide error bars and sensitivity to hardware assumptions. Pauli Group summarized the upshot plainly: “The first attack on 256-bit ECC will plausibly happen between 2027–2033.” The firm also provocatively stated via X: “PQC BTC will go to $1M+ by 2030. ECC BTC won’t.” The core risk vector is well-established: once a Bitcoin address reveals its public key on-chain—by spending from it or by using legacy formats that expose the key outright—a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could, in principle, derive the private key quickly enough to steal funds. Security researchers and industry teams note that coins in already-exposed keys are the first in line, while coins still sitting behind hashed (unrevealed) public keys are safer until they move. Several analyses estimate that a non-trivial share of outstanding BTC resides in exposed-key outputs, including early “pay-to-pubkey” era coins often associated with Satoshi. Edwards leaned into that tail risk, claiming “Satoshi’s coins will be market dumped” absent a migration. Related Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink: Analyst Warns This Key Level Must Hold Not everyone agrees on the clock speed. Some conservative estimates still point to millions of error-corrected qubits for practical, fast ECDSA breaks, and standards bodies have published transition guidance that implicitly assumes a longer runway. In late 2024, material circulated in the NIST/PQ ecosystem sketched migrations away from vulnerable algorithms by roughly 2035—a horizon many security engineers view as realistic for broad IT systems, even if niche breakthroughs arrive sooner. The spread between the “thousands” versus “millions” of logical qubits camps reflects fast-evolving algorithmic optimizations, differing error-correction models, and varied assumptions about gate speeds and code distances. Notably, Edwards is taking the message to TOKEN2049 this week, where he is slated to present “DOUBLE THREAT: Quantum & the Treasury Bubble” on Wednesday, October 1 at 10:45 a.m. local time—positioning quantum compromise and a growing “Bitcoin Treasury Bubble” as the two dominant downside risks for BTC over the next cycle.

52435892,591769,1759159854,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52435892.jpeg,Analyst Warns XRP Investors That This Is Happening Right Now – Time To Pay Attention?,https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-xrp-investors-attention/,"Crypto analyst Austin Hilton is warning XRP investors about the current market situation in a video he shared on X . He states that the price is under heavy pressure and could still decline further in the short term. At the same time, he notes that the token appears oversold, which suggests a potential rebound may occur later. Hilton explains that Bitcoin’s moves here are significant because XRP usually follows the bigger market. XRP Faces Bearish Pressure As Market Stays Oversold Hilton focuses on the XRP price trading near $2.75, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which, according to him, indicates the token is oversold. Being oversold can often mean a recovery is possible later, but Hilton makes it clear that investors should not expect it immediately. The short-term outlook remains negative, and if Bitcoin declines, XRP is likely to follow suit. Bitcoin is trading near $109,000, and analysts warn it could slide to $103,000 or $105,000, with $100,000 seen as the worst-case level. Hilton warns that if Bitcoin drops toward those lower levels, the altcoin will almost certainly lose more value as well. Bitcoin’s path is the key factor that will decide XRP’s next move. Hilton also considers the broader market, which now stands at about $3.75 trillion, and advises traders to use RSI readings to determine if assets are overbought or oversold. Currently, most readings indicate an oversold market. That means a comeback could happen, but Hilton believes the current weak stage will last longer before momentum changes. Another red flag Hilton mentions is the expiration of massive crypto options contracts. He points out that approximately $22 billion worth of options are closing, including $17.5 billion in Bitcoin and $5 billion in Ethereum. This wave of pressure is affecting XRP just as much as other leading digital assets. Institutions And Whales Accumulate Despite Short-Term Risks Hilton explains that while small investors may feel worried, big investors are using this moment to buy more XRP . Institutions and whales could be taking advantage of low prices to reduce their average buying cost and position themselves for the long run. Hilton shares that he is not an institution, but he follows the same idea. He says he buys XRP every week and is ready to add even more if the price drops below $2.50 or closer to $2. He calls this a dollar-cost averaging strategy, and reminds investors that big players buying during weakness demonstrate a strong belief in the altcoin’s future. Hilton thinks XRP may still dip under $2.50 soon, especially if Bitcoin falls further . Looking ahead, Hilton expects September and the first weeks of October to remain under bearish pressure. However, he predicts that conditions could improv e by mid-October. At that point, XRP may rebound in line with broader market gains. While he is careful to note that no outlook is confident, Hilton says his views align with those of other technical analysts who see weakness now but a better chance for growth later.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-29 15:30:54

The regulator stated that deepfakes and AI-generated endorsements are being used by criminals to deceive unsuspecting investors. These acts are perpetrated using manipulated content to create an illusion of trustworthiness. According to the SEC, scammers are creating legitimate-looking digital versions of politicians, celebrities, and media personalities in order to promote unlicensed platforms. These videos are shared through Facebook ads, Instagram reels, and Telegram groups, making dubious projects seem legitimate. The regulator noted that AI-powered deception has undermined conventional detection methods. Manipulated testimonials often resemble genuine speech and body language, making it difficult for investors to distinguish between truth and forgery. The commission cautioned that offers promising no risk, regardless of how much you invest, with guaranteed returns or celebrity endorsements, are almost always a scam. Scammers are exploiting AI to fabricate endorsements and testimonials that appear genuine. This has made traditional fraud detection methods less effective. Nigeria’s SEC SEC responds through cross-agency partnerships To combat this trend, the SEC is utilizing advanced surveillance systems that can detect fraud in real-time. The regulator said it is shifting from reactive to predictive oversight – supporting the identification of scams before they spread. Collaboration between the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) has led to the implementation of more stringent monitoring systems. These agencies are collaborating to mitigate systemic risks while engaging with social media companies to take down misinformation. The SEC also issued a warning to influencers promoting unlicensed investment products, advising them that they may be subject to sanctions or prosecution. The commission advised Nigerians to verify investment platforms on its official website, which contains the list of licensed capital market operators. Investors have been advised to verify that company registration numbers match those listed on the SEC portal and to be cautious of platforms that only use WhatsApp or Telegram and have no verifiable office address. Rising AI-driven threats to global markets The alarm comes as financial markets across the globe are facing unprecedented levels of fraud tied to AI. In the first half of 2025, AI crypto-related hacks and scams accounted for over $3.01 billion in stolen assets. According to reports, attackers are analyzing social media, forums, and blockchain activity with the help of AI, finding potential victims based on their behavioral patterns. In 2024 alone, the U.S. registered close to 160,000 fraud-related complaints related to cryptocurrencies. In South Africa, AI scams have increased 1,200% over the last year, and the banking and fintech industries have been the worst affected, according to TransUnion Africa. Recently, New York officials seized over $300,000 in stolen cryptocurrency and closed over 100 fraudulent websites linked to a Vietnam-based organization that was targeting Russian speakers in Brooklyn with fake Facebook investment offers.

Kazakhstan Shuts Down RAKS Cryptocurrency Exchange in Major Anti-Drug Operation Kazakhstan’s Financial Monitoring Agency (AFM) has announced the closure of the RAKS cryptocurrency exchange, a platform heavily involved in laundering money from drug trafficking and online fraud. The service operated for over three years and was a central part of the region’s shadow economy. RAKS Exchange’s Dark Network Uncovered The investigation revealed that RAKS collaborated with 20 of the largest darknet marketplaces, reaching over 5 million users. The platform laundered funds from more than 200 drug operations across Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova. Authorities estimate the total volume of transactions handled by the platform exceeded $224 million. AFM specialists analyzed over 4,000 crypto wallets, identifying those linked to criminal proceeds. As a result, 67 addresses connected to RAKS were blocked, freezing assets totaling 9.7 million USDT. The agency also noted clear signs that the service was shutting down. Social media accounts were deleted, customer support was suspended, and numerous complaints regarding unfulfilled financial obligations appeared on darknet forums. Impact on the Shadow Economy Officials stated that these measures dealt a severe blow to drug trafficking infrastructure, disrupting supply chains and reducing trust in illegal platforms. The shutdown of RAKS is expected to significantly impact darknet market operations in the region. Authorities continue efforts to identify the organizers behind RAKS. The AFM emphasized that combating money laundering through digital currencies remains a top priority.

FalconX has launched an electronic options trading platform that supports 24/7 trading, according to The Block. The platform aims to address the inefficiencies of traditional over-the-counter (OTC) options, which require manual intervention, by introducing automation. It was stated that the platform currently supports options trading for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) to start. “The options market is the next big frontier for institutional cryptocurrencies,” said Josh Lim, Co-Head of Global Markets at FalconX. “We built this platform to address long-standing challenges such as fragmented liquidity and a lack of 24/7 access. With FalconX Electronic Options, our clients now have the same trading quality our OTC desk is known for, but in a format designed for scale, distribution, and true 24/7 access.” FalconX’s move comes amid growing adoption in the crypto options space overall, with CME Group recently announcing plans to launch options for SOL and XRP futures products in addition to BTC and ETH, while Coinbase acquired crypto derivatives exchange Deribit in August. *This is not investment advice.

The fund was established by the country’s Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development. Kazakhstan fulfilled its plans of launching a crypto treasury with the new Alem Crypto Fund. The new investment entity is already operational and was established by the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development of Kazakhstan. The fund will be managed by Qazaqstan Venture Group, and will be registered as part of the Astana International Finance Centre (AIFC). Kazakhstan to build strategic crypto reserves The primary goal of the Alem Crypto Fund will be to serve as a vehicle for state-level savings, building long-term investments in digital assets. ‘ The creation of the Alem Crypto Fund is a step toward advancing digital finance in Kazakhstan. Our goal is to make it a reliable instrument for major investors and a key foundation for digital state reserves, ’ said Zhaslan Madiyev, Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan. As Cryptopolitan reported , the President of Kazakhstan, Jamart Tokayev, ordered the creation of a national crypto fund to modernize the country’s access to financial tools. The fund will be run in partnership with Binance Kazakhstan, a locally licensed entity and part of the global Binance ecosystem. The fund will focus first on acquiring BNB tokens, becoming one of the multiple entities to stack the native asset of Binance Chain. ‘ We are proud that Binance Kazakhstan has become the strategic partner of the Alem Crypto Fund. The fund’s choice of BNB as its first digital asset highlights the trust in the Binance ecosystem and marks a new chapter for institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan ,’ said Nurkhat Kushimov, General Manager of Binance Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan’s decision marks a foray into crypto that diverges from the country’s typical stance. Kazakhstan recently cracked down on illegal exchanges and regulated all remaining market operators and funds. BNB treasuries are still developing BNB treasuries are still a rarity, despite the involvement of Binance and the encouragement of Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, the exchange’s co-founder. Only private companies own BNB, so far accumulating 500K tokens. BNB accumulation lags behind the drive to acquire ETH or SOL, and some of the accumulation is regional. Owning BNB can translate into staking rewards. Unlike BTC, BNB gives additional perks, including token airdrops. Currently, there is no standard for handling additional privileges for holding cryptocurrency, especially at the state or corporate level. BNB recently rallied to a higher tier, consolidating above $1,000. However, the token lacks regular purchase announcements and a long list of corporate buyers, which have boosted BTC and ETH.

By doing so, the Web3 infrastructure company plans to boost the network’s performance. It’ll also encourage validators with lower-end hardware to upgrade their systems for greater speed and rewards. If all goes as planned, it could be highly beneficial for Solana-based projects. Take Snorter Token ($SNORT) , for instance. It’d make its upcoming Telegram trading bot much faster and efficient, and thus possibly the next 1000x crypto . SIMD-0370 Upgrade to Lift Solana’s 60M Compute Limit The initiative – SIMD-0370 – would remove Solana’s 60M compute unit block. As a result, block sizes can scale based on the number of transactions that validators can process. According to Anza (a Solana-focused research company), it’ll come on the heels of Alpenglow , a major consensus upgrade launching on mainnet this December. Once officially live, it promises to slash transaction finality from around 12.8 seconds to just 150 milliseconds. Then, SIMD-0370 will help the network to produce faster, more efficient blocks as higher-performance validators take on heavier loads to earn higher revenue. In fact, overall throughput will continue to improve as lower-powered validators skip complex blocks until they upgrade. Think of it like a continuous cycle of optimization and growth. Together, these upgrades could mark one of the most significant performance leaps in Solana’s history. It’ll pave the way for faster, smoother experiences for projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Snorter Bot to Leverage Solana’s Low Fees & Speedy Execution $SNORT could benefit from these upgrades with its flagship product – Snorter Bot – gearing up to launch on the Solana network. Once debuted on Telegram this quarter, it aims to enhance traders’ standing in the highly competitive and ultra-fast cryptocurrency market. By debuting on Solana, Snorter Bot promises to offer fees at just 0.85% (which it claims to be the network’s lowest), while delivering what it says is the highest execution speeds available. And with SIMD-0370 poised to boost Solana’s performance even more, that edge would become all the more apparent – even though the bot is already poised to outpace competitors like Maestro and Trojan. Snorter Bot’s ambitions don’t end there. It also aims to expand to Ethereum, BNB Chain, and other EVM-compatible networks, offering far more trading opportunities than the best Solana meme coins . Regardless of which network is your go-to, the bot will enable you to access various powerful features, including automated sniping and copy trading. This way, you can easily catch the next crypto to explode to help boost your gains. You also need not worry about falling victim to scams. Snorter Bot will be MEV-protected and include rug pull and honeypot detection alerts, ensuring you stay safe while trading. $SNORT Hits $4.1M, Could 5x Post-Presale $SNORT is behind it all, with 25% of its total token supply supporting ongoing developments and unlocking exclusive perks for holders. Think leaderboard rewards, DAO voting rights, and staking yields up to 114% APY. A hefty 20% of $SNORT also goes toward marketing, so you can anticipate growing awareness and intense community hype – both of which can bolster the token’s demand and thus its price. Given this, it’s no surprise $SNORT has raised $4.1M+ on presale, backed by whales investing sizable amounts, including $107.1K , $91.1K , and $59K (to highlight just a few major buys!). These are commendable amounts, especially when considering that you can currently buy $SNORT on presale for just $0.1063. After the bot officially goes live and expands multi-chain, our Snorter Token price prediction anticipates $SNORT to hit $0.70 this year. Therefore, now is a great time to invest for returns that might exceed 558%. Join the Snorter Token presale today. This isn’t investment advice. Make sure you always do your own research before making crypto investments, plus never spend more than you’re willing to lose.

Whales have sold more than 40 million DOGE in a single 24‑hour span , sparking sharp downward pressure. 40 million Dogecoin $DOGE sold by whales in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/VpKLI2hm87 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2025 Interestingly, data from Martinez’s chart reveals that whales have quietly been accumulating DOGE since August 12 – growing their collective holdings from 10.7 billion to over 11 billion tokens. While that’s just 0.2% of the total circulating supply, the timing and scale of this accumulation suggest a major sentiment shift behind the scenes – one that could signal where Dogecoin is headed next. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Bounces Off 200D EMA With Strong Volume In the past 24 hours, DOGE has climbed 2% as trading volumes spiked by 60%, retesting the $0.22 level. This zone aligns with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), often seen as a critical support during bull markets. If DOGE bounces here, a move toward $0.28 seems likely – and a breakout above that could trigger a full rally to $1 before year-end. Despite recent whale profit-taking, the broader trend remains intact. Altcoin season is officially underway, and this pullback may simply be a shakeout before the next leg higher. Still, the biggest upside this cycle could come from early-stage presales . Maxi Doge ($MAXI), for example, has already raised $2.6 million – and with momentum building fast, it could be the next breakout meme coin to watch . Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Turns to Leverage to Make the Most of This Market Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin that takes the legendary Doge meme and infuses it with a dose of pure bull market adrenaline. The presale exploded past $130K in its first 48 hours, and buyers seem to be frantically buying the token to join Maxi’s community – a place built for alpha hunters. Meanwhile, through the Maxi Fund, up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds will be invested into the most promising tokens of the cycle with 1000X leverage to amplify the size of these positions to whale levels. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, head to the official Maxi Doge website and link any Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH to get the token or use a bank card to invest.

Considering the current BTC market sentiment and rising buying demand among investors, the CFX price will reach $0.47 in 2025. In 2031, CFX might record a maximum price of $4.15. Conflux Network (CFX) is a high-speed layer 1 blockchain that combines proof-of-work consensus with proof-of-stake finality. Originating from China, it follows local regulations, earning it the nickname “Chinese Ethereum.” The network’s native CFX token serves various purposes, such as a store of value and governance token. You can also stake these tokens to earn passive income in more CFX tokens.

One such option is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol that has been gaining traction with early investors. Now at $0.035, MUTM has already generated more than $16.52 million in its presale and has had more than 16,640 holders, granting more market exposure. More than your run-of-the-mill altcoin, MUTM incorporates peer-to-peer and pooled lending models, staking rewards, and practical decentralized financial tools, offering utility in addition to growth. Analysts say its new platform and building community could set Mutuum Finance up to be a dominant force in Q4, providing investors with a high-upside alternative to Solana. Solana Poised for Breakout as Bulls Target $230 Solana (SOL) is rapidly approaching a critical technical decision point, currently testing an uptrend line and major support at $193.38. A sustained hold above here can pave the way for a strong bullish thrust, with immediate resistance at $214.15 and a potential breakout target above $230.44. The Stochastic RSI is also showing building momentum, suggesting that buyers can soon be in control and drive another leg up. While Solana’s price action remains one of the most closely tracked narratives in the market, many investors are also accumulating Mutuum Finance that could complement SOL’s potential run. Mutuum Finance Experiences Strong Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to gather strong momentum in Phase 6 of its presale, adding over 16,640 investors and tallying over $16.52 million. Increasing entry is an indication of increasing faith in the long-term potential and vision of the project for the decentralized finance future. As a continuing expression of its transparency and security values, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Through the program, security researchers and developers can search for platform vulnerabilities in four severity levels, namely critical, major, minor, and low. The program is just one of the numerous initiatives Mutuum is pursuing to be even more secure in its infrastructure and to win the trust of its increasing community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Optimal Efficiency At the core of the Mutuum Finance protocol lies an algorithmic real-time floating interest rate mechanism that varies according to liquidity levels. When there is high liquidity, the cost of borrowing reduces, which incentivizes lending and incoming capital. When there is low liquidity, the borrowing cost rises to incentivize new deposits and loan repayment. The self-balancing mechanism encourages a natural equilibrium, which reduces over-leveraging risks and overall ecosystem health. Efficiency is also gained with collateral optimization, particularly if co-related assets are collateralized. Collateralized positions held in a safe manner possess higher borrowing power with more favorable Loan-to-Value (LTV) terms, and reserve factors act like buffers during periods of market volatility. Unstable assets are faced with higher reserve requirements to maintain low uncertainty, but stable low-volatility assets can experience higher borrowing with less liquidation risk. LTV ratios and liquidation points are constantly adjusted to fit each token it lists’ individual volatility profiles, spreading risk evenly throughout the platform. With its presale success, cutting-edge risk management technology, and strong dedication to transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a robust and sustainable network for long-term adoption, growth, and success in the DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Finance as a High-Upside Bet in 2025 Solana’s possible breakout to $230 tells us about the strength of top altcoins, but also about the growing appeal of newer DeFi projects with even greater upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of those rare opportunities, combining real utility, active interest mechanics, and strong security fundamentals to transform decentralized finance. With more than $16.52 million raised in its presale and over 16,640 investors already signed up, market confidence is growing as the project edges toward the next stage. It is the ideal time to board the Mutuum Finance presale for as little as $0.035 and position yourself for potentially exponential growth as Q4 unfolds.

Altcoins often deliver those inflection points—periods when liquidity thins, sentiment turns, and price action becomes explosive. XRP now appears to be approaching such a crossroads, with conditions aligning for a potentially dramatic breakout that could catch unprepared traders off guard. Gordon’s Bold Forecast Prominent trader Gordon reignited the bullish narrative this week with a striking prediction. In a widely shared post, he asserted that the “next leg up for $XRP will be fast and aggressive,” cautioning that traders must either be positioned before the move or wait for a confirmed entry after it starts. His statement encapsulates the urgency many technical analysts see in XRP’s current setup. Expanding Institutional Access A key driver behind this optimism is the recent expansion of institutional channels for XRP. In mid-September, REX-Osprey launched the first U.S. spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), ticker XRPR , giving traditional investors a regulated vehicle to gain exposure without direct custody of the token. Options trading on the ETF has already begun, a sign that sophisticated market participants are preparing for tactical plays. Regulatory adjustments by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have also shortened approval timelines for crypto-based funds, making it easier for institutional capital to enter XRP markets quickly. Mark my words, the next leg up for $XRP will be fast and aggressive. You're either positioned BEFORE it happens, or begin for an entry once it does. Connect the dots or stay broke. pic.twitter.com/QCCFxyJe4P — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) September 29, 2025 Technical Setup and Price Gaps On the charts, XRP is consolidating around the mid-$2.80 range. Analysts highlight a low-liquidity corridor between $2.51 and $2.73 —a “price gap” that, once breached, could allow a rapid surge toward and beyond the psychological $3.00 level. Patterns resembling a falling wedge support the possibility of a breakout, with limited resistance immediately above. Such structures are precisely the conditions that often fuel the type of swift rally Gordon describes. Evidence of Renewed Market Interest Early trading activity in the new ETF underscores tangible institutional appetite . Volume has exceeded initial expectations, suggesting that professional investors and larger funds are positioning ahead of potential volatility. Coupled with an uptick in on-chain activity and whale transactions, these signals indicate that big players are no longer sitting on the sidelines. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Managing the Risks While the setup is compelling, traders should approach it with discipline. Breakouts through thin liquidity zones can produce extreme volatility and sharp pullbacks. Anyone seeking to ride a fast move should define entry levels, set protective stops, and be ready for sudden reversals. Long-term investors, meanwhile, must remember that broader macroeconomic forces, regulatory developments, and crypto-market leverage still present risks regardless of bullish sentiment. Outlook Gordon’s call is more than headline-grabbing bravado; it reflects real structural changes in XRP’s market landscape. With the launch of a spot ETF, active options trading, and a technical chart primed for a surge, the ingredients for a “fast and aggressive” rally are indeed present. Whether the breakout occurs in days or after another period of consolidation, the message is clear: the window for cautious preparation may be closing, and those who fail to plan may be forced to chase momentum after the fact.

QNB enables 24/7 corporate transactions, far faster than traditional transfers. Blockchain adoption by banks accelerates global financial efficiency. QNB Group Adopts JPMorgan’s Kinexys Blockchain to Process $3 Billion Daily QNB Group, one of the largest banks in the Middle East, has begun using JPMorgan's Kinexys blockchain platform to process corporate payments in US dollars. The move promises faster, 24/7 transactions, giving corporate treasurers a major upgrade from traditional interbank transfers that can take several days. Kinexys Enables Lightning-Fast Transactions The new blockchain system allows Qatari customers to complete payments within minutes, anytime, the bank reports. According to Kamel Moris, Executive Vice President of Transaction Banking at QNB, the platform meets the high expectations of corporate clients seeking speed and security. ”We now have a 24/7 service window, and we can guarantee payments in just two minutes. It's every treasurer's dream,” Moris said. Launched in 2019, Kinexys already handles $3 billion in daily transactions. While impressive, this is still a fraction of JPMorgan’s payments division, which processes around $10 trillion daily. Blockchain Adoption Accelerates Globally QNB’s adoption reflects a broader trend: financial institutions worldwide are increasingly turning to blockchain and distributed ledger technology to streamline back-office processes. JPMorgan plans to expand Kinexys through its extensive correspondent network, connecting institutions and companies that are not direct clients. ”We are opening the network to more participants and expanding to institutional clients,” said Kinexys co-CEO Navin Mallela. This expansion is expected to allow Kinexys to compete directly with traditional global interbank payment channels. Despite more than a decade of experimentation, only a few blockchain platforms have achieved practical scale.

In a press release, Swift said that , unlike its traditional role as a communications network, this move into a shared ledger will allow it to record, sequence, and validate financial transactions directly, creating a backbone for tokenized value exchange between institutions. Global Banks Join Early Design Phase Work is currently underway with more than 30 financial institutions worldwide, representing 16 countries. The consortium includes global banks, including names such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, Citi, and Wells Fargo, alongside major regional banks like ANZ, Banco Santander, and Emirates NBD. Swift said it has engaged Consensys to build the conceptual prototype, which will focus on a first use case: real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments. Feedback from participating banks will shape the system’s architecture and governance. The announcement was made at the Sibos conference in Frankfurt. Interoperable Digital Infrastructure The ledger is seen as a secure, real-time log of transactions, capable of enforcing rules through smart contracts, Swift explains. A key design priority is interoperability—not only across private and public distributed ledger networks, but also with existing fiat rails. Swift explains that it plans to avoid fragmentation and support the coexistence of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized assets, and commercial bank money. Paving the Way for Digital Transformation “We provide powerful and effective rails today and are moving at a rapid pace with our community to create the infrastructure stack of the future,” said Swift CEO Javier Pérez-Tasso. “Through this initial ledger concept, we are paving the way for financial institutions to take the payments experience to the next level with Swift’s proven and trusted platform at the centre of the industry’s digital transformation,” added Pérez-Tasso. Swift Completes Pilot for Settling Tokenized Funds Last year, UBS Asset Management, Swift, and Chainlink completed a pilot project allowing the settlement of tokenized fund subscriptions and redemptions using the Swift network. UBS Asset Management, Swift and @Chainlink have completed a pilot project allowing the settlement of tokenized fund subscriptions. #Chainlink #LINK https://t.co/A1Mu1bJO9c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 5, 2024 In an announcement, the firms said the settlement involves using Chainlink’s blockchain technology and allows digital asset transactions to be combined with traditional fiat payment systems. The pilot was launched under the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Project Guardian, which is looking to explore the use of digital assets in financial markets.
