The reason for this bullish outlook is a presale that is selling millions of tokens daily, a pace that is rapidly pushing the once-distant dream of a $1 valuation well within reach. This explosive momentum has propelled Ruvi AI past the $4 million fundraising milestone. A burgeoning community of over 3,900 holders has already acquired more than 285 million RUVI tokens , a testament to the project’s incredible demand. This record-breaking sales velocity is a clear signal that the market views Ruvi AI as a project with the potential for an earth-shattering rally, far exceeding the initial performance of many now-established coins. Smashing Forecasts with Unprecedented Demand The comparison to Avalanche’s early days is significant. While AVAX created a wave of crypto millionaires, Ruvi AI’s current trajectory suggests it could deliver even more explosive returns. The key difference is the sheer speed of token sales. By selling millions of tokens each day, Ruvi AI is demonstrating a level of market hunger that analysts say is rare and often precedes a massive price surge. This isn’t just speculative hype. Ruvi AI’s value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its credibility is further solidified by a successful CyberScope audit, which assures investors of its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , signaling to the broader market that it is a serious contender. This powerful combination of utility and trust is why experts believe its $1 price target is becoming a realistic short-term goal. The Super App Fueling the $1 Valuation Goal The engine driving Ruvi AI’s historic demand is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is designed to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token and support its journey to $1. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining the creative process. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative workflow for maximum efficiency. Last Call: Guaranteed 40% Price Jump Is Locked In The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at a ground-floor entry of just $0.020 . However, this opportunity is disappearing at an astonishing rate. In a powerful demonstration of its in-demand status, 20% of the Phase 3 token allocation was sold in just a few days . According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns as RUVI heads towards its $1 goal: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s vibrant community. The Verdict With a presale demand that outpaces even the early days of market titans, Ruvi AI has proven it has the momentum and fundamentals for a historic run. For investors looking to get in on the ground floor of a project with a realistic path to a $1 valuation, the time to act is now.

As such, traders should expect the coin to continue trading in the $2.70-3.10 mark for the next few days. Key levels to watch are $2.65 and $3.15 with each level suggesting a breakout from the trend. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market capitalization, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR’s innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant medium term growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions.

Now the price has returned to the $2.70 mark but struggles in climbing higher. Will NEAR recover? NEAR protocol price has seen a massive selloff in the last thirty days as price fell from near the $3.00 mark to the current $2 price level.

NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next several years. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable price prediction. However, the project must keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem.

The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13.

By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60.

Naver Financial is set to acquire Dunamu, the entity operating Upbit, one of South Korea’s most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. The acquisition will be completed via a share-swap deal and will make Dunamu a wholly-owned subsidiary of Naver Financial.

Security CoinStats has integrated the Glider Token Risk, a breakthrough scanning technology from cybersecurity firm Hexens. The new integration brings advanced token analysis tools to traders worldwide. It also gives them instant access to over 22 smart contract risks before they buy. Regulation The United States Senate has scheduled a high-profile hearing on October 1 to examine the taxation of crypto assets. The hearing will involve several industry experts, including representatives from Coinbase and Coin Center. Canada’s FINTRAC has imposed a C$19.6 million ($14.09 million) penalty on Peken Global Limited, the entity operating KuCoin. FINTRAC states the platform failed to comply with Canadian anti-money laundering policies. However, KuCoin has appealed the decision in court. Senator Elizabeth Warren , along with several Democrats and ethics lawyers, has called for an investigation into potential ethics violations related to deals with the United Arab Emirates. The Trump administration has recently relaxed restrictions on the sale of sensitive national security technology to the United Arab Emirates. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) plans to allow tokenized assets, including stablecoins, to be used as collateral in derivatives markets.

Investor sentiment has been battered, causing the market’s Fear & Greed Index to drop by 16 points in a single day. The index fell to 28 on Friday, its lowest level since March, before recovering to 33. Bitcoin started the week above $115,000, but price crashes on Monday and Thursday pushed the price below the key $109,000 level. This triggered liquidations of over $1 billion in long positions. The crash in the Fear & Greed Index highlights how quickly market sentiment can change when important levels fail to hold. However, fearful conditions are also an opportunity for long-term traders to add to their holdings at a discount. Analysts believe Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could be closer to their next recovery phase than many expect, with some traders already bracing for a turnaround. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down during the ongoing session, maintaining its position above $109,000. The flagship cryptocurrency faced extended bearish pressure this week, crashing nearly 4% on Thursday to fall below $110,000 and settle at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61%, but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline. BTC is trading around $109,500 during the ongoing session. Meanwhile, traders are divided about BTC’s next move, with some predicting a crash to $60,000, while others believe it will rally to $140,000. Multiple analyses state that the price could repeat the same trajectory that foreshadowed the 2021 market top. One analyst highlighted that in 2021, BTC registered a sharp rally to record highs, followed by a blow-off top, a sharp correction, and lastly, a failed test of resistance levels. The sequence triggered a crash that sent the price from $69,000 to $32,000 in weeks. The analyst points out that BTC’s current structure is mirroring the same process and risks a similar trajectory. However, not everyone expects market-ending declines. One trader highlighted a cluster by the 200-day simple and exponential moving averages, which could serve as a support during bull market dips. Analyst Bitbull believes BTC is still far from a cycle top, highlighting that the US Business Cycle, a broad indicator of economic momentum, has yet to peak. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $114,724. It recovered from this level to settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30%. BTC reached an intraday high of $117,998 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,117. The price lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.22% to $115,690. Source: TradingView BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping 0.41% on Sunday to end the weekend at $115,282. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $111,761 on Monday as bearish sentiment intensified. It recovered from this level to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday as BTC reached an intraday high of $113,357. However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $112,017, ultimately dropping 0.64%. The price fell to an intraday low of $111,066 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. Despite the bearish sentiment, it recovered to register a 1.19% increase and settle at $113,348. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $110,369 before settling at $109,697. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline.

In the following lines, we break down the chilling details of the crime and examine whether this story had anything resembling a happy ending. The Bone-Chilling Thriller Grant – a small town in the state of Minnesota – recently became the scene of a brutal crypto-related crime. On September 19, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch Center received a 911 call from a man reporting that he and his family had been held at gunpoint during a violent home invasion by two armed suspects. The individuals in question were the brothers Raymond Christian Garcia and Isiah Angelo Garcia. Earlier that day, the father of the man who called 911 was taking out a garbage can to the street when the alleged criminals suddenly attacked him with an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun. The brothers took the victim into the garage, where they bound his hands and brought him into the house. They later woke up his wife and adult son at gunpoint and also zipped their hands, forcing them to lie on the floor. Raymond Garcia supposedly held the wife and son in their residence for nine hours, while his brother forced the father (Victim 1) to log into his cryptocurrency accounts. He demanded that the victim transfer huge amounts of digital assets into a designated wallet provided by the attackers. “During the robbery, Victim 1 saw both Garcia brothers frequently making phone calls to an unknown third party, who appeared to be providing the information related to the cryptocurrency accounts and transfers,” the official announcement reads. Through this third party, the brother became aware that the father had additional crypto funds and demanded access to them. The victim explained that the assets were stored on a hard drive at a family cabin, approximately three hours away. Isiah Garcia forced the man into his truck and drove to the location where the remaining funds were transferred. In total, the victim sent $8 million worth of digital assets to the attackers’ wallets. The son of Victim 1, who was held at gunpoint while Isiah Garcia was gone, used a brief opportunity to call 911. The police officers were quick to react, and when they arrived, they found Raymond Garcia running out through the back door. For his part, Isiah Garcia (who was returning to the house with the truck) saw the chaos, ditched the vehicle and his weapon, and walked towards a nearby middle school parking lot. To protect the safety of the pupils, Mahtomedi Public Schools was forced to cancel its homecoming football game. In the next few days, the law enforcement officers checked video surveillance cameras and tracked the brothers’ previous locations, and managed to arrest them on September 22 in Texas. What Now? The incident was described by Acting US Attorney Joseph H. Thompson as “a blow to the sense of safety in everyone in Minnesota.” “This is not normal. Minnesotans should not accept wild violence and thievery as normal. Every Minnesotan deserves to live in peace and a life unaffected by rampant crime,” he added. On September 23, the Garcia brothers were charged by complaint in Washington County, Minnesota, with three counts of kidnapping with a firearm, one count of first-degree aggravated robbery, and three counts of first-degree burglary. The following day, they were both charged in a federal complaint with kidnapping. The attackers were scheduled to make their initial appearances in federal court on September 25, at which time the government will request their detention pending trial. “As alleged in the complaint, the Garcia brothers terrorized a Minnesota family in their own home, kidnapping one family member while holding the rest of the family hostage in order to conduct a brazen cryptocurrency theft. This office, together with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners in Minnesota and in Texas, will work tirelessly to hold accountable those responsible for this horrific crime,” FBI Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston, Sr assured.

52401881,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=822253,1759094639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52401881.jpeg,Poland’s crypto law met with criticism and backlash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/poland-adopts-controversial-crypto-law/,"Lawmakers in Poland have approved a bill designed to regulate the country’s cryptocurrency market in accordance with the latest EU rules. Critics say, however, that the legislation goes beyond European requirements, stirring controversy, not just in the crypto community, but in Polish politics as well. Crypto act passed amid concerns over excessive regulation The Sejm, the lower house of Polish parliament, has adopted a new law implementing the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations in the EU member state. The legislation, which has been in the making for quite some time, aims to impose order in Poland’s crypto space, arguably the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. It has been criticized, however, for attempting to overregulate the nation’s crypto industry, stifling innovation and threatening to kill the business of domestic firms that work with digital assets. On Friday, 230 members of the chamber voted in favor of the bill, another 196 rejected it, with no abstentions. The Crypto Assets Act will now go to the Senate, the upper house of parliament in Poland. The government-sponsored law should ensure protection for customers and other market participants from what has been described as “dishonest entities,” the Polish PAP news agency reported. It introduces criminal liability for certain violations such as provision of crypto services and issuance of digital tokens without authorization, and defines the obligations of approved platforms. Its provisions stipulate that Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) will be tasked to supervise the sector and equipped with the appropriate tools to conduct oversight. The KNF will be responsible for registering violations of the new rules and fraudulent activities involving operations with cryptocurrencies. Perpetrators of the most serious offences will face harsh penalties, including fines of up to 10 million Polish złoty ($120,000) and even imprisonment for up to two years. The bill regulates online cryptocurrency exchanges, which will again be supervised by the KNF. They will be required to maintain individual client accounts, which should protect user funds, PAP detailed. According to official data, released earlier this year, 18% of Poles have already invested in crypto assets, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. In July, Deputy Finance Minister of Poland Jurand Drop insisted the proposed regulations are crucial for strengthening investor protection. He also noted the lack of mechanisms to fight fraud, pointing out: “20% of investors in this market declare they have been victims of some kind of fraud or abuse.” Poland’s crypto law met with criticism and backlash The long-awaited legislation was not accepted well by members of the country’s crypto community and the parliamentary opposition, who criticized it throughout its review in the Sejm. While transposing MiCA into national law “sounds innocent,” the crypto act is a “real horror” for crypto entrepreneurs, the crypto news outlet Bitcoin.pl wrote in an article on Saturday. Highlighting some of the powers granted to Poland’s financial regulator, which stirred the industry on the weekend, the Polish portal commented: “The crypto assets law gives the KNF permissions that resemble a repression apparatus rather than market supervision.” They come with “fees, which can simply finish smaller companies” and the “clear guidelines” are just restrictions and costly requirements that will suffocate innovation, the website elaborated, adding: “This law can deal a fatal blow to domestic companies operating in the crypto sector.” The exodus of Polish cryptocurrency firms may have already started, with XTB, one of the largest brokers in Poland, signaling it may seek a license in Cyprus. Jakub Bartoszek, president of the crypto exchange service Cashify, emphasized that the Polish implementation of MiCA is one of the most extensive, imposing high entry costs and multiplies barriers. The crypto entrepreneur expressed hope that Polish President Karol Nawrocki “will listen to the voice of the market and veto the law in its current form,” something the head of state has indicated he may do. During debates in the Sejm, Bitcoin proponent and former presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen also urged Nawrocki, who took office in August, to stop the bill.

Co przyniesie ostatni kwartał 2025 roku?",https://bitcoinist.com/nowa-fala-adopcji-krypto-4-kwartal-2025/,"Rynek kryptowalut wchodzi w ostatni kwartał 2025 roku z dużą dynamiką. Decyzje amerykańskich regulatorów, rosnące zainteresowanie funduszy ETF oraz nowe projekty technologiczne sprawiają, że inwestorzy zastanawiają się, jak ulokować swoje środki. Nie chodzi już tylko o Bitcoina czy Ethereum. Dziś na radarze pojawiają się zarówno dojrzałe aktywa, jak XRP, jak i świeże inicjatywy w rodzaju Snorter Token. Nadchodzi nowa fala adopcji kryptowalut. XRP kandydatem do trzeciego miejsca na podium ETF-ów Ostatnie tygodnie przyniosły istotne informacje dla rynku. SEC analizuje sześć wniosków o uruchomienie spot ETF-ów powiązanych z XRP. Wśród aplikujących są takie podmioty jak Grayscale, 21Shares czy WisdomTree. Decyzje mają zapaść między 18 a 25 października . XRP SPOT ETF TRACKER OCTOBER WILL BE HISTORIC: Grayscale — OCT 18 21Shares — OCT 19 Bitwise — OCT 20 Canary Capital — OCT 23 WisdomTree — OCT 24 Franklin Templeton — OCT 25 CoinShares — OCT 25 $XRP Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/PrNW0GevU4 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 26, 2025 Analitycy wskazują, że ewentualna zgoda oznaczałaby otwarcie drzwi dla ogromnego kapitału instytucjonalnego. Cytując jednego z ekspertów: Zatwierdzenie ETF-ów na XRP może uruchomić rotację płynności z Bitcoina i skierować uwagę funduszy na trzecią co do wielkości kryptowalutę pod względem adopcji regulacyjnej . Warto zauważyć, że Bitcoin już korzysta z efektu ETF-ów, a Ethereum powoli podąża jego śladem. Jeśli XRP dołączy do tego grona, układ sił na rynku może się zmienić. Derywatywy budują fundamenty pod dalszy wzrost Nie tylko ETF-y napędzają oczekiwania wobec XRP. Coraz większą rolę odgrywa rynek instrumentów pochodnych. Dane CME pokazują, że otwarte pozycje na kontraktach futures na XRP przekroczyły 1 miliard dolarów, co jest najszybszym wzrostem wśród wszystkich kryptowalut w tym kwartale. CME ogłosiło także, że od 13 października uruchomi opcje na XRP oraz kontrakty Micro XRP. Dzięki temu inwestorzy instytucjonalni otrzymają regulowane narzędzia do ekspozycji na XRP – komentują analitycy. Równolegle Ripple stara się o licencję bankową w USA, która w przypadku powodzenia zapewni jej bezpośredni dostęp do systemu bankowego. To ruch, który zwiększyłby wiarygodność projektu w oczach największych inwestorów. XRP w kluczowym punkcie Z technicznego punktu widzenia XRP znajduje się w formacji trójkąta zniżkującego. Dolne wsparcie w rejonie 2,70 USD pozostaje nieprzełamane, ale każdy test tego poziomu budzi nerwowość. Średnia krocząca 50-dniowa na poziomie 2,96 USD zatrzymuje kolejne próby wybicia w górę. Świece z długimi cieniami pokazują walkę podaży z popytem, a RSI w okolicach 40 sugeruje brak wyraźnego momentum. Scenariusze są jasne: byki mogą przejąć inicjatywę dopiero po zamknięciu dnia powyżej 3,00 USD, niedźwiedzie liczą na spadek w okolice 2,59 USD. Rynek czeka więc na katalizator, a takim może być październikowa decyzja SEC. Snorter Token – nowe narzędzie na Solanie Podczas gdy XRP walczy o regulacyjną legitymizację, na drugim końcu spektrum pojawiają się projekty świeże i innowacyjne. Jednym z nich jest Snorter Token . Jest on botem tradingowym działającym w ekosystemie Solany. Jego presale zebrał już ponad 4 miliony dolarów, a do zakończenia sprzedaży pozostało jedynie 25 dni. Aktualna cena wynosi 0,1063 USD. W świecie, gdzie inwestorzy nieustannie poszukują kryptowalut z potencjałem x1000 , Snorter wzbudza zainteresowanie dzięki połączeniu technologii i marketingu. Dlaczego Solana? Szybkość i niskie koszty Snorter został oparty na Solanie, ponieważ sieć ta zapewnia błyskawiczne transakcje i minimalne prowizje. To kluczowa przewaga nad botami działającymi na Ethereum, które często zmagają się z wysokimi opłatami i przeciążeniami sieci. Główna funkcja Snortera to wykrywanie nowych tokenów jeszcze zanim staną się popularne. Bot monitoruje mempoole zarówno Solany, jak i Ethereum, wychwytując świeże projekty i pierwsze oznaki płynności. Dzięki temu użytkownicy mogą wchodzić w rynek szybciej niż reszta inwestorów. Bezpieczeństwo przede wszystkim Twórcy Snortera podkreślają, że nie chodzi o ślepe polowanie na każdy nowy token. Wbudowane filtry kontraktów i mechanizmy anty-rug mają minimalizować ryzyko związane z oszustwami czy tzw. rug pullami. Warto przypomnieć, że wielu inwestorów, którzy w 2021 roku kupowali Dogecoina czy Shiba Inu na szczytach, do dziś pozostaje na stratach. Snorter ma działać odwrotnie. Ma na celu umożliwiać wejście w projekt na wczesnym etapie i wyjście z zyskiem, gdy szerszy rynek dopiero się dowiaduje o jego istnieniu. Token SNORT – serce ekosystemu Posiadanie tokena SNORT odblokowuje pełnię możliwości bota. Najważniejsze korzyści to: obniżona prowizja za handel do 0,85% (konkurencja często pobiera 1,5–2%), unlimited snipes – możliwość uczestnictwa w dowolnej liczbie projektów, dostęp do zaawansowanych analiz, udział w głosowaniach nad rozwojem projektu, staking z dynamicznym APY sięgającym 115%. Każdy z tych elementów zwiększa popyt na token i jednocześnie ogranicza jego podaż w obiegu. Śpiesz się, presale jest na finiszu Presale Snortera kończy się za 21 dni. Po tym terminie token trafi na giełdy, gdzie jego cena prawdopodobnie wzrośnie wraz z popytem. Inwestorzy mają ograniczone okno czasowe, aby wejść na preferencyjnych warunkach. Zakupu można dokonać za pomocą SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, a także kartą kredytową. Rekomendowanym rozwiązaniem jest portfel Best Wallet. W praktyce odpowiedź na pytanie jak kupić Snorter Token sprowadza się więc do kilku kliknięć. Kryptowaluty łączą technologię i kulturę Przypadek Snortera pokazuje szerszy trend. Kryptowaluty coraz częściej łączą dwa światy, czyli zaawansowaną technologię i społecznościowy marketing. To połączenie może sprawić, że projekt zyska finalny sukces poprzez kompleksowe podjeście. W tym sensie Snorter staje się ciekawym uzupełnieniem dynamicznej sceny kryptowalut, w której z jednej strony instytucje czekają na decyzje SEC w sprawie XRP, a z drugiej inwestorzy indywidualni polują na kolejne okazje.",Altcoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BTC|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-28 21:24:40

The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $6.61 in 2031. Worldcoin (WLD) is garnering significant attention from both investors and enthusiasts, a trend that aligns with broader market predictions. In early May, WLD experienced a notable surge, quickly positioning itself among the top-performing altcoins. This rise coincided with a spike in activity surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly those related to OpenAI. The increased interest in Worldcoin is likely fueled by speculation surrounding potential collaborations and future projects that could integrate AI technology into the cryptocurrency space, further driving its market momentum. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $1.32 Market Cap $2.54B Trading Volume (24-hour) $940M Circulating Supply 2B WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.5817, June 2, 2025 24-hour High $1.35 24-hour Low $1.3 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.956 (-25.2%) Price Volatility 6.4% 50-Day SMA $1.011686 14-Day RSI 57.62 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Worldcoin price analysis: WLD faces a sharp decline as price tests critical levels Support at risk WLD holds at $1.25, but a breakdown could fuel further losses. Resistance holds sellers at $1.31, limiting recovery attempts. Bearish structure with lower highs and lows confirms bearish market control. On September 28, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) trades at $1.25, marking a 3.50% decline in the last 24 hours. The token shows a clear downtrend as it tests key support at $1.25, with immediate resistance placed at $1.31. Over the course of the day, WLD struggled to hold gains after brief upward momentum, reflecting ongoing selling pressure. The current price also stands significantly lower than its all-time high of $11.82, recorded on March 10, 2024, representing a steep 89.44% drop in value over time. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD bearish momentum holds ground On the daily timeframe, WLD displays a consistent pattern of lower highs and lower lows, signaling sustained bearish pressure. Price action shows that every recovery attempt above $1.30 quickly meets resistance, with sellers tightening control around this area. The $1.31 resistance level is proving to be a critical ceiling, repeatedly rejecting bullish attempts to break higher. The inability to establish strength above this zone highlights weakened buying interest and declining momentum. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Meanwhile, the $1.25 level is emerging as a crucial support zone that could dictate the next directional move. If bears manage to push below this threshold, WLD risks opening the path toward deeper retracement levels, which could attract further selling pressure. Conversely, a successful defense of $1.25 could provide temporary relief, though upside potential remains capped unless volume builds strongly toward $1.31. This tug-of-war between support and resistance defines the current structure of the daily chart. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD pressure builds at support On the 4-hour timeframe, WLD reflects sharp selling activity after failing to consolidate gains above $1.29. The repeated rejections below resistance show that bulls lack the strength to drive a sustained recovery. Sellers are firmly defending the $1.29–$1.31 zone, forcing price action downward in successive waves. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Currently, the price continues to press against the $1.25 support level, raising concerns about a potential breakdown if momentum fails to reverse. If this floor is lost, the bearish move could accelerate quickly, as traders may trigger stop losses near this level. To regain strength, WLD would need to climb back above $1.29 and retest $1.31 with higher volume, but until that happens, pressure remains skewed to the downside. Worldcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9607 BUY SMA 5 $0.942531 BUY SMA 10 $0.928258 BUY SMA 21 $0.942555 BUY SMA 50 $1.011686 BUY SMA 100 $1.012216 BUY SMA 20 $1.006532 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.902075 BUY EMA 5 $0.907784 BUY EMA 10 $0.923362 BUY EMA 21 $0.951525 BUY EMA 50 $0.989329 BUY EMA 100 $1.025326 BUY EMA 200 $1.187683 BUY ​​​​What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? Worldcoin’s immediate outlook depends heavily on how the $1.25 support reacts to ongoing selling pressure. A breakdown below this level could accelerate the downtrend, opening the way for deeper losses as bearish sentiment strengthens. If buyers manage to defend $1.25, the token may attempt a short-lived rebound. However, any recovery is likely to face resistance around $1.29–$1.31, where sellers have consistently regained control. Until WLD breaks above this ceiling, the broader market bias remains bearish. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin’s sharp decline from its all-time high of $11.82 to $1.25 highlights the risks tied to its volatile performance. The token has lost more than 89% of its value since March 2024, underscoring weak long-term momentum despite short-term trading opportunities. At present, the price action reflects heavy bearish control, with support at $1.25 under constant pressure and resistance capped at $1.31. Market participants view these levels as decisive for WLD’s next direction, but without a break above resistance, upside potential remains limited. Investors tracking Worldcoin are weighing its underlying utility and adoption against its prolonged decline. For now, sentiment leans cautious, as the asset struggles to attract sustained buying interest while trading at multi-month lows. Why is the WLD Price Down today The drop in WLD to $1.25 comes as bearish sentiment dominates the market, with sellers overpowering buyers at every recovery attempt. Repeated failures to break above $1.31 have reinforced downward pressure, leaving traders cautious about taking long positions. Market activity shows that momentum has shifted firmly in favor of sellers, with liquidity thinning around key support levels. Broader weakness across altcoins has also weighed on WLD, amplifying its decline and keeping the token locked in a tight range between $1.25 and $1.31. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2031. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

Optimists argue upgrades will eventually lift the project, but patience is wearing thin. In contrast, exciting new names like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are picking up traction quickly, with investors betting that speed, utility and community energy can deliver far stronger returns than the slow-moving ADA ecosystem. ADA price pressure mounts Cardano (ADA) has long been praised for its academic and research-first approach, but that steady pace hasn’t always rewarded short-term traders. At the moment, the ADA price sits close to the $0.50 mark, which many view as a key psychological level. A break below could trigger fresh selling pressure, with some analysts warning of a slide into the mid-40 cent range if momentum doesn’t return. Although ADA still benefits from a loyal community and a strong development team, the crypto market has become increasingly competitive. Faster, cheaper and more flexible tokens are drawing in capital that might otherwise have flowed into Cardano. For holders, this raises a difficult question: Wait for ADA’s slow-but-steady progress, or rotate into newer projects. Layer Brett’s presale surge In sharp contrast to Cardano’s cautious progress, Layer Brett (LBRETT) has come out of the gate swinging. The token sits at just $0.0058 in presale and has already pulled in more than $4 million, showing how quickly demand is building. Early buyers are also being rewarded with staking returns that remain above 620% APY at the time of writing, although yields will fall as more wallets join the pool, giving first movers the strongest upside. Crucially, Layer Brett is not relying on hype alone. As an Ethereum Layer 2 project, it brings faster transactions and lower costs, while the roadmap outlines NFT rollouts, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging. Buying is kept deliberately easy: Connect a wallet, use ETH or USDT, and tokens are secured in minutes. For presale investors, this combination of meme-style virality and serious technical underpinnings has made LBRETT one of the most talked-about launches of the year. Social traction and upcoming giveaway Momentum around Layer Brett isn’t only about presale numbers. Its community presence is growing fast across multiple platforms. Telegram and X groups are closing in on 10k members each, TikTok has already passed 25k followers, and YouTube reviewers are adding to the buzz with growing view counts. This visibility is helping LBRETT reach investors who might never have considered getting in early on a meme-driven project. Adding fuel to the fire, the team has hinted at a $1 million giveaway designed to reward early adopters and keep engagement high. Community-driven marketing of this kind is proving powerful and it’s a sharp contrast to Cardano’s slower, development-focused communication style. ADA vs. LBRETT: where’s the upside? For cautious investors, ADA remains a respectable hold with long-term potential if its upgrades gain traction. It has history, credibility and a strong base of supporters. But for those looking for bigger multiples in the near term, Layer Brett is making the stronger case. With its presale still under one cent, staking returns above 600 percent, viral community growth and a utility-rich roadmap, LBRETT is being tipped to move from fractions of a penny to $1 and beyond. That’s the kind of breakout Cardano holders haven’t enjoyed in years. While ADA price movements are tied to slow ecosystem progress, Layer Brett is proving that speed, hype and utility together can create an outsized opportunity. Secure your LBRETT tokens today — the presale is live, and early entry won’t last forever.

Priced at $0.035, Mutuum Finance is storming the market. The project remains in presale phase 6 that is more than 50% sold out. Having already raised well over $16.5 million in presale, with more than 16,620 holders, MUTM has been hailed by analysts as the “next SHIB” on account of its growth potential. And unlike SHIB, whose growth comes from community hype, MUTM comes with actual utility from its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that combines peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract models. With great staking rewards, good security audits, and a clearly defined roadmap, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling chance for investors to reap great rewards and a real DeFi-supported alternative to traditional meme coins. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: October Momentum Builds Amid Burn Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) is displaying hints of a potential bullish reversal heading into October, fueled by underlying on-chain events that can sustain a continued price resurgence. The token’s burn rate doubled 400% in 24 hours, removing over 1.15 million SHIB from circulation, an action that capped supply and added still more pressure to the price. Concurrently, token outflows from exchanges surged from $378,000 to 2.29 million tokens, a reflection of decreasing selling pressure as investors transferred assets from trading platforms, according to Coinglass. All these combined suggest SHIB can look forward to renewed traction in the coming weeks, and for those who are hoping for higher upside potential and with improved fundamentals, eyes are increasingly shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Momentum Accelerates Mutuum Finance recently launched the highly anticipated Stage Six presale. MUTM tokens now selling at $0.035, a 16.17% price appreciation over the previous round. Investor demand remains extremely robust, with more than 16,620 investors contributing more than $16.5 million of committed capital to date. To further enhance the security of the platform, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program where they welcome white-hat researchers and developers to identify bugs. They will be categorized into four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low, for thorough detection and speedy patching of possible vulnerabilities. Mutuum protocol is constructed around sound collateral management in a bid to protect the ecosystem and users. Some of the most noteworthy protective measures include perpetual collateral ratios, limits on loans, and deposit limits. Undercollateralized positions are quickly liquidated, while penalties and remediation fees stabilize the platform and minimize systemic risk. Efficiency is the central concept at Mutuum Finance. Through optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, and particularly overcollateralized positions, the protocol achieves maximum capital utilization with strong protection. Reserve requirements act as a market shock absorber, and surplus reserves can be invested profitably in riskier assets to offset volatility. Mutuum Finance’s vision is to redefine DeFi along three pillars: long-term sustainability, reliability, and access. Through the provision of a secure and scalable lending and borrowing platform, the platform is democratizing decentralized finance for retail as well as institutional customers. As a gesture of gratitude for the initial community engagement, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will be rewarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The action is one way of showing that Mutuum cares about rewarding the initial adopters of the project while promoting awareness for the cause. While Shiba Inu could stage a comeback in October, Mutuum Finance is a superior purchase. With over $16.5 million raised, 16,620+ investors, and tokens valued at $0.035 in Stage 6 presale, MUTM is blending true DeFi utility with strong security, staking benefits, and total lending solutions. Its pioneering platform and growing community place it above the rest as a meme coin alternative. Join the Mutuum Finance presale today to be on the ground floor before the next phase of growth.

This retest has been most visible in futures open interest, where billions of dollars in positions have been wiped out across major exchanges. This rapid unwinding comes as a correction move to weeks of excessive leverage during uptrends that had pushed derivatives activity to unsustainable levels. Related Reading: When Will XRP Reach $25? Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction Massive Open Interest Wipeout Across Major Exchanges The most recent Ethereum price correction was a broader market reset rather than a mere dip, with leveraged traders facing the brunt of the losses. Data shows that Ethereum’s open interest experienced a steep downfall over the just concluded week across multiple crypto exchanges. According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, billions worth of Ethereum positions were wiped out last week, with Binance leading the downturn with the steepest monthly average drop. Ethereum’s slide under the $4,000 mark proved to be the breaking point for over-leveraged traders. The move unleashed a wave of liquidations across derivatives markets, compounding selling pressure. Data shows that more than $3 billion was erased on September 23 through Binance alone, followed by over $1 billion just a day later. Bybit also shed $1.2 billion in positions, while OKX recorded a $580 million decline. The sharp reduction is visible in aggregate open interest, which has slumped to its lowest level since early 2024. As the chart data shows, futures leverage and open interest were closely tied to the price rally in July and August, and at the same time, it declined in lockstep with the price. Ethereum Open Interest by exchange Spot Ethereum ETF Outflows Add To Market Strain Ethereum’s break below $4,000 and the decline in open interest coincides with a week of heavy outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. According to data from Farside Investors, $795.56 million flowed out over five trading days last week, which is the largest weekly exodus since the products launched. The sell-off intensified toward the end of the week, with Thursday recording $251.2 million in outflows, followed by another $248.4 million on Friday. Waning institutinal participation contributed massively to the sell-side pressure, with investors showing caution amid uncertainty over whether regulators will allow staking features in these ETFs. This synchronized exit from both derivatives and institutional products has amplified volatility, creating a convergence of pressure across Ethereum’s trading ecosystem.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,002. Despite this attempt to regain stability, the leading altcoin is still down by about 10% in a weekly timeframe, considering it was trading around $4,490 this time last week. The bullish scenario now lies in whether ETH can reclaim and sustain a move above $4,000.

While established coins like Tron (TRX) offer stability, market analysts are issuing an urgent message: Tron can wait. The real, time-sensitive opportunity lies with Ruvi AI (RUVI), a project whose presale is moving at such a blistering pace that it’s being called one of the fastest-growing altcoins on the market. With Phase 3 hitting 20% completion in just a matter of days, the window to secure a ground-floor position is closing rapidly. This incredible speed is the latest chapter in a presale that has been nothing short of spectacular. Ruvi AI has officially soared past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens already claimed by a rapidly expanding global community of more than 3,900 holders . This level of demand is why experts are urging investors to prioritize Ruvi AI, as it shows all the signs of a project on the verge of a major price explosion. Why the Urgency? The Power of Unprecedented Growth Analysts are advising investors to shift their focus from coins like Tron because the potential for life-changing gains lies in early-stage projects with explosive momentum. Ruvi AI fits this description perfectly. Selling 20% of its Phase 3 allocation in mere days demonstrates a level of market hunger that is rare and often precedes a massive rally. This is not just speculative fervor. Ruvi AI’s value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its credibility is further solidified by a successful CyberScope audit, assuring investors of its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , which signals to the broader market that it is a serious, high-growth AI contender. This combination of speed, utility, and trust is why experts are calling it a must-have for this bull cycle. The Super App Fueling a Record-Breaking Presale The engine driving Ruvi AI’s historic demand is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining the creative workflow. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. The Clock is Ticking: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . However, this ground-floor entry point is disappearing at an astonishing rate. With 20% of the stage’s allocation sold in days, the opportunity to buy at this price is extremely limited. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns for early supporters: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s vibrant community. The Verdict The message from market analysts is clear: while Tron has its place, the once-in-a-cycle opportunity for exponential growth is happening right now with Ruvi AI. With its record-breaking presale, powerful utility, and a guaranteed price increase just around the corner, the time to secure your position is now.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. At the start of September, Tron is trending near the $0.34 range, maintaining its price above $0.31, as the current Tron sentiment is bullish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 22:45:00

Some analysts believe a bounce is possible but others think momentum is fading as attention shifts to newer Ethereum-based tokens. Chief among them is Layer Brett (LBRETT) , a presale project already drawing comparisons to the viral breakouts of past meme cycles — and being tipped by some to deliver gains of more than 4600%. Pepe coin price prediction The Pepe coin price prediction has split opinions. On one side, bulls argue that PEPE still commands strong brand recognition as one of the leading meme tokens launched in 2023. Supporters point to deep liquidity and an established holder base as signs the token can recover quickly if market sentiment turns risk-on again. On the other side, skeptics highlight that PEPE has already seen its parabolic run and now struggles to find fresh catalysts. With the token sitting near crucial support, a break lower could undermine confidence further. Analysts who take the bearish view believe the best-case scenario is sideways trading, while more optimistic traders argue a rebound is still possible if volumes pick up. Layer Brett’s breakout potential While PEPE wrestles with support, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is climbing the charts of investor interest. Starting at just $0.0058 in presale, the project has already pulled in more than $4 million, a figure that shows how quickly demand is accelerating. Staking rewards are still sitting in the hundreds of percent — currently above 600% APY — though they reduce as more holders lock in, giving early movers the best shot at outsized gains. What sets Layer Brett apart is its Ethereum Layer 2 backbone. Low fees and faster speeds are paired with real utility features: NFT launches, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging all appear on the roadmap. Buying has also been kept simple, requiring only a wallet connection and ETH or USDT to secure tokens in minutes. It’s this blend of meme coin appeal and usable infrastructure that has analysts calling LBRETT the Ethereum meme with genuine staying power. Social traction and $1M giveaway tease Momentum behind Layer Brett isn’t just about numbers on a presale page. The project is seeing fast growth across social platforms, with Telegram and X groups closing in on 10k members each and TikTok already boasting over 25k followers. YouTube reviews are adding to the buzz, helping the token reach a wider audience. Adding to that excitement, the team has lined up a $1 million giveaway that has the community watching closely for details. It’s the kind of marketing push that keeps engagement levels high and helps LBRETT stand out against projects like PEPE, which are struggling to generate fresh momentum. PEPE vs. LBRETT — where traders see bigger upside For long-time holders, PEPE still has a role as one of the more established meme tokens, and any sharp market rally could lift its price off current support. But the ceiling may be limited compared to newer plays. With no major new catalysts, the risk is that PEPE trades sideways while attention drifts elsewhere. That’s where Layer Brett is capturing momentum. With a presale still under one cent, staking rewards in the hundreds of percent, viral growth across social media and a utility-driven roadmap, analysts suggest it could be on track for a move from $0.0058 to $1 — a return measured in multiples, not percentages. For traders seeking outsized opportunity, LBRETT is increasingly seen as the Ethereum meme play to watch in 2025. Early buyers are locking in LBRETT at presale — don’t miss your chance to do the same.

In an official Marumasa Hotta release , the firm said the name change will be officially instated at a meeting of shareholders on November 11. Marusho Hotta also announced that the company would change its English name to “Bitcoin Japan Corporation” as it begins stockpiling Bitcoin (BTC) .

It also operates a range of contemporary and hybrid fashion brands. But after years of falling sales and stagnation on the Tokyo Exchange, it was taken over by the Tokyo-based RIZAP Group in 2017. Bakkt made its move in June, claiming it hopes to become Marusho Hotta’s largest shareholder and transform the firm into “a leading Japanese Bitcoin treasury company.” In its September 26 release, Marusho Hotta wrote: “We have decided to launch a new business, the Bitcoin treasury business, so we can expand our business scope and expand into new fields in the future. We are also considering the launch of finance-related business operations.” These operations, it appears, will be primarily related to Marusho Hotta’s Bitcoin treasury operations.

(Image: Google Finance) New Management Confirmed The firm has also confirmed that Bakkt International President Phillip Lord will become Bitcoin Japan’s new CEO. Akshay Naheta, the co-chief executive officer of Bakkt Holdings, will assume the new role of Chairman of the Board of Directors. The company added that its new management structure would “further align the interests of directors and shareholders.” This, the firm said, will help the company “achieve a medium- to long-term improvement in corporate value.” More Textiles Firms Turn to BTC? Marusho Hotta was founded in 1861 and opened one of Japan’s first kimono wholesale stores in 1894. It floated on the Tokyo Exchange in 1974. Earlier this year, Kitabo, a TYO-listed synthetic yarns producer, announced its own plans to buy Bitcoin and “enter the cryptoasset and Real-World Asset (RWA) sectors.” Kitabo said it plans to buy around $5.4 million worth of Bitcoin in an initial foray into the market. The firm, like many others in the world of Japanese textiles and traditional clothing, has seen revenues plummet in recent years. In 2021, the EU-Japan Center for Industrial Cooperation noted that “old, traditional [Japanese] retailers have seen sales diminish as they become less and less viable.” The likes of Kitabo and Marusho Hotta have certainly felt the pinch. After racking up years of annual net losses, Kitbo posted a net loss of $785,000 for FY2024. Marusho Hotta, meanwhile, posted a net income of minus 407.32 million yen (-$2,724,439) for the same period.

The firms are also likely to launch BTC lending services as part of their radical rebranding efforts. This year has seen scores of Japanese firms from all sorts of business sectors enter the Bitcoin treasury sector. Metaplanet has led the charge, snapping up enough Bitcoin to move into the global top five BTC treasury firms . Other firms, like the loyalty points provider Remixpoint, game-makers like Gumi, and the fashion retailer ANAP , have also thrown their hats into the Bitcoin ring in recent months.

The buys came through names like Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, FalconX and OKX.

Exchange Balances Fall To 9-Year Low According to Glassnode data, the amount of ETH held on exchanges has plunged from roughly 31 million to about 14.8 million ETH — a drop of 52% from 2016 levels. Many of those coins are likely in staking contracts, cold wallets or institutional custody, and the recent launch of the first Ethereum staking ETF has helped pull more supply off exchanges. Lower exchange balances mean fewer coins ready to be sold instantly on exchanges, which can make price moves sharper when big orders hit the market. ETH Hovers Near $4,000 As Volatility Rises Based on TradingView readings, ETH is trading around $4,011, down roughly 0.33% over the last 24 hours and more than 10% over the past week. The token briefly slipped under $3,980 earlier in the session before climbing back, and it remains below a recent close of $4,034. This two-week pullback has returned ETH to a key $4,000 support area, and short-term swings have become more pronounced as holders reposition. $3,700 Becomes A Line In Sand Crypto analyst Ted Pillows has warned that the $3,700 to $3,800 zone could face heavy pressure. Reports note that if ETH falls below $3,700, many margin positions could be wiped out and spark forced selling that pushes prices lower. $ETH liquidity heatmap is showing decent long liquidations around the $3,700-$3,800 level. This level could be revisited again before Ethereum shows any recovery. pic.twitter.com/SQTbfrujAa — Ted (@TedPillows) September 27, 2025 With fewer coins on exchanges and concentrated margin exposure, the short-term outlook is more fragile even as longer-term demand indicators look solid. ETF Outflows Show Institutional Mood Can Flip US-listed ETH funds recorded nearly $800 million in outflows this week, their largest redemptions to date. Still, roughly $26 billion sits in Ethereum ETFs, equal to 5.37% of total supply. Whales keep accumulating $ETH! 16 wallets have received 431,018 $ETH($1.73B) from #Kraken, #GalaxyDigital, #BitGo, #FalconX and #OKX in the past 3 days.https://t.co/0DPxgZMGN7 https://t.co/xtPLBKo9LZ pic.twitter.com/oEXZKIErmr — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 27, 2025 Related Reading: When Will XRP Reach $25? Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction Those numbers underline how quickly institutional sentiment can change: big inflows can vanish just as fast, and ETF flows now add a new, sizable layer to price dynamics. Lookonchain data also highlighted a prior accumulation of roughly $204 million in ETH, showing similar patterns of large players stepping up during dips. Retail traders appear more cautious for now. But the sequence of big buys from institutional-grade custodians suggests some buyers view dips as buying chances while others choose to wait on the sidelines.

In the meantime, the project’s native token continues to be deep in the red on multiple scales and is close to charting another all-time low. Hackathon Halfway There CryptoPotato reported in August that the Pi Network Core Team had come up with a new way to engage with its Pioneers in the form of a hackathon. The 2025 event began on August 21 and its final submission is scheduled for October 15, with an optional midpoint check-in on September 19. The halfway video shows some of the applications that users have developed. The first is called Starmax, which allows users to buy goods with Pi in a simple way. Another one, dubbed Nature’s Pulse, connects consumers with farmers as it allows the former to purchase “fresh, affordable produce with Pi and get them delivered directly to them.” Eternal Rush is a Pi Network-native online game. ReloadPi enables Pi holders to spend their tokens on buying thousands of products from over 300 brands, including ordering pizza or other foods and beverages. StreamPi is a newly created application that caters to Pi investors, allowing them to upload their content and pay with just one token. The team also reminded that there will be a prize pool of 160,000 Pi tokens for up to eight teams and will be distributed in the following manner: 1st Place – 75,000 Pi 2nd Place – 45,000 Pi 3rd Place – 15,000 Pi Honorable Mentions (up to 5 teams) – 5,000 Pi each Pi Price Update Despite the evident success of the hackathon and other recent updates from the team, the project’s native token can’t catch a break. The asset marked a new all-time low last week at just over $0.25, and even though it tried to recover some ground, it was quickly halted and pushed south once again. It’s deep in the red on a weekly scale (25%) and currently sits just 2.3% above the ATL from September 22. The unlocking schedule for the next month is also somewhat concerning, as October 1 and October 4 will see the release of massive quantities, up to 13.4 million coins, which could intensify the immediate selling pressure.

The Math May Shock You,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-shib-really-ever-hit-1-the-math-may-shock-you/,"The Shiba Inu price prediction is back in the spotlight after another round of social media chatter asked the same question: Can SHIB ever really hit $1? Supporters argue that continued burns and ecosystem growth could fuel massive upside, while skeptics highlight just how huge the market cap would need to be for that milestone. At the same time, new tokens like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are drawing attention for more realistic paths to big gains — some forecasts even put its upside in the thousands of percent. Shiba Inu price prediction The Shiba Inu price prediction has always divided the crypto space. On the bullish side, enthusiasts point to token burns and an expanding ecosystem, including Shibarium, as reasons why SHIB could climb much higher in the next cycle. They argue that community backing remains one of the strongest in crypto and that virality can sometimes override traditional valuation models. On the other hand, the math behind SHIB hitting $1 is daunting. At current supply levels, it would require a market cap larger than the entire crypto industry combined. That’s why many analysts believe the realistic ceiling is far lower, perhaps fractions of a cent, unless supply reductions dramatically accelerate. The Shiba Inu price prediction heading into 2025 therefore ranges from modest gains to sideways action, with a moonshot to $1 considered highly unlikely. Layer Brett’s growth story While SHIB wrestles with questions of scale, Layer Brett is being framed as a meme coin with real upside potential. Priced at just $0.0058, the presale has already raised more than $4 million, showing clear demand from investors looking for the next viral hit. At the time of writing, staking rewards sit above 600% APY , though these will reduce as more wallets join, rewarding early adopters the most. What sets Layer Brett apart from older meme coins is its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation. Transactions are faster and cheaper and the roadmap adds utility beyond memes: NFT launches, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging are all in the pipeline. To buy, just connect a wallet, use ETH or USDT and tokens are secured in minutes. For many, this balance of accessibility, hype and utility is exactly what makes LBRETT a standout in today’s market. Social momentum and the $1M giveaway tease Community energy has been a decisive factor in meme coin success and Layer Brett is already building serious traction. Telegram and X groups are closing in on 10k members each, while TikTok has surged past 25k followers. On top of that, YouTube reviews and breakdowns are helping spread the word beyond the core crypto crowd. To keep engagement high, the team has teased a $1 million giveaway as part of its roadmap. That move is designed to reward early supporters and add another layer of excitement as the presale heads into later stages. Combined with viral social buzz, it positions LBRETT as a project with momentum that SHIB has struggled to recreate since its 2021 breakout. Shiba Inu vs. Layer Brett: The case for bigger multiples By contrast, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is being tipped as the more realistic path to outsized returns. With a presale price under one cent, staking rewards as high as 600 percent and a roadmap stacked with utility, analysts argue the token has far more room to run. For early-stage buyers, it offers the kind of explosive multiples that SHIB can no longer realistically deliver. Presale demand is climbing fast — secure your LBRETT allocation before the next price rise.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $2.29. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $3.72 and an average forecast price of $3.58. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The EOS ecosystem has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 in the near future? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.401 (-1.32%) Market Cap $640.38M Trading Volume $371.3K Circulating Supply 1.59B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4027 (Nov 04, 2024) 24-hour High $0.4073 24-hour Low $0.3999 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.441984 (9.92%) Price Volatility 5.33% 50-Day SMA $0.488746 14-Day RSI 29.43 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 37 (Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.578938 EOS price analysis: Negative market sentiment pushes EOS price toward $0.401 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downward market trend toward $0.401. The altcoin lost 1.32% of its value. The EOS coin looks for support around $0.389. On September 28, the EOS price analysis revealed a bearish daily trend for the altcoin. The EOS price experienced significant losses, reaching $0.401 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the altcoin lost up to 1.32% of its value today, as sellers continue to rule the market, causing further price depreciation. The altcoin has now been losing value for a second consecutive day, targeting the next support at $0.389. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirms a decreasing trend as the price moves downward. The EOS/USD value dipped to $0.401 today. The appearance of red candlesticks on the price chart signifies a bearish trend. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.517. The indicator’s lower limit, which serves as the support, has shifted to $0.389. EOSUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 30.38 and is at the brink of entering the oversold region. The downward curve on the RSI graph signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further instability in the market can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also shows selling pressure building up at the current price level. The altcoin’s value has decreased to $0.401 as bears are trying to dominate the price action. Low levels of volatility mark a lesser chance of a reversal in market trends or further price depreciation. The Bollinger Bands have converged, hinting at low volatility. This low level of volatility signifies increased market predictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.412, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.396, indicating support. EOSUSD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 36.19, the RSI curve is pointing downwards, confirming the selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates significant pressure from the selling side of the market. We can expect further depreciation if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

The EOS price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The EOS/USD value has decreased to $0.401 in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further decrease in price levels to retest the support of $0.389. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent resistance around the $0.405 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and took the price to $0.401. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is striving to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the price trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2028 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031, which makes it a good option to buy EOS, though accurate predictions are nearly impossible in the crypto market. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $3.72 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 90th-ranked cryptocurrency. It also experienced strong bullish sentiment in November last year, when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $3.88 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. In mid-July 2025, EOS recovered to $0.625. However, at the start of September, EOS is trending near $0.47 after a price drop, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 23:55:00

One of such comments was made in an old interview which has resurfaced to catch the eye of some XRP investors on the social media platform X. Years later, those comments are being revisited as XRP continues to push for adoption in global markets and as investors are counting down to the SEC’s upcoming decision on Spot XRP ETF applications. Utility Over Hype: Revisiting Garlinghouse’s Message A recent video which was posted on the social media platform X by popular XRP commentator JackTheRippler ties back into an interview where Garlinghouse noted how trillions in capital could pour into XRP in the coming years. In that conversation, Garlinghouse explained that hype alone cannot sustain the value of any cryptocurrency, insisting instead that true growth comes from solving real-world problems and building a customer base. These comments were made in a 2017 interview on CNBC’s Squawk Alley, at a time when cryptocurrencies were mostly valued on speculation alone. In the interview, Garlinghouse pointed out that XRP wasn’t just created to trade on exchanges but was meant to serve a real purpose, which is settling liquidity between banks. At the time, he noted that more than $27 trillion was sitting idle in correspondent banking accounts worldwide to facilitate payments between themselves. RIPPLE CEO SAYS THAT #XRP SETTLES MONEY IN SECONDS! TRILLIONS IN CAPITAL COULD POUR INTO XRPL. DRIVEN BY REAL TOKEN, BUILT TO TOKENIZE THE ENTIRE REAL ESTATE SECTOR! DYOR/NFA GET REAL TOKEN HERE: https://t.co/kYx7u3Ko4Z pic.twitter.com/seidvGLqdy — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) September 27, 2025 His vision was that XRP, with its ability to settle transactions in seconds, could free up that capital and make cross-border payments much more efficient. “We use this digital asset called XRP to settle liquidity needs between banks,” he said. Even though those words were spoken years ago, they still fit into today’s conversations about XRP. Its adoption potential in the worldwide financial system continues to be the foundation of why many investors believe XRP can stand apart from other cryptocurrencies. Countdown To US SEC’s Spot XRP ETF Decision The attention surrounding XRP nowadays is shifting to the regulatory front, with many investors awaiting the outcome of pending Spot XRP ETF applications . After Bitcoin and Ethereum won approval for similar products, many see XRP as the next logical step given its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency. The US SEC has introduced new listing standards designed to speed up crypto ETF approvals, cutting the review window to 75 days or less. Grayscale’s filing is due for a decision on October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19, Bitwise on October 20, CoinShares and Canary Capital on October 23, and WisdomTree on October 24.

Central to Labour’s Youth Guarantee programme , the plan represents one of the most radical attempts in years to address Britain’s persistent rates of long-term youth unemployment . In a speech at the Labour Party conference, Reeves will argue that she is committed to nothing less than the abolition of long-term youth unemployment. Under the scheme, those aged 16-24 and out of work for at least 18 months would be given a job offer they would have to take. Those who decline could face sanctions, including a reduction in benefits. Reeves will say the policy is not just about jobs, “It is also about dignity. “We will not allow a generation of young people to languish, without hope or prospects for the future — locked out from security and the fair chance that good work brings,” she will say. The Labour government is adamant that this is not about punishing the young, but preventing them from being left behind in a shifting economy. Budget will decide funding and scope The scheme will be detailed in the Budget on November 26. Ministers will detail whether jobs will be directly funded by the government or subsidised through incentives to employers. The scheme only applies to those in the specified age group and who have been on Universal Credit for 18 months. That means some groups of people — like young adults not claiming benefits, or the recently unemployed — will not be eligible. Officials concede that it is hard to be certain that the scheme creates new jobs rather than filling those that would have been taken anyway. Critics fear the government could pay employers to create low-quality jobs with limited long-term value. For years, unions and business organisations have called on the government to put money into youth jobs. The Trades Union Congress is calling for creating a permanent £1bn-a-year guarantee scheme, akin to those implemented during the 2009 financial crisis and the Covid pandemic. The British Chambers of Commerce supported the principle of a subsidised jobs scheme but warned that many businesses were struggling with higher national insurance contributions and new employment protections. The group said last week that young people without work history would be left without opportunities unless the government helped cover the cost. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of the CBI, said the plan was crucial for the economy but urged the government to provide more detail. She said the business group wanted to know how the scheme would operate and whether it would address rising employment costs. Previous schemes shape the current plan The UK has attempted similar programs in the past. The Future Jobs Fund, introduced in 2009, provided thousands of placements but was scrapped in 2010 as it was deemed too expensive. The Kickstart Scheme was established by Rishi Sunak during the pandemic to stave off a youth jobs crisis, but closed early after fewer than anticipated employers applied. Reeves is framing this plan as narrower. By prioritising those who have been unemployed or not in education the longest, Labour hopes to break a cycle of exclusion. Now one in eight 16-to-24-year-olds is not in work, education, or training, and that number has grown by almost a third over the past four years. The government is already testing elements of the Youth Guarantee in so-called “trailblazer” areas that connect young people with apprenticeships, places at college, or support packages. Ministers also announced earlier this year that £3.8bn of funding would be available to help those with health conditions, making it more difficult for them to move into work. However, skeptics, including international investors and domestic experts, warn that despite the momentum, serious structural challenges — such as skills shortages, regional inequality, and high cost of hiring — will make progress difficult.

This update came after the EV manufacturer shared its sales data from January 2023 to June 2025. According to the data, the company had only sold about 5,300 vehicles . This indicated that the automaker is struggling in the market even after adopting strategies such as opening its 45th sales location in Japan, introducing a competitive fourth EV model, and embracing plans to release an electric ‘kei’ car by late 2026. Although its sales were disappointing and its efforts did not pay off, BYD has not yet lost hope. To boost its sales, the company now offers customers discounts. Based on the strategy, it gives out discounts of up to ¥1 million, which is equivalent to around $6,700. This can be combined with government subsidies to lower prices by as much as 50%. For instance, when one purchases the Atto 3, he or she will pay just under ¥4.2 million. Considering its advantages in the era of the recent crackdowns in the industry, Chinese individuals have reportedly found this strategy appealing. Foreign automakers encounter hardship in the Japanese auto market Tech analysts commented on the situation, acknowledging that BYD’s pricing strategy is unusual because, in recent years, Japanese automakers have hardly reduced their car prices. This has raised worries that Japan’s pricing strategy may fail despite the automaker solidifying its position as a leading EV brand in China. Tatsuo Yoshida, a Senior Auto Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence covering the Japanese auto sector, further explained the situation, stating that the strategy could make first buyers feel like they got a bad deal for paying more, resulting in reduced resale values. The challenges outlined have demonstrated the struggles of foreign automakers like BYD in the Japanese auto market. According to reports from sources, buyers are inclined to choose well-known brands such as Toyota Motor Corp. and usually prefer gas-electric hybrids instead of battery electric vehicles (EVs). This proves that Japanese car buyers are loyal to local firms, affecting major legacy brands. To illustrate this, General Motors Company had quit the Japanese auto market after experiencing poor sales. Additionally, Hyundai Motor Company is taking another shot after leaving the market in 2009. For BYD, the mixed response in the Japanese auto market stands out when compared to the rising sales in the European market. Despite the challenges surrounding its operation, the company is still committed to expanding globally and addressing the challenges encountered in its homeland, China. Yoshida calls on the urgency of making an impression in the EV market Despite its short-term challenges, the Japanese auto market has long-term benefits that offset these challenges. According to reports from reliable sources, EVs are anticipated to make up only 3.4% of new vehicles in Japan in 2025; however, growth is predicted in the years to come. In a statement, Yoshida emphasized that the main goal is to make an impression, not Japan. According to the analyst, what matters for BYD is that it may be recognized by some of the most demanding customers in the world. “What they really want is a history of doing business in Japan with the most discerning quality customers, even if it does not make complete economic sense,” he said. The company still has a long way to go before it can bite off chunks of the market share away from local Japanese companies. BYD sold 512 of all its models for June, compared to a top EV in Japan, Nissan Motor Co.’s Sakura, which sold 1,137. However, Yoshida highlighted that these sales figures are insufficient to pay employee salaries and keep showrooms operational. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Having a price tag of $0.035 MUTM is also in stage 6 of its presale. This phase is over 50% sold, and this is an indicator that the investors have less time to get before the window is closed. Mutuum Finance has true DeFi utility and innovative peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending, staking rewards, and solid security measures compared to SOL that is grappling with short-term volatility. Mutuum Finance may be the most appropriate cryptocurrency to invest at the end of September 2025. Solana Under Bearish Pressure With Key Breakdown Solana (SOL) is at a crossroad in the 4H chart because of the price movement being below the up-trending trendline and even at the key support region between the ranges of $214-210. This shift is reflecting bearish momentum, and technical analysts are looking at two important downside points to have the first target support at the $185 region and a more extreme possible retracement zone of $165 to $167 with further selling pressure. Solana is still dominating, but its present structure indicates a period of consolidation or even more radical price reduction, something that is causing investors to find other options elsewhere to potentially more dynamically generate growth opportunity Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Triumph Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing good performance in its presale. The current phase is already 50% complete and sells tokens at 0.035. The investor demand is high and this project has already collected more than 16.5 million. One of the roadmap highlights of it is the introduction of a USD-denominated stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain which will grant it assistance to long-term value, introduce liquidity, and supply users with steady returns. Sound Risk Controls and Architecture-based Security. Mutuum Finance is built on the hierarchies of risk management and the security imprinted in all the protocol layers. It deals with under-collateralization and over-collateralization events rather well with the help of such measures as cascading Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, liquidity protection, liquidation charges and reserve hedging schemes all of which keep the platform stable despite the fluctuations of market conditions. The protocol interest rate model is sound and sensitive to the level of liquidity. Lending rates are minimised to lengthen the borrower sub-market interest rates since excess liquidity is experienced. During a liquidity crunch, the rate of interest charged on borrowing is elevated in the perspective of promoting loan recovery and realization of new deposits. There are situations in which the dynamic model allows borrowing at fixed rates i.e. when one is presenting very liquid collateral and the overall balance in the market is maintained. Besides the core lending and borrowing business, Mutuum Finance is also undertaking a very aggressive growth strategy by staking rewards, token buybacks, and exchange listings, all of which are targeted at spurring a healthy ecosystem and usage in the long-run. The project has also created a $100,000 giveaway in honor of its first adopters, 10 participants will each be given $10 000 worth of MUTM tokens. The move signifies the interest of Mutuum in creating a healthy and strong community and rewarding birds of a feather as the platform takes an early lead in its speedy growth. MUTM offers actual DeFi utility, superior security, and long-term scalability. Invest in Mutuum Finance presale now and receive your share before the prices are increased.

MoonBull Presale Gains Speed While Cheems and Dogecoin Add Meme Market Heat,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-best-new-crypto-in-texas-moonbull-presale-gains-speed-while-cheems-and-dogecoin-add-meme-market-heat/,"What if the next big crypto moonshot is already blasting off and most people in Texas are still standing on the sidelines? The cryptocurrency conversation has evolved into a race to find the best new crypto in Texas, where meme culture, presale excitement, and community loyalty combine to create market momentum. Many investors chase the so-called best crypto in Texas before it takes off because being early often means being rewarded the most. It has become a meme itself among traders, who joke that timing the entry is like catching lightning in a bottle. Everyone wants to be the one bragging about calling the move before it happened. Some projects come and go in conversation, but MoonBull has quickly emerged as the one creating genuine urgency with its presale momentum. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Presale Rocket Poised for Texas Investors MoonBull is capturing serious attention as a candidate for the best crypto in Texas due to its ground-up construction. It is a meme coin launched on Ethereum to reward the community while avoiding the usual pitfalls of presales dominated by bots or whales. Transparency, fairness, and sustainability are central to its design. The project moved quickly into Stage 3 of its presale, showing just how strong the demand has been. The early numbers alone are striking. Over 400 holders have already joined, with the presale tally crossing $142,000 and a current price of just $0.00004057. That early surge hints at the kind of scarcity that makes investors rush to grab their share before stages get more expensive. The mechanics behind MoonBull give it an edge. One highlight is the staking system that unlocks at Stage 10. Holders can stake tokens directly from the dashboard and earn a fixed 95% annual yield. This feature rewards conviction while supporting stability since it encourages holders to lock in rather than sell off. Another standout is community governance that begins at Stage 12. Holders get a direct vote on project decisions such as surprise burns and future campaigns, making the token feel like a shared project instead of a closed-door launch. These features create both trust and long-term incentive for the people already on board. Referral rewards add another layer of attraction. Not only does each invite earn 15% for the referrer and 15% more for the buyer, but the top referrers each month can take home bonuses in USDC. This is not just about meme energy. It is about a system designed to grow naturally through incentives that keep people engaged. The early presale numbers tell the same story. An investor putting in $20,000 right now would receive nearly 492,975,104.76 MOBU. At the projected listing price of $0.00616, that position could expand into more than $3,036,726.65. It is the kind of upside that fuels excitement around what some are calling the best new crypto in Texas . MoonBull’s rapid climb to Stage 3 in a matter of hours suggests more than hype. It demonstrates confidence from the community and signals that later stages will fill even more quickly. That combination of momentum, scarcity, and community engagement is exactly what gives it an edge in this race. Dogecoin: The Veteran Meme King Dogecoin is often mentioned in discussions about the best cryptocurrencies in Texas, largely due to its reputation. It began as a joke but over time grew into one of the most widely recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. It benefits from brand power and a massive community that has kept it relevant even years after launch. The strengths of Dogecoin are clear. It is listed on nearly every major exchange, accepted by several merchants, and still used for tipping across social platforms. That broad adoption makes it more stable compared to many meme coins that struggle for visibility. Its deep liquidity and history give investors a sense of security when compared to smaller meme projects. However, Dogecoin no longer offers the same explosive upside that it once did. Much of its story has already been written, which means its price movements now rely more on broader market cycles and high-profile endorsements than new mechanics. Dogecoin does not have presale stages, staking programs, or governance layers to create fresh catalysts. Instead, its strength lies in its staying power and brand recognition. Cheems: The Meme Challenger Cheems is another meme coin that holds its own place in the conversation around the best crypto in Texas. It draws power from the viral appeal of the “doge family” of memes while carving out its own lane in the community space. Cheems has a loyal following and manages to capture bursts of attention whenever meme coin energy flares up across the market. What makes Cheems interesting is that it occupies a unique position between established giants and emerging tokens. It is not yet a household name, but it has enough recognition to be taken seriously in crypto circles. When meme coin rallies heat up, Cheems tends to ride the wave as traders look for alternatives with higher growth potential. That said, Cheems does not currently offer the kind of built-in incentives that other projects in the space have introduced. It does not have staking at high yields or community governance structures. Its growth depends heavily on community sentiment and social media traction. This makes it less predictable, but also means its upside could be significant if it catches viral momentum at the right moment. Final Thoughts Based on research and market trends, the race for the best new crypto in Texas comes down to three very different options. MoonBull brings energy, features, and presale speed that could reward early believers in ways other meme coins rarely achieve. For investors chasing real upside, MoonBull appears to offer the most powerful combination of mechanics and momentum. MoonBull presale is live, stages are moving quickly, and early numbers show both confidence and demand. Anyone looking to enter the world of crypto in Texas might see this as the right time to act, before prices rise further.

Markets and economists had widely anticipated the action. The decision follows three rate cuts earlier this year, representing a move toward greater caution while inflation quickens again. The central bank has tried to quell post-pandemic inflation without pinching off job growth. Recent data suggest progress, though risks of inflation persist. The monthly inflation gauge was up for a second straight month in August. Housing, food, and alcohol prices rose. Economists caution that this trend may indicate fresh price pressures, particularly in services. According to RBA Governor Michele Bullock last week, the economy was showing “a bit stronger” than expected signs. She added that the labour market is close to full employment and private sector activity is strengthening. Bullock, however, has cautioned that the RBA is not on a preset course. Future decisions will be conditioned on new real-time inflation, jobs, and wages information. Markets await guidance on cuts The 3.6% pause by the RBA hasn’t halted the debate over what happens next. Attention has shifted to the timing of the next step, with some analysts still predicting rate cuts are inevitable . Westpac and Bloomberg Economics foresee the four-year curve falling below 3 per cent by the end of 2026. They believe the economy will slow down sufficiently to compel the bank into action sooner than many think. National Australia Bank has also extended its forecast to May 2026 with no change in policy. NAB economists say stubborn inflation and robust growth will see the RBA keep rates on hold for significantly longer than market prices. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA ) previously called for a November cut. Now, its own economists are backing away. They cite data on inflation that have come in stronger than expected in recent months as the biggest risk, cautioning that the path to lower rates “is not clear, it is a done deal. “ International dynamics are also complicating the calculus. The US Federal Reserve slashed rates again earlier this month, the first time it has cut since late 2023. The Fed keeps easing while the RBA holds, and suddenly Australian assets start to look relatively attractive. That would bolster capital inflows, push the Australian dollar higher, and help local bond markets. Such a split interest rate could make it easier for the RBA not to rush into cutting. Higher relative yields could take some sting out of the financial stress without any need to loosen the stance on policy. But if the stronger currency were to remain, it would also jeopardize weakening exports. RBA navigates inflation risks carefully If the Fed moves too quickly to lower interest rates, inflation could reignite and reverse all the progress made over the past two years. But if it leaves rates too high for too long, the risk is weaker growth, sluggish job creation, and more financial stress on household s al ready stretched trying to keep up with hefty mortgage repayments. It’s a “delicate trade-off,” Governor Michele Bullock recently said. The central bank is walking a tightrope, seeking to maintain its credibility that it will fight against inflation while not tipping the economy into a downturn. For now, the board believes that moderate restraint on policy will be appropriate. This suggests that interest rates have risen enough to cool prices but not so far as to choke off demand. Surveys that measure payrolls and spending are rebounding as reopening proceeds apace, suggesting the strategy is working, though economists warn the direction could easily change. How much happens will depend on how inflation behaves in the next few months. And if prices for housing, energy, and services keep rising, the bank may not have a choice but to continue leaving rates higher well into 2026. Complicating matters, of course, is the global context. The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have started loosening policy. If Australia falls too far behind other countries, capital flows and exchange rate movements may rewrite domestic financial conditions unpredictably. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The financial arm of Sony was officially listed separately from its parent, prompting a rush of buy orders that resulted in shares going untraded at open. The listing is a watershed for Sony and the Japanese market. It is the first partial spinoff under a 2023 tax reform and the first direct listing in Tokyo in over 20 years. Shares of Sony Financial were assigned a reference price of ¥150 (or about $1) per share. But demand far outpaced supply. Brokers said that buy orders had piled up from the opening bell, preventing trading from getting underway. While the rarity of such a spin-off has fueled excitement, investor interest is mainly rooted in confidence in the business. With strong positions in banking, life, and non-life insurance, Sony Financial is seen as a profitable, stable company with a vast customer base. The company has already committed to buying shares worth up to ¥100 billion in the years ahead. Analysts say it could also help to supercharge investor appetite and calm trading once the initial frenzy cools. Sony sharpens its focus. The spinoff is part of a sweeping overhaul plan at Sony Group. The entertainment and technology giant plans to concentrate on its global strengths: games, music, movies, and image sensors. By unleashing its financial arm, Sony believes both can grow faster and more wisely. Sony has maintained a minority stake in the new company. This permits the parent to leverage future appreciation while freeing Sony Financial to access capital and set its own targets for growth. Executives have said the breakup will also bring greater transparency to investors, who can now assess the value of each business on its own. There are deep roots in the finance arm, as it began with life insurance in 1979 and went on to offer banking and other services. Millions across Japan now use it. The spinoff is designed to make it more flexible in digital banking and product development and allow Sony Group to assign its resources more squarely into entertainment and technology. Sony spinoff reshapes Japan’s market landscape Japan has been wary about direct listings for some time, preferring traditional initial public offerings. The success of Sony Financial’s debut might also prompt other companies to follow its lead, particularly under the new tax rules that have been touted as a way to encourage spinoffs and corporate overhaul. Industry observers say the listing could serve as a model for other Japanese conglomerates with multiple placements. If Sony’s gamble is successful, other companies may be tempted to seek to spin off businesses to unlock value for their investors. Investors will now be monitoring Sony Financial’s trading in the coming days. The robust demand signals market confidence, but the true test will come when trading returns to normal. The split is a fresh new start for Sony. Relieved of the burden of operating a financial arm, it is doubling down on entertainment and technology businesses with global prominence. For Japan, the spinoff could represent the beginning of a new dynamic environment that shakes up long-held company structures. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

BTC was near $112,110, ETH around $4,124, SOL near $209, and XRP about $2.86 alongside 24-hour gains of roughly 2%–4% for these names. Market breadth improved as risk appetite steadied after last week’s volatility. Spot ETF flows have turned constructive again this month, offering a structural bid that has supported rebounds across large caps even as macro headlines remained choppy. Bitcoin leads the market higher Bitcoin edged higher after a turbulent stretch tied to macroeconomic data and options positioning, with recent dips below $111K following a US GDP revision that pressured risk assets before they subsequently stabilised. On the flows side, US spot BTC ETFs recorded multiple consecutive days of net inflows in mid‑September, reinforcing demand from institutions and contributing to the latest bounce. Analysts warn that BTC may need to fall toward $104,000 for correction fatigue to set in—otherwise, the sellers may remain in control. If Bitcoin breaks below a key level near $110,500, further downside toward $107,200 or even $103,500 is possible. On the upside, a daily close above $113,500 could reassert bullish dominance. Ethereum back above $4,100 Ether tracked BTC higher today. Ethereum’s price—around $4,100–$4,200—is under pressure, even though it showed modest gains in the past 24 hours. Analysts suggest ETH must reclaim $4,580 to trigger a breakout. While institutional demand is holding firm, retail flows remain weak. Some price forecasts — driven by macro tailwinds and technical setups — see ETH reaching $5,000+ by year-end. Solana Solana (SOL) traded near $209, up 3.6% in the past day but still nursing a steep 10.6% weekly loss. Solana outperformed earlier in September amid substantial accumulation signals, including Galaxy Digital-linked withdrawals totaling roughly $724M of SOL from exchanges, while some analysts argue demand from treasuries and potential ETF catalysts could extend the narrative. That optimism has been tempered near month‑end by a surge in open interest and weaker technicals that left SOL vulnerable to deeper pullbacks, even as developers press network‑level performance proposals. The net result is elevated two‑way risk in the short run around the $200 handle despite strong year‑to‑date execution and interest from institutions. XRP remains below $3 XRP held at $2.86, with 2.4% daily gains offset by a 2.3% weekly drop. XRP’s price stabilised after a volatile month shaped by its US ETF debut, where “sell‑the‑news” flows overshadowed record day‑one volume before the market found footing again. Technical updates through September point to consolidation under $3, with traders watching for breakouts while macro and ETF narratives sway flows across the complex. The near‑term setup remains range‑bound, but improved risk sentiment today helped the token participate in the broader bounce shown in the screenshots. Top gainers and losers Among altcoins, Zcash (ZEC) was the standout performer, jumping 20% to $65.09 in the past 24 hours. Pump.fun (PUMP) also rallied sharply, climbing 15% to $0.005855, while Story (IP) advanced 12% to $9.17. On the downside, Plasma (XPL) slumped 12% to $1.47, leading the laggards. MemeCore (M) fell 2.7% to $2.29, and XDC Network (XDC) edged lower by 0.95% to $0.072, underscoring selective weakness across smaller-cap names even as the wider market strengthened.

52411869,317728,1759112290,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/52411869.jpeg,Mitchell Demeter Appointed CEO of Sonic Labs to Drive Global Growth and Institutional Expansion,https://chainwire.org/2025/09/29/mitchell-demeter-appointed-ceo-of-sonic-labs-to-drive-global-growth-and-institutional-expansion/,"George Town, Cayman Islands, September 29th, 2025, Chainwire Sonic Labs , the team behind the highest-performing EVM blockchain Sonic, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mitchell Demeter as its new Chief Executive Officer. Demeter, a pioneer in digital assets and seasoned entrepreneur, will lead Sonic Labs in its next phase of global growth, accelerating the adoption of Sonic as one of the world’s leading blockchains. His mandate includes expanding developer and ecosystem adoption worldwide, strengthening institutional relationships, and building bridges into U.S. and global capital markets as part of Sonic’s broader mission to redefine the future of finance. Since the launch of the Sonic network in December 2024, the organization has achieved many milestones, including having a proven mainnet that can confirm up to 400,000 transactions per second with confirmation times consistently under 1 second, coupled with successes such as the Coinbase listing for S, native issuance of USDC , integration of Chainlink’s CCIP , and many others. However, what’s missing are strong institutional connections in the U.S. and elsewhere backing the Sonic network and its ecosystem projects. This is a necessary component—coupled with great technology, business functions, and exchange listings—that will take Sonic to the next level. Under Demeter’s leadership, Sonic Labs will be assembling a strong executive team around him, bringing in proven operators with deep experience across both traditional finance and crypto to complement the foundation’s technology strengths. Sonic Labs is expanding its business development efforts in the United States and globally, actively recruiting and hiring leaders to deepen institutional relationships and build lasting partnerships with major U.S. and global investors and enterprises alike. This transition is coming at a pivotal moment. Industry leaders have forecast that within the next decade, as much as 10% of global GDP could be transacted on blockchain rails, representing over $10 trillion in on-chain economic activity. Sonic is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, combining unmatched speed and scalability with developer and institutional incentive models designed for mass adoption. Demeter said he has always believed blockchain would fundamentally reshape global markets, but that success now depends on building the right bridges between decentralized innovation and institutional frameworks. “Sonic’s technology is unmatched in speed and scalability, and our mission is to bring that performance directly into institutional finance and global markets,” he explained. He continued, “Our mission is not just adoption, it’s to make Sonic indispensable to the future of global finance. That means scaling our business development and partnership efforts with large, well-known U.S. and global entities, and supporting lighthouse applications through strategic partnerships that will serve as proof points for the entire industry. The world’s financial infrastructure is moving on-chain, and Sonic intends to be at the very center of that transition.” Under his leadership, Sonic will continue to expand its presence among institutional investors and builders alike, bridging global markets without losing sight of its decentralized roots. Michael Kong, who has guided Sonic Labs (and previously Fantom) to this stage, will continue serving on the Board of Directors and take on the role of Chief Information Officer, remaining actively involved in the company’s leadership. Michael has been central to the evolution of Fantom, now Sonic, since 2018, and will remain fully engaged in guiding and supporting Demeter as he leads the network into its next phase of growth. Kong noted that he has watched Demeter bridge public markets with blockchain for more than a decade and believes this is the right moment for his leadership. “Mitchell’s extensive network and trusted relationships across the blockchain ecosystem, traditional finance, and beyond will be critical in driving the partnerships and real-world applications that will take Sonic to the next level. Myself and the entire Sonic Board of Directors are fully committed to supporting him in achieving this vision.” About Mitchell Demeter Mitchell Demeter is widely recognized as a pioneer in the blockchain industry. He launched the world’s first Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver and co-founded Cointrader Exchange, one of Canada’s earliest digital currency trading platforms. Over the years, his work has been featured in Forbes, Time, Fast Company, Wired, Huffington Post, and other major outlets. As a serial entrepreneur and investor, Demeter has founded and scaled multiple ventures across industries, consistently demonstrating an ability to anticipate market shifts and deliver innovative solutions. As part of this transition, he will step back from his role as CEO of SonicStrategy and assume the position of Executive Chair, where he will continue to provide leadership on strategy and capital markets development.

Demeter, a pioneer in digital assets and seasoned entrepreneur, will lead Sonic Labs in its next phase of global growth, accelerating the adoption of Sonic as one of the world’s leading blockchains. His mandate includes expanding developer and ecosystem adoption worldwide, strengthening institutional relationships, and building bridges into U.S. and global capital markets as part of Sonic’s broader mission to redefine the future of finance. Since the launch of the Sonic network in December 2024, the organization has achieved many milestones, including having a proven mainnet that can confirm up to 400,000 transactions per second with confirmation times consistently under 1 second, coupled with successes such as the Coinbase listing for S, native issuance of USDC , integration of Chainlink’s CCIP , and many others. However, what’s missing are strong institutional connections in the U.S. and elsewhere backing the Sonic network and its ecosystem projects. This is a necessary component—coupled with great technology, business functions, and exchange listings—that will take Sonic to the next level. Under Demeter’s leadership, Sonic Labs will be assembling a strong executive team around him, bringing in proven operators with deep experience across both traditional finance and crypto to complement the foundation’s technology strengths. Sonic Labs is expanding its business development efforts in the United States and globally, actively recruiting and hiring leaders to deepen institutional relationships and build lasting partnerships with major U.S. and global investors and enterprises alike. This transition is coming at a pivotal moment. Industry leaders have forecast that within the next decade, as much as 10% of global GDP could be transacted on blockchain rails, representing over $10 trillion in on-chain economic activity. Sonic is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, combining unmatched speed and scalability with developer and institutional incentive models designed for mass adoption. Demeter said he has always believed blockchain would fundamentally reshape global markets, but that success now depends on building the right bridges between decentralized innovation and institutional frameworks. “Sonic’s technology is unmatched in speed and scalability, and our mission is to bring that performance directly into institutional finance and global markets,” he explained. He continued, “Our mission is not just adoption, it’s to make Sonic indispensable to the future of global finance. That means scaling our business development and partnership efforts with large, well-known U.S. and global entities, and supporting lighthouse applications through strategic partnerships that will serve as proof points for the entire industry. The world’s financial infrastructure is moving on-chain, and Sonic intends to be at the very center of that transition.” Under his leadership, Sonic will continue to expand its presence among institutional investors and builders alike, bridging global markets without losing sight of its decentralized roots. Michael Kong, who has guided Sonic Labs (and previously Fantom) to this stage, will continue serving on the Board of Directors and take on the role of Chief Information Officer, remaining actively involved in the company’s leadership. Michael has been central to the evolution of Fantom, now Sonic, since 2018, and will remain fully engaged in guiding and supporting Demeter as he leads the network into its next phase of growth. Kong noted that he has watched Demeter bridge public markets with blockchain for more than a decade and believes this is the right moment for his leadership. “Mitchell’s extensive network and trusted relationships across the blockchain ecosystem, traditional finance, and beyond will be critical in driving the partnerships and real-world applications that will take Sonic to the next level. Myself and the entire Sonic Board of Directors are fully committed to supporting him in achieving this vision.” About Mitchell Demeter Mitchell Demeter is widely recognized as a pioneer in the blockchain industry.

52412559,https://invezz.com/?p=2902156,1759112311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"At $0.035, analysts call an altcoin the best crypto to buy to hit $1 faster than DOGE",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/29/at-0-035-analysts-call-an-altcoin-the-best-crypto-to-buy-to-hit-1-faster-than-doge/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been viewed as the poster child of meme-driven rallies, but its growth has slowed considerably in recent years. While DOGE struggles to maintain momentum, analysts are pointing toward a new DeFi project that blends utility with strong tokenomics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at just $0.035 in presale Phase 6, is being highlighted as the altcoin with the fundamentals to reach $1 far sooner than DOGE. For those investing in crypto, this project introduces an ecosystem where dual lending, mtToken staking, and MUTM buybacks come together to fuel long-term value. Why MUTM’s utility puts it ahead of DOGE Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a meme token—it will be a Layer 2 DeFi protocol built with real financial mechanics designed for scalability. The platform introduces dual lending mechanics that combine peer-to-contract (P2C) pools for stablecoins and blue-chip crypto coins with peer-to-peer (P2P) pools for riskier assets like meme coins. This structure will allow users to earn predictable yields in P2C while exploring higher returns in P2P, creating balance in one ecosystem. The project is also preparing for its Beta launch at listing, which will let users experience the dashboard, lending systems, and mtToken staking functions firsthand. Mutuum’s dashboard is functional; it will display user holdings, track ROI in real time, and feature a Top 50 leaderboard that rewards major investors with bonus MUTM tokens. These design choices build long-term engagement and encourage participation, two aspects that DOGE has struggled to sustain. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further differentiates itself with stable interest rate borrowing. Initial rates will be locked to provide predictability, while rebalancing conditions will adjust over time for sustainability. Borrowers will operate under clear loan-to-value caps, collateralization rules, and liquidation penalties that feed back into the protocol’s treasury. This means predictable revenue flows will support platform growth and drive continuous token demand. Strong demand drivers to take MUTM to $1 The numbers behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are already compelling. Out of a total supply of 4 billion tokens, Phase 6 has raised $16.45 million, with 50% of its 170 million tokens already sold. The token is priced at $0.035 with over 16,650 holders participating. As presale phases progress, the price will rise, with the next step set at $0.04—a 15% increase. That creates an urgent opportunity for investors to enter at a discount before the price moves higher. Several factors are expected to propel MUTM’s valuation. The Beta launch will allow immediate user adoption and showcase lending and borrowing utilities from day one. Expected listings on top exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC, are anticipated, which will broaden access, improve liquidity, and expose the token to global audiences. The buy-and-distribute mechanism is another standout feature, with platform revenue directed toward open-market MUTM repurchases that are then redistributed to stakers. This cycle creates sustained buying pressure, reinforces holding incentives, and increases long-term demand. The presale has already proven highly rewarding for early participants. A Phase 1 investor who allocated $10,000 at $0.01 now holds $35,000 value at today’s Phase 6 valuation. By the next phase at $0.04, that same position will be valued at $40,000. Even investors entering at the current $0.035 stage are projected to see immediate gains as the presale progresses, showcasing how structured pricing supports consistent ROI. Security and transparency are central pillars of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a CertiK audit that included both manual review and static analysis, earning a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. Alongside this, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivizes white-hat testing and reinforces confidence in the platform’s readiness for launch. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just another presale. It’s a properly planned DeFi system that will beat speculative coins that don’t have any real worth. DOGE has relied on hype, while MUTM is getting ready to merge real-world mechanics with demand drivers that will help it reach $1. If you’re wondering why crypto is down today, this presale shows that the answer isn’t to sit out but to look for projects that are establishing long-lasting ecosystems. MUTM is being called the best cryptocurrency to buy right now since it has a lot of uses, a lot of people are interested in it, and its presale is picking up speed. This is a big change from DOGE’s slow growth.

A lot of people are now looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project that is meant to be useful in the real world and has a clear 700% upside for early investors. Some traders are asking why crypto is down today, but others know that downturns frequently lead to smarter rotations into businesses with stronger fundamentals. MUTM is the DeFi token to keep an eye on because it has two lending pools, a stablecoin structure, and Layer 2 integration that promises cheaper costs and faster transactions. This initiative is getting more and more interest from both retail and institutional investors who possess ADA and are looking for a new route. From ADA uncertainty to MUTM’s clear utility Unlike speculative crypto coins that depend heavily on community hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on mechanisms that will generate sustainable demand. Its dual lending structure will allow users to participate in Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for blue-chip assets like BTC, ETH, and stablecoins, while also enabling Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for meme tokens such as PEPE and DOGE. This flexibility will attract both conservative investors who value stability and risk-tolerant traders seeking higher yields. The platform will also introduce stablecoin issuance, providing users with a dollar-pegged asset that enhances both lending and borrowing efficiency. mtToken staking will reward users for securing liquidity, while the MUTM buyback system will redistribute revenue to strengthen token utility. Combined with Layer 2 technology, transactions will remain cost-efficient and scalable even as user activity increases. These features will be demonstrated in the Beta launch at listing, allowing early adopters to see the protocol’s full utility in action. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently drawing attention, with $16.45 million raised so far, 50% of its 170 million allocation already sold, and a price of $0.035. More than 16,650 holders are now part of this stage, signaling rising demand ahead of Phase 7. With the next price increase to $0.04—a 15% jump—the window for discounted entry is narrowing. For ADA traders who are shifting their strategies, the presale provides a timely opportunity to align with a project offering clearer growth prospects. Why MUTM is targeting a 700% run The projected 700% upside for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not based on speculation alone but supported by the protocol’s revenue model and demand drivers. A utilization-based interest system will dynamically adjust borrowing rates depending on liquidity, ensuring lenders remain incentivized and borrowers stay engaged. This flow of activity will grow the treasury, reinforcing the project’s long-term sustainability and supporting token demand. Deposit and borrow caps will also be applied to different asset classes, while restricted collateral mode will prevent correlated risk from destabilizing the system. These safeguards will encourage larger deposits and create higher confidence for participants, ensuring MUTM remains attractive for those investing in crypto with long-term goals. Expected listings on major exchanges such as KuCoin and Kraken will provide broad visibility and adoption. Increased access to trading pairs will drive retail inflows, while institutional interest will rise as the protocol proves its mechanics through the Beta launch and growing liquidity. With collateral and liquidation mechanics ensuring predictable revenue—through loan-to-value thresholds, liquidation penalties, and treasury allocations—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to generate ongoing demand independent of market hype. The investment examples highlight the strength of entering early. A Phase 1 investor who placed $10,000 at $0.01 now holds $35,000 at the current $0.035 presale price. A Phase 6 participant investing the same amount will see $11,500 value immediately after the Phase 7 price increase. This clear trajectory illustrates how retail participants can capture value at multiple presale stages while building confidence for the long-term run. Reinforcing this credibility is the CertiK audit, which delivered a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, paired with a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. These measures confirm that the protocol is taking security seriously while incentivizing independent oversight. For traders seeking safety alongside growth potential, this combination offers a rare balance. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing itself as the go-to project for ADA traders who are exiting stagnant positions and looking for more ambitious growth. With strong presale momentum, clear token mechanics, and a roadmap that includes Beta testing and top exchange listings, the project is uniquely positioned to deliver outsized returns. For those searching for the next DeFi gem, MUTM is more than an alternative—it is a structured opportunity for serious retail and institutional investors to capture a projected 700% run.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a standout, already showing 250% gains from its early presale phases and positioning itself as the top crypto to buy for 20x upside. This momentum is reinforced by MUTM’s advanced ecosystem, which combines dual lending pools, a stable interest rate model, and mtToken staking with open-market buyback incentives. In a market where crypto prices fluctuate and crypto predictions remain uncertain, MUTM provides a structured environment for crypto investment, balancing growth with risk management. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently priced at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. Phase 7 is expected to launch at $0.04, offering a 15% short-term gain and creating urgency for early acquisition. MUTM’s presale structure rewards early investors while maintaining demand, supporting projected upside through platform adoption, staking rewards, and buyback-driven supply reduction. ETH consolidates at $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) has entered a phase of consolidation around the $4,000 mark, trading in a relatively tight range as buyers and sellers wrestle for control. After slipping just below $4,000 in recent sessions, ETH has rebounded slightly but still lacks strong directional momentum. On-chain data suggests accumulation in cold wallets and continued inflows from institutional sources, but caution is warranted: if the $3,900 support fails, ETH may test lower levels such as $3,800 or $3,700. Meanwhile, ETF redemptions and broader market volatility are exerting pressure, making this consolidation zone an important battleground for the next leg. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): dual lending pools and stable interest rate model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate dual lending pools to cater to diverse investor strategies. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will accept stablecoins like USDC and DAI, as well as blue-chip cryptocurrencies such as ETH and BTC. These deposits will earn predictable yields through the stable interest rate model, which will include initial rate locks, higher starting rates, and rebalancing conditions to ensure liquidity remains healthy and borrowing costs remain consistent. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending pools will allow users to lend and borrow higher-risk, less-liquid assets such as meme coins, including SHIB and DOGE. These isolated pools will feature individually negotiated rates, offering higher returns for willing participants while protecting the core P2C liquidity. MUTM’s stable interest rate model is tailored to provide security for borrowers and lenders alike. Borrowers with volatile or less-liquid assets will benefit from predictable repayment schedules, while lenders will enjoy consistent accruals from deposits. Rate rebalancing will adjust periodically according to pool utilization, ensuring that liquidity is optimized for both borrowing and lending activities. Overcollateralization and liquidation thresholds will safeguard the system, with clear LTV caps and liquidation bonuses to protect the platform during market swings. Reserve factors and treasury allocations will further mitigate risk, giving confidence to both retail and institutional participants. Strategic growth Investors who participated in Phases 1–3, acquiring MUTM at $0.01–$0.02, will see their holdings grow substantially, while new participants in Phase 6 will have an immediate opportunity for upside appreciation post-next-phase launch. A $10,000 Phase 1 investment will project $50,000 in value through price progression and staking rewards, while a $10,000 Phase 6 investment will project $11,500 post Phase 7. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement enhanced collateral efficiency with restricted collateralization modes, deposit and borrowing caps, and correlated asset exposure controls. These features provide confidence to institutional participants while maintaining robust safeguards for retail investors. Price discovery and liquidity management will rely on Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds, aggregated market data, and DEX TWAPs, ensuring accurate valuations and efficient lending across both P2C and P2P pools. Roadmap, security, and incentives The MUTM roadmap is structured to build confidence in investors and strengthen adoption. Phase 2 will focus on smart contract development and front/back-end integration, Phase 3 will introduce beta testing and exchange listing preparations, and Phase 4 will deliver the live platform with Layer-2 scaling, staking, and buybacks. Multi-chain expansion will ensure wider adoption and efficient capital deployment. Security remains a priority with a CertiK audit scoring 90 for Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, alongside a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program. MUTM will also conduct a $100,000 ongoing giveaway , with ten winners receiving $10,000 in MUTM tokens each, further driving community engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great option for traders who want to avoid ETH consolidation and want to make structured crypto investments. MUTM offers a mix of risk-managed growth and presale upside through multiple lending pools, a steady interest rate strategy, overcollateralization safeguards, and open-market buybacks. Phase 6 is now half sold, and Phase 7 is expected to see a 15% price spike, which makes it hard to get in at a discount. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to be the best cryptocurrency to buy since it has a clear plan, excellent mechanics, and benefits for early buyers.

With 50% of Phase 6 already sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the standout DeFi project that combines real utility with promising upside. Unlike many projects chasing hype, MUTM operates dual lending pools that cater to both peer-to-contract (P2C) assets like stablecoins, ETH, and BTC, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for high-risk, high-reward tokens such as SHIB and PEPE. This strategic design is positioning MUTM as a crypto coin primed to achieve $1 by 2026, making it one of the most attractive options for investors looking at crypto predictions and crypto charts for next-generation returns. Phase 6 presale momentum and urgency Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has already raised $16.45 million, with half of the 170 million allocated tokens sold. The current price stands at $0.035, and the presale now includes more than 16,650 holders. The next phase will see the price increase to $0.04, representing a 15% gain, making this the last opportunity for investors to acquire discounted MUTM before the price rise. Layer 2 integration ensures that transactions on the MUTM platform will be faster and more cost-effective than traditional Layer 1 networks, attracting both retail and institutional participants. A Beta launch is planned prior to full listing, giving early adopters hands-on experience with the lending pools, stablecoin issuance, and staking mechanisms. Users will also be able to track their holdings and ROI through a sophisticated dashboard, while the Top 50 leaderboard will reward the most active and committed investors with bonus MUTM tokens, fostering community engagement and long-term participation. Road to $1 Several factors are expected to drive demand and support upward momentum. The Beta launch will provide users with early access to MUTM’s full platform functionality, giving them the chance to experience dual lending, stablecoin minting, and mtToken staking firsthand. This engagement will not only increase platform adoption but also create tangible demand for MUTM tokens. Anticipated listings on top-tier exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, will further expand visibility and liquidity, attracting a broader base of investors and traders looking to diversify their holdings with reliable crypto coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a buy-and-distribute model whereby a portion of platform revenue is used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the market, with rewards distributed to mtToken stakers. This mechanism will encourage long-term participation, stabilize token demand, and generate consistent activity across the platform. The structured staking and reward system creates predictable utility, ensuring that the presale interest converts into sustainable adoption and trading volume. Risk management is another pillar of MUTM’s design. Loans will be overcollateralized with calibrated loan-to-value ratios, and liquidation triggers will be closely monitored to safeguard the protocol. Penalties from liquidations feed into the treasury and support the reserve factor, creating a stable, self-reinforcing ecosystem. The restricted-collateral mode allows the platform to minimise systemic risk while maintaining flexibility for borrowers, ensuring investor confidence remains high as adoption scales. Early investment benefit Early investors are already seeing substantial gains. A Phase 1 participant who invested $10,000 is now seeing a valuation of $35,000, and this amount is projected to rise to $40,000 on paper in the next presale phase as the price adjusts to $0.04. These clear and structured investment outcomes highlight why MUTM is becoming a favorite among traders and investors analyzing crypto prices and future projections. Security and transparency are also central to the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit, including manual review and static analysis, and maintains a 50,000 USDT bug bounty to incentivize white-hat reporting and continuous improvement. This ensures that participants can invest with confidence, knowing the protocol prioritizes safety and reliability in a volatile market. MUTM has presale momentum, Layer 2 efficiency, dual lending mechanisms, Beta involvement, and structured demand drivers. Half of Phase 6 has already been sold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great investment opportunity for anybody looking for a DeFi project that has genuine value and a lot of potential. Like the other prudent early joiners, it is better to acquire tokens now before it gets close to its $1 target in 2026. MUTM is on track to be one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the next several years because it combines excellent foundations, new technology, and clear incentive systems.

Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain strong options due to their established networks, yet analysts suggest a new DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , could outperform both in returns. MUTM’s unique combination of dual lending mechanics, Layer 2 efficiency, and presale momentum positions it as a high-utility token capable of delivering exceptional ROI. Observers tracking crypto predictions, crypto charts, and crypto prices will find MUTM a compelling choice for both short-term gains and long-term growth. Phase 6 of MUTM’s presale has raised $16.45 million, with 50% of 170 million tokens sold at $0.035 and over 16,650 holders participating. The next phase is priced at $0.04, reflecting a 15% increase, creating urgency for early acquisition. A $100,000 giveaway will further engage the community, offering 10 winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens, amplifying awareness and adoption. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate as a foundational blockchain for smart contracts. Current crypto prices reflect steady performance, supported by network adoption and developer activity. Despite this, ETH’s large market capitalization limits its short-term ROI potential, making it more suitable for investors prioritizing stability and long-term portfolio growth rather than rapid gains. Historical crypto charts indicate consistent appreciation, yet ETH lacks mechanisms to deliver explosive returns compared to emerging DeFi ecosystems. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL), on the other hand, has been lauded for its speed and low transaction costs, attracting decentralized applications and NFT projects. Recent market movements highlight resistance levels and adoption challenges, with slower-than-expected scaling slightly dampening investor enthusiasm. SOL provides a balance of growth and utility but remains constrained by network-specific limitations and volatility, resulting in an ROI slower than high-utility DeFi platforms targeting real user demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a next-generation DeFi solution with dual lending mechanics that cater to both bluechip assets and high-volatility tokens. P2C lending allows users to leverage bluechip collateral such as BTC, ETH, and stablecoins. For example, 2 BTC can be used to borrow $100,000 USDC at 75% LTV, or 5 ETH can generate 3.75 ETH in stablecoins. P2P lending supports meme coins like PEPE and FLOKI, with interest rates negotiated to reward risk-tolerant investors. Layer 2 integration ensures faster, lower-cost transactions, boosting platform adoption and liquidity. MUTM offers a user-friendly dashboard to track ROI, and the Top 50 leaderboard will reward the most active investors with bonus tokens, encouraging long-term engagement and repeated participation. The upcoming Beta launch will provide early users with hands-on access to platform functionality, demonstrating practical utility that will drive demand and adoption. The demand for MUTM is supported by several structural drivers. Beta access allows users to experience real utility, which will increase adoption and trading volume. Expected listings on top exchanges, including KuCoin and Kraken, will expand liquidity and market visibility, contributing to price growth. The buy-and-distribute mechanism repurchases MUTM from the market to reward stakers, ensuring consistent buy pressure and incentivizing long-term holding. Stable interest rates combined with enhanced collateral efficiency will attract sophisticated users, driving borrowing volume, accumulating reserves, and reinforcing MUTM’s token value. Final words Investment examples highlight the token’s potential. An investor who swapped $12,000 from SOL and ETH into MUTM during early phases now sees holdings valued at $42,000 in Phase 6. Expected listing at $0.06, this investment is projected to reach $72,000 on paper, supported by Beta adoption, Layer 2 cost efficiency, and the platform’s structured utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a better choice for ROI than ETH and SOL. Ethereum (ETH) is stable, and Solana (SOL) grows slowly. MUTM, on the other hand, combines dual lending, Layer 2 efficiency, structured staking rewards, and presale FOMO to make a token that people really want and that has real uses. Investors who look at crypto predictions and charts will see that MUTM is a presale jewel that can give them huge returns and be used for a long time.

Crypto prices today show a clear slowdown in ETH momentum, prompting retail and institutional participants to wonder why crypto is down. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a standout DeFi project, offering a dual lending system and mtToken staking, with structured mechanics that project 20x upside from its presale price. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently priced at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. Phase 7 is projected at $0.04, offering a 15% short-term upside. Early presale investors from Phase 1, who acquired tokens at $0.01, have already seen a substantial projected return. A $10,000 investment in Phase 1 will translate into $35,000 in current Phase 6 value, while a $10,000 purchase now will project $11,500 post next phase on paper, delivering immediate growth and long-term potential. ETH run over? Some analysts are now warning that ETH’s rally run might be over for this season, pointing to signs of weakening momentum and rising downside risks. Ethereum (ETH) recently dropped below the $4,000 mark, with trading volume spiking and over $1.2 billion in crypto liquidations observed in a short span — a signal of heavy selling pressure. At the same time, open interest has fallen sharply, indicating many leveraged long positions have been closed out. Citi analysts have also revised their forecasts downward, projecting ETH could fall to ~$3,300 by year-end. Together, these technical and sentiment indicators fuel the argument that Ethereum (ETH)’s upward leg has likely paused — at least until broader market conditions improve. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending and stable interest model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate dual lending pools to serve a wide spectrum of investors. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will allow users to lend stablecoins or major cryptocurrencies like USDT, ETH, and LINK into audited liquidity contracts, earning interest on deposits. A typical example will see a $12,000 USDT deposit converted to mtUSDT, generating a projected 15% APY. Borrowing within P2C will remain secured with overcollateralization; for instance, $9,000 USDC can be borrowed against $12,000 ETH at a safe 75% LTV, ensuring system solvency and pool protection. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will handle riskier assets, including memecoins like PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE, within isolated pools. Rates will be negotiated individually, allowing lenders to earn higher returns without impacting P2C liquidity. Across both pools, the platform will implement overcollateralization, LTV caps, liquidation triggers, and a reserve factor ranging from 10% to 50% based on asset volatility, safeguarding investors’ capital even during volatile market conditions. MUTM will use a Stable Interest Rate Model for borrowers, featuring initial rate locks, higher starting rates, and rebalancing conditions. Stable assets will enjoy predictable borrowing costs, while volatile assets will be subject to dynamic adjustments to maintain solvency and incentivize timely repayments. This interest framework will provide transparency and security for both lenders and borrowers, ensuring the platform remains robust during periods of market stress or sudden crypto crash events. Liquidity management Price discovery and liquidity management at MUTM will leverage Chainlink oracles for USD and native asset pricing, with fallback feeds, aggregated data, and DEX TWAPs to maintain accurate valuations. Borrow rates will adjust according to pool utilization: lower rates will encourage borrowing when liquidity is abundant, and higher rates will attract deposits when capital is scarce. This system ensures efficient, liquid borrowing and lending while stabilizing the platform against sudden market movements. mtToken staking will allow users to earn MUTM rewards from platform revenue. Open-market buybacks will simultaneously handle circulating supply and create natural demand, amplifying investor incentives. The roadmap spans Phases 2–4, covering smart contract deployment, beta testing, exchange listing preparation, and live platform launch with Layer-2 integration for faster and cheaper transactions. Security, credibility, and FOMO opportunity MUTM’s presale will be backed by a CertiK audit, scoring 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, alongside a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program. A $100,000 giveaway , divided into ten $10,000 MUTM prizes, will further engage the community. MUTM is a solid alternative to ETH that will interest investors. It has a dual lending structure, overcollateralization, a stable interest rate model, and a price discovery framework that all work together to give you a lot of upside and security. There won’t be many chances to get reduced tokens because Phase 6 is nearly 50% sold and Phase 7 will cost 15% more. MUTM is a DeFi solution that mixes growth potential with structured risk management. This makes it one of the most appealing crypto projects for investors who want to move their money from ETH to assets with more potential.

The crypto fear and greed index has shown a shift toward caution, and crypto charts indicate subdued momentum in traditional blue-chip tokens. Traders questioning why crypto is down are now turning their attention to promising alternatives with tangible utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a DeFi protocol that offers structured growth, and early participants have already witnessed a 3.5× value gain on paper from Phase 1 to Phase 6. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale will offer tokens at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. The platform hosted over 16,650 holders this phase. This underdog altcoin combines real-world use cases with a growing community, positioning itself as a strong candidate to outperform BTC and ETH in ROI over the next few years. BTC & ETH hard to 100X Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are unlikely to be 100x from current levels due to simple market math and economic constraints. BTC already has a market cap above $1 trillion and ETH around $400–500 billion; multiplying these by 100 would require valuations of $100 trillion and $40–50 trillion, respectively—figures that rival or surpass the entire global GDP of roughly $110 trillion. Such growth would demand tens of trillions in fresh capital inflows, which is highly unrealistic given competition with traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. Moreover, both BTC and ETH have reached widespread adoption, with Bitcoin (BTC) established as a store of value and Ethereum (ETH) powering most DeFi and smart contracts, meaning their early-stage exponential growth is gone and future gains will be more gradual, like large-cap tech stocks. Smaller altcoins with lower market caps offer more realistic 100x potential, but BTC and ETH cannot scale that way again. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): dual lending mechanics and stablecoin innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will leverage two primary lending mechanisms. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending will focus on blue-chip tokens such as USDT and LINK, providing stable returns with interest rates that adjust based on pool utilization. For example, when capital is abundant, rates will remain low to encourage borrowing, whereas higher utilization will increase rates to attract deposits and incentivize repayments. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will accommodate higher-risk or less-liquid tokens, including memecoins like PEPE and DOGE, with individually negotiated rates. These P2P pools will remain isolated to protect the core liquidity of P2C lenders, ensuring that riskier trades do not compromise systemic stability. An innovative feature of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be its decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1. This stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against approved collateral, and burned upon repayment or liquidation. Interest rates will be dynamically governed by the platform to maintain the peg, while arbitrage opportunities will ensure that the token remains stable under market pressure. Price discovery and liquidity management will also be key drivers of MUTM’s growth. Chainlink oracles will provide reliable USD and native-asset pricing, supported by fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and on-chain DEX metrics for accurate valuation. Utilization-based interest rates will ensure safe borrowing while protecting liquidity. Low rates will attract borrowers when pools are underutilized, while higher rates will encourage repayments and deposits when liquidity is scarce, stabilizing the system and maintaining healthy pool balances. mtToken ecosystem CertiK audits will ensure security, with a Token Scan score of 90 and Skynet score of 79. A 50,000 USDT bug bounty will reward participants across four tiers: Critical ($2,000), Major ($1,000), Medium ($500), and Low ($200). Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway will select ten winners to receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.040, a 15% jump that will reward presale participants who act early. The mtToken staking mechanism will provide additional incentives. Users will stake their mtTokens to earn MUTM rewards, while a buy-and-distribute system will use platform revenue to repurchase MUTM from the open market, increasing demand and prices.. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will follow a clear roadmap. Phase 1 executed the initial presale, Phase 2 will focus on building core smart contracts and front/back-end infrastructure, Phase 3 will launch a beta for early user interaction and testing, and Phase 4 will include the full live platform with multi-chain support and advanced DeFi features. The beta launch will allow investors to experience all the offered features besides the already live dashboard, track ROI, and climb the Top-50 leaderboard, earning bonus MUTM tokens for top rankings. Conclusion By Phase 6, an investor who traded $5,000 ETH for MUTM in Phase 1 will have already made a 3.5× return on their investment. The protocol will offer a lot of upside for early adopters, with a predicted listing price of $0.06 and a long-term goal of $1. This is because of beta adoption, Layer-2 speed improvements, and visibility on key exchanges. More than half of Phase 6 has been sold, and the following phase will cost $0.040, which means that the last chance to get in at a lower price is coming up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer structured lending, new stablecoin mechanisms, and a strong presale momentum, making it the best option for investors who want to make a lot of money without investing in BTC or ETH.

With the crypto fear and greed index swinging toward fear and crypto charts indicating increased volatility, traders are analyzing why crypto is down and actively seeking safe entry points. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a standout solution, offering decentralized finance features designed to protect users while delivering meaningful returns. With Phase 6 of the presale already 50% sold at $0.035, the token is positioned for a 15% jump to $0.040 in Phase 7, creating an ideal window for investors looking to secure early-stage assets. BTC price status Bitcoin (BTC) recently slipped beneath the $112,000 threshold and is now at around $109K, triggering concern among traders as a wave of liquidations and weak support levels exacerbated the decline. As prices fell, the share of Bitcoin (BTC) held “in loss” more than doubled, signaling mounting stress in the market. Technically, BTC failed to hold above pivot zones near $110,000–$119,000, and some analysts now view a retest of the $110,000 level as likely. The broader macro backdrop—especially hawkish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve and a strengthening dollar—has added pressure to risk assets like Bitcoin (BTC). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): robust collateral and lending structure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement a Stability Factor to assess the security of collateral across all loans. Overcollateralization will remain a cornerstone, ensuring that both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans are fully protected against market swings. Automatic liquidations will trigger when collateral falls below thresholds, and liquidators will repurchase undercollateralized positions at discounted rates, reinforcing liquidity and minimizing systemic risk. For lower-volatility assets such as stablecoins or major tokens like ETH, LTVs can reach 75% with an 80% liquidation threshold, while volatile tokens, including DOGE and TRUMP, will remain capped at 35–50% LTV with 65% thresholds. Reserve factors will adjust dynamically between 10% and 50% according to asset risk. The P2C lending feature will allow a participant to lend $12,000 SOL and receive mtSOL, earning a 14% APY. Borrowers can leverage $12,000 ETH as collateral to secure $9,000 USDT while staying within a 75% LTV, ensuring both solvency and protection for lenders. P2P lending pools will accommodate higher-risk tokens such as PEPE with negotiated APYs, isolated from P2C lending, ensuring that the broader liquidity pools remain secure while offering high-yield opportunities to risk-tolerant investors. Market volatility and liquidity management will be actively maintained. Caps, liquidation incentives, and reserve factors will ensure that the protocol can handle market swings without compromising solvency. By maintaining structured thresholds and risk-adjusted LTVs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide participants with confidence that lending and borrowing operations remain safe even in turbulent conditions. Early investor advantage The presale stage is a major catalyst for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demand. Phase 6 currently offers tokens at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and over 16,650 holders participating. With half of the Phase 6 supply already sold, early investors will benefit from the imminent Phase 7 price increase to $0.040. The platform will launch a beta version at the time of token listing, giving participants early access to the offered features like dual lending and staking. Dashboard is already live, allowing them to monitor holdings, calculate ROI, and engage with the Top-50 leaderboard that rewards significant investors with bonus MUTM tokens. Security is emphasized through a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. Additionally, the project will implement a 50,000 USDT bug bounty across multiple severity tiers, along with a $100,000 ongoing giveaway where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Layer-2 integration will reduce transaction costs and improve processing speeds, enhancing the platform’s usability and attracting additional users. Investment examples highlight the potential of early participation. An investor exchanging $7,500 BTC into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 will witness their position grow through Phase 6 pricing, while the projected listing and broader adoption will set the stage for multi-year price targets reaching $3. The combination of presale momentum, Layer-2 efficiency, and structured collateral safeguards ensures that MUTM will be a leading option for investors seeking a secure and profitable entry into DeFi. Conclusion As BTC’s popularity fades and people look for safer options, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will create a structured, high-demand space for lending, borrowing, and staking. With Phase 7 coming up and more than half of the existing supply sold, the platform will give investors a rare chance to get into a strong DeFi ecosystem before the industry as a whole changes. Collateral safety, automatic liquidations, and multi-layered risk management will keep participants secure and set MUTM up for big growth.

With its presale price fixed at just $0.035, many in the crypto investing world see this as the type of asymmetric opportunity that rarely comes around. At a time when crypto prices today show volatility and some ask why is crypto down, MUTM is positioning itself with innovations that appeal to both retail and institutional investors. The dual lending system that redefines DeFi The presale is already attracting heavy interest. Phase 6 has brought in more than $16.5 million, with over 16,650 holders joining the project. Half of the 170 million tokens allocated for this stage are already sold. At $0.035 per token, this price marks the final discounted entry before the increase to $0.040 in Phase 7. Investors looking for exposure understand that presale positioning can be decisive, especially with analysts forecasting such dramatic growth. Buying now locks in access before the cost rises and before MUTM enters wider markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a design that blends two lending models into one ecosystem. The Peer-to-Contract system is dedicated to stablecoins and blue-chip assets such as ETH and BTC, giving users safer yields and deep liquidity. Alongside this, the Peer-to-Peer framework unlocks higher-return possibilities for lenders willing to engage with riskier tokens like meme coins. By keeping risk isolated in the P2P setup while maintaining stability through P2C pools, the project opens doors for broader participation across market segments. This dual-lending structure stands out as a balanced yet ambitious solution in decentralized finance. Why analysts project 120x growth by 2026 The growth trajectory for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is anchored by its structural revenue model and efficiency enhancements. Every liquidation penalty will flow directly into the treasury, building sustainable reserves that back the system. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency lets users extract more value from their deposits, amplifying borrowing activity while maximizing the capital utility of stable pairs. The utilization-based interest model ensures that as demand for borrowing increases, lenders are rewarded with higher yields, creating an ever-adapting balance that keeps liquidity deep and attractive. Together, these features form the foundation for a robust ecosystem that compounds demand for the token itself. Several upcoming milestones highlight why analysts are confident in the projected upside. The beta launch at the time of token listing will allow users to immediately interact with the core features of lending and borrowing. A Layer-2 integration is planned to cut costs and deliver faster transaction speeds, addressing one of the most persistent challenges in DeFi. The development of a decentralized stablecoin pegged at $1 will drive daily usage on the platform and expand real utility for users. On top of this, listings on Tier-1 exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase are expected to give the project global visibility and liquidity. Each of these milestones represents a direct pathway for accelerating both adoption and token value. Why MUTM stands out in today’s market With crypto investing often dominated by established names that already carry large valuations, finding the next undervalued project is the challenge. Unlike other projects that have already matured, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at a stage where investor entry is still early. This combination of strong presale traction, innovative mechanics, and clear growth catalysts sets it apart as one of the most compelling stories in digital assets. At $0.035, analysts see the token as a bargain price compared to the upside projections. For investors scanning crypto prices today, MUTM appears less as a speculative gamble and more as a calculated opportunity with a powerful design behind it. Analysts say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the cheapest cryptocurrency of the current cycle and that it could recover 120X its value by 2026. The coin combines new ideas with ease of use at a price that works for both small and large investors. With presale momentum already developing and several factors coming up, this is a good time to buy. As the rest of the market keeps asking why crypto is down, MUTM serves as a powerful reminder that there are still chances for those who see them early. At $0.035, it is not only a presale admission but also a smart way to get a piece of one of the most exciting launches in decentralized finance.

To commemorate the update, Alt.town has launched the “ValueFi Deposit Event.” With this update, $TOWN can now be freely swapped into KEY, the core point of Alt.town. KEY is used for DNA (creator token) trading and content payments, transforming $TOWN from a mere trading asset into a structurally significant utility token tied directly to platform demand. The newly launched deposit event allows users who swap $TOWN into KEY and hold their KEY on the platform to receive MILE point rewards as interest. While holding, KEY remains fully tradable and usable within the platform, with rewards maintained as long as it is not withdrawn. The total reward pool is set at approximately $10,000, designed to encourage stable holding behavior that supports long-term value growth and ecosystem stability. This update follows the August 26th listing of $TOWN on Binance Alpha, Bitget, Gate.io , and MEXC, which marked a significant milestone in Alt.town’s global expansion. Unlike many Web3 projects that focus primarily on short-term liquidity, Alt.town emphasizes a ValueFi model centered on real utility and user participation, rapidly expanding a use-case driven ecosystem for both fans and creators. Alt.town was developed by a team led by a former CTO of SM Entertainment, together with experts in content and blockchain. The platform pursues a “ValueFi” ecosystem where fans and creators grow together. At its core is the DNA tokenization system, which transforms creator IP into tradable tokens while reflecting fan engagement and creator activity in real time on-chain. Eugene, CEO of bitBLUE, commented: “This update marks a key turning point in building a real utility foundation for $TOWN.

Crypto exchange Uphold has released its weekly XRP report, covering whale behavior, Ripple’s latest moves in cross-border payments, shifts in market sentiment, and key price levels. With volatility shaping market psychology, the latest data provides a snapshot of where XRP stands as it approaches a critical price threshold. Here’s your #XRP Report for the week: Whales Accumulate Despite Volatility On-chain data shows large holders adding to their positions during dips. Analysts suggest whale accumulation could provide a base for the next rally. Ripple Expands Partnerships Ripple… pic.twitter.com/QnrqvJKL5U — Uphold (@UpholdInc) September 27, 2025 Whale Accumulation During Market Dips According to Uphold’s report , large XRP holders have continued to increase their positions despite recent volatility. On-chain data indicates that whales are taking advantage of market dips to accumulate more XRP. Analysts interpret this activity as potentially laying the groundwork for future price stability, suggesting that large-scale accumulation often provides a stronger base for upward movement. While short-term traders remain cautious, the buying activity among major holders underscores confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. Ripple’s Expanding Partnerships Another key highlight in the update is Ripple’s announcement of new integrations with important cross-border payment providers. These partnerships continue to strengthen the role of XRP in global settlement systems . By extending its network, Ripple is positioning XRP as a functional tool within the international payment infrastructure. These steps emphasize the ongoing development of XRP’s practical utility, which some analysts argue is more significant than short-term price fluctuations. Market Sentiment and Fear Index Uphold also pointed out that market sentiment has shifted into the “fear” zone, as measured by major indicators. Traders remain divided, with some anticipating further downside risk while others interpret the correction as a typical “buy the dip” scenario. Despite the caution reflected in sentiment indexes, whale accumulation and Ripple’s business advancements suggest that optimism remains within certain segments of the market. Key Price Levels and Technical Outlook At the time of Uphold’s report, XRP was trading at $2.74 within a weekly range of $2.68 to $2.89. The report identifies $2.70 as an important support level, cautioning that a break below this zone could lead to a retest of $2.60. On the upside, $2.90 is the resistance, and breaching this level could open the path back to $3 and beyond. Overall sentiment is described as mixed, balancing whale accumulation and Ripple’s progress against broader market caution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Perspectives Reactions from the XRP community offer contrasting interpretations of the report. One user, identified as JO, expressed optimism, stating that a $3 breakout appears inevitable and that fear will not prevent upward momentum. Another commentator, Contrarian DNA, took a longer-term view, suggesting that weekly movements are less relevant than the broader vision for XRP. They argued that whales are not accumulating for minor breakouts but for XRP’s potential role as a settlement layer in the future financial system. In this perspective, Ripple’s partnerships represent steady progress toward global adoption rather than isolated announcements. With XRP consolidating near the $2.70–$2.90 range, market attention is focused on whether the token can reclaim the $3 mark in the short term. Whale accumulation and Ripple’s continued partnerships provide underlying support, while sentiment indicators reflect caution among traders. The balance between long-term adoption narratives and immediate market psychology will likely determine XRP’s next move.

ETH is now consolidating and might aim for more gains if it clears the $4,170 resistance. Ethereum remained stable above $3,820 and started a recovery wave. The price is trading above $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $4,170 and $4,200. Ethereum Price Recovers Ethereum price remained supported above the $3,820 level and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to recover above the $3,880 and $4,000 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,275 swing high to the $3,826 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,150 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,170 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,275 swing high to the $3,826 low. The first major resistance is near the $4,200 level. A clear move above the $4,200 resistance might send the price toward the $4,250 resistance. An upside break above the $4,250 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,320 resistance zone or even $4,350 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,200 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,050 level. The first major support sits near the $4,000 zone. A clear move below the $4,000 support might push the price toward the $3,920 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,880 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

52414157,https://invezz.com/?p=2902445,1759115518,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Market pullback could open doors for these 3 cryptos: MUTM, SOL, ETH",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/29/market-pullback-could-open-doors-for-these-3-cryptos-mutm-sol-eth/,"The recent crypto crash has reminded investors that downturns often bring opportunities. Market pullbacks reset inflated valuations and open the door to projects with real growth engines. For those investing in crypto with an eye on long-term adoption, this is the moment to look beyond surface-level hype and into platforms that are building future-ready infrastructure. Among the names gaining attention are Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH), each offering distinct advantages at today’s crypto prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): utility-first lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining how lending works in the decentralized world. Its dual model of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending allows users to interact with major assets like USDC and ETH through efficient smart contracts, while also enabling lending in tokens such as DOGE and FLOKI through P2P agreements. This dual approach builds both stability and flexibility into the ecosystem. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $16.5 million at a token price of $0.035, with more than 16,650 holders and over half of the allocation sold. The beta launch has given early participants the ability to explore platform features before the full release, signaling that development is matching pace with presale traction. Features like its interactive dashboard, Top 50 leaderboard, and Layer-2 integration strengthen user engagement and network efficiency. Growth for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being anchored by mechanisms that drive long-term demand. Its stablecoin system, coupled with buyback mechanics, ensures ongoing participation while strengthening token value. A $100,000 giveaway program rewards early adopters, while a 50,000 USDT bug bounty secured through CertiK highlights the project’s commitment to security and transparency. As expected, exchange listings on platforms like Binance and KuCoin move closer; the stage is set for significant exposure. Investors from Phase 1 already secured a 3.5X value gain at current pricing, and post-listing projections aim at 12x returns. These numbers underscore why many see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the strongest presale opportunity available during this market pullback. Solana (SOL): speed and momentum Solana (SOL) continues to be recognized for its impressive transaction speed and ability to process high-volume activity at low costs. Over the past cycles, this performance positioned it as a top-tier blockchain and attracted a growing ecosystem of developers. However, despite these strengths, Solana (SOL)’s growth story is beginning to face challenges from newer projects with broader utility layers, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Investors who benefited from earlier price rallies in Solana (SOL) are now exploring diversification opportunities, and the current crypto crash makes this an opportune time to rebalance with tokens offering stronger upside at entry-level prices. Ethereum (ETH): resilient yet slower growth Ethereum (ETH) remains the most established smart contract platform in the market. Its ecosystem supports thousands of decentralized applications and continues to grow with upgrades that improve scalability. As the foundational blockchain for decentralized finance, it carries immense credibility and resilience even during pullbacks. However, Ethereum (ETH)’s growth curve is steadier compared to emerging projects, making it a safer but slower option for those investing in crypto today. While ETH is a long-term hold for stability, its room for explosive returns is narrower compared to what presale tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are currently offering. The bottom line When the market pulls back, it’s the perfect time to find assets that are worth less than they are. Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) are both good candidates for any diversified crypto portfolio, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because it has a unique mix of usefulness, quick acceptance through its presale, and a clear plan for listings and feature rollouts. Investors are looking at startups that have working models and strong incentives for adoption because crypto values are falling. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that is well-positioned to lead the next recovery phase since it includes new lending mechanics, solid security standards, and activities that are good for investors.

52414159,https://invezz.com/?p=2902494,1759115676,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"ETH down 4%, so whales wonder what’s the best crypto to invest for early ETH like gains",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/29/eth-down-4-so-whales-wonder-whats-the-best-crypto-to-invest-for-early-eth-like-gains/,"Ethereum (ETH)’s recent 4% weekly dip has caught the attention of whale investors looking for the next big crypto with ETH-style upside. Early ETH investors saw monumental gains when the token was still trading below $1, and today’s market presents an opportunity for whales to seek similar high-utility projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a platform positioned to deliver comparable returns, combining decentralized finance, dual lending pools, and innovative stablecoin mechanics. With its presale momentum and upcoming beta launch, MUTM offers a structured path for both yield-focused and growth-oriented investors. ETH down 4% weekly Ethereum (ETH) fell about 4% over the past week, and this mark has reached up to 10% now, underscoring rising pressure and weakening momentum in the altcoin space. The slide comes amid broad crypto market volatility and macro uncertainty, with many investors liquidating leveraged positions and rotating out of risk assets. ETH also dipped below the $4,000 mark (now around that level)—an important technical level—adding to bearish sentiment. Over the same period, spot ETF outflows have intensified, contributing to downward pressure on price. Unless ETH can reclaim support quickly, the risk of further losses toward deeper support zones remains elevated. Presale snapshot and lending mechanics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in its Phase 6 presale, raising around $16.50 million with over 16,650 holders securing their tokens. The current price sits at $0.035, and half of the 170 million token supply for this phase is already claimed. Phase 7 is set at $0.04, reflecting a 15% increase, creating a strong incentive for early buyers. The platform has undergone a CertiK audit, achieving a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00, reinforcing its credibility. With a growing social presence of 12,000+ Twitter followers, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 ongoing giveaway for ten winners, MUTM demonstrates both transparency and community engagement. The P2C lending model offers whales a chance to generate predictable yields while retaining their core assets. For example, a whale depositing $50,000 worth of BTC receives mtBTC tokens representing their pool share. With an average APY of 12%, that investor earns $6,000 annually without selling any BTC. These mtBTC tokens can also be staked or used as collateral to borrow other assets, providing flexible financial leverage while keeping exposure to BTC intact. Stablecoin pools like USDT and USDC serve as a foundation for long-term liquidity, making MUTM a reliable option for sustained yield generation. Borrowers also benefit from leveraging high-quality crypto. A trader pledging $2,000 in SOL can borrow $1,300 in USDT at a 65% LTV, enabling them to reinvest in other opportunities while preserving SOL exposure. This approach combines capital efficiency with risk management, highlighting MUTM’s structured lending environment. P2P lending caters to more speculative assets like SHIB and PEPE. While riskier, these pools allow lenders to earn higher yields by isolating volatility from the main lending pools. This separation ensures that P2C liquidity remains stable while offering users the chance to participate in higher-reward opportunities, balancing risk and reward across the platform. Collateral and liquidation policies are carefully designed to maintain solvency. Stable assets like BTC and ETH enjoy higher LTVs of 70–75%, while more volatile coins such as DOGE have restricted LTVs around 40%. Liquidation triggers and the platform’s stability factor safeguard the protocol, ensuring lenders and borrowers remain protected against market swings. Future catalysts and ETH-like growth Investors in Phase 1 who allocated $10,000 when MUTM traded at $0.01 now see their holdings valued at $35,000 at Phase 6’s $0.035 price. With the official listing projected at $0.06, that investment will rise to $60,000, and the platform’s $1 per token target by 2026 translates to a $1 million valuation. For Phase 6 investors purchasing at $0.035, the expected upside is around 28X, demonstrating a compressed ETH-style growth curve. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to interact with the dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard, enabling investors to monitor their holdings, calculate ROI, and compete for bonus tokens. This access experience is expected to drive engagement and broaden the user base, pushing MUTM demand higher. Layer-2 integration will enhance transaction efficiency, drastically lowering costs compared to Layer-1 networks and allowing high-frequency lending and borrowing with minimal friction. Combined with stablecoin pools and mtToken mechanics, this setup ensures that MUTM will maintain robust utility, offering both liquidity and real-world use cases. Expected listings on major exchanges like KuCoin and Kraken will make the token more visible and available to more people. The adoption rate is expected to speed up as more people use the platform’s lending and borrowing features. This will lead to higher demand for tokens and make MUTM one of the best presale opportunities of 2025. MUTM offers controlled growth with measured returns for investors who want to know if crypto is a smart investment in today’s volatile market. While the news is full with stories about the crypto crash and other crypto predictions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming the presale project that strikes the right combination between security, utility, and price upside.

The poll, which was conducted between August 22 and September 11, 2025, gathered responses from 2,549 participants. It found that while a majority lean positive, a significant minority remains wary of how Wall Street and traditional finance may reshape the asset. Wall Street vs. Decentralization Overall, 60% of respondents said mainstream adoption, including developments such as spot ETFs, corporate treasuries holding Bitcoin, and government accumulation, is positive for Bitcoin. Within this group, 41.4% described the trend as “very positive,” and cited greater legitimacy and long-term price potential, while 18.6% felt “positive” but expressed less enthusiasm. Another 19.4% of participants were neutral. However, 20.5% voiced concerns that Bitcoin’s expansion into traditional finance could compromise its core principles. This group included 12.7% who see mainstream adoption as “very negative.” They warned that decentralization and censorship resistance may be weakened. Meanwhile, 7.8% were “negative” but less strongly opposed. The skepticism was most pronounced among first-cycle investors, who experienced their first crypto market cycle. Among these newcomers, 29.3% viewed mainstream adoption as negative or very harmful, roughly double the 14.9% rate recorded among second-cycle participants and 15.7% among those in their third cycle or beyond. On the other hand, only 52.0% of first-cycle participants felt positive or very positive about Bitcoin’s mainstream momentum, compared with 65.2% of second-cycle respondents and 64.4% of long-term veterans. Second-cycle participants were also the most likely to call mainstream adoption “very positive.” The findings suggest that seasoned crypto users are more comfortable with the idea of institutional involvement, while newer entrants may either lack exposure to past adoption cycles or represent speculative traders wary of Bitcoin becoming another Wall Street asset. Crypto Demographics Among the participants, CoinGecko found that 68% identified as long-term crypto investors, while 20% described themselves as short-term traders. Builders made up 7% of the group, and 5% were sidelined spectators observing the market without active participation. In terms of experience, 38% were navigating their first market cycle with up to three years in crypto, 41% were in their second cycle spanning four to seven years, and 21% were seasoned veterans with over eight years of involvement. Geographically, respondents were concentrated in Europe, which accounted for 31% of participants, followed by Asia at 26% and North America at 22%. The remaining participants were spread across Africa, South America, and Oceania.

His decision reshapes the city’s mayoral race only weeks before the November vote. Adams announced the withdrawal in a video posted to X on Sunday. “Despite all we’ve achieved, I cannot continue my re-election campaign,” he said, pointing to the Campaign Finance Board’s decision to deny him public matching funds. The loss of those funds, combined with constant questions about his next move, made his position untenable, he said. https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1972348511892262962 Mamdani Holds Double-Digit Lead As Race Narrows Polls had shown Adams trailing badly in a crowded field. Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani has consistently led by double digits, with former governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, also in the race. Strategists say Adams’ exit could tighten the contest between Mamdani and Cuomo, though Mamdani remains the frontrunner. Pressure for Adams to step aside had been mounting. Party officials and donors worried that his presence would split moderate Democratic support, all but ensuring Mamdani’s victory. His campaign never gained traction, with his polling numbers slipping to single digits in recent months. Sliwa, meanwhile, has insisted he will stay in the race despite polling slightly ahead of Adams. His continued presence leaves the possibility of further vote splitting in November. Adams Earned ‘Bitcoin Mayor’ Title With Crypto Paycheck Stunt Adams, who took office in Jan. 2022, quickly made a national name for himself as one of the most pro-crypto politicians in America. He famously converted his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum , a symbolic move that earned him the nickname “Bitcoin Mayor.” He pledged to make New York the “global capital of cryptocurrency,” pushing blockchain integration in city services. His proposals included using blockchain for municipal recordkeeping, allowing residents to pay fines and taxes in crypto, and even issuing Bitcoin-backed municipal bonds. Critics, including City Comptroller Brad Lander, warned such ideas carried financial risks. Despite the skepticism, Adams became a fixture in the digital assets scene. He courted industry leaders such as Galaxy Digital’s Michael Novogratz for fundraising, spoke at major conferences like Permissionless and Bitcoin 2023, and lobbied for regulatory reforms. He often contrasted his stance with that of Andrew Cuomo, accusing the former governor of dismantling the industry through hostile policies. Crypto Community Loses One Of Its Political Advocates Disclosures suggested Adams’ personal crypto holdings were modest by late 2023. Still, his willingness to champion digital assets distinguished him from other national figures and reinforced New York’s ambitions in the sector. In May, he launched a digital assets advisory council aimed at bringing fintech jobs and investment to Manhattan. The move was part of a broader effort to align the city with federal progress on stablecoin rules and market structure legislation. Adams’ exit leaves New York politics without one of crypto’s most outspoken champions in elected office. For an industry that once looked to the mayor as a high-profile ally, the November election will determine whether City Hall continues to embrace digital assets or takes a more cautious path.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of those standouts, with its Phase 6 presale already 50% sold out. At a price of $0.035, the project has raised over $16.50 million and welcomed more than 16,650 holders. Phase 7 will increase the token price to $0.040, a 15% rise, showing that investors entering today are locking in a clear discount before the next leg up. Analysts project that buyers in this round are positioning for 350% gains even before the bull run fully resumes. A framework built on risk management and stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not simply another addition to the growing list of crypto coins. It is a decentralized lending protocol designed with multiple safety mechanisms to protect users and sustain long-term growth. The system is structured around overcollateralized borrowing, ensuring loans are backed by more value than borrowed, while automated liquidation triggers and penalty fees maintain stability if collateral values fall. Liquidators are incentivized to restore balance through discounted repayments, creating constant pressure toward systemic health. A key differentiator is its oracle strategy, which aggregates Chainlink feeds, fallback oracles, and time-weighted on-chain data. This ensures borrowers and lenders always interact with fair and tamper-resistant price information, reducing the risk of manipulation that plagues many DeFi platforms. Alongside this, borrow caps and Restricted Collateralization Mode limit the exposure of risky assets, so volatile tokens do not compromise the safety of the entire system. A reserve factor applied to each asset also feeds income into the treasury, which in turn will support platform sustainability. Unlike unchecked DeFi protocols that expose participants to systemic fragility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a structure where every component—whether liquidation penalties or collateral ratios—works together to safeguard investor capital. This emphasis on capital protection and controlled risk makes the platform more attractive during times of uncertainty, reinforcing why investing in crypto through structured protocols can outperform sentiment-driven alternatives. Security, roadmap, and investor upside Beyond its mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is securing investor confidence with external validation and community-focused measures. The project has undergone a CertiK audit, scoring 90.00 in Token Scan and 79.00 in Skynet assessments, demonstrating a commitment to robust code standards. Complementing this, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivizes ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities, while a $100,000 giveaway rewards and energizes its growing community. These steps underline a transparent approach rarely seen in newer crypto coins. The roadmap is equally compelling. Phase 2 focuses on core contract and infrastructure development, while Phase 3 is set to bring beta testing and functional demos. By Phase 4, the platform will go live, with MUTM token listings, claim activation, and multi-chain expansion. Each stage provides investors with tangible milestones that align with price growth and adoption momentum. The outcomes speak for themselves for investors who are keeping an eye on returns. At the current presale pricing, a Phase 1 allotment of $10,000 at $0.01 has already increased to $35,000, which is a 250% increase. People who buy in Phase 6 for $0.035 should see their worth rise by 350% before the bull cycle picks up speed again. This illustrates that making smart early investments in structured initiatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can lead to big profits even before the market as a whole starts to rise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting itself up as the uncommon presale token that offers strong security, long-lasting mechanics, and actual safety for investors. While other people chase after short-lived buzz, this project is showing that the best places to invest in crypto are platforms that create demand on purpose. With 50% of Phase 6 already sold, the chance to get tokens at a discount is running out quickly. This makes MUTM one of the best buys before the next bull run starts.

As major players rebalance, attention is moving away from the giants and toward undervalued altcoins that combine utility, scalability, and a low entry price. In this environment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out as a project priced at only $0.035 in presale, with analysts confident it will be the next crypto to break past the $1 mark by 2026. While large tokens fluctuate with crypto ETF flows, investors are hunting early opportunities with higher growth potential, and MUTM is emerging as a top candidate. BTC & ETH ETFs see $509M outflow Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs have reportedly seen a combined $509 million outflow, signaling that investors are pulling capital out of crypto exposure. Such outflows often reflect risk-off sentiment, portfolio rebalancing, or diminished confidence in near-term upside. In practice, large withdrawals from BTC/ETH ETFs can exacerbate price weakness because funds must sell underlying assets to meet redemptions, adding downward pressure. The move also suggests that “fast money” — traders using ETFs for shorter-term plays — may be turning cautious, focusing less on long-term conviction and more on liquidity and macro signals. Unless inflows resume, the persistent outflows could indicate a phase of underperformance or sideways trading for BTC and ETH, especially if broader markets stay volatile or interest rates remain uncertain. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): a next-gen lending model for broad adoption Momentum in the presale demonstrates that demand is building rapidly. Phase 6 has raised over $16.5 million, with more than 16,650 holders participating so far. At the current price of $0.035, half of the 170 million tokens allocated for this round are already sold. With Phase 7 set to push the price up by 15% to $0.040, investors are recognizing that this is the last chance to secure a discounted entry. An active community of more than 12,000 Twitter followers further amplifies awareness, fueling urgency to participate before wider exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to reshape decentralized finance with its dual lending system. The Peer-to-Contract model focuses on stablecoins and established assets like ETH and BTC, offering reliable liquidity and steady yields. In parallel, the Peer-to-Peer system will open lending for higher-risk tokens, where borrowers and lenders can negotiate terms while keeping risks isolated. This dual design provides flexibility across different risk appetites, ensuring that both conservative and adventurous participants will find a place in the ecosystem. Security and trust are equally important for growth, and MUTM has already undergone a full CertiK audit. The audit included manual review and static analysis, resulting in a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. For investors concerned about contract vulnerabilities, these results add an extra layer of confidence in the platform’s foundation. Catalysts set to drive the $1 breakthrough Multiple catalysts are aligning to position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for significant demand growth once it lists publicly. The upcoming beta launch will allow users to test real features before the token hits exchanges. Investors are already able to explore the lending and borrowing system, a dedicated ROI dashboard, and a Top 50 leaderboard where participants earn bonus rewards. This gamified environment not only creates engagement but also establishes token demand even before full rollout. The integration of a Layer-2 network will dramatically improve speed and reduce transaction costs compared to operating on Layer-1 alone. This efficiency will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a more attractive option for frequent borrowing and lending, driving sustained volume on the platform. With smoother transactions, users will engage more often, feeding a cycle of adoption and liquidity growth. Another major milestone is the launch of a decentralized stablecoin. Minted through overcollateralized loans, this $1-pegged asset will strengthen ecosystem activity by enabling borrowing, repayments, and on-chain liquidity that feeds back into MUTM demand. This feature adds practical utility, setting the project apart from tokens that lack real-world application. Exchange visibility will also amplify growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to list on major platforms such as Binance and MEXC. These listings will bring access to global investors, raise liquidity, and make it easier for traders to enter and exit positions. With strong exchange support, the market will gain greater confidence in evaluating MUTM’s fundamentals, likely pushing the price upward in line with bullish crypto predictions. The need to act is stronger than ever. Half of the Phase 6 tokens have already been sold, and prices will go up by 15% in Phase 7. Investors who wait will miss out on the best chance to buy in. Retail traders and institutional investors who are moving away from BTC and ETH ETFs are finding that MUTM offers not just a lower entry point, but also an ecosystem that encourages ongoing participation and long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a lot going for it, including new ways to lend money, smart contracts backed by security, a successful presale, gamified dashboards, Layer-2 efficiency, decentralized stablecoin usefulness, and forthcoming Tier-1 exchange listings. These linked factors are why analysts think MUTM will be the next cryptocurrency to hit $1 by 2026. This initiative gives you the chance to change your portfolio in a big way at a time when crypto values are going up and down, and regular ETF flows are changing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the clear choice for investors who are ready to act.

52415031,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84531,1759118409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Investing in Small-Cap Altcoins: What You Need to Know,https://timestabloid.com/investing-in-small-cap-altcoins-what-you-need-to-know/,"The cryptocurrency market has always been a place of rapid shifts, especially when it comes to small-cap altcoins. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the spotlight, investors eager for bigger gains often turn to tokens with lower market caps. One example is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has been on a tear lately, breaking records and drawing attention from retailers. Experts suggest exponential growth could follow once it makes its way onto major exchanges. Small-cap coins don’t always get the same coverage as the industry giants, but they can present unique opportunities. Since they are earlier in their growth cycles, investors who discover them before the wider market often see the most upside. At the same time, these projects come with higher risks, making careful evaluation essential. Why Small-Cap Altcoins Matter These tokens typically have much smaller market valuations compared to top assets like Bitcoin or Solana. Their limited size gives them the potential for outsized growth when adoption expands or when listings occur on major exchanges. Many of today’s largest cryptocurrencies started as small-caps, which is why investors continue scanning for the next breakout. The attraction lies in the possibility of sharp gains. Unlike large-cap coins that may move gradually, small-caps can deliver fast price surges if momentum builds. This speculative edge is what keeps traders and early adopters focused on them. Balancing Risk and Reward The same qualities that make small-caps appealing also make them risky. They tend to be more volatile, have less liquidity, and can collapse if they fail to deliver on promises. For this reason, experienced investors usually dedicate only part of their portfolio to them while holding stronger assets as a foundation. Research is key. Looking into the development team, the uniqueness of the technology, the size of the community, and whether the project has undergone audits can help separate serious contenders from risky bets. Transparency and consistent progress are usually the strongest signs of long-term viability. A New Breakout Opportunity One project standing out in this space is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its presale has shattered milestones, with demand outpacing supply as new participants rush in. The project’s audited framework, combined with a fast-growing community, has made it one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025. Analysts highlight that early participants could see exponential upside once the token lists on top-tier exchanges. Momentum around MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn comparisons to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. While nothing is guaranteed, its growth trajectory so far shows all the hallmarks of a coin positioned to surprise the market. Drivers Behind Small-Cap Growth There are common factors that tend to spark rallies in small-cap tokens: Community strength, as engaged supporters boost visibility. Exchange listings, which open liquidity and drive awareness. Real-world utility or unique features that set a project apart. Partnerships with established players that build credibility. Transparent audits and clear roadmaps that strengthen trust. Projects hitting these milestones often see momentum snowball into broader adoption. Market Context This surge in small-cap interest comes as the wider crypto market holds steady despite global uncertainty. Institutions continue to focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, while retail investors seek higher-risk plays with bigger upside. This dynamic has historically set the stage for smaller tokens to shine, especially during altcoin seasons that follow Bitcoin-led rallies. If 2025 plays out like previous cycles, the spotlight on small-caps could intensify. In that case, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are well placed to benefit as liquidity flows into newer tokens. Smart Ways to Approach For investors considering entry, risk management is critical. Allocating only a portion of a portfolio to these projects helps capture growth potential without overexposure. Diversification across multiple small-caps rather than going all in on one is another way to reduce risk. Patience also matters. Many small-cap investors have seen their biggest wins by holding through volatility while sticking to projects that keep delivering on their promises. Conclusion Small-cap altcoins remain one of the most exciting opportunities in crypto. They carry higher risk, but for those who research carefully and manage exposure, the rewards can be significant. In this landscape, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a clear frontrunner, smashing records and positioning itself for exponential gains once it lists on major exchanges. As the market cycle evolves, investors looking for the next breakout story should keep a close eye on this corner of crypto.

In a video captioned in his latest tweet, he examined the similarities between past and present price movements and explained why the short and mid-term outlook could be setting up a major breakout. According to StephIsCrypto, XRP bottomed in June 2025 before rallying 92% to a July peak, almost identical to the 93% surge from June to August 2020. They noted that the correction following July’s peak, which has so far seen a 26% decline, also aligns closely with the timeline of 2020, when XRP bottomed in late September. With today’s market in a similar condition to the 2020 pattern, the analyst argued that XRP may already have found its floor for this phase. Most People Don't Realize What's About To Hit #XRP ! (Price Prediction) pic.twitter.com/anzvXmnPJM — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 27, 2025 Short-Term Expectations and Possible Rally The video further broke down how the 2020 cycle unfolded after September. At that time, XRP consolidated sideways for about two weeks before launching a 252% rally beginning in early November. If the same trajectory repeats, StephIsCrypto projected that XRP could move sideways into early November before making another explosive move upward. By applying the same percentage increase from the last cycle, the analyst outlined that XRP could potentially approach the $10 level during this phase. They also cautioned, however, that just as in 2020, such a rally could be short-lived, followed by a steep correction. In the earlier cycle, XRP lost around 78% of its value shortly after that November run. While not predicting an identical outcome, StephIsCrypto highlighted the importance of being prepared for similar volatility. Technical and Sentiment Indicators Beyond price comparisons, StephIsCrypto noted that technical signals are also lining up with past cycles. Specifically, the 50-day simple moving average on the three-day timeframe is currently in the same position seen before major rallies in 2014, 2020, and 2024. This alignment adds weight to the possibility of a significant move in October or November. The analyst also examined market sentiment using tools such as Google Trends and the crypto fear and greed index. They explained that while prices are making higher highs, retail interest is forming lower highs compared to last December. This divergence, in their view, suggests the market could be closer to the end of the cycle rather than the beginning, echoing patterns observed in previous XRP runs . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Lower social media engagement and reduced retail participation were cited as further signs of waning momentum that could eventually lead to a larger correction. Going Forward StephIsCrypto emphasized that XRP appears to be tracking its historical cycle with notable precision. They see the most likely outcome as a significant rally in November, though they acknowledged that October could also provide upside potential. At the same time, they urged caution, saying that if history rhymes, a major correction could follow any near-term surge. For now, their analysis indicates that XRP is at a critical point, with the coming weeks likely to define whether the asset reaches new highs or faces another period of retracement.

The price now faces a couple of key hurdles near $2.880 and $2.920. XRP price is slowly moving higher above the $2.80 support zone. The price is now trading above $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.80 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.920. XRP Price Dips Eyes Upside Break XRP price found support near $2.70 and recently started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.780 and $2.80 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.995 swing high to the $2.70 low. However, the price is now facing hurdles near $2.88. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.80 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.88 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.995 swing high to the $2.70 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.920 level. A clear move above the $2.920 resistance might send the price toward the $2.9880 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.020 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.050. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.880 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.820 level. The next major support is near the $2.80 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.80 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.720. The next major support sits near the $2.70 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.80 and $2.720.

It reminds me of Solana in the earlier days, and Solana has proven its worth and is, you know, there with the big boys,” Wood said during a recent interview on the Master Investor podcast. Wood explained that while ARK Invest has not disclosed any holdings in Hyperliquid, the protocol’s growth is one she is closely monitoring. Her comments come at a time when competition among perpetual futures decentralized exchanges (DEXs) is intensifying. Aster, another player in the space, launched its token earlier this month and has already seen its trading volume and open interest surpass Hyperliquid’s. ARK Invest’s Focus on Core Assets ARK Invest currently maintains exposure to three major cryptocurrencies across its public funds: Bitcoin (BTC $111,777), Ethereum (ETH $4,118), and Solana (SOL $210.18). Wood noted that the firm’s Solana exposure is connected to Breera Sports, which is tied to the Solana treasury and backed by Middle Eastern investors. She added that economist Art Laffer has advisory links to the project. While the fund has diversified into some derivative protocols like Uniswap and Solana-related markets, Wood stressed that its core focus remains narrow by design. “If you’re talking about the big boys or girls, those are the big three right now,” she said. Bitcoin’s Enduring Dominance Despite the explosion of tokens and new protocols, Wood argued that the long-term future of crypto belongs to a select group of networks. “We don’t think there are going to be very many cryptocurrencies,” she said. “Bitcoin owns the cryptocurrency space when it comes to pure crypto.” Wood emphasized Bitcoin’s role as a monetary system with a fixed supply and resilience, contrasting it with Ethereum’s role powering decentralized finance. She also noted the growing importance of stablecoins but reiterated that Bitcoin remains central to ARK’s long-term thesis. Retail and Quant Traders Drive DEX Growth According to Bitget Wallet’s chief marketing officer Jamie Elkaleh, decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid are seeing a surge in activity from retail traders and semi-professional quants. Incentives such as airdrops, low fees, and fast execution are helping drive this shift. Institutions, however, still prefer centralized exchanges for their fiat access, compliance, and brokerage support. Yet the performance gap between DEXs and CEXs is narrowing, with order-book platforms such as Hyperliquid and dYdX v4 now offering execution speeds and liquidity previously limited to centralized venues.",Crypto News Today|DeFi,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BTC|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-29 04:21:52

On Saturday evening, South Korea’s National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac stated clearly during an interview on Channel A News television that his country cannot deliver $350 billion in cash. “It is objectively and realistically not a level we are able to handle,” Wi said, emphasizing that “our position is not a negotiating tactic.” Wi’s remarks followed Trump’s characterization of the investment commitments secured from Japan and South Korea as “up front” payments. Seoul and Washington reached an agreement in July promising an investment of $350 billion included in wider trade arrangement to reduce US tariffs from 25% to 15%. However, the two nations remain at odds over how the payment structure should work. Japan has made a similar commitment worth $550 billion, though details about how it will be carried out remain vague. Information that has surfaced about the arrangement has caused alarm among officials in Seoul. Last week, South Korea’s Prime Minister Kim Min-seok told Bloomberg News that without a deal of currency swap with the US, the investment might inflict severe harm on the country’s economy. The $350 billion amount equals more than 80% of South Korea’s foreign currency holdings. Japan also expressed reservations about their $550 billion US investment arrangement over the weekend. Sanae Takaichi, a top contender to lead Japan’s ruling party, indicated that revisiting the trade deal with the US might be an option if it fails to serve Japan’s interests. Speaking on Sunday about the investment fund, Takaichi said Japan must not back down if any aspects of the deal’s implementation prove unfavorable or unjust to the country, and “that includes a potential renegotiation.” Washington prefers cash over loans According to reports, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has informed South Korean officials that Washington wants the investment in cash instead of loans. Wi indicated the government is looking at other options and remains hopeful about achieving progress during the upcoming meeting between the two leaders at the APEC Summit in Gyeongju next month. In a related matter, Korea’s Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol informed reporters on Saturday that he has completed discussions with the US on foreign exchange issues and will announce specifics soon. A presidential official later clarified that Koo’s comments relate to the US Treasury’s report on currency policies of its major trading partners. Japan’s investment mechanism remains murky In Japan, the Asian country has accepted the $550 billion investment arrangement as part of an agreement with the US to lower tariffs on Japanese exports to 15%, but the funding mechanism remains unclear. A memorandum of understanding the both countries signed at the start of September indicated that once Trump has picked investment projects for Japan to finance, the country has 45 business days to come up with the funds. The sum must be deposited into the account or accounts designated by the US in dollars. However, Japan’s chief trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa has since maintained that JBIC and NEXI, the two organizations primarily responsible for funding the investments, will not provide money for projects that do not benefit Japan. Akazawa said he does not anticipate the investment mechanism will significantly impact Japan’s government finances because it will be executed according to existing laws that govern JBIC and NEXI. The Japanese trade negotiator has previously contended that only 1-2% of the $550 billion mechanism will be actual investment, with the remainder consisting of loans and loan guarantees. The LDP is scheduled to hold a vote for its next leader on Oct. 4. Takaichi and Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi are the two leading candidates in the race that will likely decide who becomes Japan’s next prime minister.

The post , published on September 28, featured an image showing the number of accounts across various XRP balance ranges. It reported that the average amount of XRP held per wallet is “12,350.86 $XRP.” Like the XRP rich list , this table provides key insight into token distribution among wallets, breaking down accounts by balance categories, starting from wallets with zero to 20 XRP and rising to a small group of wallets with over 1 billion XRP. 5 wallets fall into the highest category, collectively holding more than 7.4 billion XRP. Other segments show that 22 wallets each have between 500 million and one billion XRP, while 58 wallets hold between 100 million and 500 million XRP. The average amount of #XRP per wallet, is 12,350.86 $XRP . pic.twitter.com/hD39nOOd2l — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) September 28, 2025 Average Holding Value at Current Market Price XRP is currently trading at $2.81, which means the reported average of 12,350.86 XRP per wallet equals about $34,700. This average value also sits far above the 1,000 XRP threshold , which many experts have set as the minimum investment for everyone serious about XRP. However, the image also reveals that most wallets fall on the lower end of the scale. There are over 1.3 million wallets with 20 XRP or less, and more than 2.3 million wallets holding between 20 and 500 XRP. These numbers suggest that the large sums in the top tiers contribute significantly to the calculated average. The XRP ecosystem is known for significant whale activity , and the concentration in a small number of large wallets creates a significant skew in the average. The table clearly shows the steep drop-off in holdings outside of the top categories. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Weighs In on the Figures Responses to the post reveal mixed reactions. One user questioned whether the average accurately reflects typical XRP holders, noting that many wallets reportedly contain only small amounts, often between 1 and 100 XRP. Another commenter found it surprising that wallets holding between 100 and 500 XRP outnumber those in the 75 to 100 XRP range, suggesting this group includes more than just retail traders, and hinting at potential institutional involvement . Others expressed doubt about the calculation itself, with one commenter suggesting the math may not align with their expectations for an average figure.

SOL price is now attempting to recover from $192 and faces hurdles near $215. SOL price started a fresh decline below $225 and $220 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $200 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another decline if it stays below $215 and $220. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price failed to stay above $220 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL traded below the $212 and $205 support levels to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. A low was formed at $191 and the price recently started a recovery wave above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $242 swing high to the $191 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $200 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there are more gains, the price could face resistance near the $212 level. The next major resistance is near the $215 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $242 swing high to the $191 low. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $230. Any more gains might send the price toward the $242 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $215 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $202 zone. The first major support is near the $200 level. A break below the $200 level might send the price toward the $192 support zone. If there is a close below the $192 support, the price could decline toward the $180 support in the near term.

Ethereum (ETH), despite recent setbacks, remains the perfect example of how patience and conviction rewarded early believers with extraordinary returns. During its formative stages, ETH traded for cents before transforming into a pillar of the market. In today’s downturn, retail investors are once again seeking that kind of ETH-like trajectory, and analysts are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the project that mirrors the same early fundamentals with innovative features like dual lending pools and a governance-backed stablecoin. Lending and stablecoin innovation reshaping crypto investment At this stage, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in its presale, which has already raised over $16.5 million. Phase 6 is 50% sold, with tokens priced at $0.035. The price will move next to $0.040, creating a 15% jump for those who secure their entry before the next round begins. Just as ETH’s earliest supporters multiplied their portfolios before it broke out, retail investors now have a chance to get in while MUTM is still undervalued and positioned for its next price lift. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building its foundation around a dual lending system that combines peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models. This allows retail traders to unlock liquidity while holding onto their long-term assets. For example, depositing $1,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) as collateral will allow borrowing up to 75% of that value, giving users liquidity without sacrificing exposure to future ETH gains. On the lending side, participants can contribute assets like $10,000 worth of ADA into the system and receive mtADA, a token that represents their deposit plus interest. This not only generates passive income but also strengthens the overall pool liquidity, benefiting both lenders and borrowers. The other pillar of the platform will be its decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1. Unlike volatile assets that swing with the market, this stablecoin is designed to maintain value through governance-driven interest rates and arbitrage opportunities. If the stablecoin drifts from its peg, borrowing rates will be adjusted to pull it back in line. Arbitrage traders will also have the incentive to restore equilibrium, ensuring stability across the platform. Overcollateralized loans and automatic liquidations will keep the system solvent and secure, removing risks associated with unbacked models that failed in the past. To support these mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate Chainlink price feeds as the primary oracle system. Additional fallback feeds, aggregated data sources, and decentralized exchange TWAPs will further reinforce price accuracy. This multi-layered price discovery design makes sure collateral values and liquidation events remain fair and transparent. Building momentum through buybacks, roadmap, and security Beyond its lending and stablecoin design, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built a token economy that continuously strengthens demand. Users of mtTokens will have the ability to stake them in smart contracts, earning MUTM rewards on top of their interest income. Revenue generated by the platform will also be used for open-market buybacks of MUTM, which will then be redistributed to stakers. This creates a feedback loop where growing adoption translates directly into buying pressure and increasing value for token users. The project’s roadmap outlines a clear path from development to launch. Smart contract deployment, beta testing on testnet, and exchange listing preparations are all milestones that will be completed before the live launch. Once the platform goes live, features such as multi-chain expansion and advanced risk parameters will unlock further opportunities for growth. Each step forward will expand adoption and bring more visibility to the project. Confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is further supported by its security-first approach. The team has engaged CertiK for a full audit, ensuring smart contracts are rigorously reviewed with both manual and automated tools. A bug bounty program worth $50,000 has also been created to encourage independent developers to stress-test the system, while a $100,000 giveaway is running to reward community participation during the presale. These steps showcase a commitment to transparency and safety that strengthens investor trust. Conclusion With most people making crypto investments out of fear, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a builder with strong fundamentals that will keep its worth over time. It has overcollateralized loans, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar, solid oracles, constant buybacks, and a well-structured roadmap. All of these things make it the finest ETH-like prospect for regular investors right now. The presale price is $0.035, and the next price increase to $0.040 is coming up soon. This project offers the kind of early-stage entry that has historically led to life-changing returns. Even though the market as a whole is going down, retail is choosing to plant its flag at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for an ETH-like path.

He commented, “We now have a deeper understanding of supply shocks and structural drivers of inflation and have expanded our use of high-frequency data for more timely and granular monitoring.” He added that the bank has developed ways to gauge neutral interest rates and conduct scenario testing, leaving policymakers better prepared to maintain price stability in turbulent times. This follows New Zealand Prime Minister Christoper Luxon’s recent comment that he spoke with RBNZ Governor Christian Hawkesby about the New Zealand economy. When asked whether he wished he had encouraged a bolder move to the governor, he said, “Pretty much, yeah.” Though he noted that, “I can give my views, but I do respect the independence of the Reserve Bank under legislation.” New Zealand law includes elaborate renderings to insulate (RBNZ independence). It is unusual for a prime minister or a cabinet official to comment publicly on rate decisions. ECB President Christine Lagarde warned that political interference in monetary policy threatens to destabilize economies. RBNZ recognised it had forecast errors in the pandemic period The RBNZ has been faulted for falling behind the curve after COVID-19. Officials, nevertheless, admitted that the former dual mandate had made it harder to prioritize inflation control. Conway noted that, in retrospect, stronger action might have helped back then, but policymakers had to weigh the risk of hurting jobs given their dual mandate. He stated: “In hindsight, an earlier or more aggressive tightening might have reduced inflation sooner.” The bank’s decision to raise the official cash rate from 0.25% in October 2021 to 5.5% in May 2023 also fueled public criticism. Not to mention, the bank struggled to produce accurate forecasts during the pandemic, when unusual economic shocks threw off its models. The bank noted that private analysts and other central banks also struggled with big forecast misses during that time. Still, it argued, since November 2022, its accuracy has nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels. RBNZ also acknowledged that the scale of pandemic-era fiscal easing had a bigger impact than expected, prompting efforts to refine its fiscal analysis and deepen collaboration with Treasury. The bank said it is ensuring it can quickly deploy tools like large-scale asset purchases or negative rates should future conditions demand them. It further noted, “Over the past two decades, neutral interest rates have declined significantly, both in New Zealand and globally. This structural shift increases the likelihood that the OCR could reach its effective lower bound in future downturns.” Though it claimed that as of late 2021, the country’s major banks had the systems in place to operate under a negative cash rate. New Zealand’s economy fell 0.9% in Q2 New Zealand’s GDP contracted more than expected in the second quarter as construction shrank and global jitters sapped demand, adding to calls for beefier easing when the Reserve Bank next meets in October. Official data on Sept. 18 indicated that GDP fell 0.9% in the second quarter of 2025, three times the 0.3% drop predicted by analysts and the RBNZ. The country’s economy has shrunk in three of the last five quarters, with annual GDP falling 0.6%. The markets are now lifting their bets for OCR reductions to 58 bps, with odds of a half-point cut in October rising to 20%. Westpac’s senior economist, Michael Gordon, believes the construction, manufacturing, and professional services were the biggest drags on the economy. Nonetheless, Conway insists they are working to improve the country’s long-run economic performance. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

He argued that artificial intelligence could make equities less attractive while positioning Bitcoin as the ultimate digital-age store of value. At the same time, Samson Mow believes a wave of nation-state adoption is approaching, with a number of countries preparing to launch Strategic Bitcoin Reserves. Despite Bitcoin hovering around $110,000 and lagging behind gold and equities, both analysts see strong long-term potential, though some suggest the next major rally may be delayed until 2026. Analysts Split on Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin’s journey toward new all-time highs is unlikely to be a straight path upward. This is according to market analyst Jordi Visser, who warned that big corrections of 20% or more will be part of the process. Even as the fourth quarter is traditionally strong for crypto markets, Visser believes pullbacks are inevitable while Bitcoin builds its long-term trajectory. By drawing a comparison to Nvidia, the high-performance chipmaker that is the world’s most valuable publicly traded company with a market cap above $4 trillion, Visser pointed out that massive rallies often come with equally sharp corrections along the way. Nvidia’s meteoric rise of over 1,000% since the launch of ChatGPT less than three years ago included at least five separate corrections of 20% or more, yet the stock still managed to set new record highs. Visser suggested Bitcoin will follow a similar pattern as part of what he calls the “AI trade.” According to his view, artificial intelligence will reshape the global economy, replacing human labor and disrupting traditional industries. This shift could weaken the long-term value of many established companies, making equities less attractive to investors. In such a scenario, Bitcoin will stand out as the ultimate store of value for the digital era by offering an alternative to depreciating fiat currencies and underperforming stocks. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Still, Bitcoin’s price performance over the past few months caused some debate among analysts and investors. While gold and equities are climbing to fresh highs, Bitcoin is trading near $110,000, which is roughly 11% below its record of more than $123,000. People are split on whether Q4 could drive BTC toward $140,000 or if the latest pullback signals the early stages of a deeper correction, which could potentially drag prices as low as $60,000. The lack of movement on proposals for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve also tempered optimism. Some analysts anticipated that such a reserve , built through regular government purchases, could drive huge demand for BTC in 2025, but the absence of progress has left investors a bit more cautious. Nation-State Bitcoin FOMO is Near Although the US strategic Bitcoin reserve is taking a bit longer than expected, Bitcoin adoption among nation-states could accelerate much faster than many expect. This is according to Jan3 founder Samson Mow. On the What Bitcoin Did podcast, Mow said that the world may be at the tipping point where gradual progress suddenly shifts into a wave of rapid adoption. He believes it is only a matter of time before a surge of countries embrace Bitcoin as part of their national strategies, and described it as a potential “nation-state FOMO.” A key driver of this narrative is the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which would see governments formally hold and accumulate BTC. Mow also said that although US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish such a reserve, the US has yet to begin purchasing. Still, he explained that the country is advancing its plans through budget-neutral acquisition proposals and the Bitcoin Act. Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn also suggested that a US reserve could materialize before the end of the year. However, Mow warned that the US risks being front-run by other countries, like Pakistan, if it delays purchases. The US currently holds 198,012 Bitcoin, according to Bitbo data , the largest sovereign holding of any government. Mow said he is particularly bullish on Latin America, where he expects major Bitcoin-related developments to emerge. The notion of governments and sovereign wealth funds holding Bitcoin has been gaining a lot of momentum throughout 2025. Fidelity Digital Assets predicted earlier this year that more nation-states and central banks would establish strategic positions in the cryptocurrency, which only adds credibility to the idea of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price has not delivered the explosive move higher that many anticipated. Mow admitted he expected a massive rally by now but suggested this cycle may simply be delayed until next year. Others in the industry share this outlook, including Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who recently predicted 2026 will be an “up year.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-29 05:30:00

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Doha-based QNB will use JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments system, allowing its business clients in Qatar to settle dollar payments in minutes and at any time of the week. Traditional rails often take several days and operate only on weekdays. Corporate clients are increasingly demanding faster and more reliable cross-border payments, Kamel Moris, executive vice president of transactional banking at QNB, told the outlet. “Now we can have a 24/7 service window, we can guarantee payments as fast as in two minutes,” he said. “It’s a treasurer’s dream.” According to Bloomberg, Qatar National Bank (QNB Group) has adopted JPMorgan’s blockchain platform to process US dollar corporate payments for its Qatar-based bank.

Faster, Cheaper Settlements Seen As Key To Attract Global Capital The move places QNB among a growing group of Gulf banks turning to global partners like JPMorgan to modernize payments. The region, which has long relied on oil-linked wealth and dollar liquidity, is now seeking to strengthen its financial infrastructure to support diversification strategies and attract global investors. Faster and cheaper settlement systems are seen as crucial to that shift. JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform, launched in 2019, is already processing about $3b in daily transactions. While that is only a fraction of the $10 trillion handled by the bank’s broader payments arm, the network has been expanding steadily as more institutions join. The US bank is the largest dollar clearer in the world and is using its position to extend Kinexys’ reach. QNB Adoption Shows Gulf Banks Driving Wider Blockchain Use For QNB, instant access to dollar payments meets the rising expectations of treasurers. In today’s global economy, information moves seamlessly, and money is expected to follow. Moreover, faster settlement allows the bank to compete more aggressively in corporate banking against both regional and international peers. At the same time, large financial institutions worldwide are investing more heavily in blockchain-based solutions. Their goal is to simplify back-office operations and improve transparency. For over a decade, banks have experimented with distributed ledger technology. However, only a handful of platforms have managed to scale commercially. QNB’s adoption signals that Gulf banks, often among the earliest in emerging markets to test new financial technologies, are now pushing toward wider implementation. The shift reflects both the competitive pressure to modernize and the strategic importance of maintaining reliable access to US dollars.

Many investors today are watching closely for signals that the next major surge could be around the corner. With Bitcoin consolidating near new highs and altcoin activity picking up across exchanges, the question for many is whether now is the final chance to secure a position before the market accelerates again. Among the projects generating buzz is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a token audited that has seen a record-breaking presale, a rapidly expanding community, and rising global attention. The conversation around timing couldn’t come at a more critical moment. Analysts argue that cryptocurrency often moves in cycles, and when momentum builds, those on the sidelines can find themselves priced out quickly. With growing speculation that the next phase of the bull market is approaching, retail and institutional players alike are reconsidering their strategies to avoid missing what could be a defining move. Why Investors Are on Edge For much of 2025, digital assets have traded in a volatile but upward range. Bitcoin’s price resilience despite global economic uncertainty has reinforced the narrative that crypto is maturing as an asset class. At the same time, altcoins have started to show renewed strength, with liquidity flowing into projects beyond the established leaders. Institutional adoption continues to play a role, with major financial firms exploring ETFs, custody services, and even direct token holdings. Each wave of adoption creates ripples across the market, and when combined with retail enthusiasm, it sets the stage for dramatic price acceleration. This mix of factors has many market watchers saying the next breakout could arrive sooner than expected. The Appeal of Small and Mid-Cap Projects While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate attention, some of the biggest stories in past bull runs came from lesser-known projects. Smaller tokens can deliver significant growth when they attract large communities and secure critical exchange listings. They often introduce innovations or fill market gaps that larger players leave behind. Investors are increasingly scanning for these breakout opportunities, knowing that history has shown the highest returns often come from projects that were underestimated at the start. But with opportunity comes risk, as not all small-cap projects are able to sustain their growth or prove their utility over time. A Standout Performance One project now being singled out as a top contender is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its presale has already smashed records, raising millions in a short period while selling out rounds at a rapid pace. The project has gone through rigorous audits by HashEx and CertiK , two of the industry’s most respected security firms, giving investors added confidence in its infrastructure. Beyond security, MAGACOIN FINANCE has cultivated a fast-growing community that spans across multiple regions, making it one of the most globally recognized presales of the year. Analysts have noted that its combination of strong audits, record-breaking fundraising, and rapid adoption positions it for exponential growth once major exchange listings go live . For many, this is why MAGACOIN FINANCE is seen as the “last train” before the broader market surge fully arrives. Catalysts Driving the Next Surge Several factors could accelerate the coming wave in crypto: Macroeconomic conditions – Central banks are still wrestling with inflation and growth concerns, driving investors toward alternative assets. ETF expansion – Institutional products bring new waves of liquidity and legitimacy into the space. Technological upgrades – From Ethereum’s scaling to Bitcoin’s layer-two solutions, improved infrastructure attracts more users. Retail participation – Grassroots enthusiasm tends to peak in late stages of bull runs, amplifying price momentum. Global adoption – Emerging markets are increasingly using digital assets for remittances, savings, and payments, boosting long-term demand. Together, these elements create fertile ground for altcoins to outperform, especially those already building strong communities and securing early trust. How Investors Can Prepare For those considering entry into the market, strategy and discipline are essential. Experts recommend diversification across both large and smaller projects to balance potential growth with stability. Timing also plays a role; entering before widespread hype can deliver the best positioning, but it requires conviction and research. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE illustrate why due diligence matters. Security audits, transparent roadmaps, and measurable milestones separate serious contenders from weaker plays. By focusing on fundamentals, investors can identify which tokens are most likely to benefit when the next surge begins. Conclusion The crypto market has always rewarded those who prepare before momentum hits full stride. With speculation building that a major surge is close, experts say this could be the final opportunity to “board the train” before prices accelerate further. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the most compelling projects of 2025, combining record-breaking presale success, strong security audits, and a growing global community. As Bitcoin stabilizes and altcoins strengthen, the stage is set for the next chapter of the bull cycle. Those looking to secure positions early may find this moment defining for years to come.

This has already triggered fear in the market, with the Fear and Greed Index falling into the Fear territory, marking a new 5-month low. From here, the next direction of the Bitcoin price carries a lot of weight for the entire market, and the point at which the cryptocurrency is sitting is a decision-making point. Bitcoin Price Falls Into Critical Junction According to crypto analyst Weslad, who posted an interesting analysis on the TradingView website, the Bitcoin price is now sitting at what could be considered a make-or-break level. This critical junction lies at a major supply zone, and with the strong supply at this point, a rejection could quickly follow. The crypto analyst explains that the Bitcoin price is currently still holding above the key demand zone of $106,269-$108,715, which is still very bullish for the price. In fact, this has been historically known as a point where the Bitcoin bulls have often held, supporting and triggering the next wave of uptrends. This means that the bulls will have to keep holding this demand zone if they want to maintain the primary uptrend. In the case of a successful hold and a subsequent bounce and breakout with strong momentum, it could put the Bitcoin price on a path to clearing its all-time high above $124,000. Moving further away from this point, the crypto analyst believes it is possible that this bounce could send the Bitcoin price rallying toward the $135,627-$139,616 target zone . This would be an over 20% increase for the cryptocurrency. Bears Could Still Take Control While it does seem that the bulls are holding the primary uptrend while keeping the Bitcoin price above the demand zone of $106,269-$108,715, there is still the possibility of bears taking over from here. Weslad points to the recent rejection from the $117,000 supply zone as proof that sellers are still very much active in the market. If the selling were to continue, then the pressure could press down the Bitcoin price further , putting the key demand support at risk. If the bears were able to successfully break below the demand zone of $106,269-$108,715, then the crypto analyst expects the price to continue to struggle. A downtrend from here could trigger another 10% crash , and such a crash could see the Bitcoin price moving straight toward $98,384. This break would mean Bitcoin losing the $100,000 psychological level for the first time in more than three months.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-29 06:00:33

His comments have drawn interest for challenging the notion that blockchain-based solutions, such as XRP, represent a break from the existing system . Booth suggested that the model behind XRP reflects the very structures it claims to transform. The video featuring Booth’s remarks was shared on X by Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto proponent. Xaif sees the discussion as a debate over whether XRP is driving change in financial systems or simply reproducing traditional structures. Jeff Booth — one of the most famous Canadian author, entrepreneur & investor Drops it straight — $XRP is essentially replicating the banking system. The question: is it reforming finance, or just re-building the old one? #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/3eILaPgzil — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) September 28, 2025 Concerns About Replicating the Existing System Booth questioned whether XRP’s design offers real change or simply follows the structure of existing financial institutions. He pointed out that the current system allows banks to create money through lending and then charge interest on it, a cycle that he views as central to today’s economic framework. While he raised doubts about introducing new technology into that framework without changing its fundamentals, he acknowledged that many in the crypto space are motivated by good intentions. Booth suggested that its approach risks maintaining some of the same practices it was expected to challenge. His remarks left open the question of whether a platform that works with banks and governments can still drive meaningful reform. Decentralization and Opportunities for Change Booth contrasted decentralized models with the legacy structures of finance, noting that the latter remain tied to interest-based lending. However, he did not argue that XRP’s role in facilitating cross-border payments and partnering with traditional institutions is entirely without merit. By bringing blockchain technology into established systems, projects like XRP could create opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce friction , even if they do not fully break from the old model. Reform requires more than technical innovation. It also involves rethinking incentives and the flow of capital. His perspective highlighted the need to balance the pursuit of decentralization with practical steps that can make existing systems fairer and more transparent.

Many XRP supporters argue that its integration with global payment networks is a necessary step toward modernizing finance, enabling faster transactions and improved liquidity. Booth’s comments invited consideration of whether working alongside established players can be part of progress rather than an obstacle to it, and XRP’s remarkable progress across the globe with tokenization, CBDC projects, and more, shows that Ripple’s approach of integration has its merits.

Morningstar increased its fair value estimate for Alibaba’s American Depositary Receipts by 49% to $267. The firm also set its Hong Kong-listed shares at HK$260. Separately, Morgan Stanley lifted its ADR price target by 21% to $200. The Hong Kong-listed stock rose as much as 4.1% to over HK$173 during Monday’s session. That brought the company’s gain this month to nearly 50%, putting it at the top of the Hang Seng Tech Index. Chelsey Tam, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in a note that the shares look undervalued. She said several things are helping cloud revenue grow, including more money going into overseas data centers, strong competitive results, wide use of the company’s open-source models, and better performance from chips it developed in-house. As reported by Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley analysts said they became more positive about Alicloud after a conference in Hangzhou. At that event, Alibaba announced plans to spend more on AI and revealed a new partnership with Nvidia. Cloud Growth Forecasts Raised to 40% Gary Yu and his team at Morgan Stanley raised their cloud growth forecasts to 32% for fiscal 2026 and 40% for fiscal 2027. The analysts said the higher estimates reflect increased capital spending, model improvements, strategic partnerships, and faster expansion into international markets. Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed stock is on pace for its best month since the company went public there in 2019. Investors are backing the internet company’s AI investments as a way to drive growth. In the most recent quarter, the firm reported triple-digit growth in AI-related products. Its cloud division also delivered sales growth that exceeded expectations. As optimism builds, Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management reopened positions in Alibaba’s ADRs this month . It was the first time the firm bought the stock in four years buying $16 billion worth of Alibaba stock. Half of that amount went into the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF, while the rest went into the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF. It marked her first major purchase of the company since 2021. Strategic Nvidia partnership to bypass U.S. Chip restrictions As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier Alibaba’s global AI spending could reach $4 trillion over the next five years . Eddie said Alibaba needs to keep up with that pace or risk getting left behind. Alibaba is now pursuing the same opportunity as Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta. Those companies are expected to spend $364 billion on AI next year, up from an earlier estimate of $325 billion. The company also signed an agreement with Nvidia to use its training tools for robotics and self-driving vehicles. Financial terms weren’t disclosed, but the partnership carries weight. U.S. restrictions have made it harder for Chinese companies to purchase Nvidia’s chips, so Alibaba is finding ways around those limits. Other Chinese firms are also developing domestic chips to replace American technology, including the processors used to train and operate large AI systems. Eddie said the company wants to become a complete AI provider, which includes making its own chips. The cloud division already serves clients in the U.S. and Australia and is now expanding its reach. New data centers are opening in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands. These facilities will support the next phase of Alibaba’s AI infrastructure. The company’s stock has climbed 110% in 2025. Cloud revenue grew 26% year-over-year in the second quarter. Eddie identified AI, cloud, and e-commerce as the company’s three main growth drivers, with AI now taking the leading role. Other companies are seeing similar effects from AI investments. Oracle is putting $35 billion into AI infrastructure for 2026, with that number expected to reach $65 billion by 2029. Thanks to new partnerships with OpenAI, Meta, and SoftBank, Oracle’s stock has surged, adding $390 billion in value this year.
