The reason for this bullish outlook is a presale that is selling millions of tokens daily, a pace that is rapidly pushing the once-distant dream of a $1 valuation well within reach. This explosive momentum has propelled Ruvi AI past the $4 million fundraising milestone. A burgeoning community of over 3,900 holders has already acquired more than 285 million RUVI tokens , a testament to the project’s incredible demand. This record-breaking sales velocity is a clear signal that the market views Ruvi AI as a project with the potential for an earth-shattering rally, far exceeding the initial performance of many now-established coins. Smashing Forecasts with Unprecedented Demand The comparison to Avalanche’s early days is significant. While AVAX created a wave of crypto millionaires, Ruvi AI’s current trajectory suggests it could deliver even more explosive returns. The key difference is the sheer speed of token sales. By selling millions of tokens each day, Ruvi AI is demonstrating a level of market hunger that analysts say is rare and often precedes a massive price surge. This isn’t just speculative hype. Ruvi AI’s value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its credibility is further solidified by a successful CyberScope audit, which assures investors of its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , signaling to the broader market that it is a serious contender. This powerful combination of utility and trust is why experts believe its $1 price target is becoming a realistic short-term goal. The Super App Fueling the $1 Valuation Goal The engine driving Ruvi AI’s historic demand is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is designed to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token and support its journey to $1. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining the creative process. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative workflow for maximum efficiency. Last Call: Guaranteed 40% Price Jump Is Locked In The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at a ground-floor entry of just $0.020 . However, this opportunity is disappearing at an astonishing rate. In a powerful demonstration of its in-demand status, 20% of the Phase 3 token allocation was sold in just a few days . According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns as RUVI heads towards its $1 goal: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s vibrant community. The Verdict With a presale demand that outpaces even the early days of market titans, Ruvi AI has proven it has the momentum and fundamentals for a historic run. For investors looking to get in on the ground floor of a project with a realistic path to a $1 valuation, the time to act is now.

As such, traders should expect the coin to continue trading in the $2.70-3.10 mark for the next few days. Key levels to watch are $2.65 and $3.15 with each level suggesting a breakout from the trend. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market capitalization, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR’s innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant medium term growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions.

Now the price has returned to the $2.70 mark but struggles in climbing higher. Will NEAR recover? NEAR protocol price has seen a massive selloff in the last thirty days as price fell from near the $3.00 mark to the current $2 price level.

NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next several years. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable price prediction. However, the project must keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem.

The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35.

In mid-July, the price of NEAR Protocol surged toward the high of $3 but it started to decay in the later half of the month, a trend that continued in August with NEAR closing the month at $2.38.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|NEAR|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 21:04:25

Meanwhile, the US Senate has scheduled a hearing to examine the subject of taxation of crypto assets. Here are some of the biggest developments of the week.

The funding round saw participation from several firms and investors, and did not have a lead investor. Naver Financial is set to acquire Dunamu, the entity operating Upbit, one of South Korea’s most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. The acquisition will be completed via a share-swap deal and will make Dunamu a wholly-owned subsidiary of Naver Financial. Tether , the entity behind USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, is in talks to raise $20 billion at a $500 billion valuation. If the deal goes through, it would make Tether one of the world’s most valuable companies alongside OpenAI and SpaceX.

The robo-farm, developed in partnership with KanayaAI and tokenization platform DualMint, brings AI-driven automation and real-world assets together in a new model for sustainable, community-driven agriculture. Security CoinStats has integrated the Glider Token Risk, a breakthrough scanning technology from cybersecurity firm Hexens. The new integration brings advanced token analysis tools to traders worldwide. It also gives them instant access to over 22 smart contract risks before they buy. Regulation The United States Senate has scheduled a high-profile hearing on October 1 to examine the taxation of crypto assets. The hearing will involve several industry experts, including representatives from Coinbase and Coin Center. Canada’s FINTRAC has imposed a C$19.6 million ($14.09 million) penalty on Peken Global Limited, the entity operating KuCoin. FINTRAC states the platform failed to comply with Canadian anti-money laundering policies. However, KuCoin has appealed the decision in court. Senator Elizabeth Warren , along with several Democrats and ethics lawyers, has called for an investigation into potential ethics violations related to deals with the United Arab Emirates. The Trump administration has recently relaxed restrictions on the sale of sensitive national security technology to the United Arab Emirates. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) plans to allow tokenized assets, including stablecoins, to be used as collateral in derivatives markets.

The flagship cryptocurrency is trading around $109,570. The market is divided over BTC’s next move, with some predicting a drop to $60,000, while others favor a push towards $140,000. Vanadi Coffee Approves Bitcoin (BTC) Investment The Spanish coffee shop franchise-turned Bitcoin treasury company has approved a €1 billion investment in Bitcoin . The approval came in an extraordinary shareholder meeting, with the company highlighting the value of Bitcoin as a global, liquid, and decentralized reserve asset that can withstand the volatility affecting markets. Vanadi Coffee claims to be the first Bitcoin treasury in Spain, and plans to leverage BTC as a long-term asset and a hedge against inflation. The company added that the investment plan will be conducted with complete transparency, in accordance with local regulations. Salvador Martí, President of Vanadi Coffee, called the development a milestone for the company. “We believe in Bitcoin as a store of value for the future and as an asset capable of strengthening management with a long-term vision, transparency, and discipline.” Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops To Lowest Level Since March The cryptocurrency market is in a nervous mood after Bitcoin (BTC) lost key levels over the week. Investor sentiment has been battered, causing the market’s Fear & Greed Index to drop by 16 points in a single day. The index fell to 28 on Friday, its lowest level since March, before recovering to 33. Bitcoin started the week above $115,000, but price crashes on Monday and Thursday pushed the price below the key $109,000 level. This triggered liquidations of over $1 billion in long positions. The crash in the Fear & Greed Index highlights how quickly market sentiment can change when important levels fail to hold. However, fearful conditions are also an opportunity for long-term traders to add to their holdings at a discount. Analysts believe Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could be closer to their next recovery phase than many expect, with some traders already bracing for a turnaround. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down during the ongoing session, maintaining its position above $109,000. The flagship cryptocurrency faced extended bearish pressure this week, crashing nearly 4% on Thursday to fall below $110,000 and settle at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61%, but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline. BTC is trading around $109,500 during the ongoing session. Meanwhile, traders are divided about BTC’s next move, with some predicting a crash to $60,000, while others believe it will rally to $140,000. Multiple analyses state that the price could repeat the same trajectory that foreshadowed the 2021 market top. One analyst highlighted that in 2021, BTC registered a sharp rally to record highs, followed by a blow-off top, a sharp correction, and lastly, a failed test of resistance levels. The sequence triggered a crash that sent the price from $69,000 to $32,000 in weeks. The analyst points out that BTC’s current structure is mirroring the same process and risks a similar trajectory. However, not everyone expects market-ending declines. One trader highlighted a cluster by the 200-day simple and exponential moving averages, which could serve as a support during bull market dips. Analyst Bitbull believes BTC is still far from a cycle top, highlighting that the US Business Cycle, a broad indicator of economic momentum, has yet to peak. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $114,724. It recovered from this level to settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30%. BTC reached an intraday high of $117,998 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,117. The price lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.22% to $115,690. Source: TradingView BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping 0.41% on Sunday to end the weekend at $115,282. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $111,761 on Monday as bearish sentiment intensified. It recovered from this level to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday as BTC reached an intraday high of $113,357. However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $112,017, ultimately dropping 0.64%.

Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $110,369 before settling at $109,697. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline.

In the following lines, we break down the chilling details of the crime and examine whether this story had anything resembling a happy ending. The Bone-Chilling Thriller Grant – a small town in the state of Minnesota – recently became the scene of a brutal crypto-related crime. On September 19, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch Center received a 911 call from a man reporting that he and his family had been held at gunpoint during a violent home invasion by two armed suspects. The individuals in question were the brothers Raymond Christian Garcia and Isiah Angelo Garcia. Earlier that day, the father of the man who called 911 was taking out a garbage can to the street when the alleged criminals suddenly attacked him with an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun. The brothers took the victim into the garage, where they bound his hands and brought him into the house. They later woke up his wife and adult son at gunpoint and also zipped their hands, forcing them to lie on the floor. Raymond Garcia supposedly held the wife and son in their residence for nine hours, while his brother forced the father (Victim 1) to log into his cryptocurrency accounts. He demanded that the victim transfer huge amounts of digital assets into a designated wallet provided by the attackers. “During the robbery, Victim 1 saw both Garcia brothers frequently making phone calls to an unknown third party, who appeared to be providing the information related to the cryptocurrency accounts and transfers,” the official announcement reads. Through this third party, the brother became aware that the father had additional crypto funds and demanded access to them. The victim explained that the assets were stored on a hard drive at a family cabin, approximately three hours away. Isiah Garcia forced the man into his truck and drove to the location where the remaining funds were transferred. In total, the victim sent $8 million worth of digital assets to the attackers’ wallets. The son of Victim 1, who was held at gunpoint while Isiah Garcia was gone, used a brief opportunity to call 911. The police officers were quick to react, and when they arrived, they found Raymond Garcia running out through the back door. For his part, Isiah Garcia (who was returning to the house with the truck) saw the chaos, ditched the vehicle and his weapon, and walked towards a nearby middle school parking lot. To protect the safety of the pupils, Mahtomedi Public Schools was forced to cancel its homecoming football game. In the next few days, the law enforcement officers checked video surveillance cameras and tracked the brothers’ previous locations, and managed to arrest them on September 22 in Texas. What Now? The incident was described by Acting US Attorney Joseph H. Thompson as “a blow to the sense of safety in everyone in Minnesota.” “This is not normal. Minnesotans should not accept wild violence and thievery as normal. Every Minnesotan deserves to live in peace and a life unaffected by rampant crime,” he added. On September 23, the Garcia brothers were charged by complaint in Washington County, Minnesota, with three counts of kidnapping with a firearm, one count of first-degree aggravated robbery, and three counts of first-degree burglary. The following day, they were both charged in a federal complaint with kidnapping. The attackers were scheduled to make their initial appearances in federal court on September 25, at which time the government will request their detention pending trial. “As alleged in the complaint, the Garcia brothers terrorized a Minnesota family in their own home, kidnapping one family member while holding the rest of the family hostage in order to conduct a brazen cryptocurrency theft. This office, together with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners in Minnesota and in Texas, will work tirelessly to hold accountable those responsible for this horrific crime,” FBI Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston, Sr assured.

52401881,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=822253,1759094639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52401881.jpeg,Poland’s crypto law met with criticism and backlash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/poland-adopts-controversial-crypto-law/,"Lawmakers in Poland have approved a bill designed to regulate the country’s cryptocurrency market in accordance with the latest EU rules. Critics say, however, that the legislation goes beyond European requirements, stirring controversy, not just in the crypto community, but in Polish politics as well. Crypto act passed amid concerns over excessive regulation The Sejm, the lower house of Polish parliament, has adopted a new law implementing the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations in the EU member state. The legislation, which has been in the making for quite some time, aims to impose order in Poland’s crypto space, arguably the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. It has been criticized, however, for attempting to overregulate the nation’s crypto industry, stifling innovation and threatening to kill the business of domestic firms that work with digital assets. On Friday, 230 members of the chamber voted in favor of the bill, another 196 rejected it, with no abstentions. The Crypto Assets Act will now go to the Senate, the upper house of parliament in Poland. The government-sponsored law should ensure protection for customers and other market participants from what has been described as “dishonest entities,” the Polish PAP news agency reported. It introduces criminal liability for certain violations such as provision of crypto services and issuance of digital tokens without authorization, and defines the obligations of approved platforms. Its provisions stipulate that Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) will be tasked to supervise the sector and equipped with the appropriate tools to conduct oversight. The KNF will be responsible for registering violations of the new rules and fraudulent activities involving operations with cryptocurrencies. Perpetrators of the most serious offences will face harsh penalties, including fines of up to 10 million Polish złoty ($120,000) and even imprisonment for up to two years. The bill regulates online cryptocurrency exchanges, which will again be supervised by the KNF. They will be required to maintain individual client accounts, which should protect user funds, PAP detailed. According to official data, released earlier this year, 18% of Poles have already invested in crypto assets, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. In July, Deputy Finance Minister of Poland Jurand Drop insisted the proposed regulations are crucial for strengthening investor protection. He also noted the lack of mechanisms to fight fraud, pointing out: “20% of investors in this market declare they have been victims of some kind of fraud or abuse.” Poland’s crypto law met with criticism and backlash The long-awaited legislation was not accepted well by members of the country’s crypto community and the parliamentary opposition, who criticized it throughout its review in the Sejm. While transposing MiCA into national law “sounds innocent,” the crypto act is a “real horror” for crypto entrepreneurs, the crypto news outlet Bitcoin.pl wrote in an article on Saturday. Highlighting some of the powers granted to Poland’s financial regulator, which stirred the industry on the weekend, the Polish portal commented: “The crypto assets law gives the KNF permissions that resemble a repression apparatus rather than market supervision.” They come with “fees, which can simply finish smaller companies” and the “clear guidelines” are just restrictions and costly requirements that will suffocate innovation, the website elaborated, adding: “This law can deal a fatal blow to domestic companies operating in the crypto sector.” The exodus of Polish cryptocurrency firms may have already started, with XTB, one of the largest brokers in Poland, signaling it may seek a license in Cyprus. Jakub Bartoszek, president of the crypto exchange service Cashify, emphasized that the Polish implementation of MiCA is one of the most extensive, imposing high entry costs and multiplies barriers. The crypto entrepreneur expressed hope that Polish President Karol Nawrocki “will listen to the voice of the market and veto the law in its current form,” something the head of state has indicated he may do. During debates in the Sejm, Bitcoin proponent and former presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen also urged Nawrocki, who took office in August, to stop the bill.

Co przyniesie ostatni kwartał 2025 roku?",https://bitcoinist.com/nowa-fala-adopcji-krypto-4-kwartal-2025/,"Rynek kryptowalut wchodzi w ostatni kwartał 2025 roku z dużą dynamiką. Decyzje amerykańskich regulatorów, rosnące zainteresowanie funduszy ETF oraz nowe projekty technologiczne sprawiają, że inwestorzy zastanawiają się, jak ulokować swoje środki. Nie chodzi już tylko o Bitcoina czy Ethereum. Dziś na radarze pojawiają się zarówno dojrzałe aktywa, jak XRP, jak i świeże inicjatywy w rodzaju Snorter Token. Nadchodzi nowa fala adopcji kryptowalut. XRP kandydatem do trzeciego miejsca na podium ETF-ów Ostatnie tygodnie przyniosły istotne informacje dla rynku. SEC analizuje sześć wniosków o uruchomienie spot ETF-ów powiązanych z XRP. Wśród aplikujących są takie podmioty jak Grayscale, 21Shares czy WisdomTree. Decyzje mają zapaść między 18 a 25 października . XRP SPOT ETF TRACKER OCTOBER WILL BE HISTORIC: Grayscale — OCT 18 21Shares — OCT 19 Bitwise — OCT 20 Canary Capital — OCT 23 WisdomTree — OCT 24 Franklin Templeton — OCT 25 CoinShares — OCT 25 $XRP Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/PrNW0GevU4 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 26, 2025 Analitycy wskazują, że ewentualna zgoda oznaczałaby otwarcie drzwi dla ogromnego kapitału instytucjonalnego. Cytując jednego z ekspertów: Zatwierdzenie ETF-ów na XRP może uruchomić rotację płynności z Bitcoina i skierować uwagę funduszy na trzecią co do wielkości kryptowalutę pod względem adopcji regulacyjnej . Warto zauważyć, że Bitcoin już korzysta z efektu ETF-ów, a Ethereum powoli podąża jego śladem. Jeśli XRP dołączy do tego grona, układ sił na rynku może się zmienić. Derywatywy budują fundamenty pod dalszy wzrost Nie tylko ETF-y napędzają oczekiwania wobec XRP. Coraz większą rolę odgrywa rynek instrumentów pochodnych. Dane CME pokazują, że otwarte pozycje na kontraktach futures na XRP przekroczyły 1 miliard dolarów, co jest najszybszym wzrostem wśród wszystkich kryptowalut w tym kwartale. CME ogłosiło także, że od 13 października uruchomi opcje na XRP oraz kontrakty Micro XRP. Dzięki temu inwestorzy instytucjonalni otrzymają regulowane narzędzia do ekspozycji na XRP – komentują analitycy. Równolegle Ripple stara się o licencję bankową w USA, która w przypadku powodzenia zapewni jej bezpośredni dostęp do systemu bankowego. To ruch, który zwiększyłby wiarygodność projektu w oczach największych inwestorów. XRP w kluczowym punkcie Z technicznego punktu widzenia XRP znajduje się w formacji trójkąta zniżkującego. Dolne wsparcie w rejonie 2,70 USD pozostaje nieprzełamane, ale każdy test tego poziomu budzi nerwowość. Średnia krocząca 50-dniowa na poziomie 2,96 USD zatrzymuje kolejne próby wybicia w górę. Świece z długimi cieniami pokazują walkę podaży z popytem, a RSI w okolicach 40 sugeruje brak wyraźnego momentum. Scenariusze są jasne: byki mogą przejąć inicjatywę dopiero po zamknięciu dnia powyżej 3,00 USD, niedźwiedzie liczą na spadek w okolice 2,59 USD. Rynek czeka więc na katalizator, a takim może być październikowa decyzja SEC. Snorter Token – nowe narzędzie na Solanie Podczas gdy XRP walczy o regulacyjną legitymizację, na drugim końcu spektrum pojawiają się projekty świeże i innowacyjne. Jednym z nich jest Snorter Token . Jest on botem tradingowym działającym w ekosystemie Solany. Jego presale zebrał już ponad 4 miliony dolarów, a do zakończenia sprzedaży pozostało jedynie 25 dni. Aktualna cena wynosi 0,1063 USD. W świecie, gdzie inwestorzy nieustannie poszukują kryptowalut z potencjałem x1000 , Snorter wzbudza zainteresowanie dzięki połączeniu technologii i marketingu. Dlaczego Solana? Szybkość i niskie koszty Snorter został oparty na Solanie, ponieważ sieć ta zapewnia błyskawiczne transakcje i minimalne prowizje. To kluczowa przewaga nad botami działającymi na Ethereum, które często zmagają się z wysokimi opłatami i przeciążeniami sieci. Główna funkcja Snortera to wykrywanie nowych tokenów jeszcze zanim staną się popularne. Bot monitoruje mempoole zarówno Solany, jak i Ethereum, wychwytując świeże projekty i pierwsze oznaki płynności. Dzięki temu użytkownicy mogą wchodzić w rynek szybciej niż reszta inwestorów. Bezpieczeństwo przede wszystkim Twórcy Snortera podkreślają, że nie chodzi o ślepe polowanie na każdy nowy token. Wbudowane filtry kontraktów i mechanizmy anty-rug mają minimalizować ryzyko związane z oszustwami czy tzw. rug pullami. Warto przypomnieć, że wielu inwestorów, którzy w 2021 roku kupowali Dogecoina czy Shiba Inu na szczytach, do dziś pozostaje na stratach. Snorter ma działać odwrotnie. Ma na celu umożliwiać wejście w projekt na wczesnym etapie i wyjście z zyskiem, gdy szerszy rynek dopiero się dowiaduje o jego istnieniu. Token SNORT – serce ekosystemu Posiadanie tokena SNORT odblokowuje pełnię możliwości bota. Najważniejsze korzyści to: obniżona prowizja za handel do 0,85% (konkurencja często pobiera 1,5–2%), unlimited snipes – możliwość uczestnictwa w dowolnej liczbie projektów, dostęp do zaawansowanych analiz, udział w głosowaniach nad rozwojem projektu, staking z dynamicznym APY sięgającym 115%. Każdy z tych elementów zwiększa popyt na token i jednocześnie ogranicza jego podaż w obiegu. Śpiesz się, presale jest na finiszu Presale Snortera kończy się za 21 dni. Po tym terminie token trafi na giełdy, gdzie jego cena prawdopodobnie wzrośnie wraz z popytem. Inwestorzy mają ograniczone okno czasowe, aby wejść na preferencyjnych warunkach. Zakupu można dokonać za pomocą SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, a także kartą kredytową. Rekomendowanym rozwiązaniem jest portfel Best Wallet. W praktyce odpowiedź na pytanie jak kupić Snorter Token sprowadza się więc do kilku kliknięć. Kryptowaluty łączą technologię i kulturę Przypadek Snortera pokazuje szerszy trend. Kryptowaluty coraz częściej łączą dwa światy, czyli zaawansowaną technologię i społecznościowy marketing. To połączenie może sprawić, że projekt zyska finalny sukces poprzez kompleksowe podjeście. W tym sensie Snorter staje się ciekawym uzupełnieniem dynamicznej sceny kryptowalut, w której z jednej strony instytucje czekają na decyzje SEC w sprawie XRP, a z drugiej inwestorzy indywidualni polują na kolejne okazje.",Altcoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BTC|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-28 21:24:40

The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $6.61 in 2031. Worldcoin (WLD) is garnering significant attention from both investors and enthusiasts, a trend that aligns with broader market predictions. In early May, WLD experienced a notable surge, quickly positioning itself among the top-performing altcoins. This rise coincided with a spike in activity surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly those related to OpenAI. The increased interest in Worldcoin is likely fueled by speculation surrounding potential collaborations and future projects that could integrate AI technology into the cryptocurrency space, further driving its market momentum.

Resistance holds sellers at $1.31, limiting recovery attempts. Bearish structure with lower highs and lows confirms bearish market control. On September 28, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) trades at $1.25, marking a 3.50% decline in the last 24 hours. The token shows a clear downtrend as it tests key support at $1.25, with immediate resistance placed at $1.31. Over the course of the day, WLD struggled to hold gains after brief upward momentum, reflecting ongoing selling pressure. The current price also stands significantly lower than its all-time high of $11.82, recorded on March 10, 2024, representing a steep 89.44% drop in value over time. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD bearish momentum holds ground On the daily timeframe, WLD displays a consistent pattern of lower highs and lower lows, signaling sustained bearish pressure. Price action shows that every recovery attempt above $1.30 quickly meets resistance, with sellers tightening control around this area. The $1.31 resistance level is proving to be a critical ceiling, repeatedly rejecting bullish attempts to break higher. The inability to establish strength above this zone highlights weakened buying interest and declining momentum. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Meanwhile, the $1.25 level is emerging as a crucial support zone that could dictate the next directional move. If bears manage to push below this threshold, WLD risks opening the path toward deeper retracement levels, which could attract further selling pressure. Conversely, a successful defense of $1.25 could provide temporary relief, though upside potential remains capped unless volume builds strongly toward $1.31. This tug-of-war between support and resistance defines the current structure of the daily chart. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD pressure builds at support On the 4-hour timeframe, WLD reflects sharp selling activity after failing to consolidate gains above $1.29. The repeated rejections below resistance show that bulls lack the strength to drive a sustained recovery. Sellers are firmly defending the $1.29–$1.31 zone, forcing price action downward in successive waves. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Currently, the price continues to press against the $1.25 support level, raising concerns about a potential breakdown if momentum fails to reverse. If this floor is lost, the bearish move could accelerate quickly, as traders may trigger stop losses near this level. To regain strength, WLD would need to climb back above $1.29 and retest $1.31 with higher volume, but until that happens, pressure remains skewed to the downside.

Worldcoin’s immediate outlook depends heavily on how the $1.25 support reacts to ongoing selling pressure. A breakdown below this level could accelerate the downtrend, opening the way for deeper losses as bearish sentiment strengthens. If buyers manage to defend $1.25, the token may attempt a short-lived rebound. However, any recovery is likely to face resistance around $1.29–$1.31, where sellers have consistently regained control. Until WLD breaks above this ceiling, the broader market bias remains bearish. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin’s sharp decline from its all-time high of $11.82 to $1.25 highlights the risks tied to its volatile performance. The token has lost more than 89% of its value since March 2024, underscoring weak long-term momentum despite short-term trading opportunities. At present, the price action reflects heavy bearish control, with support at $1.25 under constant pressure and resistance capped at $1.31. Market participants view these levels as decisive for WLD’s next direction, but without a break above resistance, upside potential remains limited. Investors tracking Worldcoin are weighing its underlying utility and adoption against its prolonged decline. For now, sentiment leans cautious, as the asset struggles to attract sustained buying interest while trading at multi-month lows. Why is the WLD Price Down today The drop in WLD to $1.25 comes as bearish sentiment dominates the market, with sellers overpowering buyers at every recovery attempt. Repeated failures to break above $1.31 have reinforced downward pressure, leaving traders cautious about taking long positions. Market activity shows that momentum has shifted firmly in favor of sellers, with liquidity thinning around key support levels. Broader weakness across altcoins has also weighed on WLD, amplifying its decline and keeping the token locked in a tight range between $1.25 and $1.31. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2031. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success. Worldcoin price prediction September 2025 Worldcoin is expected to exhibit a range of price movements in September 2025. The potential low is $0.84, while the average price might be around $1.30.

Optimists argue upgrades will eventually lift the project, but patience is wearing thin. In contrast, exciting new names like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are picking up traction quickly, with investors betting that speed, utility and community energy can deliver far stronger returns than the slow-moving ADA ecosystem. ADA price pressure mounts Cardano (ADA) has long been praised for its academic and research-first approach, but that steady pace hasn’t always rewarded short-term traders. At the moment, the ADA price sits close to the $0.50 mark, which many view as a key psychological level. A break below could trigger fresh selling pressure, with some analysts warning of a slide into the mid-40 cent range if momentum doesn’t return. Although ADA still benefits from a loyal community and a strong development team, the crypto market has become increasingly competitive. Faster, cheaper and more flexible tokens are drawing in capital that might otherwise have flowed into Cardano. For holders, this raises a difficult question: Wait for ADA’s slow-but-steady progress, or rotate into newer projects. Layer Brett’s presale surge In sharp contrast to Cardano’s cautious progress, Layer Brett (LBRETT) has come out of the gate swinging. The token sits at just $0.0058 in presale and has already pulled in more than $4 million, showing how quickly demand is building. Early buyers are also being rewarded with staking returns that remain above 620% APY at the time of writing, although yields will fall as more wallets join the pool, giving first movers the strongest upside. Crucially, Layer Brett is not relying on hype alone. As an Ethereum Layer 2 project, it brings faster transactions and lower costs, while the roadmap outlines NFT rollouts, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging. Buying is kept deliberately easy: Connect a wallet, use ETH or USDT, and tokens are secured in minutes. For presale investors, this combination of meme-style virality and serious technical underpinnings has made LBRETT one of the most talked-about launches of the year. Social traction and upcoming giveaway Momentum around Layer Brett isn’t only about presale numbers. Its community presence is growing fast across multiple platforms. Telegram and X groups are closing in on 10k members each, TikTok has already passed 25k followers, and YouTube reviewers are adding to the buzz with growing view counts. This visibility is helping LBRETT reach investors who might never have considered getting in early on a meme-driven project. Adding fuel to the fire, the team has hinted at a $1 million giveaway designed to reward early adopters and keep engagement high. Community-driven marketing of this kind is proving powerful and it’s a sharp contrast to Cardano’s slower, development-focused communication style. ADA vs. LBRETT: where’s the upside? For cautious investors, ADA remains a respectable hold with long-term potential if its upgrades gain traction. It has history, credibility and a strong base of supporters. But for those looking for bigger multiples in the near term, Layer Brett is making the stronger case. With its presale still under one cent, staking returns above 600 percent, viral community growth and a utility-rich roadmap, LBRETT is being tipped to move from fractions of a penny to $1 and beyond. That’s the kind of breakout Cardano holders haven’t enjoyed in years. While ADA price movements are tied to slow ecosystem progress, Layer Brett is proving that speed, hype and utility together can create an outsized opportunity. Secure your LBRETT tokens today — the presale is live, and early entry won’t last forever.

Priced at $0.035, Mutuum Finance is storming the market. The project remains in presale phase 6 that is more than 50% sold out. Having already raised well over $16.5 million in presale, with more than 16,620 holders, MUTM has been hailed by analysts as the “next SHIB” on account of its growth potential. And unlike SHIB, whose growth comes from community hype, MUTM comes with actual utility from its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that combines peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract models. With great staking rewards, good security audits, and a clearly defined roadmap, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling chance for investors to reap great rewards and a real DeFi-supported alternative to traditional meme coins. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: October Momentum Builds Amid Burn Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) is displaying hints of a potential bullish reversal heading into October, fueled by underlying on-chain events that can sustain a continued price resurgence. The token’s burn rate doubled 400% in 24 hours, removing over 1.15 million SHIB from circulation, an action that capped supply and added still more pressure to the price. Concurrently, token outflows from exchanges surged from $378,000 to 2.29 million tokens, a reflection of decreasing selling pressure as investors transferred assets from trading platforms, according to Coinglass. All these combined suggest SHIB can look forward to renewed traction in the coming weeks, and for those who are hoping for higher upside potential and with improved fundamentals, eyes are increasingly shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Momentum Accelerates Mutuum Finance recently launched the highly anticipated Stage Six presale. MUTM tokens now selling at $0.035, a 16.17% price appreciation over the previous round. Investor demand remains extremely robust, with more than 16,620 investors contributing more than $16.5 million of committed capital to date. To further enhance the security of the platform, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program where they welcome white-hat researchers and developers to identify bugs. They will be categorized into four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low, for thorough detection and speedy patching of possible vulnerabilities. Mutuum protocol is constructed around sound collateral management in a bid to protect the ecosystem and users. Some of the most noteworthy protective measures include perpetual collateral ratios, limits on loans, and deposit limits. Undercollateralized positions are quickly liquidated, while penalties and remediation fees stabilize the platform and minimize systemic risk. Efficiency is the central concept at Mutuum Finance. Through optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, and particularly overcollateralized positions, the protocol achieves maximum capital utilization with strong protection. Reserve requirements act as a market shock absorber, and surplus reserves can be invested profitably in riskier assets to offset volatility. Mutuum Finance’s vision is to redefine DeFi along three pillars: long-term sustainability, reliability, and access. Through the provision of a secure and scalable lending and borrowing platform, the platform is democratizing decentralized finance for retail as well as institutional customers. As a gesture of gratitude for the initial community engagement, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will be rewarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The action is one way of showing that Mutuum cares about rewarding the initial adopters of the project while promoting awareness for the cause. While Shiba Inu could stage a comeback in October, Mutuum Finance is a superior purchase. With over $16.5 million raised, 16,620+ investors, and tokens valued at $0.035 in Stage 6 presale, MUTM is blending true DeFi utility with strong security, staking benefits, and total lending solutions. Its pioneering platform and growing community place it above the rest as a meme coin alternative. Join the Mutuum Finance presale today to be on the ground floor before the next phase of growth.

This retest has been most visible in futures open interest, where billions of dollars in positions have been wiped out across major exchanges. This rapid unwinding comes as a correction move to weeks of excessive leverage during uptrends that had pushed derivatives activity to unsustainable levels. Related Reading: When Will XRP Reach $25? Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction Massive Open Interest Wipeout Across Major Exchanges The most recent Ethereum price correction was a broader market reset rather than a mere dip, with leveraged traders facing the brunt of the losses. Data shows that Ethereum’s open interest experienced a steep downfall over the just concluded week across multiple crypto exchanges. According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, billions worth of Ethereum positions were wiped out last week, with Binance leading the downturn with the steepest monthly average drop. Ethereum’s slide under the $4,000 mark proved to be the breaking point for over-leveraged traders. The move unleashed a wave of liquidations across derivatives markets, compounding selling pressure. Data shows that more than $3 billion was erased on September 23 through Binance alone, followed by over $1 billion just a day later. Bybit also shed $1.2 billion in positions, while OKX recorded a $580 million decline. The sharp reduction is visible in aggregate open interest, which has slumped to its lowest level since early 2024. As the chart data shows, futures leverage and open interest were closely tied to the price rally in July and August, and at the same time, it declined in lockstep with the price. Ethereum Open Interest by exchange Spot Ethereum ETF Outflows Add To Market Strain Ethereum’s break below $4,000 and the decline in open interest coincides with a week of heavy outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. According to data from Farside Investors, $795.56 million flowed out over five trading days last week, which is the largest weekly exodus since the products launched. The sell-off intensified toward the end of the week, with Thursday recording $251.2 million in outflows, followed by another $248.4 million on Friday. Waning institutinal participation contributed massively to the sell-side pressure, with investors showing caution amid uncertainty over whether regulators will allow staking features in these ETFs. This synchronized exit from both derivatives and institutional products has amplified volatility, creating a convergence of pressure across Ethereum’s trading ecosystem.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,002. Despite this attempt to regain stability, the leading altcoin is still down by about 10% in a weekly timeframe, considering it was trading around $4,490 this time last week. The bullish scenario now lies in whether ETH can reclaim and sustain a move above $4,000.

While established coins like Tron (TRX) offer stability, market analysts are issuing an urgent message: Tron can wait. The real, time-sensitive opportunity lies with Ruvi AI (RUVI), a project whose presale is moving at such a blistering pace that it’s being called one of the fastest-growing altcoins on the market. With Phase 3 hitting 20% completion in just a matter of days, the window to secure a ground-floor position is closing rapidly. This incredible speed is the latest chapter in a presale that has been nothing short of spectacular. Ruvi AI has officially soared past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens already claimed by a rapidly expanding global community of more than 3,900 holders . This level of demand is why experts are urging investors to prioritize Ruvi AI, as it shows all the signs of a project on the verge of a major price explosion. Why the Urgency? The Power of Unprecedented Growth Analysts are advising investors to shift their focus from coins like Tron because the potential for life-changing gains lies in early-stage projects with explosive momentum. Ruvi AI fits this description perfectly. Selling 20% of its Phase 3 allocation in mere days demonstrates a level of market hunger that is rare and often precedes a massive rally. This is not just speculative fervor. Ruvi AI’s value is firmly anchored in its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . Its credibility is further solidified by a successful CyberScope audit, assuring investors of its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , which signals to the broader market that it is a serious, high-growth AI contender. This combination of speed, utility, and trust is why experts are calling it a must-have for this bull cycle. The Super App Fueling a Record-Breaking Presale The engine driving Ruvi AI’s historic demand is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will create sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining the creative workflow. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. The Clock is Ticking: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . However, this ground-floor entry point is disappearing at an astonishing rate. With 20% of the stage’s allocation sold in days, the opportunity to buy at this price is extremely limited. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns for early supporters: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s vibrant community. The Verdict The message from market analysts is clear: while Tron has its place, the once-in-a-cycle opportunity for exponential growth is happening right now with Ruvi AI. With its record-breaking presale, powerful utility, and a guaranteed price increase just around the corner, the time to secure your position is now.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. At the start of September, Tron is trending near the $0.34 range, maintaining its price above $0.31, as the current Tron sentiment is bullish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 22:45:00

Some analysts believe a bounce is possible but others think momentum is fading as attention shifts to newer Ethereum-based tokens. Chief among them is Layer Brett (LBRETT) , a presale project already drawing comparisons to the viral breakouts of past meme cycles — and being tipped by some to deliver gains of more than 4600%. Pepe coin price prediction The Pepe coin price prediction has split opinions. On one side, bulls argue that PEPE still commands strong brand recognition as one of the leading meme tokens launched in 2023. Supporters point to deep liquidity and an established holder base as signs the token can recover quickly if market sentiment turns risk-on again. On the other side, skeptics highlight that PEPE has already seen its parabolic run and now struggles to find fresh catalysts. With the token sitting near crucial support, a break lower could undermine confidence further. Analysts who take the bearish view believe the best-case scenario is sideways trading, while more optimistic traders argue a rebound is still possible if volumes pick up. Layer Brett’s breakout potential While PEPE wrestles with support, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is climbing the charts of investor interest. Starting at just $0.0058 in presale, the project has already pulled in more than $4 million, a figure that shows how quickly demand is accelerating. Staking rewards are still sitting in the hundreds of percent — currently above 600% APY — though they reduce as more holders lock in, giving early movers the best shot at outsized gains. What sets Layer Brett apart is its Ethereum Layer 2 backbone. Low fees and faster speeds are paired with real utility features: NFT launches, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging all appear on the roadmap. Buying has also been kept simple, requiring only a wallet connection and ETH or USDT to secure tokens in minutes. It’s this blend of meme coin appeal and usable infrastructure that has analysts calling LBRETT the Ethereum meme with genuine staying power. Social traction and $1M giveaway tease Momentum behind Layer Brett isn’t just about numbers on a presale page. The project is seeing fast growth across social platforms, with Telegram and X groups closing in on 10k members each and TikTok already boasting over 25k followers. YouTube reviews are adding to the buzz, helping the token reach a wider audience. Adding to that excitement, the team has lined up a $1 million giveaway that has the community watching closely for details. It’s the kind of marketing push that keeps engagement levels high and helps LBRETT stand out against projects like PEPE, which are struggling to generate fresh momentum. PEPE vs. LBRETT — where traders see bigger upside For long-time holders, PEPE still has a role as one of the more established meme tokens, and any sharp market rally could lift its price off current support. But the ceiling may be limited compared to newer plays. With no major new catalysts, the risk is that PEPE trades sideways while attention drifts elsewhere. That’s where Layer Brett is capturing momentum. With a presale still under one cent, staking rewards in the hundreds of percent, viral growth across social media and a utility-driven roadmap, analysts suggest it could be on track for a move from $0.0058 to $1 — a return measured in multiples, not percentages. For traders seeking outsized opportunity, LBRETT is increasingly seen as the Ethereum meme play to watch in 2025. Early buyers are locking in LBRETT at presale — don’t miss your chance to do the same.

In an official Marumasa Hotta release , the firm said the name change will be officially instated at a meeting of shareholders on November 11. Marusho Hotta also announced that the company would change its English name to “Bitcoin Japan Corporation” as it begins stockpiling Bitcoin (BTC) . The company first announced its new Bitcoin treasury business operations after a June deal saw the US-based crypto custody player Bakkt Holdings agree to buy a controlling share in Marusho Hotta.

Read the full press release : https://t.co/XxHU3hm1Rf pic.twitter.com/Jon5t2iYnw — Bakkt (@Bakkt) September 22, 2025 Marusho Hotta: Bitcoin Pivot Under Bakkt The Japanese firm is one of the country’s most storied and best-known kimono makers and textile producers. It also operates a range of contemporary and hybrid fashion brands. But after years of falling sales and stagnation on the Tokyo Exchange, it was taken over by the Tokyo-based RIZAP Group in 2017. Bakkt made its move in June, claiming it hopes to become Marusho Hotta’s largest shareholder and transform the firm into “a leading Japanese Bitcoin treasury company.” In its September 26 release, Marusho Hotta wrote: “We have decided to launch a new business, the Bitcoin treasury business, so we can expand our business scope and expand into new fields in the future. We are also considering the launch of finance-related business operations.” These operations, it appears, will be primarily related to Marusho Hotta’s Bitcoin treasury operations.

(Image: Google Finance) New Management Confirmed The firm has also confirmed that Bakkt International President Phillip Lord will become Bitcoin Japan’s new CEO. Akshay Naheta, the co-chief executive officer of Bakkt Holdings, will assume the new role of Chairman of the Board of Directors. The company added that its new management structure would “further align the interests of directors and shareholders.” This, the firm said, will help the company “achieve a medium- to long-term improvement in corporate value.” More Textiles Firms Turn to BTC? Marusho Hotta was founded in 1861 and opened one of Japan’s first kimono wholesale stores in 1894. It floated on the Tokyo Exchange in 1974. Earlier this year, Kitabo, a TYO-listed synthetic yarns producer, announced its own plans to buy Bitcoin and “enter the cryptoasset and Real-World Asset (RWA) sectors.” Kitabo said it plans to buy around $5.4 million worth of Bitcoin in an initial foray into the market. The firm, like many others in the world of Japanese textiles and traditional clothing, has seen revenues plummet in recent years. In 2021, the EU-Japan Center for Industrial Cooperation noted that “old, traditional [Japanese] retailers have seen sales diminish as they become less and less viable.” The likes of Kitabo and Marusho Hotta have certainly felt the pinch. After racking up years of annual net losses, Kitbo posted a net loss of $785,000 for FY2024. Marusho Hotta, meanwhile, posted a net income of minus 407.32 million yen (-$2,724,439) for the same period.

(Source: @youtowa_official/Instagram) Metaplanet Leads Charge Kitabo said that it hopes to build up cross-border business avenues and partnerships with overseas firms. The firms are also likely to launch BTC lending services as part of their radical rebranding efforts. This year has seen scores of Japanese firms from all sorts of business sectors enter the Bitcoin treasury sector.

The buys came through names like Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, FalconX and OKX.

Exchange Balances Fall To 9-Year Low According to Glassnode data, the amount of ETH held on exchanges has plunged from roughly 31 million to about 14.8 million ETH — a drop of 52% from 2016 levels. Many of those coins are likely in staking contracts, cold wallets or institutional custody, and the recent launch of the first Ethereum staking ETF has helped pull more supply off exchanges. Lower exchange balances mean fewer coins ready to be sold instantly on exchanges, which can make price moves sharper when big orders hit the market. ETH Hovers Near $4,000 As Volatility Rises Based on TradingView readings, ETH is trading around $4,011, down roughly 0.33% over the last 24 hours and more than 10% over the past week. The token briefly slipped under $3,980 earlier in the session before climbing back, and it remains below a recent close of $4,034. This two-week pullback has returned ETH to a key $4,000 support area, and short-term swings have become more pronounced as holders reposition. $3,700 Becomes A Line In Sand Crypto analyst Ted Pillows has warned that the $3,700 to $3,800 zone could face heavy pressure. Reports note that if ETH falls below $3,700, many margin positions could be wiped out and spark forced selling that pushes prices lower. $ETH liquidity heatmap is showing decent long liquidations around the $3,700-$3,800 level. This level could be revisited again before Ethereum shows any recovery. pic.twitter.com/SQTbfrujAa — Ted (@TedPillows) September 27, 2025 With fewer coins on exchanges and concentrated margin exposure, the short-term outlook is more fragile even as longer-term demand indicators look solid. ETF Outflows Show Institutional Mood Can Flip US-listed ETH funds recorded nearly $800 million in outflows this week, their largest redemptions to date. Still, roughly $26 billion sits in Ethereum ETFs, equal to 5.37% of total supply.

Lookonchain data also highlighted a prior accumulation of roughly $204 million in ETH, showing similar patterns of large players stepping up during dips. Retail traders appear more cautious for now. But the sequence of big buys from institutional-grade custodians suggests some buyers view dips as buying chances while others choose to wait on the sidelines.

In the meantime, the project’s native token continues to be deep in the red on multiple scales and is close to charting another all-time low. Hackathon Halfway There CryptoPotato reported in August that the Pi Network Core Team had come up with a new way to engage with its Pioneers in the form of a hackathon. The 2025 event began on August 21 and its final submission is scheduled for October 15, with an optional midpoint check-in on September 19. The halfway video shows some of the applications that users have developed. The first is called Starmax, which allows users to buy goods with Pi in a simple way. Another one, dubbed Nature’s Pulse, connects consumers with farmers as it allows the former to purchase “fresh, affordable produce with Pi and get them delivered directly to them.” Eternal Rush is a Pi Network-native online game. ReloadPi enables Pi holders to spend their tokens on buying thousands of products from over 300 brands, including ordering pizza or other foods and beverages. StreamPi is a newly created application that caters to Pi investors, allowing them to upload their content and pay with just one token. The team also reminded that there will be a prize pool of 160,000 Pi tokens for up to eight teams and will be distributed in the following manner: 1st Place – 75,000 Pi 2nd Place – 45,000 Pi 3rd Place – 15,000 Pi Honorable Mentions (up to 5 teams) – 5,000 Pi each Pi Price Update Despite the evident success of the hackathon and other recent updates from the team, the project’s native token can’t catch a break. The asset marked a new all-time low last week at just over $0.25, and even though it tried to recover some ground, it was quickly halted and pushed south once again. It’s deep in the red on a weekly scale (25%) and currently sits just 2.3% above the ATL from September 22. The unlocking schedule for the next month is also somewhat concerning, as October 1 and October 4 will see the release of massive quantities, up to 13.4 million coins, which could intensify the immediate selling pressure.

The Math May Shock You,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-shib-really-ever-hit-1-the-math-may-shock-you/,"The Shiba Inu price prediction is back in the spotlight after another round of social media chatter asked the same question: Can SHIB ever really hit $1? Supporters argue that continued burns and ecosystem growth could fuel massive upside, while skeptics highlight just how huge the market cap would need to be for that milestone. At the same time, new tokens like Layer Brett (LBRETT) are drawing attention for more realistic paths to big gains — some forecasts even put its upside in the thousands of percent. Shiba Inu price prediction The Shiba Inu price prediction has always divided the crypto space. On the bullish side, enthusiasts point to token burns and an expanding ecosystem, including Shibarium, as reasons why SHIB could climb much higher in the next cycle. They argue that community backing remains one of the strongest in crypto and that virality can sometimes override traditional valuation models. On the other hand, the math behind SHIB hitting $1 is daunting. At current supply levels, it would require a market cap larger than the entire crypto industry combined. That’s why many analysts believe the realistic ceiling is far lower, perhaps fractions of a cent, unless supply reductions dramatically accelerate. The Shiba Inu price prediction heading into 2025 therefore ranges from modest gains to sideways action, with a moonshot to $1 considered highly unlikely. Layer Brett’s growth story While SHIB wrestles with questions of scale, Layer Brett is being framed as a meme coin with real upside potential. Priced at just $0.0058, the presale has already raised more than $4 million, showing clear demand from investors looking for the next viral hit. At the time of writing, staking rewards sit above 600% APY , though these will reduce as more wallets join, rewarding early adopters the most. What sets Layer Brett apart from older meme coins is its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation. Transactions are faster and cheaper and the roadmap adds utility beyond memes: NFT launches, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging are all in the pipeline. To buy, just connect a wallet, use ETH or USDT and tokens are secured in minutes. For many, this balance of accessibility, hype and utility is exactly what makes LBRETT a standout in today’s market. Social momentum and the $1M giveaway tease Community energy has been a decisive factor in meme coin success and Layer Brett is already building serious traction. Telegram and X groups are closing in on 10k members each, while TikTok has surged past 25k followers. On top of that, YouTube reviews and breakdowns are helping spread the word beyond the core crypto crowd. To keep engagement high, the team has teased a $1 million giveaway as part of its roadmap. That move is designed to reward early supporters and add another layer of excitement as the presale heads into later stages. Combined with viral social buzz, it positions LBRETT as a project with momentum that SHIB has struggled to recreate since its 2021 breakout. Shiba Inu vs. Layer Brett: The case for bigger multiples By contrast, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is being tipped as the more realistic path to outsized returns. With a presale price under one cent, staking rewards as high as 600 percent and a roadmap stacked with utility, analysts argue the token has far more room to run. For early-stage buyers, it offers the kind of explosive multiples that SHIB can no longer realistically deliver. Presale demand is climbing fast — secure your LBRETT allocation before the next price rise.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $2.29. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $3.72 and an average forecast price of $3.58. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The EOS ecosystem has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 in the near future? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.401 (-1.32%) Market Cap $640.38M Trading Volume $371.3K Circulating Supply 1.59B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4027 (Nov 04, 2024) 24-hour High $0.4073 24-hour Low $0.3999 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.441984 (9.92%) Price Volatility 5.33% 50-Day SMA $0.488746 14-Day RSI 29.43 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 37 (Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.578938 EOS price analysis: Negative market sentiment pushes EOS price toward $0.401 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downward market trend toward $0.401. The altcoin lost 1.32% of its value. The EOS coin looks for support around $0.389. On September 28, the EOS price analysis revealed a bearish daily trend for the altcoin. The EOS price experienced significant losses, reaching $0.401 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the altcoin lost up to 1.32% of its value today, as sellers continue to rule the market, causing further price depreciation. The altcoin has now been losing value for a second consecutive day, targeting the next support at $0.389. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirms a decreasing trend as the price moves downward. The EOS/USD value dipped to $0.401 today. The appearance of red candlesticks on the price chart signifies a bearish trend. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.517. The indicator’s lower limit, which serves as the support, has shifted to $0.389. EOSUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 30.38 and is at the brink of entering the oversold region. The downward curve on the RSI graph signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further instability in the market can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also shows selling pressure building up at the current price level. The altcoin’s value has decreased to $0.401 as bears are trying to dominate the price action. Low levels of volatility mark a lesser chance of a reversal in market trends or further price depreciation. The Bollinger Bands have converged, hinting at low volatility. This low level of volatility signifies increased market predictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.412, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.396, indicating support. EOSUSD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 36.19, the RSI curve is pointing downwards, confirming the selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates significant pressure from the selling side of the market. We can expect further depreciation if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

The EOS price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The EOS/USD value has decreased to $0.401 in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further decrease in price levels to retest the support of $0.389. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent resistance around the $0.405 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and took the price to $0.401. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is striving to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the price trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2028 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031, which makes it a good option to buy EOS, though accurate predictions are nearly impossible in the crypto market. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $3.72 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 90th-ranked cryptocurrency. It also experienced strong bullish sentiment in November last year, when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $3.88 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. In mid-July 2025, EOS recovered to $0.625. However, at the start of September, EOS is trending near $0.47 after a price drop, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-28 23:55:00

One of such comments was made in an old interview which has resurfaced to catch the eye of some XRP investors on the social media platform X. Years later, those comments are being revisited as XRP continues to push for adoption in global markets and as investors are counting down to the SEC’s upcoming decision on Spot XRP ETF applications. Utility Over Hype: Revisiting Garlinghouse’s Message A recent video which was posted on the social media platform X by popular XRP commentator JackTheRippler ties back into an interview where Garlinghouse noted how trillions in capital could pour into XRP in the coming years. In that conversation, Garlinghouse explained that hype alone cannot sustain the value of any cryptocurrency, insisting instead that true growth comes from solving real-world problems and building a customer base. These comments were made in a 2017 interview on CNBC’s Squawk Alley, at a time when cryptocurrencies were mostly valued on speculation alone. In the interview, Garlinghouse pointed out that XRP wasn’t just created to trade on exchanges but was meant to serve a real purpose, which is settling liquidity between banks.

Even though those words were spoken years ago, they still fit into today’s conversations about XRP. Its adoption potential in the worldwide financial system continues to be the foundation of why many investors believe XRP can stand apart from other cryptocurrencies. Countdown To US SEC’s Spot XRP ETF Decision The attention surrounding XRP nowadays is shifting to the regulatory front, with many investors awaiting the outcome of pending Spot XRP ETF applications . After Bitcoin and Ethereum won approval for similar products, many see XRP as the next logical step given its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency. The US SEC has introduced new listing standards designed to speed up crypto ETF approvals, cutting the review window to 75 days or less. Grayscale’s filing is due for a decision on October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19, Bitwise on October 20, CoinShares and Canary Capital on October 23, and WisdomTree on October 24. The eventual launch of a Spot XRP ETF could be the turning point that helps the cryptocurrency take its place alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in traditional finance. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.79.

Central to Labour’s Youth Guarantee programme , the plan represents one of the most radical attempts in years to address Britain’s persistent rates of long-term youth unemployment . In a speech at the Labour Party conference, Reeves will argue that she is committed to nothing less than the abolition of long-term youth unemployment. Under the scheme, those aged 16-24 and out of work for at least 18 months would be given a job offer they would have to take. Those who decline could face sanctions, including a reduction in benefits. Reeves will say the policy is not just about jobs, “It is also about dignity. “We will not allow a generation of young people to languish, without hope or prospects for the future — locked out from security and the fair chance that good work brings,” she will say. The Labour government is adamant that this is not about punishing the young, but preventing them from being left behind in a shifting economy. Budget will decide funding and scope The scheme will be detailed in the Budget on November 26. Ministers will detail whether jobs will be directly funded by the government or subsidised through incentives to employers. The scheme only applies to those in the specified age group and who have been on Universal Credit for 18 months. That means some groups of people — like young adults not claiming benefits, or the recently unemployed — will not be eligible. Officials concede that it is hard to be certain that the scheme creates new jobs rather than filling those that would have been taken anyway. Critics fear the government could pay employers to create low-quality jobs with limited long-term value. For years, unions and business organisations have called on the government to put money into youth jobs. The Trades Union Congress is calling for creating a permanent £1bn-a-year guarantee scheme, akin to those implemented during the 2009 financial crisis and the Covid pandemic. The British Chambers of Commerce supported the principle of a subsidised jobs scheme but warned that many businesses were struggling with higher national insurance contributions and new employment protections. The group said last week that young people without work history would be left without opportunities unless the government helped cover the cost. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of the CBI, said the plan was crucial for the economy but urged the government to provide more detail. She said the business group wanted to know how the scheme would operate and whether it would address rising employment costs. Previous schemes shape the current plan The UK has attempted similar programs in the past. The Future Jobs Fund, introduced in 2009, provided thousands of placements but was scrapped in 2010 as it was deemed too expensive. The Kickstart Scheme was established by Rishi Sunak during the pandemic to stave off a youth jobs crisis, but closed early after fewer than anticipated employers applied. Reeves is framing this plan as narrower. By prioritising those who have been unemployed or not in education the longest, Labour hopes to break a cycle of exclusion. Now one in eight 16-to-24-year-olds is not in work, education, or training, and that number has grown by almost a third over the past four years. The government is already testing elements of the Youth Guarantee in so-called “trailblazer” areas that connect young people with apprenticeships, places at college, or support packages. Ministers also announced earlier this year that £3.8bn of funding would be available to help those with health conditions, making it more difficult for them to move into work. However, skeptics, including international investors and domestic experts, warn that despite the momentum, serious structural challenges — such as skills shortages, regional inequality, and high cost of hiring — will make progress difficult.

This update came after the EV manufacturer shared its sales data from January 2023 to June 2025. According to the data, the company had only sold about 5,300 vehicles . This indicated that the automaker is struggling in the market even after adopting strategies such as opening its 45th sales location in Japan, introducing a competitive fourth EV model, and embracing plans to release an electric ‘kei’ car by late 2026. Although its sales were disappointing and its efforts did not pay off, BYD has not yet lost hope. To boost its sales, the company now offers customers discounts. Based on the strategy, it gives out discounts of up to ¥1 million, which is equivalent to around $6,700. This can be combined with government subsidies to lower prices by as much as 50%. For instance, when one purchases the Atto 3, he or she will pay just under ¥4.2 million. Considering its advantages in the era of the recent crackdowns in the industry, Chinese individuals have reportedly found this strategy appealing. Foreign automakers encounter hardship in the Japanese auto market Tech analysts commented on the situation, acknowledging that BYD’s pricing strategy is unusual because, in recent years, Japanese automakers have hardly reduced their car prices. This has raised worries that Japan’s pricing strategy may fail despite the automaker solidifying its position as a leading EV brand in China. Tatsuo Yoshida, a Senior Auto Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence covering the Japanese auto sector, further explained the situation, stating that the strategy could make first buyers feel like they got a bad deal for paying more, resulting in reduced resale values. The challenges outlined have demonstrated the struggles of foreign automakers like BYD in the Japanese auto market. According to reports from sources, buyers are inclined to choose well-known brands such as Toyota Motor Corp. and usually prefer gas-electric hybrids instead of battery electric vehicles (EVs). This proves that Japanese car buyers are loyal to local firms, affecting major legacy brands. To illustrate this, General Motors Company had quit the Japanese auto market after experiencing poor sales. Additionally, Hyundai Motor Company is taking another shot after leaving the market in 2009. For BYD, the mixed response in the Japanese auto market stands out when compared to the rising sales in the European market. Despite the challenges surrounding its operation, the company is still committed to expanding globally and addressing the challenges encountered in its homeland, China. Yoshida calls on the urgency of making an impression in the EV market Despite its short-term challenges, the Japanese auto market has long-term benefits that offset these challenges. According to reports from reliable sources, EVs are anticipated to make up only 3.4% of new vehicles in Japan in 2025; however, growth is predicted in the years to come. In a statement, Yoshida emphasized that the main goal is to make an impression, not Japan. According to the analyst, what matters for BYD is that it may be recognized by some of the most demanding customers in the world. “What they really want is a history of doing business in Japan with the most discerning quality customers, even if it does not make complete economic sense,” he said. The company still has a long way to go before it can bite off chunks of the market share away from local Japanese companies. BYD sold 512 of all its models for June, compared to a top EV in Japan, Nissan Motor Co.’s Sakura, which sold 1,137. However, Yoshida highlighted that these sales figures are insufficient to pay employee salaries and keep showrooms operational. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Having a price tag of $0.035 MUTM is also in stage 6 of its presale. This phase is over 50% sold, and this is an indicator that the investors have less time to get before the window is closed. Mutuum Finance has true DeFi utility and innovative peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending, staking rewards, and solid security measures compared to SOL that is grappling with short-term volatility. Mutuum Finance may be the most appropriate cryptocurrency to invest at the end of September 2025. Solana Under Bearish Pressure With Key Breakdown Solana (SOL) is at a crossroad in the 4H chart because of the price movement being below the up-trending trendline and even at the key support region between the ranges of $214-210. This shift is reflecting bearish momentum, and technical analysts are looking at two important downside points to have the first target support at the $185 region and a more extreme possible retracement zone of $165 to $167 with further selling pressure. Solana is still dominating, but its present structure indicates a period of consolidation or even more radical price reduction, something that is causing investors to find other options elsewhere to potentially more dynamically generate growth opportunity Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Triumph Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing good performance in its presale. The current phase is already 50% complete and sells tokens at 0.035. The investor demand is high and this project has already collected more than 16.5 million. One of the roadmap highlights of it is the introduction of a USD-denominated stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain which will grant it assistance to long-term value, introduce liquidity, and supply users with steady returns. Sound Risk Controls and Architecture-based Security. Mutuum Finance is built on the hierarchies of risk management and the security imprinted in all the protocol layers. It deals with under-collateralization and over-collateralization events rather well with the help of such measures as cascading Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, liquidity protection, liquidation charges and reserve hedging schemes all of which keep the platform stable despite the fluctuations of market conditions. The protocol interest rate model is sound and sensitive to the level of liquidity. Lending rates are minimised to lengthen the borrower sub-market interest rates since excess liquidity is experienced. During a liquidity crunch, the rate of interest charged on borrowing is elevated in the perspective of promoting loan recovery and realization of new deposits. There are situations in which the dynamic model allows borrowing at fixed rates i.e. when one is presenting very liquid collateral and the overall balance in the market is maintained. Besides the core lending and borrowing business, Mutuum Finance is also undertaking a very aggressive growth strategy by staking rewards, token buybacks, and exchange listings, all of which are targeted at spurring a healthy ecosystem and usage in the long-run. The project has also created a $100,000 giveaway in honor of its first adopters, 10 participants will each be given $10 000 worth of MUTM tokens. The move signifies the interest of Mutuum in creating a healthy and strong community and rewarding birds of a feather as the platform takes an early lead in its speedy growth. MUTM offers actual DeFi utility, superior security, and long-term scalability. Invest in Mutuum Finance presale now and receive your share before the prices are increased.

MoonBull Presale Gains Speed While Cheems and Dogecoin Add Meme Market Heat,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-best-new-crypto-in-texas-moonbull-presale-gains-speed-while-cheems-and-dogecoin-add-meme-market-heat/,"What if the next big crypto moonshot is already blasting off and most people in Texas are still standing on the sidelines? The cryptocurrency conversation has evolved into a race to find the best new crypto in Texas, where meme culture, presale excitement, and community loyalty combine to create market momentum. Many investors chase the so-called best crypto in Texas before it takes off because being early often means being rewarded the most. It has become a meme itself among traders, who joke that timing the entry is like catching lightning in a bottle. Everyone wants to be the one bragging about calling the move before it happened. Some projects come and go in conversation, but MoonBull has quickly emerged as the one creating genuine urgency with its presale momentum. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Presale Rocket Poised for Texas Investors MoonBull is capturing serious attention as a candidate for the best crypto in Texas due to its ground-up construction. It is a meme coin launched on Ethereum to reward the community while avoiding the usual pitfalls of presales dominated by bots or whales. Transparency, fairness, and sustainability are central to its design. The project moved quickly into Stage 3 of its presale, showing just how strong the demand has been. The early numbers alone are striking. Over 400 holders have already joined, with the presale tally crossing $142,000 and a current price of just $0.00004057. That early surge hints at the kind of scarcity that makes investors rush to grab their share before stages get more expensive. The mechanics behind MoonBull give it an edge. One highlight is the staking system that unlocks at Stage 10. Holders can stake tokens directly from the dashboard and earn a fixed 95% annual yield. This feature rewards conviction while supporting stability since it encourages holders to lock in rather than sell off. Another standout is community governance that begins at Stage 12. Holders get a direct vote on project decisions such as surprise burns and future campaigns, making the token feel like a shared project instead of a closed-door launch. These features create both trust and long-term incentive for the people already on board. Referral rewards add another layer of attraction. Not only does each invite earn 15% for the referrer and 15% more for the buyer, but the top referrers each month can take home bonuses in USDC. This is not just about meme energy. It is about a system designed to grow naturally through incentives that keep people engaged. The early presale numbers tell the same story. An investor putting in $20,000 right now would receive nearly 492,975,104.76 MOBU. At the projected listing price of $0.00616, that position could expand into more than $3,036,726.65. It is the kind of upside that fuels excitement around what some are calling the best new crypto in Texas . MoonBull’s rapid climb to Stage 3 in a matter of hours suggests more than hype. It demonstrates confidence from the community and signals that later stages will fill even more quickly. That combination of momentum, scarcity, and community engagement is exactly what gives it an edge in this race. Dogecoin: The Veteran Meme King Dogecoin is often mentioned in discussions about the best cryptocurrencies in Texas, largely due to its reputation. It began as a joke but over time grew into one of the most widely recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. It benefits from brand power and a massive community that has kept it relevant even years after launch. The strengths of Dogecoin are clear. It is listed on nearly every major exchange, accepted by several merchants, and still used for tipping across social platforms. That broad adoption makes it more stable compared to many meme coins that struggle for visibility. Its deep liquidity and history give investors a sense of security when compared to smaller meme projects. However, Dogecoin no longer offers the same explosive upside that it once did. Much of its story has already been written, which means its price movements now rely more on broader market cycles and high-profile endorsements than new mechanics. Dogecoin does not have presale stages, staking programs, or governance layers to create fresh catalysts. Instead, its strength lies in its staying power and brand recognition. Cheems: The Meme Challenger Cheems is another meme coin that holds its own place in the conversation around the best crypto in Texas. It draws power from the viral appeal of the “doge family” of memes while carving out its own lane in the community space. Cheems has a loyal following and manages to capture bursts of attention whenever meme coin energy flares up across the market. What makes Cheems interesting is that it occupies a unique position between established giants and emerging tokens. It is not yet a household name, but it has enough recognition to be taken seriously in crypto circles. When meme coin rallies heat up, Cheems tends to ride the wave as traders look for alternatives with higher growth potential. That said, Cheems does not currently offer the kind of built-in incentives that other projects in the space have introduced. It does not have staking at high yields or community governance structures. Its growth depends heavily on community sentiment and social media traction. This makes it less predictable, but also means its upside could be significant if it catches viral momentum at the right moment. Final Thoughts Based on research and market trends, the race for the best new crypto in Texas comes down to three very different options. MoonBull brings energy, features, and presale speed that could reward early believers in ways other meme coins rarely achieve. For investors chasing real upside, MoonBull appears to offer the most powerful combination of mechanics and momentum. MoonBull presale is live, stages are moving quickly, and early numbers show both confidence and demand. Anyone looking to enter the world of crypto in Texas might see this as the right time to act, before prices rise further.

Markets and economists had widely anticipated the action. The decision follows three rate cuts earlier this year, representing a move toward greater caution while inflation quickens again. The central bank has tried to quell post-pandemic inflation without pinching off job growth. Recent data suggest progress, though risks of inflation persist. The monthly inflation gauge was up for a second straight month in August. Housing, food, and alcohol prices rose. Economists caution that this trend may indicate fresh price pressures, particularly in services. According to RBA Governor Michele Bullock last week, the economy was showing “a bit stronger” than expected signs. She added that the labour market is close to full employment and private sector activity is strengthening. Bullock, however, has cautioned that the RBA is not on a preset course. Future decisions will be conditioned on new real-time inflation, jobs, and wages information. Markets await guidance on cuts The 3.6% pause by the RBA hasn’t halted the debate over what happens next. Attention has shifted to the timing of the next step, with some analysts still predicting rate cuts are inevitable . Westpac and Bloomberg Economics foresee the four-year curve falling below 3 per cent by the end of 2026. They believe the economy will slow down sufficiently to compel the bank into action sooner than many think. National Australia Bank has also extended its forecast to May 2026 with no change in policy. NAB economists say stubborn inflation and robust growth will see the RBA keep rates on hold for significantly longer than market prices. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA ) previously called for a November cut. Now, its own economists are backing away. They cite data on inflation that have come in stronger than expected in recent months as the biggest risk, cautioning that the path to lower rates “is not clear, it is a done deal. “ International dynamics are also complicating the calculus. The US Federal Reserve slashed rates again earlier this month, the first time it has cut since late 2023. The Fed keeps easing while the RBA holds, and suddenly Australian assets start to look relatively attractive. That would bolster capital inflows, push the Australian dollar higher, and help local bond markets. Such a split interest rate could make it easier for the RBA not to rush into cutting. Higher relative yields could take some sting out of the financial stress without any need to loosen the stance on policy. But if the stronger currency were to remain, it would also jeopardize weakening exports. RBA navigates inflation risks carefully If the Fed moves too quickly to lower interest rates, inflation could reignite and reverse all the progress made over the past two years. But if it leaves rates too high for too long, the risk is weaker growth, sluggish job creation, and more financial stress on household s al ready stretched trying to keep up with hefty mortgage repayments. It’s a “delicate trade-off,” Governor Michele Bullock recently said. The central bank is walking a tightrope, seeking to maintain its credibility that it will fight against inflation while not tipping the economy into a downturn. For now, the board believes that moderate restraint on policy will be appropriate. This suggests that interest rates have risen enough to cool prices but not so far as to choke off demand. Surveys that measure payrolls and spending are rebounding as reopening proceeds apace, suggesting the strategy is working, though economists warn the direction could easily change. How much happens will depend on how inflation behaves in the next few months. And if prices for housing, energy, and services keep rising, the bank may not have a choice but to continue leaving rates higher well into 2026. Complicating matters, of course, is the global context. The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have started loosening policy. If Australia falls too far behind other countries, capital flows and exchange rate movements may rewrite domestic financial conditions unpredictably. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The financial arm of Sony was officially listed separately from its parent, prompting a rush of buy orders that resulted in shares going untraded at open. The listing is a watershed for Sony and the Japanese market. It is the first partial spinoff under a 2023 tax reform and the first direct listing in Tokyo in over 20 years. Shares of Sony Financial were assigned a reference price of ¥150 (or about $1) per share. But demand far outpaced supply. Brokers said that buy orders had piled up from the opening bell, preventing trading from getting underway. While the rarity of such a spin-off has fueled excitement, investor interest is mainly rooted in confidence in the business. With strong positions in banking, life, and non-life insurance, Sony Financial is seen as a profitable, stable company with a vast customer base. The company has already committed to buying shares worth up to ¥100 billion in the years ahead. Analysts say it could also help to supercharge investor appetite and calm trading once the initial frenzy cools. Sony sharpens its focus. The spinoff is part of a sweeping overhaul plan at Sony Group. The entertainment and technology giant plans to concentrate on its global strengths: games, music, movies, and image sensors. By unleashing its financial arm, Sony believes both can grow faster and more wisely. Sony has maintained a minority stake in the new company. This permits the parent to leverage future appreciation while freeing Sony Financial to access capital and set its own targets for growth. Executives have said the breakup will also bring greater transparency to investors, who can now assess the value of each business on its own. There are deep roots in the finance arm, as it began with life insurance in 1979 and went on to offer banking and other services. Millions across Japan now use it. The spinoff is designed to make it more flexible in digital banking and product development and allow Sony Group to assign its resources more squarely into entertainment and technology. Sony spinoff reshapes Japan’s market landscape Japan has been wary about direct listings for some time, preferring traditional initial public offerings. The success of Sony Financial’s debut might also prompt other companies to follow its lead, particularly under the new tax rules that have been touted as a way to encourage spinoffs and corporate overhaul. Industry observers say the listing could serve as a model for other Japanese conglomerates with multiple placements. If Sony’s gamble is successful, other companies may be tempted to seek to spin off businesses to unlock value for their investors. Investors will now be monitoring Sony Financial’s trading in the coming days. The robust demand signals market confidence, but the true test will come when trading returns to normal. The split is a fresh new start for Sony. Relieved of the burden of operating a financial arm, it is doubling down on entertainment and technology businesses with global prominence. For Japan, the spinoff could represent the beginning of a new dynamic environment that shakes up long-held company structures. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

BTC was near $112,110, ETH around $4,124, SOL near $209, and XRP about $2.86 alongside 24-hour gains of roughly 2%–4% for these names. Market breadth improved as risk appetite steadied after last week’s volatility. Spot ETF flows have turned constructive again this month, offering a structural bid that has supported rebounds across large caps even as macro headlines remained choppy. Bitcoin leads the market higher Bitcoin edged higher after a turbulent stretch tied to macroeconomic data and options positioning, with recent dips below $111K following a US GDP revision that pressured risk assets before they subsequently stabilised. On the flows side, US spot BTC ETFs recorded multiple consecutive days of net inflows in mid‑September, reinforcing demand from institutions and contributing to the latest bounce. Analysts warn that BTC may need to fall toward $104,000 for correction fatigue to set in—otherwise, the sellers may remain in control. If Bitcoin breaks below a key level near $110,500, further downside toward $107,200 or even $103,500 is possible. On the upside, a daily close above $113,500 could reassert bullish dominance. Ethereum back above $4,100 Ether tracked BTC higher today. Ethereum’s price—around $4,100–$4,200—is under pressure, even though it showed modest gains in the past 24 hours. Analysts suggest ETH must reclaim $4,580 to trigger a breakout. While institutional demand is holding firm, retail flows remain weak. Some price forecasts — driven by macro tailwinds and technical setups — see ETH reaching $5,000+ by year-end. Solana Solana (SOL) traded near $209, up 3.6% in the past day but still nursing a steep 10.6% weekly loss. Solana outperformed earlier in September amid substantial accumulation signals, including Galaxy Digital-linked withdrawals totaling roughly $724M of SOL from exchanges, while some analysts argue demand from treasuries and potential ETF catalysts could extend the narrative. That optimism has been tempered near month‑end by a surge in open interest and weaker technicals that left SOL vulnerable to deeper pullbacks, even as developers press network‑level performance proposals. The net result is elevated two‑way risk in the short run around the $200 handle despite strong year‑to‑date execution and interest from institutions. XRP remains below $3 XRP held at $2.86, with 2.4% daily gains offset by a 2.3% weekly drop. XRP’s price stabilised after a volatile month shaped by its US ETF debut, where “sell‑the‑news” flows overshadowed record day‑one volume before the market found footing again. Technical updates through September point to consolidation under $3, with traders watching for breakouts while macro and ETF narratives sway flows across the complex. The near‑term setup remains range‑bound, but improved risk sentiment today helped the token participate in the broader bounce shown in the screenshots. Top gainers and losers Among altcoins, Zcash (ZEC) was the standout performer, jumping 20% to $65.09 in the past 24 hours. Pump.fun (PUMP) also rallied sharply, climbing 15% to $0.005855, while Story (IP) advanced 12% to $9.17. On the downside, Plasma (XPL) slumped 12% to $1.47, leading the laggards. MemeCore (M) fell 2.7% to $2.29, and XDC Network (XDC) edged lower by 0.95% to $0.072, underscoring selective weakness across smaller-cap names even as the wider market strengthened.

52411869,317728,1759112290,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/52411869.jpeg,Mitchell Demeter Appointed CEO of Sonic Labs to Drive Global Growth and Institutional Expansion,https://chainwire.org/2025/09/29/mitchell-demeter-appointed-ceo-of-sonic-labs-to-drive-global-growth-and-institutional-expansion/,"George Town, Cayman Islands, September 29th, 2025, Chainwire Sonic Labs , the team behind the highest-performing EVM blockchain Sonic, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mitchell Demeter as its new Chief Executive Officer. Demeter, a pioneer in digital assets and seasoned entrepreneur, will lead Sonic Labs in its next phase of global growth, accelerating the adoption of Sonic as one of the world’s leading blockchains. His mandate includes expanding developer and ecosystem adoption worldwide, strengthening institutional relationships, and building bridges into U.S. and global capital markets as part of Sonic’s broader mission to redefine the future of finance. Since the launch of the Sonic network in December 2024, the organization has achieved many milestones, including having a proven mainnet that can confirm up to 400,000 transactions per second with confirmation times consistently under 1 second, coupled with successes such as the Coinbase listing for S, native issuance of USDC , integration of Chainlink’s CCIP , and many others. However, what’s missing are strong institutional connections in the U.S. and elsewhere backing the Sonic network and its ecosystem projects. This is a necessary component—coupled with great technology, business functions, and exchange listings—that will take Sonic to the next level. Under Demeter’s leadership, Sonic Labs will be assembling a strong executive team around him, bringing in proven operators with deep experience across both traditional finance and crypto to complement the foundation’s technology strengths. Sonic Labs is expanding its business development efforts in the United States and globally, actively recruiting and hiring leaders to deepen institutional relationships and build lasting partnerships with major U.S. and global investors and enterprises alike. This transition is coming at a pivotal moment. Industry leaders have forecast that within the next decade, as much as 10% of global GDP could be transacted on blockchain rails, representing over $10 trillion in on-chain economic activity. Sonic is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, combining unmatched speed and scalability with developer and institutional incentive models designed for mass adoption. Demeter said he has always believed blockchain would fundamentally reshape global markets, but that success now depends on building the right bridges between decentralized innovation and institutional frameworks. “Sonic’s technology is unmatched in speed and scalability, and our mission is to bring that performance directly into institutional finance and global markets,” he explained. He continued, “Our mission is not just adoption, it’s to make Sonic indispensable to the future of global finance. That means scaling our business development and partnership efforts with large, well-known U.S. and global entities, and supporting lighthouse applications through strategic partnerships that will serve as proof points for the entire industry. The world’s financial infrastructure is moving on-chain, and Sonic intends to be at the very center of that transition.” Under his leadership, Sonic will continue to expand its presence among institutional investors and builders alike, bridging global markets without losing sight of its decentralized roots. Michael Kong, who has guided Sonic Labs (and previously Fantom) to this stage, will continue serving on the Board of Directors and take on the role of Chief Information Officer, remaining actively involved in the company’s leadership. Michael has been central to the evolution of Fantom, now Sonic, since 2018, and will remain fully engaged in guiding and supporting Demeter as he leads the network into its next phase of growth. Kong noted that he has watched Demeter bridge public markets with blockchain for more than a decade and believes this is the right moment for his leadership. “Mitchell’s extensive network and trusted relationships across the blockchain ecosystem, traditional finance, and beyond will be critical in driving the partnerships and real-world applications that will take Sonic to the next level. Myself and the entire Sonic Board of Directors are fully committed to supporting him in achieving this vision.” About Mitchell Demeter Mitchell Demeter is widely recognized as a pioneer in the blockchain industry.

52412559,https://invezz.com/?p=2902156,1759112311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"At $0.035, analysts call an altcoin the best crypto to buy to hit $1 faster than DOGE",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/29/at-0-035-analysts-call-an-altcoin-the-best-crypto-to-buy-to-hit-1-faster-than-doge/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been viewed as the poster child of meme-driven rallies, but its growth has slowed considerably in recent years. While DOGE struggles to maintain momentum, analysts are pointing toward a new DeFi project that blends utility with strong tokenomics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at just $0.035 in presale Phase 6, is being highlighted as the altcoin with the fundamentals to reach $1 far sooner than DOGE. For those investing in crypto, this project introduces an ecosystem where dual lending, mtToken staking, and MUTM buybacks come together to fuel long-term value. Why MUTM’s utility puts it ahead of DOGE Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a meme token—it will be a Layer 2 DeFi protocol built with real financial mechanics designed for scalability. The platform introduces dual lending mechanics that combine peer-to-contract (P2C) pools for stablecoins and blue-chip crypto coins with peer-to-peer (P2P) pools for riskier assets like meme coins. This structure will allow users to earn predictable yields in P2C while exploring higher returns in P2P, creating balance in one ecosystem. The project is also preparing for its Beta launch at listing, which will let users experience the dashboard, lending systems, and mtToken staking functions firsthand. Mutuum’s dashboard is functional; it will display user holdings, track ROI in real time, and feature a Top 50 leaderboard that rewards major investors with bonus MUTM tokens. These design choices build long-term engagement and encourage participation, two aspects that DOGE has struggled to sustain. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further differentiates itself with stable interest rate borrowing. Initial rates will be locked to provide predictability, while rebalancing conditions will adjust over time for sustainability. Borrowers will operate under clear loan-to-value caps, collateralization rules, and liquidation penalties that feed back into the protocol’s treasury. This means predictable revenue flows will support platform growth and drive continuous token demand. Strong demand drivers to take MUTM to $1 The numbers behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are already compelling. Out of a total supply of 4 billion tokens, Phase 6 has raised $16.45 million, with 50% of its 170 million tokens already sold. The token is priced at $0.035 with over 16,650 holders participating. As presale phases progress, the price will rise, with the next step set at $0.04—a 15% increase. That creates an urgent opportunity for investors to enter at a discount before the price moves higher. Several factors are expected to propel MUTM’s valuation. The Beta launch will allow immediate user adoption and showcase lending and borrowing utilities from day one. Expected listings on top exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC, are anticipated, which will broaden access, improve liquidity, and expose the token to global audiences. The buy-and-distribute mechanism is another standout feature, with platform revenue directed toward open-market MUTM repurchases that are then redistributed to stakers. This cycle creates sustained buying pressure, reinforces holding incentives, and increases long-term demand. The presale has already proven highly rewarding for early participants. A Phase 1 investor who allocated $10,000 at $0.01 now holds $35,000 value at today’s Phase 6 valuation. By the next phase at $0.04, that same position will be valued at $40,000. Even investors entering at the current $0.035 stage are projected to see immediate gains as the presale progresses, showcasing how structured pricing supports consistent ROI. Security and transparency are central pillars of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a CertiK audit that included both manual review and static analysis, earning a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. Alongside this, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivizes white-hat testing and reinforces confidence in the platform’s readiness for launch. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just another presale. It’s a properly planned DeFi system that will beat speculative coins that don’t have any real worth. DOGE has relied on hype, while MUTM is getting ready to merge real-world mechanics with demand drivers that will help it reach $1. If you’re wondering why crypto is down today, this presale shows that the answer isn’t to sit out but to look for projects that are establishing long-lasting ecosystems. MUTM is being called the best cryptocurrency to buy right now since it has a lot of uses, a lot of people are interested in it, and its presale is picking up speed. This is a big change from DOGE’s slow growth.

A lot of people are now looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project that is meant to be useful in the real world and has a clear 700% upside for early investors. Some traders are asking why crypto is down today, but others know that downturns frequently lead to smarter rotations into businesses with stronger fundamentals. MUTM is the DeFi token to keep an eye on because it has two lending pools, a stablecoin structure, and Layer 2 integration that promises cheaper costs and faster transactions. This initiative is getting more and more interest from both retail and institutional investors who possess ADA and are looking for a new route. From ADA uncertainty to MUTM’s clear utility Unlike speculative crypto coins that depend heavily on community hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on mechanisms that will generate sustainable demand. Its dual lending structure will allow users to participate in Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for blue-chip assets like BTC, ETH, and stablecoins, while also enabling Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for meme tokens such as PEPE and DOGE. This flexibility will attract both conservative investors who value stability and risk-tolerant traders seeking higher yields. The platform will also introduce stablecoin issuance, providing users with a dollar-pegged asset that enhances both lending and borrowing efficiency. mtToken staking will reward users for securing liquidity, while the MUTM buyback system will redistribute revenue to strengthen token utility. Combined with Layer 2 technology, transactions will remain cost-efficient and scalable even as user activity increases. These features will be demonstrated in the Beta launch at listing, allowing early adopters to see the protocol’s full utility in action. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently drawing attention, with $16.45 million raised so far, 50% of its 170 million allocation already sold, and a price of $0.035. More than 16,650 holders are now part of this stage, signaling rising demand ahead of Phase 7. With the next price increase to $0.04—a 15% jump—the window for discounted entry is narrowing. For ADA traders who are shifting their strategies, the presale provides a timely opportunity to align with a project offering clearer growth prospects. Why MUTM is targeting a 700% run The projected 700% upside for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not based on speculation alone but supported by the protocol’s revenue model and demand drivers. A utilization-based interest system will dynamically adjust borrowing rates depending on liquidity, ensuring lenders remain incentivized and borrowers stay engaged. This flow of activity will grow the treasury, reinforcing the project’s long-term sustainability and supporting token demand. Deposit and borrow caps will also be applied to different asset classes, while restricted collateral mode will prevent correlated risk from destabilizing the system. These safeguards will encourage larger deposits and create higher confidence for participants, ensuring MUTM remains attractive for those investing in crypto with long-term goals. Expected listings on major exchanges such as KuCoin and Kraken will provide broad visibility and adoption. Increased access to trading pairs will drive retail inflows, while institutional interest will rise as the protocol proves its mechanics through the Beta launch and growing liquidity. With collateral and liquidation mechanics ensuring predictable revenue—through loan-to-value thresholds, liquidation penalties, and treasury allocations—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to generate ongoing demand independent of market hype. The investment examples highlight the strength of entering early. A Phase 1 investor who placed $10,000 at $0.01 now holds $35,000 at the current $0.035 presale price. A Phase 6 participant investing the same amount will see $11,500 value immediately after the Phase 7 price increase. This clear trajectory illustrates how retail participants can capture value at multiple presale stages while building confidence for the long-term run. Reinforcing this credibility is the CertiK audit, which delivered a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, paired with a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. These measures confirm that the protocol is taking security seriously while incentivizing independent oversight. For traders seeking safety alongside growth potential, this combination offers a rare balance. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing itself as the go-to project for ADA traders who are exiting stagnant positions and looking for more ambitious growth. With strong presale momentum, clear token mechanics, and a roadmap that includes Beta testing and top exchange listings, the project is uniquely positioned to deliver outsized returns. For those searching for the next DeFi gem, MUTM is more than an alternative—it is a structured opportunity for serious retail and institutional investors to capture a projected 700% run.

His mandate includes expanding developer and ecosystem adoption worldwide, strengthening institutional relationships, and building bridges into U.S. and global capital markets as part of Sonic’s broader mission to redefine the future of finance. Since the launch of the Sonic network in December 2024, the organization has achieved many milestones, including having a proven mainnet that can confirm up to 400,000 transactions per second with confirmation times consistently under 1 second, coupled with successes such as the Coinbase listing for S, native issuance of USDC , integration of Chainlink’s CCIP , and many others. However, what’s missing are strong institutional connections in the U.S. and elsewhere backing the Sonic network and its ecosystem projects. This is a necessary component—coupled with great technology, business functions, and exchange listings—that will take Sonic to the next level. Under Demeter’s leadership, Sonic Labs will be assembling a strong executive team around him, bringing in proven operators with deep experience across both traditional finance and crypto to complement the foundation’s technology strengths. Sonic Labs is expanding its business development efforts in the United States and globally, actively recruiting and hiring leaders to deepen institutional relationships and build lasting partnerships with major U.S. and global investors and enterprises alike. This transition is coming at a pivotal moment. Industry leaders have forecast that within the next decade, as much as 10% of global GDP could be transacted on blockchain rails, representing over $10 trillion in on-chain economic activity. Sonic is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, combining unmatched speed and scalability with developer and institutional incentive models designed for mass adoption. Demeter said he has always believed blockchain would fundamentally reshape global markets, but that success now depends on building the right bridges between decentralized innovation and institutional frameworks. “Sonic’s technology is unmatched in speed and scalability, and our mission is to bring that performance directly into institutional finance and global markets,” he explained. He continued, “Our mission is not just adoption, it’s to make Sonic indispensable to the future of global finance. That means scaling our business development and partnership efforts with large, well-known U.S. and global entities, and supporting lighthouse applications through strategic partnerships that will serve as proof points for the entire industry. The world’s financial infrastructure is moving on-chain, and Sonic intends to be at the very center of that transition.” Under his leadership, Sonic will continue to expand its presence among institutional investors and builders alike, bridging global markets without losing sight of its decentralized roots. Michael Kong, who has guided Sonic Labs (and previously Fantom) to this stage, will continue serving on the Board of Directors and take on the role of Chief Information Officer, remaining actively involved in the company’s leadership. Michael has been central to the evolution of Fantom, now Sonic, since 2018, and will remain fully engaged in guiding and supporting Demeter as he leads the network into its next phase of growth. Kong noted that he has watched Demeter bridge public markets with blockchain for more than a decade and believes this is the right moment for his leadership. “Mitchell’s extensive network and trusted relationships across the blockchain ecosystem, traditional finance, and beyond will be critical in driving the partnerships and real-world applications that will take Sonic to the next level. Myself and the entire Sonic Board of Directors are fully committed to supporting him in achieving this vision.” About Mitchell Demeter Mitchell Demeter is widely recognized as a pioneer in the blockchain industry. He launched the world’s first Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver and co-founded Cointrader Exchange, one of Canada’s earliest digital currency trading platforms. Over the years, his work has been featured in Forbes, Time, Fast Company, Wired, Huffington Post, and other major outlets. As a serial entrepreneur and investor, Demeter has founded and scaled multiple ventures across industries, consistently demonstrating an ability to anticipate market shifts and deliver innovative solutions. As part of this transition, he will step back from his role as CEO of SonicStrategy and assume the position of Executive Chair, where he will continue to provide leadership on strategy and capital markets development. This move allows Demeter to shift his primary focus and attention to leading as CEO of Sonic Labs, while still supporting SonicStrategy’s ongoing growth. Demeter brings extensive capital markets and business development experience, helping organizations navigate the intersection of blockchain innovation and institutional finance. About Sonic Sonic is the highest-performing EVM blockchain built for the future of finance. The network achieves sub-second finality and ultra-high throughput, delivering institutional-grade settlement speed for trading, real-world assets, and next-generation DeFi. At the heart of Sonic’s developer incentive model is Fee Monetization, a system that lets developers earn 90% of the network fees generated by their apps. Inspired by Web2 ad-revenue sharing models, Fee Monetization rewards developers for driving usage, growth, and real activity.

The price is trading above $110,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $109,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it clears the $112,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Starts Recovery Bitcoin price managed to stay above the $108,500 zone and started a recovery wave . BTC settled above the $109,500 resistance zone to start the current move.

52412562,https://invezz.com/?p=2902202,1759112705,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"ETH consolidates at $4,000 while MUTM gains 250%, marked as the top crypto to buy for 20x upside",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/29/eth-consolidates-at-4000-while-mutm-gains-250-marked-as-the-top-crypto-to-buy-for-20x-upside/,"As ETH consolidates around the $4,000 mark, traders and investors are closely monitoring high-potential alternatives for superior growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a standout, already showing 250% gains from its early presale phases and positioning itself as the top crypto to buy for 20x upside. This momentum is reinforced by MUTM’s advanced ecosystem, which combines dual lending pools, a stable interest rate model, and mtToken staking with open-market buyback incentives. In a market where crypto prices fluctuate and crypto predictions remain uncertain, MUTM provides a structured environment for crypto investment, balancing growth with risk management. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently priced at $0.035, with $16.45 million raised and 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. Phase 7 is expected to launch at $0.04, offering a 15% short-term gain and creating urgency for early acquisition. MUTM’s presale structure rewards early investors while maintaining demand, supporting projected upside through platform adoption, staking rewards, and buyback-driven supply reduction. ETH consolidates at $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) has entered a phase of consolidation around the $4,000 mark, trading in a relatively tight range as buyers and sellers wrestle for control. After slipping just below $4,000 in recent sessions, ETH has rebounded slightly but still lacks strong directional momentum. On-chain data suggests accumulation in cold wallets and continued inflows from institutional sources, but caution is warranted: if the $3,900 support fails, ETH may test lower levels such as $3,800 or $3,700. Meanwhile, ETF redemptions and broader market volatility are exerting pressure, making this consolidation zone an important battleground for the next leg. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): dual lending pools and stable interest rate model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate dual lending pools to cater to diverse investor strategies. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will accept stablecoins like USDC and DAI, as well as blue-chip cryptocurrencies such as ETH and BTC. These deposits will earn predictable yields through the stable interest rate model, which will include initial rate locks, higher starting rates, and rebalancing conditions to ensure liquidity remains healthy and borrowing costs remain consistent. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending pools will allow users to lend and borrow higher-risk, less-liquid assets such as meme coins, including SHIB and DOGE. These isolated pools will feature individually negotiated rates, offering higher returns for willing participants while protecting the core P2C liquidity. MUTM’s stable interest rate model is tailored to provide security for borrowers and lenders alike. Borrowers with volatile or less-liquid assets will benefit from predictable repayment schedules, while lenders will enjoy consistent accruals from deposits. Rate rebalancing will adjust periodically according to pool utilization, ensuring that liquidity is optimized for both borrowing and lending activities. Overcollateralization and liquidation thresholds will safeguard the system, with clear LTV caps and liquidation bonuses to protect the platform during market swings. Reserve factors and treasury allocations will further mitigate risk, giving confidence to both retail and institutional participants. Strategic growth Investors who participated in Phases 1–3, acquiring MUTM at $0.01–$0.02, will see their holdings grow substantially, while new participants in Phase 6 will have an immediate opportunity for upside appreciation post-next-phase launch. A $10,000 Phase 1 investment will project $50,000 in value through price progression and staking rewards, while a $10,000 Phase 6 investment will project $11,500 post Phase 7. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement enhanced collateral efficiency with restricted collateralization modes, deposit and borrowing caps, and correlated asset exposure controls. These features provide confidence to institutional participants while maintaining robust safeguards for retail investors. Price discovery and liquidity management will rely on Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds, aggregated market data, and DEX TWAPs, ensuring accurate valuations and efficient lending across both P2C and P2P pools. Roadmap, security, and incentives The MUTM roadmap is structured to build confidence in investors and strengthen adoption. Phase 2 will focus on smart contract development and front/back-end integration, Phase 3 will introduce beta testing and exchange listing preparations, and Phase 4 will deliver the live platform with Layer-2 scaling, staking, and buybacks. Multi-chain expansion will ensure wider adoption and efficient capital deployment. Security remains a priority with a CertiK audit scoring 90 for Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, alongside a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program. MUTM will also conduct a $100,000 ongoing giveaway , with ten winners receiving $10,000 in MUTM tokens each, further driving community engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great option for traders who want to avoid ETH consolidation and want to make structured crypto investments. MUTM offers a mix of risk-managed growth and presale upside through multiple lending pools, a steady interest rate strategy, overcollateralization safeguards, and open-market buybacks. Phase 6 is now half sold, and Phase 7 is expected to see a 15% price spike, which makes it hard to get in at a discount. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to be the best cryptocurrency to buy since it has a clear plan, excellent mechanics, and benefits for early buyers.

With 50% of Phase 6 already sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the standout DeFi project that combines real utility with promising upside. Unlike many projects chasing hype, MUTM operates dual lending pools that cater to both peer-to-contract (P2C) assets like stablecoins, ETH, and BTC, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for high-risk, high-reward tokens such as SHIB and PEPE. This strategic design is positioning MUTM as a crypto coin primed to achieve $1 by 2026, making it one of the most attractive options for investors looking at crypto predictions and crypto charts for next-generation returns. Phase 6 presale momentum and urgency Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has already raised $16.45 million, with half of the 170 million allocated tokens sold. The current price stands at $0.035, and the presale now includes more than 16,650 holders. The next phase will see the price increase to $0.04, representing a 15% gain, making this the last opportunity for investors to acquire discounted MUTM before the price rise. Layer 2 integration ensures that transactions on the MUTM platform will be faster and more cost-effective than traditional Layer 1 networks, attracting both retail and institutional participants. A Beta launch is planned prior to full listing, giving early adopters hands-on experience with the lending pools, stablecoin issuance, and staking mechanisms. Users will also be able to track their holdings and ROI through a sophisticated dashboard, while the Top 50 leaderboard will reward the most active and committed investors with bonus MUTM tokens, fostering community engagement and long-term participation. Road to $1 Several factors are expected to drive demand and support upward momentum. The Beta launch will provide users with early access to MUTM’s full platform functionality, giving them the chance to experience dual lending, stablecoin minting, and mtToken staking firsthand. This engagement will not only increase platform adoption but also create tangible demand for MUTM tokens. Anticipated listings on top-tier exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, will further expand visibility and liquidity, attracting a broader base of investors and traders looking to diversify their holdings with reliable crypto coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a buy-and-distribute model whereby a portion of platform revenue is used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the market, with rewards distributed to mtToken stakers. This mechanism will encourage long-term participation, stabilize token demand, and generate consistent activity across the platform. The structured staking and reward system creates predictable utility, ensuring that the presale interest converts into sustainable adoption and trading volume. Risk management is another pillar of MUTM’s design. Loans will be overcollateralized with calibrated loan-to-value ratios, and liquidation triggers will be closely monitored to safeguard the protocol. Penalties from liquidations feed into the treasury and support the reserve factor, creating a stable, self-reinforcing ecosystem. The restricted-collateral mode allows the platform to minimise systemic risk while maintaining flexibility for borrowers, ensuring investor confidence remains high as adoption scales. Early investment benefit Early investors are already seeing substantial gains. A Phase 1 participant who invested $10,000 is now seeing a valuation of $35,000, and this amount is projected to rise to $40,000 on paper in the next presale phase as the price adjusts to $0.04. These clear and structured investment outcomes highlight why MUTM is becoming a favorite among traders and investors analyzing crypto prices and future projections. Security and transparency are also central to the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit, including manual review and static analysis, and maintains a 50,000 USDT bug bounty to incentivize white-hat reporting and continuous improvement. This ensures that participants can invest with confidence, knowing the protocol prioritizes safety and reliability in a volatile market. MUTM has presale momentum, Layer 2 efficiency, dual lending mechanisms, Beta involvement, and structured demand drivers. Half of Phase 6 has already been sold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great investment opportunity for anybody looking for a DeFi project that has genuine value and a lot of potential. Like the other prudent early joiners, it is better to acquire tokens now before it gets close to its $1 target in 2026. MUTM is on track to be one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the next several years because it combines excellent foundations, new technology, and clear incentive systems.
