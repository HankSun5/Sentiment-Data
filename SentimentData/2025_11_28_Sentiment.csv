He pointed to Session and SimpleX as two projects working on these areas and disclosed that he has donated 128 ETH to each of them. Major ETH Donations In a post on X this week, Buterin said both applications are attempting to strengthen decentralization and enhance user protections without relying on phone numbers, while also addressing challenges such as multi-device support and resistance to Sybil or denial-of-service attacks. Buterin said the donation addresses are publicly available on the projects’ websites and added that, although the platforms are not yet perfect, they represent active efforts to advance privacy-preserving communication. He also called for more developers to help tackle the technical problems that still remain, and added that these issues “need more eyes on them.” It is important to note that while Signal has emerged as a widely used encrypted messaging app, it faced renewed scrutiny following a March incident in which senior US national security officials accidentally included a reporter in a Signal group discussing strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Days later, a Pentagon-wide advisory warned against using the app for any non-public information, citing a vulnerability tied to its linked-devices feature. The memo said Russian hacking groups were targeting the users of the app through phishing tactics. Signal later attributed the issue to user-targeted attacks rather than problems with its encryption, and that the company had already implemented safeguards and warnings. Buterin’s Privacy Push The Ethereum co-founder has repeatedly spoken this year about treating privacy as a basic necessity for digital systems. Following a recent data breach involving major US banks, where client information from institutions including JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley may have been exposed after a cyberattack on mortgage technology vendor SitusAMC, Buterin responded by describing privacy as a form of “hygiene.” In an essay published in April, he argued that “privacy is an important guarantor of decentralization” and outlined a path for Ethereum to support stealth addresses, selective disclosure, and application-level zero-knowledge tools to help reduce unnecessary data exposure. More recently, he warned that X’s new geo-inference system, which assigns country labels to user accounts, poses privacy risks. He said such systems can still reveal sensitive location information and may endanger vulnerable users, even when only broad regions are disclosed.

While the Shiba Inu price prediction is still taking shape, a powerful buy signal just lit up the charts. On the hourly timeframe, the 50-period simple moving average has surged above the 200-period. This is a classic golden cross pattern that often marks the beginning of a strong upward move. As a result of the latest downturn, SHIB has booked a 60% year-to-date loss. Wall Street seems to have focused on getting a Dogecoin ETF out there first before aiming for other tokens. However, as the regulatory landscape becomes much more supportive, it should be a matter of time for a Shiba Inu ETF to hit the market. Paired with the buy signal mentioned earlier, meme coins could be getting ready to make a comeback in 2026. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal After Key Support Bounce The daily chart indicates that the price has bounced off a key trendline support in the past few days and could begin its ascent from $0.0000080 to $0.000012 in the next few days. This would mean a 50% upside potential in the near term for SHIB, without necessarily pushing the envelope too much. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just popped up the signal line, which also favors a bullish outlook. This indicates that positive momentum is accelerating as macroeconomic conditions improve. Trading volumes need to rise to confirm the relevance of this support bounce, as they are currently a bit low at around 3% of the token’s circulating market cap. ChatGPT said: If the Federal Reserve cuts rates in December, it could trigger a surge in trading volume, setting the stage for meme coins to rally. One project gaining serious traction is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , a mine-to-earn game that makes crypto mining simple, fun, and fully virtual with no hardware needed. With over $2.2 million raised so far, investor interest is building quickly as the presale gains momentum.

All three altcoins could experience an unusually volatile December, either surging or sliding sharply depending on macroeconomic sentiment and industry catalysts. Over the past month, the crypto market has been in a steep correction triggered by a major Bitcoin selloff, with steep pullbacks across most major assets. Bitcoin briefly dipped to an eight-month low around $82,000 last Friday. Even so, the bigger picture remains constructive. Blockchain innovation continues to advance, and high-durability altcoins like XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are still viewed as strong long-term contenders. Once market conditions stabilize, each project could regain upward momentum. Below is how Claude AI breaks down the bullish and bearish paths for December. XRP (XRP): Claude AI Predicts a Possible Swing Toward Either $10 or $1 Based on December Market Conditions Claude AI’s downside projection suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could retreat to around $1.80 by Christmas if market sentiment deteriorates, representing a 17% drop from today’s price near $2.18. Source: Claude Such a reversal would contrast sharply with XRP’s powerful run earlier this year, when it rallied to a seven-year peak of $3.65 in July after Ripple secured a major legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For months, XRP has consolidated within multiple bullish flag formations that failed to resolve. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits near 53, and the token climbed 1.5% during the past 24 hours as the rest of the market collectively climbed 4% to a combined market cap of $3.2 trillion. Under ideal conditions, Claude’s upper-bound target reaches $10. The SEC’s recent approval of nine XRP spot ETFs could steady institutional demand, if the prior Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches are an accurate precedent. Additionally, more high-profile ETF launches could arrive soon. Further regulatory clarity or major institutional partnerships could help propel XRP toward the double-digit range by 2026. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Claude AI Highlights the Potential for a 15× Rally Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , which debuted in 2020 as a playful challenger to Dogecoin, now commands a market capitalization above $5 billion. Trading near $0.0000085, SHIB climbed 2% in the past day, roughly matching Dogecoin’s gains. A move toward the key $0.000025 resistance as November wraps up could pave the way for Claude AI’s projected year-end price window of $0.00005 to $0.00009, representing potential gains of up to 11×. Claude’s bearish outlook for SHIB is notably less severe than its predictions for XRP and Pepe. In a downside scenario, SHIB could rise a little into the $0.00001 support zone and then trade sideways, indicating minimal gains of 18% from its current price. The Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded significantly, with Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling network, offering faster transactions, lower fees, broader developer support, and enhanced privacy tools. These features place SHIB in a more advanced category than typical meme tokens. Pepe ($PEPE): Claude AI Predicts 420% Surge! Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, has grown into the leading non-doge-themed meme coin, with a heady market cap of over $2 billion. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series, Pepe’s cultural influence and meme legacy have helped solidify its ubiquitous presence across social media. Despite fierce competition, Pepe maintains deep liquidity and an active fan base, occasionally boosted by cryptic nods from Elon Musk on X, prompting speculation that he has a Pepe position alongside his known positions in DOGE and BTC. The token trades near $0.0000046 today, still about 84% below its December 2024 high of $0.00002803. Claude AI’s models suggest PEPE could challenge ATH with a 420% rise to reach $0.000024. In the short term, however, the token must break through the stubborn $0.000018 resistance area to confirm a larger trend shift. However, a bear market could see a collapse of 35% to $0.000003. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rising Meme Coin Not Factored Into Claude’s Forecasts While Claude AI anticipates potential pressure on major altcoins, presale projects continue attracting heavy interest. One standout is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has raised $4.2 million and markets itself as the “next Dogecoin.” MAXI’s humorous origin story centers on a character named Maxi Doge, depicted as plotting a comedic takeover after years of watching Dogecoin dominate. The project leans heavily into viral content, community contests, and an active social presence to build momentum. As an ERC-20 token, MAXI benefits from Ethereum’s stronger security, scalability, lower environmental impact, and larger developer ecosystem, advantages that Dogecoin’s older proof-of-work model lacks. The project currently advertises staking rewards of up to 73% APY, though these rates will naturally decrease as staking participation grows. MAXI is priced at $0.00027 in its presale, with scheduled increases in later phases. Purchases can be made via MetaMask or Best Wallet . Dogecoin stands no chance!

The cryptocurrency slid to a recent bottom near $82,000 last Friday, a zone many traders hope will be the bottom. Today, as BTC punches above $91,000, things appear to be fine. Crypto old hands aren’t panicking. Long-term bulls frame the downturn as a healthy cooldown after months of relentless accumulation, a phase designed to shake out excessive leverage, curb overheated speculation, and reset the market to prepare it for the next leg higher. Given that Bitcoin dominance no longer has a complete hold on crypto’s narrative, it’s likely that the next bull phase will be oriented around altcoins. That makes today the best opportunity to load up on XRP, Solana, and Ethereum. XRP (XRP): A Leading Contender for the Future of Global Money Movement Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) leads crypto’s international payments sector with rapid settlement times and ultra-low fees, features that position the XRP Ledger as a more efficient replacement to SWIFT. Ripple’s solution has been spotlighted in research from both the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House. Additionally, Ripple’s expanding roster of banking partners has kept XRP among the three top projects, maintaining a market cap of over $132 billion. Ripple’s introduction of U.S. dollar–pegged stablecoin RLUSD further signals its commitment to cornering the on-chain future of digital payments. Every RLUSD transaction on the XRPLedger removes a small amount of XRP from circulation, tying XRP’s value directly to the expanding popularity of Ripple’s solutions. XRP has risen 53% over the past year, breaking a six-year stagnation period with a new record high of $3.65 in July. Over the same timeframe, Bitcoin fell 2%. With its Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering near 55 and the current price of $2.19 sitting slightly above the 30-day moving average, XRP demand is visibly growing, lifting it 5% thanks to the recent rollout of nine XRP ETFs. More ETFs will follow, which will draw significant institutional capital. If the U.S. finally delivers long-promised crypto regulation, XRP could realistically approach $10 or more by 2026. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Challenger Sets Its Sights on $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has cemented its reputation as one of the fastest and most cost-efficient smart-contract networks in the industry. With a market cap approaching $80 billion and over $9 billion in TVL in its DeFi ecosystem, it is Ethereum’s most formidable rival. Last month’s launch of Solana spot ETFs from Grayscale and Bitwise grants large institutions direct access, a catalyst that historically triggered explosive growth for both Bitcoin and Ethereum during prior cycles. SOL bottomed near $100 earlier in the year, and at around $142 today, it’s hovering in a support zone. A bullish flag pattern has been forming since mid-September, suggesting a potential breakout, with strong psychological support up at the next leg, $200, and significant resistance around $250. A decisive move above those ranges could send SOL past its record high of $293.31, with optimistic projections targeting $750 during a robust Q4 rally. Meanwhile, Solana’s ultra-low fees and high-speed transactions continue drawing Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization projects, with major financial firms, such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, issuing tokenized real-world assets on Solana. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart-Contract Titan Gears Up for Major Expansion Ethereum ($ETH) retains its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and the wider Web3 economy, supported by a market cap of over $366 billion. With nearly $70 billion in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols, Ethereum remains the dominant force in smart contracts and decentralized applications, underscoring its foundational importance across the blockchain landscape. In a bull market, ETH could hit $10,000 by year-end, a dramatic leap from today’s $3,000 price and nearly twice its previous peak of $4,946 set in August. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, expected in early December, aims to significantly boost data availability for Layer-2 networks while improving security, sustainability, and scalability. These enhancements could help drive ETH closer to the $5,000 level by month’s end. However, ETH’s path toward $10,000 will depend on clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks and a favourable macro-environment, both of which could unlock major institutional entry. Earlier this year, Ethereum broke out of a bullish flag formation, rallying from $1,800 to its all-time high. Stronger momentum will be required to propel it into five-figure territory. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Culture Meets High-Speed Bitcoin Layer-2 Innovation An emerging candidate for 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling solution cosplaying as a meme coin. Despite its playful branding, the project supercharges Bitcoin with fast throughput, extremely low fees, and full smart-contract functionality. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables fluid Bitcoin transfers across different blockchains. The HYPER presale has already surpassed $28.5 million in funding, and popular crypto analyst Borch Crypto has suggested the token could see gains up to 100×. A recent audit by Coinsult confirmed no smart-contract vulnerabilities, highlighting the project’s credibility. The HYPER token powers network fees, governance, and staking, with early presale investors receiving yields of up to 40% APY. Next year, Bitcoin is going HYPER!

Source: AVAXUSD on Tradingview Securitize Wins EU Approval and Selects Avalanche for Settlement System Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. AVAX Price Holds Key Support as Technical Signals Improve While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Institutional Accumulation Strengthens Bullish Outlook Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over?

According to reports, about 54 billion Korean won — roughly $36–37 million — was taken in what the company called an “abnormal withdrawal” detected at 04:42 KST. Upbit Suspends Solana Services According to the exchange, deposits and withdrawals for assets on the Solana chain were halted immediately after the breach was found. Company engineers moved remaining Solana holdings into cold storage to limit further access. Some tokens were later frozen on-chain while investigators traced transfers. Reports have disclosed that about 12 billion won (around $8–9 million) in LAYER tokens has been frozen so far. NEW: UPBIT DISCLOSES ~$37M HACK ON SOLANA NETWORK – “TO PREVENT ANY DAMAGE TO MEMBER ASSETS, THE ENTIRE AMOUNT WILL BE COVERED BY UPBIT’S HOLDINGS.

Stolen tickers reportedly include ACS, BONK, RAY, JUP, PYTH, ORCA, JTO, LAYER, RENDER, MOODENG, and TRUMP, among others. The list is long, and tracking continues as some tokens move through multiple wallets. At this stage, several of the addresses holding the funds are under active monitoring. Upbit( @Official_Upbit ) has been hacked — 54B KRW (~36.8M USD) in assets on #Solana have been transferred to unknown wallets. https://t.co/plbmBz2G4N https://t.co/YOHoqDVfqa pic.twitter.com/DM5BxSTtXA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 27, 2025 Exchange Operator Pledges Coverage Dunamu , Upbit’s parent company, has said the exchange will cover the full loss from its own reserves so that customer balances will not be reduced. According to the company, this decision was made to protect users while the technical and forensic reviews are under way. A security review of the deposit and withdrawal systems has been launched, and outside experts are reported to be assisting with the investigation. Past Incidents And Timing Raise Questions Reports note the timing was awkward: the breach came just after a high-profile corporate announcement involving Naver Financial on November 26, 2025. Upbit is not new to major hacks; a 2019 attack cost the platform a large amount of ETH. Hot wallets, which are connected to the internet, remain a known weak point for centralized exchanges. That risk was exposed again here. On-Chain Tracking And Recovery Hopes Blockchain analysts are following the trail of transfers and identifying the wallets that received funds. Some tokens can be frozen if their issuers or governing authorities cooperate, which is how the reported LAYER freeze was achieved. Still, many assets may be hard to recover, and legal routes can be slow. It was reported that the exchange attempted to freeze what it could while moving other assets offline. What This Means For Users And Market Confidence For now, Upbit users have been assured their funds are safe because the operator pledged to absorb the loss. Market reaction could include temporary liquidity issues for certain Solana tokens listed on the platform while services remain limited.

Over six XRP-linked ETFs have debuted in recent days, with combined assets nearing $800 million — yet XRP has posted just a 3% gain in the past week. Wall Street’s crypto appetite shows no signs of slowing, but the market’s muted response is raising eyebrows. One possible reason for XRP’s muted reaction could be the lack of retail participation, as much of the recent demand appears to be coming from institutional flows. Open interest in XRP futures currently sits at $4 billion, which is the same level it reached in June, just days before XRP surged to its 2025 high of around $3.65. This parallel is now fueling speculation that a breakout could still be on the table if retail traders begin to re-enter. XRP Price Prediction: Historical Patterns Suggest That XRP Could Soon Explode Looking at the daily chart, a confirmed breakout out of the token’s descending price channel could set in motion a trend reversal for XRP. The price would have to climb to $2.40 at least to achieve that. In that case, the first target could be the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2.60. Then, we could expect a much more pronounced move to $3.10 if positive momentum accelerates. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just sent a buy signal after rising above the 14-day moving average. Hence, it seems that XRP is already on the move. As the market shows early signs of recovery, top presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are quickly gaining momentum. This Dogecoin-themed meme coin has already raised over $4 million, giving traders a rare early-day chance to join a high-energy project before it hits the market. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Tapping Into the Spirit of Early Dogecoin Maxi Doge ($MAXI) brings back the feel of Dogecoin’s early days, when meme coins were fun, fast-moving, and full of potential. Built on Ethereum, it’s designed for traders who want to get in early and ride the momentum as the community grows.

They also get access to an exclusive idea hub through which they can share insights , trading setups , their biggest Ws and Ls, and more. Finally, the project plans to invest up to 25% of the presale funds into a handful of YOLO trades and use the money to pay for marketing. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, simply head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

Prices have responded positively after U.S. stock markets rose yesterday, as increased expectations of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month buoyed sentiment. BTC is up by 5% today, while Ethereum and Solana have risen by 4% and 3.5%, although many major tokens remain down in the past week and month. Yet today’s bounce may signal a sustained turnaround, so we’ve picked the best altcoin to buy now, in order to take advantage of a surge in bullishness. This token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that’s aiming to make mining much more accessible. Crypto Price Prediction: Best Altcoin to Buy During the Crypto Crash PEPENODE kicked off its increasingly popular presale at the end of September, and now it has raised more than $2.2 million from enthusiastic investors. As noted above, its unique selling point is that it offers a unique mining system, one that removes the massive cost that comes with traditional crypto mining. Namely, it enables users to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow simply by spending PEPENODE on more nodes. Excitingly, more nodes equal greater rewards, implying that there may be a big demand for PEPENODE tokens. PEPENODE pays out mining rewards in the form of external coins, such as Pepe and Fartcoin, while it will add additional coins at later dates. On top of this, holders of PEPENODE can stake the token for a passive income , and at the moment, the coin is paying a very attractive yield of 586% APY. We could therefore see the token shoot up in price steadily over time, given the bullishness of its tokenomics. Mapping your next move in Pepenode isn’t flavor. It’s core gameplay that determines how fast you climb upgrade those Nodes! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/vY69IDm3C1 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 27, 2025 And what’s also interesting is that miners can sell on their virtual nodes once they’re finished with them, providing them with an exit and another source of income. PEPENODE Could Be One of the Biggest New Coins of 2026 Such features make PEPENODE one of the most exciting presale tokens in the market right now, and it has every chance of surging once it lists in the coming weeks. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, which its team has allocated between marketing, development, listings, mining rewards, and its treasury. Investors can join its sale by going to the PEPENODE website , where they can connect a suitable wallet and buy as much of the token as they like. It’s currently selling at a price of $0.0011685, although this will rise again in two days. In fact, it will rise every few days until the sale ends, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later. Given that the market looks ready to recover, now could be a perfect time to buy.

55013426,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90839,1764286232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Reveals The Fastest Road To XRP Price Growth,https://timestabloid.com/expert-reveals-the-fastest-road-to-xrp-price-growth/,"Market analyst Chad Steingraber has reiterated his view that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now represent the most influential and fastest-acting force capable of driving XRP price growth. In a series of recent comments, he emphasized that ETF inflows are expanding at a pace that surpasses every other potential catalyst, including increasing network activity and broader market sentiment. Rapid Expansion of XRP ETF Holdings Steingraber’s assessment is anchored in the surge of institutional accumulation taking place through newly launched XRP ETFs. Among the most prominent examples is Bitwise , which now manages more than 80.5 million XRP, valued at roughly $178.8 million. This position increased following a single-day inflow of $7.46 million, marking the largest increase among all XRP ETF issuers for that session. This is the fastest road to a higher price. All other options are much longer. — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 27, 2025 Other managers are seeing similar results. Canary Capital added $5.21 million in inflows, pushing its total XRP assets to $336.98 million. Grayscale and Franklin Templeton also recorded steady increases of $4.32 million and $4.83 million, raising their respective totals to $84.68 million and $76 million. Across all providers, XRP ETFs collectively oversee $676.49 million in assets, an amount accumulated within just nine trading days of the ETFs becoming available. Steingraber expects this figure to grow substantially as more firms begin trading XRP products. Projected Increase in ETF Trading Activity Three additional funds are set to join the group, which Steingraber believes will significantly expand daily trading activity. Once the new ETFs become active, he predicts the average daily trading volume across all issuers could rise by an additional $35 million. Under these conditions, overall daily ETF trading could fall within the $75 million to $80 million range. Higher volume directly translates to greater XRP acquisition requirements from issuers, a factor that he sees as central to near-term market dynamics. Based on the projected trading range, Steingraber calculates that the combined ETFs may eventually need between 20 million and 30 million XRP each day. Even at the lower end of that estimate, accumulation would occur at a substantial pace. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If seven ETFs collectively purchased 20 million XRP in a single session, that would equal 100 million XRP across a standard trading week. Over one month, this could rise to 400 million XRP, and over a full year, the total could reach approximately 4.8 billion XRP. He stresses that the market may not require a full year to feel the impact. According to him, if prices do not adjust upward quickly, the decrease in available supply could become noticeable within a matter of months. Why ETF Demand Is the Most Immediate Catalyst Steingraber argues that no other factor, including corporate integrations, cross-border payment expansion, or broader crypto-market optimism, currently matches the immediate effect of ETF-related buying. ETF inflows draw directly from the circulating supply, and issuers must secure XRP to create new shares when investor demand increases. This link between capital inflow and actual XRP acquisition makes ETFs a direct mechanism for tightening supply, unlike developments that may influence price more gradually. Despite the rapid accumulation, XRP continues to trade around the $2 mark. Analysts note that this is partly because early ETF demand is often routed through over-the-counter desks, delaying its influence on public order books. As more ETFs begin operations and daily accumulation reaches the levels Steingraber projects, he expects the market to respond more quickly. He concludes that ETF-driven demand represents the most immediate path to notable XRP price appreciation, arguing that all other potential catalysts, while valuable, operate on much slower timelines and therefore cannot generate comparable short-term impact.

After falling nearly 45% this month, the meme coin may still have room to drop — with top analyst Ali Martinez suggesting a further 60% decline could be on the table. Martinez points to a clear head-and-shoulders breakdown, with Pepe slipping below its neckline on November 3 and still tracking toward a potential target of $0.0000015. Keep an eye on $PEPE ! pic.twitter.com/YGIsHu6u1A — Ali (@ali_charts) November 26, 2025 Derivatives markets appear to be trailing the setup. Speculative demand has plunged, with Open Interest down 65% since the breakdown, now sitting at $238 million. Pepe Open Interest (OI). Source: Coinglass . Traders have disengaged with price movements, but a $46 million pickup in OI this week and a Long Short Ratio of 1.03 show bullishness creeping back in. The majority of traders are betting on further price increases, showing potential for an early bailout from the head-and-shoulders pattern. Pepe Price Prediction: Will Pepe Vanish? Not all marker commentators share Martinez’s view. Analyst GalaxyBTC cites historical support as grounds for the meme coin still “ looks good ” at its current position. This support stands to be confirmed as a launchpad level yet again with a 6-week descending channel approaching a breakout as momentum indicators flip bullish. PEPE / USD 12-hour chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView. The RSI teeters on a cross back above the 50 neutral line, while the MACD maintains a wide lead above the signal line. Both of these metrics point to this week’s pickup as the early stages of a lasting uptrend as buyers step back in. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout sits around $0.0000047, with a bounce likely to rule out a false breakout. Fully realised, the pattern targets the $0.000009 demand zone for a 95% gain. And as the bull market matures with anticipated U.S. interest rate cuts to fuel risk appetite, this push could go even further, eying a 5x move to all-time highs at $0.000028. PepeNode: Earn Meme Coins with a Virtual Miner Tired of trying to time meme coin pumps? PepeNode ($PEPENODE) makes it easy to earn from the market without trading, guessing entries, or buying hardware. Just build virtual mining rigs, upgrade your setup, and start collecting rewards in top tokens like $PEPE , $FARTCOIN , and more. The more rigs you launch, the more you earn — and top miners also unlock exclusive airdrops. It’s fun, fast to set up, and already gaining serious traction. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.2 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 585% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside, all without having to worry about timing the perfect entry.

Adding to the uncertainty, new data from Arkham reveals that SpaceX transferred out another 1,163 BTC—worth approximately $105.23 million—just a few hours ago. The transfer appears to have been routed to Coinbase Prime, suggesting a potential custody shift by the company. Such large movements often spark concern in the market, as they may signal repositioning, selling preparation, or treasury adjustments by major corporate holders. While Bitcoin’s push above $90K provides temporary relief, it does little to change the broader narrative: the market remains under pressure, liquidity is thinning, and macro-driven uncertainty continues to shape price action. The coming sessions will determine whether BTC can build momentum or slip back into deeper correction territory. SpaceX’s Bitcoin Movements Add New Layer of Market Uncertainty According to data from Arkham, SpaceX currently holds 6,095.45 BTC, valued at roughly $550 million at today’s prices. This substantial treasury position places the company among the larger corporate Bitcoin holders, and its recent on-chain activity has quickly drawn attention across the market. The latest transfer—1,163 BTC moved just hours ago—marks a meaningful shift in activity for SpaceX, especially considering the company has been largely inactive in terms of BTC movements for months. Arkham reports that this is SpaceX’s first notable transaction since October 29, when the company transferred 281 BTC to a new wallet address. While the motives behind these transfers remain unknown, traders typically monitor such moves closely, as large corporate holders can influence market sentiment. Transfers to Coinbase Prime—as suspected in the latest movement—often suggest custody adjustments, treasury restructuring, or preparations for strategic repositioning. For now, there is no clear indication that SpaceX is reducing its Bitcoin exposure. However, the renewed on-chain activity comes at a sensitive moment for the market, which is struggling with selling pressure, fear, and broad speculation about an emerging bear phase. As long as major smart-money entities remain active, Bitcoin’s short-term direction may continue to experience heightened volatility. Attempted Recovery but Still Under Pressure Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after plunging to new local lows last week, with the price now pushing back above $91,000. The chart shows a sharp bounce from the sub-$82,000 zone, which acted as a temporary support during the capitulation phase. However, despite this rebound, BTC remains below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—which reinforces the broader bearish structure. The recent upswing reflects short-term relief rather than a confirmed trend reversal. Volume spiked heavily during the sell-off, indicating forced liquidations and panic selling. But the current bounce is happening on lighter volume, suggesting that buyers are cautious and not yet committing with strong conviction. Structurally, Bitcoin must reclaim the $95,000–$98,000 zone, where the 50-day and 100-day moving averages converge. This area represents the first major resistance cluster and will determine whether the market is transitioning into a recovery or simply forming a lower high before another leg down. Failure to break above this band could invite renewed selling pressure.

Banks will be allowed to offer accounts, custody and payment services tied to stablecoins such as USDT, government statements and local reports disclosed. The move follows a sharp rise in crypto use as people seek ways to hold dollar-pegged value amid currency pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Banks To Offer USDT Accounts Reports have disclosed that Economy Minister Jose Gabriel Espinoza announced the change, and at least one lender, Banco Bisa, has already begun offering custody and transfer services for USDT. Based on reports, crypto transactions in Bolivia jumped dramatically last year, with some counts showing growth of more than 500% and figures putting crypto activity at $294 million in the first half of 2025. Those numbers have pushed regulators and banks to respond more directly. 💥 BREAKING: 🇧🇴 Bolivia to integrate Bitcoin and crypto into its financial system, starting with stablecoins pic.twitter.com/Qb0Tj7pern — Bitcoin Archive (@BitcoinArchive) November 26, 2025 Everyday Payments And Savings People and businesses are reportedly testing USDT for real payments. Some shops and service providers have shown prices in USDT, and certain sectors — such as car dealers and firms handling imports — are said to be accepting stablecoin payments for some transactions. According to market observers, the change is partly a response to shortages of physical US dollars and to rising costs that make the local currency less stable for saving. Banks will be able to create savings products denominated in stablecoins, and may offer loans or payment options tied to them. Cross-Border Transfers And Remittances Based on reports, one obvious use will be cross-border transfers. Stablecoins can offer a dollar-pegged option when access to actual US dollars is limited. That could help businesses that buy fuel or other imports and families that receive money from abroad. Still, practical hurdles remain: many people are unbanked or lack easy internet access, and broad adoption will take infrastructure, training and clear consumer protections. Regulatory Limits And Risks According to analysts, the government’s plan does not make stablecoins legal tender in place of the boliviano. Rather, it lets regulated banks provide crypto-linked services under the financial system. That means accepting USDT will likely stay voluntary for merchants. There are also risks to watch: stablecoin liquidity, custody safety, and how well banks manage anti-money-laundering rules. Consumer education and stronger oversight will be needed to protect ordinary users. What Comes Next Several months of rollout and pilot programs are expected, and observers will be watching transaction volumes and how many banks and businesses sign on. If the system grows, Bolivia could become an example for neighboring countries facing similar currency stress. But the deeper economic problems that pushed people to crypto — inflation and limited dollar access — will still need government solutions beyond new payment rails.

His comments were made during a recent shareholder briefing, where he underscored SBI’s involvement in a developing XRP treasury project managed by Evernorth. Although the presentation was originally delivered in Japanese, an English-language version was later circulated by community commentator Crypto Eri. Overview of Evernorth Treasury Project Evernorth recently announced plans to join forces with Armada Acquisition Corp II through a merger that would create what the company describes as a large-scale XRP treasury entity. As part of this plan, Evernorth has launched a fundraising effort valued at $1 billion. SBI Group is one of the major contributors to this initiative and has allocated $200 million specifically to the acquisition of XRP on the open market. XRP | Ripple @evernorthxrp ""This will be very interesting."" pic.twitter.com/i0KMgEIJCK — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) November 26, 2025 The fundraising round also includes a substantial contribution from Ripple, which is providing a mix of XRP and cash exceeding $500 million. Participation extends further to individual and institutional investors. Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has already supplied 50 million XRP personally, while other companies, such as Kraken, Pantera Capital, and Arrington Capital, have collectively added more than $600 million. SBI’s Position and Expectations The merger is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2026. Once finalized, the combined entity plans to begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol XRPN. Kitao referred to the project as noteworthy due to the expectations around its market performance and strategic value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As one of the investors backing the treasury, SBI Group may benefit from any gains that arise once the shares become publicly traded. The arrangement allows SBI to hold a direct stake in an entity built around long-term XRP accumulation and management. Current Holdings and Status As of early November, Evernorth reported holding approximately 473.27 million XRP, valued at around $1.03 billion based on prevailing market prices at the time. These assets are spread across a series of wallets operating on the XRP Ledger. According to available data, two of the primary wallets hold roughly 45 million XRP and 42 million XRP each, while the remainder is distributed across several other custodial accounts. Kitao’s remarks signal SBI Group’s continued interest in the broader XRP ecosystem and reaffirm its ongoing collaboration with Ripple. The upcoming merger and public listing represent the next phase of this involvement, positioning SBI to play a prominent role in the development of the new treasury-focused enterprise.

This bold proposal aims to reduce the tax burden on American workers while leveraging an unconventional funding source: tariff revenue. What Does Trump’s Income Tax Cut Plan Actually Mean? President Trump’s proposal centers on using revenue generated from tariffs to fund reductions in income taxes. This approach represents a fundamental shift in how the government might collect and redistribute funds. The income tax cut would potentially put more money back into the pockets of American taxpayers. According to multiple media reports, the President believes tariff collections could cover a substantial portion of the proposed income tax reduction. This strategy connects international trade policy directly with domestic tax relief, creating an innovative economic model. How Would This Income Tax Cut Actually Work? The mechanics behind this income tax cut proposal involve several key components. First, tariffs collected on imported goods would flow into government coffers. Then, these funds would offset the revenue loss from lowering income tax rates. Key aspects of the plan include: Reduced income tax rates across multiple brackets Increased reliance on tariff revenue Potential changes to international trade relationships Possible impacts on consumer prices What Are the Potential Benefits of This Income Tax Cut Strategy? This innovative approach to funding an income tax cut offers several potential advantages. American workers could see immediate benefits through higher take-home pay. Moreover, businesses might experience reduced payroll costs and increased consumer spending power. The income tax cut could stimulate economic growth by putting more disposable income in circulation. However, the success of this strategy depends heavily on maintaining sufficient tariff revenue streams while managing potential trade relationship impacts. Could This Income Tax Cut Face Implementation Challenges? While the income tax cut proposal sounds promising, several hurdles could emerge. Congress must approve any significant tax changes, and political opposition might complicate passage. Additionally, fluctuating tariff revenues could create budget uncertainty. International trade partners might respond with their own tariffs, potentially affecting American exports. The income tax cut’s sustainability also depends on maintaining consistent trade flows and tariff collections over time. What Makes This Income Tax Cut Different From Previous Proposals? This income tax cut stands apart because of its unique funding mechanism. Unlike traditional tax cuts funded through spending reductions or increased borrowing, this plan uses tariff revenue as the primary offset. This creates a direct link between trade policy and domestic tax relief. The income tax cut proposal represents a departure from conventional fiscal thinking. It suggests that protectionist trade policies could finance domestic economic benefits, potentially reshaping how governments approach revenue generation. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Approach to Tax Policy President Trump’s income tax cut proposal marks a significant departure from traditional economic thinking. By linking tariff revenue to domestic tax relief, this plan could redefine how governments balance international trade and domestic fiscal policy. The success of this income tax cut will depend on careful implementation and ongoing evaluation of its economic impacts. Frequently Asked Questions How would tariff revenue fund the income tax cut? Money collected from tariffs on imported goods would be used to replace revenue lost from lowering income tax rates, creating a new funding stream for tax relief. When might this income tax cut take effect? The timeline depends on congressional approval and implementation details. The process could take several months or longer if political negotiations become complex. Would all taxpayers benefit from this income tax cut? While details are still emerging, the proposal appears aimed at providing broad-based tax relief, though specific impacts might vary across income brackets. How might this affect international trade relationships? Increased reliance on tariff revenue could strain trade partnerships, potentially leading to retaliatory measures from other countries. What are the risks of funding tax cuts through tariffs? Primary risks include trade disruption, potential consumer price increases, and revenue volatility if trade patterns change significantly. How does this compare to previous tax cut proposals? This approach is unique in its direct linkage between tariff collections and income tax reductions, representing an innovative funding mechanism.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.33 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $3.79. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.3847 Market cap $382.73M Trading volume $114.29M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.393 24-hour low $0.3759 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 14.11% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.4983 14-Day RSI 42.80 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.6970 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is stabilizing but still needs to reclaim $0.407 for real upside. The coin’s short-term trend is up, but momentum is cooling. The resistance at $0.395 and $0.407 remains the barrier to expansion. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As of November 27, WIF is stabilizing after the sharp drop seen around Nov 21–22. The price has recovered from the lower Bollinger Band but remains below the middle band near $0.407, which continues to act as resistance. WIF’s momentum is improving, as shown by a positive MACD histogram, though both MACD lines remain below zero, indicating the broader trend is still in a recovery phase. Also, PVT has begun rising again but remains subdued. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart shows a clearer short-term uptrend, with price trading above the Alligator lines and the structure sloping upward. However, the candles show repeated hesitation around $0.39–$0.395, where rejection wicks appear. The MACD remains positive but is losing strength as the histogram contracts, indicating a cooling momentum.

WIF is in recovery mode but not yet in a full bullish trend. Traders can expect continued grinding upward with pullbacks, and watch for a decisive break above $0.407, which would confirm strength and open higher targets. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $1 by the end of 2025 and between $3.4 and $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

This massive expiration event represents one of the largest in crypto history and could significantly influence Bitcoin price action in the coming days. What Does This Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean for Traders? According to data from Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange, these Bitcoin options contracts will expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC on November 28. The sheer scale of this expiration demands attention from every serious crypto investor. The put/call ratio of 0.56 indicates more call options than put options, suggesting overall bullish sentiment among traders. The max pain price sits at $100,000, representing the strike price where the maximum number of options would expire worthless. This level often acts as a gravitational pull on the underlying asset’s price as expiration approaches. Understanding these Bitcoin options dynamics helps traders anticipate potential market movements. How Do Options Expirations Affect Bitcoin Price? Options expirations create significant market pressure as traders adjust their positions. Here’s what typically happens: Gamma exposure forces market makers to hedge their positions Large expirations can lead to increased volatility Price often gravitates toward the max pain level Post-expiration frequently brings relief rallies or sell-offs The current Bitcoin options landscape shows substantial open interest that must be resolved. Market participants should prepare for potential price swings as these contracts reach their expiration date. The $100,000 max pain price becomes particularly relevant for short-term price predictions. Ethereum Options Join the Expiration Party Meanwhile, Ethereum options worth $1.7 billion will expire simultaneously. These Ethereum contracts feature a put/call ratio of 0.48 and a max pain price of $3,400. The coordinated expiration of both major cryptocurrency options creates a compounded market event that could amplify volatility across the entire crypto space. The lower put/call ratio for Ethereum options indicates even stronger bullish sentiment compared to Bitcoin. This divergence between the two largest cryptocurrencies provides interesting insights into trader positioning and market expectations. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? Following this massive Bitcoin options expiration, traders should monitor several key factors: Immediate price reaction after 8:00 a.m. UTC Volume and liquidity changes in derivatives markets Open interest reset for new options contracts Spot market correlation with derivatives activity Historical patterns suggest that large Bitcoin options expirations often precede significant price movements. However, market conditions and external factors can always override typical expiration effects. The current macroeconomic environment adds another layer of complexity to this already dramatic Bitcoin options event. Navigating Post-Expiration Market Conditions Once these Bitcoin options contracts settle, the market typically experiences a period of recalibration. Market makers reduce their hedging activities, and traders establish new positions based on updated market outlooks. This transition period often creates trading opportunities for alert investors. The resolution of $13.4 billion in Bitcoin options exposure will undoubtedly leave its mark on market structure. Whether this leads to sustained trends or temporary disruptions remains to be seen, but the magnitude guarantees market impact. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin Markets Today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration represents a critical inflection point for cryptocurrency markets. The $13.4 billion notional value underscores the growing maturity and sophistication of crypto derivatives. While short-term volatility seems inevitable, the long-term implications for market development are profoundly positive as institutional participation continues to grow. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin options expiration? Bitcoin options expiration is when options contracts reach their expiry date and are either exercised or expire worthless based on the underlying asset’s price. How does the put/call ratio affect market sentiment? A put/call ratio below 1 indicates more call options than puts, suggesting bullish sentiment among traders expecting price increases. What is max pain price in options trading? Max pain price is the strike price where the maximum number of options contracts expire worthless, causing the most financial pain to option holders. Can options expirations predict Bitcoin price movement? While not perfectly predictive, large options expirations often influence short-term price action as market makers adjust their hedging strategies. How often do Bitcoin options expire? Major crypto exchanges typically have monthly options expirations, with some offering weekly contracts for more frequent trading opportunities. Should retail traders worry about options expirations? Retail traders should be aware of expiration dates but focus more on their overall investment strategy rather than timing markets around single events. Found this analysis helpful?

Interpol just dropped a bombshell revelation that will make you think twice about online opportunities. The international police organization has officially designated crypto-based scam compounds as a serious transnational criminal threat, exposing a dark underworld that spans multiple countries and exploits thousands of victims. What Are Crypto-Based Scam Compounds? Interpol’s investigation reveals these crypto-based scam compounds operate like modern-day criminal enterprises. They lure unsuspecting victims with fake job postings, promising legitimate employment opportunities. However, once recruits arrive at compounds in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, they find themselves trapped in nightmare scenarios. Victims face forced labor conditions where they must execute various fraudulent schemes including: Voice phishing operations Romance scams targeting lonely individuals Sophisticated investment frauds Direct cryptocurrency scams How Do These Criminal Networks Operate? The sophistication of these crypto-based scam compounds demonstrates why Interpol considers them a transnational threat. These organizations use cryptocurrency for several key reasons that make them particularly dangerous. Cryptocurrency provides these criminals with: Borderless transaction capabilities Enhanced anonymity features Quick money movement across jurisdictions Difficulty in tracing funds Why Is This Designation So Important? Interpol’s classification of crypto-based scam compounds as a transnational criminal threat marks a significant shift in global law enforcement priorities. This designation triggers enhanced cooperation between member countries and allocates additional resources to combat these networks. The international police organization emphasizes that no single country can tackle this problem alone. The cross-border nature of these crypto-based scam compounds requires coordinated efforts across multiple jurisdictions to effectively dismantle the networks and rescue victims. What Can You Do to Stay Protected? While authorities work to dismantle these crypto-based scam compounds , individuals need to remain vigilant. Understanding the warning signs can help you avoid falling victim to these sophisticated operations. Watch for these red flags in job offers: Unusually high salaries for minimal qualifications Vague job descriptions Requests for upfront payments Pressure to relocate quickly Companies with limited online presence The Global Response to Crypto-Based Scam Compounds Interpol’s announcement signals a new era in fighting crypto-based scam compounds . The organization calls for improved information sharing between national police forces and enhanced training for identifying cryptocurrency-related crimes. Moreover, financial intelligence units worldwide are developing better tools to track transactions involving crypto-based scam compounds . This coordinated approach aims to disrupt the financial flows that keep these criminal enterprises operating. Frequently Asked Questions What makes crypto-based scam compounds different from regular scams? These compounds operate as organized criminal enterprises with physical locations where victims are held against their will and forced to commit fraud, making them far more dangerous than typical online scams. Which countries have the highest concentration of these compounds? Interpol specifically identified Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos as primary locations, though the networks operate across multiple Southeast Asian countries. How do victims typically get recruited? Most victims respond to fraudulent job postings that promise high salaries and good working conditions, only to discover the reality once they arrive at the compounds. What types of cryptocurrency scams do they run? These compounds typically execute investment frauds, romance scams, fake exchange platforms, and phishing operations targeting cryptocurrency holders. How can I verify if a job offer is legitimate? Always research companies thoroughly, verify contact information through official channels, and be wary of offers that seem too good to be true. What should I do if I suspect someone is trapped in such a compound? Contact local authorities immediately and provide any available information about the location and circumstances. You can also reach out to international organizations that specialize in human trafficking cases. Help spread awareness about this critical issue – share this article on social media to ensure more people understand the dangers of crypto-based scam compounds and can protect themselves and their loved ones from falling victim to these transnational criminal operations.

This movement signals important changes in market sentiment that could impact your investment decisions. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency market dynamics. This important metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. However, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clear picture of genuine market movements.

The current reading of 21 suggests we’re firmly in Bitcoin season territory.

When the index remains low, it might indicate better opportunities in Bitcoin or established projects.

Dogecoin (DOGE), the first meme currency, however, has been encountering strong technological challenges since it fell below its vital support level of $0.14, which triggered a prediction of the currencies falling to $0.07. In this environment of uncertainty, the presale scheme of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has managed to attract capital through the provision of utility and growth trends. In the emerging environment of investing in the best crypto to buy today and achieve significant gains, there’s a clear shift towards initiatives that exhibit proper foundations. Dogecoin’s Tough Spot The market trend of Dogecoin has shifted to the bear side, and its recent break below the support level of $0.14 indicates its possibility of dropping even further. According to various analysts, the break below this crucial support level makes the downward movement of Dogecoin to levels of $0.13, $0.12, and even $0.10 possible, along with the structural support level of $0.07. Although the meme coin community engagement of 19,000 posts and 2.2 million reactions in a day leads the chart, this level of community engagement has not been enough to halt the fall. The bearish signals from the MACD indicator continue, although the RSI indicator has yet to reach the oversold levels before turning the tide. The disparity from the levels of hype and price performance makes this particular option less attractive as a platform that identifies the best cryptocurrencies to invest in safely. Dominant Presale to Near Completion of Phase 6 In contrast to Dogecoin’s challenges, there lies a tempting and urgent opportunity in the almost presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The platform has shown great support because it has managed to raise over $19,020,000 and has attracted a community of 18,250 holders. The sixth phase of the fundraising has been reached: the platform has sold 95% of the tokens at the current price of $0.035, which has shown a 250% jump from the first phase. This phase will be sold out at a rapid pace and will be the last opportunity to obtain MUTM without its price rising to $0.040 in the next phase. The intended progression towards hitting the $0.06 launch price will allow existing investors to generate substantial growth possibilities and will continue to remain a prime option to consider when investing in the cryptocurrencies available to buy at the current time. Competitive Leaderboard Incentive And adding a level of engagement to its fundraising activities, the Mutuum Finance platform has also improved its presales through the installation of a 24-hour leaderboard. This will create a level of competition to encourage the most active participants. The participant who makes the highest transaction in the 24-hour period will win the bonus of MUTM $500 daily. The leaderboard system also automatically reinitializes at the start of each day at UTC 00:00. This helps to ignite the already existing community and also form the agenda of bringing in new investors who will be interested in the best possible option of investing in the best-crypto available in the market because of the instant benefit provided above its value appreciation in the presale. Sustainable Buy-and-Distribute Strategy Apart from the presale model, the Mutuum Finance platform has been built to retain the value of its tokens through the novel “Buy and Distribute” model. The platform utilizes its fee income to automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. The bought tokens are then distributed to the users who stake their mtTokens. The mtTokens are the interest-bearing receipts received as liquidity. This leads to a virtuous cycle because the usage of the protocol and the generation of fees will be directly proportional to the pressure exerted on the MUTM token from the buy side. This directly relates the success of the platform to the demand for the token. The basic utility of this approach plays a crucial role in making choices about what to buy in the world of cryptocurrencies today when it comes to the mostly non-performing nature of meme coins. Comparing Dogecoin And Mutuum Finance’s Performance Paths DOGE’s failed support levels and bearish outlook point to the dangers of hype coins. MUTM’s close to sold-out presale phase, engaging rewards programs, and sound tokenomics provide a tangible prospect of immense growth. The limited duration of the opportunity to participate at the price of $0.035 is noted. The data-driven momentum presented at Mutuum Finance makes it an attractive option for the type of investor who prioritizes the identification of the best available option in the world of crypto to invest in.

55016474,635467,1764291603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55016474.jpeg,Australia Signals Big Crypto Ambitions With $24B Framework and Tighter Custody Standards,https://bitcoinist.com/australia-signals-crypto-ambitions-24b-framework/,"Australia is accelerating its push into digital finance with the introduction of the Corporations Amendment (Digital Assets Framework) Bill 2025, a comprehensive regulatory overhaul designed to strengthen crypto custody standards, improve investor protection, and unlock an estimated $24 billion in annual economic value. The bill establishes the country’s first comprehensive framework for digital asset platforms and crypto custodians, positioning Australia as one of the most proactive jurisdictions in the global race for crypto regulation. A New Licensing Regime to Protect Consumers The cornerstone of the legislation is a requirement for crypto exchanges and custody providers to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL). This brings them under the supervision of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) , a major structural shift for an industry that previously operated in a fragmented regulatory space. Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino emphasized that Australia must “keep pace” with financial innovation. The bill specifically targets firms holding customer crypto, rather than blockchain technology itself, addressing a widespread concern that companies can currently store unlimited digital assets for clients without adequate safeguards. To close this gap, the bill introduces two new regulated categories: Digital asset platforms Tokenized custody platforms Both will be subject to strict standards for transactions, settlements, asset storage, and mandatory disclosure of risks and fees. Balancing Innovation With Oversight While the legislation imposes tough standards, it also aims to support responsible growth in the digital asset sector. Companies handling less than A$10 million in annual transactions or participating in crypto only as an incidental activity will be exempt from licensing. Industry response has been broadly positive, with firms like Crypto.com and DECA calling the bill a long-awaited step that provides regulatory clarity without stifling innovation. A phased rollout, a 12-month preparation period followed by a six-month transition window, gives platforms time to meet the new requirements. ASIC’s recent crackdown on scams underscores the urgency. Since mid-2023, the regulator has removed over 14,000 phishing and scam sites, approximately 20% of which were related to cryptocurrency. A Transformational Step for Australia’s Digital Finance Future Treasurer Jim Chalmers noted that digital assets, from cryptocurrencies to tokenized real-world assets, represent a significant economic opportunity. Research cited by the government suggests that the reforms could help unlock up to $24 billion annually in productivity and efficiencies across the financial sector. However, industry experts warn that coordination across ASIC, AUSTRAC, and the ATO will be essential. The bill’s success will depend on whether the final regulatory framework is both enforceable and flexible enough to adapt to rapid innovation in tokenization and blockchain services. As the bill moves through Parliament, with easy passage expected in the House, the key question is whether crossbench support in the Senate will solidify Australia’s position as a global leader in secure, innovation-friendly crypto regulation.

Got zeroed.” Scaramucci framed the last 20 trading days as another brutal reminder of crypto’s structural volatility. “I know I have a trap door on my portfolio,” he said. “Once in a while I’ll be walking across the living room feeling beautiful about myself. And then, boom, a trap door opens and I have fallen into the basement of the house.” Related Reading: Will Crypto Explode If Kevin Hassett Takes Over The Fed In 2026? According to Novogratz, this particular trap door opened at Binance. “It started really by, you know, at Binance, they had an oracle which set price misfunction,” he said. That error hit a synthetic stablecoin and “created a cascade where people were getting stopped out because there was the wrong price.” The dislocation then bled into levered perpetual markets “like Hyperliquid, like Uniswap,” where “as prices went down, people started getting liquidated.” He argued that the way crypto participants use leverage turned a technical glitch into a systemic event. “What people don’t understand about crypto is that the crypto investor doesn’t play for 10, 11, 12 percent returns,” he said. “Crypto investor call themselves degens with pride. They want to turn one into 15. And so they trade a very volatile asset with a lot of leverage.” Perpetual futures make that leverage particularly dangerous for liquidity providers. “Perpetual futures are not normal futures,” Novogratz said, crediting “the genius that Arthur Hayes and his group of people” for a design where “as longs get liquidated, they’re paired off against shorts.” In a fast collapse, “you could be short and you lose your short position. Well, if you’re long on another exchange against that short position, you’re shit out of luck. And that happened to a lot of market makers.” Will The Crypto Market Recover? The result, he said, was a sharp loss of liquidity and retail capital. “We lost a lot of liquidity in the market. We lost a lot of retail punters who lost their stack,” he noted, adding that after such a wipeout “it takes a while for Humpty Dumpty to get put back together again.” Novogratz said he initially expected higher levels to hold. “I actually, to be fair, thought we were going to hold at higher levels at $90,000,” he admitted. “And we went all the way to $80,000. $80,000 was a maximum pain point… Got to $1.80 on XRP. We got to $125 on Solana. Real pain points.” He links the subsequent rebound to macro tailwinds, not healed sentiment. “Now we bounce up. We bounce because of the Fed. But we’re not out of the woods,” he said. “I do think Bitcoin will climb back towards $100,000 by the end of the year, but there’ll be sellers waiting there. We’ve done some medium-term damage to the psychology of the market.” Related Reading: Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran On the spot side, he highlighted massive profit-taking by early holders against ETF-driven inflows. “We had one $9 billion seller,” he said. “That’s one-third of all of IBIT’s flows of the year.” As US wealth channels move “from a zero weighting to a 3 to 4 percent weighting” in Bitcoin, that “was met with OG sellers.” “In the long run, that’s healthy,” he said. “In the short run, that’s painful.” Novogratz also argued that crypto is being repriced as a real business ecosystem rather than a pure story. “It’s a transition from just being a story — ‘we’re the most important industry… we’re going to decentralize the world’ — to ‘show me what crypto actually does,’” he said. “Some businesses are making money. Some businesses aren’t. There are some token ecosystems that make common sense to an investor and there’s some that all feel like they’re just an association.” Overlaying it all is a macro backdrop he views as increasingly supportive. He called the Fed’s recent signals and plans to ease bank cash requirements in repo “a monstrous liquidity boom that’s coming,” adding that “they’re going to bring rates down to 2 percent in the next 16 months” and that inflation will “creep higher,” implying negative real rates. For crypto, the message is double-edged: structurally de-levered, with fewer market makers and wounded sentiment, but still tied to a global liquidity cycle that Novogratz believes is turning in its favor — once Humpty Dumpty gets put back together again. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,115.

Bitcoin and Ethereum remain range bound while mid caps show uneven recovery patterns. Avalanche, Sui, and Hedera have posted sharp intraday swings, and XRP continues to react heavily to liquidity shifts. In unstable markets like this, analysts say the smartest positioning comes from mixing established assets with early-stage presales that offer fixed entry levels. Because the broader market is still struggling for direction, accumulating strong assets now is becoming a key strategy for traders expecting a turnaround. Assets to Watch in the Next Crypto Bull Run Here are the five assets analysts believe could lead the next expansion cycle. 1. Noomez ($NNZ) Noomez ($NNZ) has quickly become one of the most watched early-stage opportunities after its price advanced from $0.0000187 to $0.0000230 , confirming the start of Stage 5. With Stage 6 approaching , buyers understand that the next increase is automatic once the current allocation is cleared. The presale has already gathered 196 holders with $43,512.28 raised , and demand is rising because entries remain fixed and shielded from open market volatility. Key elements driving Noomez’s traction include: 28-stage model with transparent pricing Unsold tokens permanently burned each stage Vault events at Stage 14 and Stage 28 Up to 66% APY through Noom Rewards Early interest described as massive as demand continues to explode With prices low at this phase, many buyers choose to buy Noomez now before the next jump. The referral system also gives both sides a 10 percent bonus. 2. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera, currently priced at $0.1478 , remains one of the most stable enterprise focused networks. Key details supporting Hedera’s long-term outlook include: $6.28B market cap with strong institutional backing 42.47B circulating supply and steady on-chain usage Predictable, low-cost network fees High throughput suited for enterprise applications 3. Sui (SUI) Sui trades at $1.53 with a $5.66B market cap and nearly $787M in daily volume . Core strengths driving Sui’s relevance include: 3.68B circulating supply with strong liquidity Expanding Move-based ecosystem Heavy focus on gaming and high-speed apps Growing validator network and developer activity 4. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, priced at $14.94 , maintains a strong $6.41B market cap with nearly $500M in 24h volume . Key Avalanche advantages include: Rapid growth of custom subnets for institutions 428.93M AVAX circulating with strong liquidity A leading ecosystem for scaling independent chains Broad developer adoption across gaming and enterprise apps 5. XRP XRP trades at $2.19 with a massive $132.53B market cap and $3.93B daily volume . Reasons XRP remains essential for large-cap exposure include: 60.33B tokens circulating with high liquidity Ongoing global settlement integrations Strong institutional visibility A proven asset during macro liquidity rotations Accumulating Noomez Coin Is Emerging as the Smartest Strategy for 2025 Noomez is attracting early accumulation for one simple reason: it provides fixed, predictable entry levels at a time when open-market assets move aggressively with every liquidity shift. Each stage increases the price automatically, which means anyone entering now secures a lower cost basis than future buyers. The presale also burns all unsold tokens, tightening supply as demand grows. With Stage 6 approaching and momentum accelerating, many traders see Noomez as the most strategic bet for buyers preparing for the next major market expansion. Why Noomez Could Lead the Next Crypto Bull Run Noomez is gaining momentum because demand rises at every stage while supply shrinks from automatic burns. Prices increase with each new phase, and staking boosts long-term upside with up to 66 percent APY. Fixed pricing protects buyers during volatile markets, and Stage 6 is nearing activation, meaning the time is running out for early entries before higher tiers take over.

According to a recent SEC filing , CalPERS acquired 448,157 Strategy (MSTR) shares in the third quarter, paying over $144m for the position. The stake, which gave the fund direct equity exposure to one of the most volatile Bitcoin plays in traditional markets, is now worth roughly $80m. In the context of CalPERS, the hit is manageable. The fund manages over $550b in assets for more than 2m public sector workers and retirees, making it the largest public pension plan in the US, so the Strategy stake represents only a tiny slice of its portfolio. Index Risk Looms With JPMorgan Flagging Possible MSCI And Nasdaq Exits Strategy’s stock has done the damage. The shares closed around $175 on Wednesday and are down about 45% so far this quarter. The drop largely tracks Bitcoin’s own swings, as well as a broader risk-off tone that has weighed on high-beta tech and crypto-related names. Sentiment has also taken a hit from Wall Street. JPMorgan analysts recently warned that Strategy could be removed from major equity benchmarks such as the MSCI USA index and the Nasdaq 100. They estimated that MSCI exclusion alone might trigger up to $2.8b in outflows, with more selling pressure if other index providers follow. Strategy’s spot @MicroStrategy in major indexes is now at risk, with JPMorgan warning that a removal from MSCI USA or the Nasdaq 100 could spark billions in outflows. #Strategy #CryptoStocks https://t.co/ozDjakVUm7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 21, 2025 The index angle matters because passive money is already deeply tied to the name. Funds that track benchmarks and hold Strategy as part of those indices account for nearly $9b of market exposure, and a decision on its index status is expected by Jan. 15. A removal would likely force some of those vehicles to sell, regardless of their view on Bitcoin or the company. Strategy’s Premium Vanishes As Investors Turn Wary Of Leveraged Bitcoin Plays For a business that built its brand on wrapping Bitcoin inside an equity ticker, index risk hits more than daily volumes. Strategy became a favoured tool for institutions that wanted listed market access to Bitcoin but were not ready to hold the token directly, so any loss of benchmark status threatens that role as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto. The company’s rise followed a simple pattern. It sold stock into the market, used the proceeds to buy more Bitcoin, then leaned on each crypto rally to justify fresh issuance and even larger purchases. At the height of that cycle, Strategy’s market value traded far above the worth of its Bitcoin holdings, reflecting a rich premium for its aggressive strategy. That premium has largely evaporated. The firm’s valuation now sits only slightly above the value of its Bitcoin reserves, a sign that investors are no longer willing to pay as much extra for its leveraged play on the asset. For CalPERS and other large funds using listed proxies to tap crypto, the episode is a reminder that Bitcoin exposure packaged in equity form can still deliver sharp drawdowns when sentiment turns.

AllianceDAO founder Qiao Wang recently dropped a bombshell revelation about Layer 1 tokens and their fundamental competitive challenges. His insights explain why these foundational blockchain networks struggle to maintain value in today’s rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Why Are Layer 1 Tokens Losing Their Competitive Edge? Qiao Wang argues that Layer 1 tokens face an existential threat: they lack distinct competitive advantages. Cross-chain bridges have become incredibly user-friendly, allowing developers to migrate between networks with surprising ease. This mobility creates a highly competitive environment where no single chain can maintain dominance for long. The situation becomes more challenging when you consider that launching new chains has never been simpler. Wang emphasizes that switching blockchain ecosystems costs significantly less than migrating between cloud platforms like AWS. This low switching cost fundamentally undermines the long-term value proposition of Layer 1 tokens. How Cross-Chain Technology Changes Everything Cross-chain bridges have revolutionized how applications operate across different blockchain networks. Here’s what makes migration so accessible: Most applications can move between chains without major technical hurdles Only applications with highly complex smart contracts face migration challenges Development tools and frameworks have standardized across multiple chains User experience has improved dramatically across bridge interfaces This interoperability means developers can chase better incentives, lower fees, or improved performance without being locked into a single ecosystem. Consequently, Layer 1 tokens must constantly compete to retain their application base. The Vertical Integration Solution: Chains Owning Their Applications Wang proposes a compelling solution for Layer 1 networks seeking sustainable competitive advantages. He suggests that chains must vertically integrate by directly owning their application layers. This strategy creates natural ecosystem lock-in and strengthens network effects. Several prominent chains have already embraced this approach: Solana has developed strong native applications and ecosystem projects Base leverages its Coinbase integration for built-in user acquisition Hyperliquid focuses on specialized financial applications Tempo builds payment-focused solutions directly into its chain This vertical integration creates stronger moats around Layer 1 tokens, making them more resilient to competitive pressures and migration trends. What Does This Mean for Blockchain Investors? For investors believing in blockchain technology’s long-term growth, Wang suggests focusing on chains that control their application layers. These Layer 1 tokens demonstrate stronger defensive characteristics and sustainable competitive advantages. The traditional model of generic Layer 1 tokens competing purely on technical specifications appears increasingly vulnerable. Instead, chains with strategic vertical integration and owned application ecosystems show greater promise for long-term value retention. Conclusion: The Future of Layer 1 Competition The blockchain landscape is undergoing a fundamental shift. Layer 1 tokens can no longer rely on technical superiority alone. Sustainable competitive advantages now require strategic ecosystem development and application layer control. Chains that successfully implement vertical integration strategies will likely outperform their generic counterparts in the long run. Frequently Asked Questions What are Layer 1 tokens? Layer 1 tokens are the native cryptocurrencies of base blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin. They form the foundation upon which other applications and tokens are built. Why do Layer 1 tokens lack competitive advantages? They face intense competition because cross-chain bridges make migration easy, and launching new chains has become simpler, reducing switching costs for developers and users. What is vertical integration in blockchain? Vertical integration occurs when a blockchain network directly owns or controls applications built on its platform, creating stronger ecosystem lock-in and network effects. Which chains are successfully implementing vertical integration? Solana, Base, Hyperliquid, and Tempo are examples of chains that have adopted vertical integration strategies by developing or controlling key applications within their ecosystems. How does this affect my investment strategy? Focus on Layer 1 tokens with strong vertical integration and owned application ecosystems, as they demonstrate better defensive characteristics against competitive pressures. Are all Layer 1 tokens facing these challenges? While most face similar competitive pressures, chains with unique technological advantages or strong ecosystem development may maintain better competitive positioning. Found this analysis insightful?

South Korean authorities are pointing fingers at the infamous Lazarus Group following a devastating $32.2 million Upbit hack that occurred last Thursday. This security breach raises serious questions about exchange safety and the ongoing threat from state-sponsored hacking collectives. What Exactly Happened in the Upbit Hack? The Upbit hack resulted in the loss of 44.5 billion won, equivalent to $32.2 million in cryptocurrency assets. According to Maeil Business Newspaper, the attack took place on Thursday, with investigators quickly identifying patterns consistent with previous Lazarus Group operations. The timing and methodology suggest this was no ordinary cybercrime but a carefully orchestrated assault. Security experts note that the Upbit hack follows a familiar pattern seen in other North Korean-linked cryptocurrency thefts. However, the scale and precision of this particular attack have raised alarms throughout the crypto community. Exchange officials are working around the clock to strengthen security measures and prevent future breaches. Why is Lazarus Group the Prime Suspect? South Korean authorities didn’t arrive at this conclusion randomly. Several key factors point to Lazarus Group’s involvement in the Upbit hack: Technical fingerprints match previous Lazarus operations Similar malware deployment patterns Consistent with North Korea’s cryptocurrency funding strategy Advanced social engineering techniques used Infrastructure overlaps with known Lazarus command centers The Lazarus Group has a well-documented history of targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, making them the logical suspect for investigators. Their sophisticated methods and state backing make them particularly dangerous adversaries in the digital asset space. How Does This Upbit Hack Affect Crypto Investors? For everyday cryptocurrency users, the Upbit hack serves as a stark reminder about exchange security. While Upbit has assured users that customer funds remain protected through insurance reserves, the incident highlights several critical concerns: Even major exchanges remain vulnerable to sophisticated attacks The importance of using hardware wallets for long-term storage Need for enhanced security measures across all trading platforms Ongoing threat from state-sponsored hacking groups This Upbit hack incident should prompt investors to review their security practices immediately. Consider diversifying where you store assets and always enable two-factor authentication wherever available. What Security Lessons Can We Learn? The recent Upbit hack provides valuable insights for both exchanges and individual users. First, exchanges must implement more robust cold storage solutions and regular security audits. Second, users should never keep large amounts on any single exchange. Third, the crypto industry needs better information sharing about emerging threats. Moreover, this Upbit hack demonstrates that even well-established exchanges can become targets. The Lazarus Group specifically chooses high-value targets, meaning no platform is completely safe from determined attackers. Therefore, continuous security upgrades and user education become essential defenses. Looking Forward: The Future of Exchange Security Following this Upbit hack, we can expect several developments in cryptocurrency security. Exchanges will likely increase their insurance coverage and implement more sophisticated monitoring systems. Regulatory bodies may introduce stricter security requirements for trading platforms. Meanwhile, users will become more conscious about where and how they store their digital assets. The Upbit hack represents more than just a financial loss—it’s a wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. As hacking groups become more sophisticated, security measures must evolve even faster to protect user funds and maintain trust in digital asset ecosystems. Frequently Asked Questions How much was stolen in the Upbit hack? The hackers stole 44.5 billion won, which equals approximately $32.2 million in various cryptocurrencies. Has Upbit recovered any of the stolen funds? As of now, Upbit has not announced any recovery of the stolen funds, but investigations are ongoing. Are user funds safe after this hack? Upbit has stated that customer assets remain protected through their insurance reserves, and no user funds were directly affected. Why do authorities suspect Lazarus Group? Technical evidence, attack patterns, and infrastructure links all point to Lazarus Group’s involvement based on their known methods. What should Upbit users do now? Users should enable all available security features, consider moving large holdings to hardware wallets, and monitor official communications from Upbit. How often do major exchanges get hacked?

This moment of market volatility is a profound inflection point, where the interplay of rising institutional adoption and changing global macroeconomic conditions is converging. Historical Breakout Zones Align With Price Structure Bitcoin is currently sitting at a thrilling crossroads. In an X post, an analyst known as CryptoCrewU has stated that BTC is witnessing the strongest bearish divergence in years, paired with a rare 2-week close below the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) of this bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Flees, But Sharks & Whales Quietly Growing: Data Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently dipping into levels reminiscent of past pivotal moments in 2015, 2018, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2022 bottoms. Meanwhile, the Stoch RSI has yet to cross upwards, hinting at the full extent of the potential move ahead. While fear is at its peak in the market right now, history shows that buying during these market lows has consistently led to significant profits over the past 5 years. “Let data guide you, not emotions,” CryptoCrewU noted. Trader_XO highlighted that since 2015, one pattern has remained remarkably consistent in Bitcoin’s cycle. Historically, whenever breaks below the 50-week Moving Average (MA), it has often signaled a deeper move toward the 200-week MA, or even the 300-week MA. Meanwhile, BTC tends to treat the 200-week MA as a major cycle support area. The price has only dipped below the 300-week MA once in history, and anything trading below the 200-week MA has been relatively short-lived, aligning with the best part of the cycle lows. According to Trader_XO, if the price were to revisit those lower moving average levels, and the broader market context aligns, that area would be viewed as a high-probability buying opportunity, unless this time the move is different. Market Structure Shows Early Signs Of Strength Returning Bitcoin is finally showing signs of strength again. A Full-time crypto teacher, Sykodelic, has pointed out that for the first time since the drop from $116,000, the price has broken above its previous low-time-frame (LTF) range, with a strong push above the 50 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Powers Over $90K as Buyers Suddenly Regain Control of the Trend Since the $116,000 rejection, every time BTC attempts to move into an upper range, it gets rejected and makes new lows. This time, BTC has finally pushed higher. Currently, this is simply an LTF action, but these subtle shifts are exactly what to watch out for when it comes to understanding the nature of trend reversals. A daily close above $87,000 will confirm the breakout of the trend. Sykodelic concluded that moving higher after a drop like that is intricate, and it can take time. Therefore, observe the signs and move accordingly to see how the daily close goes.

55018400,635342,1764295207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55018400.jpeg,Coinbase Wallet Rebalancing Creates False $68B LTH Distribution Signal – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-wallet-rebalancing-creates-false-68b-lth/,"The crypto market is facing a wave of misinterpretation as Coinbase’s large-scale wallet rebalancing, which began on November 22, 2025, continues to distort major on-chain indicators. Many dashboards now display what appears to be an unprecedented $68 billion Long-Term Holder (LTH) “sell” spike — but according to analysts, this is not real distribution. Instead, it’s the direct result of Coinbase transferring coins internally as part of its routine wallet restructuring process. This distinction is critical. Several prominent analysts and market commentators have highlighted massive outflows, huge shifts in LTH supply, and unusual wallet movements, yet many have failed to mention the underlying cause: Coinbase’s internal reshuffling. Without this context, market participants might wrongly conclude that long-term holders are panic-selling at scale, reinforcing fear during an already fragile market environment. These rebalancing events have happened before, but the size of Coinbase’s holdings means even normal internal operations can trigger dramatic spikes in on-chain metrics such as LTH Net Position Change, Exchange Netflow, and Spent Output Age Bands. Coinbase Internal Transfers Distorted Key On-Chain Metrics According to detailed analysis by Axel Adler, Coinbase’s internal migration of approximately 800,000 BTC created one of the largest distortions in on-chain data ever recorded — without a single coin being sold. The exchange executed 286 transactions totaling 798,636 BTC, moving funds from legacy P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash) addresses to modern P2WPKH (SegWit) addresses. This technical reorganization produced an artificial $68 billion “realized profit” spike, misleading many market observers into interpreting it as massive long-term holder distribution. This large UTXO migration disrupted several major on-chain indicators. LTH and STH Supply metrics were temporarily skewed, showing a sharp drop in Long-Term Holder supply and a rise in Short-Term Holder supply — a pattern typically associated with heavy “smart money” selling. In reality, no distribution occurred; Coinbase simply restructured its internal wallets. The distortion also affected LTH Realized Profit/Loss models, which reflected tens of billions in phantom gains, and HODL Waves, where UTXO ages were “reset,” suggesting long-term holders had suddenly spent old coins. Even Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) showed a significant spike, mimicking an “old coin awakening,” though the activity was entirely internal. These disruptions highlight how exchange operations can temporarily break the reliability of on-chain metrics, requiring careful interpretation from analysts and investors. Total Market Rebounds but Remains Under Critical Pressure The Total Crypto Market Cap chart shows a sharp rebound after tagging the $2.88T zone, a level that aligns closely with the 100-week moving average (green), acting as a key structural support in previous cycles. This bounce has pushed total valuation back above the $3T mark, but the broader trend remains fragile after weeks of heavy selling across majors like BTC and ETH. Price structure highlights a clear breakdown from the $3.6T–$3.8T consolidation zone, followed by a fast, impulsive decline—mirroring the speed of corrections seen during 2021 and mid-2022. Despite the latest recovery candle, the market remains below the 50-week moving average (blue), signaling that buyers must regain momentum quickly to avoid deeper downside toward the 200-week moving average near $2T. Volume has surged on recent sell-offs, showing widespread forced selling and capitulation behavior—a pattern consistent with cycle mid-reset phases. The rebound, however, shows reduced sell volume, suggesting exhaustion from bearish participants. To confirm strength, total market cap must reclaim the $3.25T–$3.3T area, which currently acts as the first major resistance. Failure to break above this zone risks further consolidation or a retest of the $2.8T support. For now, the market shows early signs of stabilization, but broader recovery depends on Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its own rebound and restore confidence across altcoins.

The update came after the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Court issued an indefinite worldwide asset freeze on Aria Commodities DMCC and related entities, the first global freeze in the case. Justin Sun continues to campaign for justice The order, issued by the Dubai International Financial Centre Court on October 17, blocks any movement of the disputed funds and applies across jurisdictions. Sun has praised the DIFC Courts and its Digital Economy Court for its “fair and resolute ruling,” while claiming the missing funds are being actively traced around the globe to make a full recovery of all the reserve assets. He wrote: “Justice may be delayed, but it will never be denied.” According to Sun , the priority remains “full recovery and restitution” of TUSD’s reserves. Investigations have been speeding up, with more evidence expected from ongoing probes into Chok, Matthew Brittain (linked to Aria entities), and former TrueCoin executives. Since the freeze order is now active, the case is entering a new phase, and legal actions in areas like Hong Kong, Dubai, the Cayman Islands, and other regions are expected to increase, with more evidence and additional recovery steps underway. How the $456M went missing The origin of the fraud can be traced back to 2020 when Techteryx acquired TUSD, while TrueCoin – its original operator – remained the manager of the reserves. In the year that followed, as well as the subsequent one, TrueCoin, First Digital Trust (FDT), Legacy Trust, and offshore entities linked to Matthew Brittain allegedly joined hands to create forged documents, submit misleading filings, and move reserves out of regulated custody. Those funds were ultimately sent to bank accounts linked to Aria DMCC, a Dubai company owned by Brittain’s spouse, and according to available information, FDT CEO Vincent Chok approved these transfers and directed funds into private accounts in exchange for undisclosed kickbacks. The U.S. SEC later accused TrueCoin of misleading investors about the safety of TUSD’s reserves, which exposed deeper operational issues. Despite the drama, TUSD has shown great strength, remaining pegged near $1; however, this is mostly thanks to Sun’s involvement and quarantined reserves. The famous crypto thought leader in April accused the FDT and related parties of embezzling the funds and has worked hard to prevent TUSD’s collapse by protecting holders, even going as far as to support Techteryx with a loan of around $450 million as reported by Cryptopolitan. FDT has denied his claims, and CEO Chok claims there is no evidence to back it up while announcing plans for legal action against Sun. Despite the drama, Sun is unbothered and is more than willing to contend in court, framing his actions as safeguarding the broader crypto ecosystem.

The largest cryptocurrency traded in a tight band between about $90,600 and $91,400 after touching roughly $91,800 in the past 24 hours. A global equity gauge was little changed, yet still on track for its best week since June as traders leaned into the idea that the Federal Reserve is finally ready to start cutting interest rates. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $90,868, down 0.2% Ether : $3,001, down 1.6% XRP : $2.17, down 2.2% Total crypto market cap: $3.18 trillion, down 0.9% China Remains In Focus After JPMorgan Turns Overweight On The Market Asian equities opened mixed. Indexes in South Korea and Japan slipped at the open, while Australia edged higher in thin, holiday-affected trading after the US Thanksgiving break. Chinese shares stayed in focus after JPMorgan lifted its view on the market to overweight, arguing that the potential upside next year now outweighs the risk of further losses, even as stress at developers such as China Vanke kept property names under pressure. JPMorgan has raised its recommendation for China’s stocks to “overweight,” stating that the prospect of large gains next year now outweighs the risk of significant losses https://t.co/a9n8bgCenA — Bloomberg (@business) November 27, 2025 Across assets, the week’s tone has been driven by Fed expectations. Futures markets are now pricing in roughly an 80% to 85% chance of a quarter-point cut next month and are leaning toward three reductions by the end of 2026. That shift has helped global stocks recover most of their November losses, which had been driven by worries that richly valued AI names were flashing bubble warnings. In bonds, a sharp rally in Treasuries has cooled. The 10-year yield held around 4% after stronger-than-expected US labour market data interrupted the slide. Jobs Data And Fed Signals Strengthen Case For A December Cut Yields had been falling since late last week after delayed September jobs figures painted a mixed picture, then dropped further when New York Fed President John Williams said he saw room for a rate cut in the near term as the labour market softened. Trading volumes have been thinner than usual. A holiday-shortened week and the earlier 43-day US government shutdown, which left official data releases badly delayed, have pushed investors to lean more on Fed speakers for guidance. Recent comments from officials including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Governor Christopher Waller have reinforced expectations for a December move. ETF Flows Slow But Stay Positive With BlackRock Still Dominant On the crypto side, US spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to pull in money, although at a slower pace than during the early-year surge. Data from SoSoValue showed daily total net inflows of about $21.m on Nov. 26, bringing cumulative net inflows to roughly $57.6b. Total trading value for the day reached about $4.6b, with net assets across the ETF complex at around $117.7b, equal to about 6.6% of Bitcoin’s market value. Flows again centred on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, which saw roughly $42.8m in net inflows for the day and now holds about $69.9b in assets. Fidelity’s FBTC posted an outflow of about $33.3m, while Grayscale’s converted GBTC vehicle recorded a modest $5.6m inflow but still shows cumulative net outflows of about $25b since spot ETFs launched. Smaller products from Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, VanEck and others were broadly flat on the day, with only single digit millions of fresh money moving in. Those numbers show the significant shift in structural demand toward regulated vehicles. IBIT alone accounts for roughly 3.9% of the Bitcoin market, according to the SoSoValue dashboard, while the broader ETF suite now represents a meaningful slice of circulating supply. For traders in Asia waking up to a slightly softer crypto board and wobbling local equities, the combination of heavy ETF ownership and rising Fed cut odds is likely to set the tone into the year-end, even if price action in both Bitcoin and stocks looks more cautious after an explosive week.

Binance has just dropped important news that could impact your trading strategy. The world’s largest crypto exchange announced it will Binance delist margin trading pairs from its platform, affecting 18 different trading combinations. This move signals significant changes coming to the margin trading landscape. Which Margin Trading Pairs Are Being Removed? Binance confirmed the Binance delist margin trading pairs action will take place on December 4 at 6:00 a.m. UTC. The exchange is removing both cross margin and isolated margin pairs, primarily affecting Bitcoin trading pairs. This decision reflects the platform’s ongoing evaluation of trading pair performance and liquidity requirements. The affected pairs include some well-known cryptocurrencies. For cross margin trading, the following pairs will be delisted: WAXP/BTC SXP/BTC ONT/BTC ID/BTC ZRX/BTC CHR/BTC ENJ/BTC What Does This Mean for Isolated Margin Traders? Isolated margin traders face even more changes with the Binance delist margin trading pairs announcement. The platform will remove these isolated margin pairs: WAXP/BTC ONG/BTC POWR/BTC SXP/BTC ONT/BTC ID/BTC AGLD/BTC ZRX/BTC CHR/BTC ENJ/BTC UMA/BTC Why Is Binance Delisting These Trading Pairs? Exchanges regularly review their trading pairs to ensure optimal market conditions. The decision to Binance delist margin trading pairs typically stems from several factors including low trading volume, liquidity concerns, or strategic repositioning. This helps maintain healthy markets and protects traders from potential slippage issues. Moreover, such delistings often indicate the exchange’s focus on pairs with stronger performance metrics. Traders should view this as part of normal market evolution rather than alarm. However, it does require immediate attention to adjust trading strategies accordingly. What Should Affected Traders Do Immediately? If you currently hold positions in any of the affected Binance delist margin trading pairs , take these crucial steps: Close all open positions before December 4 deadline Transfer funds to other trading pairs or wallets Update your trading bots and automated strategies Monitor official Binance announcements for updates Remember, failing to close positions before delisting could result in automatic liquidation by the exchange. Therefore, proactive management is essential to protect your investments. How Will This Impact the Crypto Market? The Binance delist margin trading pairs decision may create temporary price volatility for the affected cryptocurrencies. However, experienced traders understand that such routine adjustments are normal in evolving markets. The long-term impact depends on each project’s fundamentals and community support. Interestingly, this move might redirect trading volume to other pairs, potentially benefiting remaining margin trading options on the platform. It also demonstrates Binance’s commitment to maintaining high-quality trading environments for its users. Final Thoughts: Navigating Exchange Changes Successfully The announcement to Binance delist margin trading pairs serves as an important reminder for all cryptocurrency traders. Staying informed about exchange updates and adapting quickly to changes separates successful traders from the rest. While such news might seem concerning initially, it represents the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. Always maintain diversified trading strategies and stay updated with official exchange communications. This approach ensures you can navigate market changes effectively while protecting your investment portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions What happens if I don’t close my positions before delisting? Binance will automatically close any remaining positions in the affected pairs at the time of delisting. This could result in unexpected losses, so we strongly recommend closing positions manually. Will these cryptocurrencies still be available for spot trading? Yes, most of these cryptocurrencies will remain available for spot trading. The delisting only affects margin trading pairs against Bitcoin. Can these pairs be relisted in the future? While possible, there’s no guarantee. Exchanges may relist pairs if trading conditions improve significantly, but traders should not count on this happening. How often does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance regularly reviews and adjusts its trading pairs, typically making such announcements several times per year as market conditions evolve. Should I be worried about other pairs being delisted? Not necessarily. This is a normal part of exchange operations. However, always monitor official announcements and maintain diversified trading strategies. Where can I get official updates about such changes? Always check Binance’s official website and announcement channels for the most accurate and timely information about platform changes.

Recent data reveals a stunning development: Binance whale inflows have skyrocketed to $7.5 billion over the past month, marking the highest level we’ve seen in an entire year. This massive movement of funds signals important changes in market sentiment that every crypto investor should understand. What Do These Massive Binance Whale Inflows Really Mean? According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, these substantial Binance whale inflows tell us crucial information about market dynamics. When large-scale holders transfer their assets to Binance, they’re typically preparing for significant trading activity. The exchange serves as a major liquidity provider, making it the go-to platform for whales during periods of market uncertainty. Here’s why this matters right now: Large holders move funds to exchanges when expecting price volatility Binance provides the liquidity needed for major trades Current patterns mirror March’s high-volatility period Selling pressure may not have stabilized yet How Does This Compare to Previous Market Cycles? The current surge in Binance whale inflows closely resembles the pattern we observed last March. During that period, Bitcoin experienced dramatic price swings, dropping from around $102,000 to the low $70,000s. This historical parallel suggests we might be entering another phase of significant market turbulence. Market analysts note that when whales accumulate this much exchange-bound capital, it often precedes major price movements. The $7.5 billion in Binance whale inflows represents one of the largest capital movements we’ve witnessed, indicating that institutional and large retail players are positioning themselves for potential market shifts. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For Next? Understanding these Binance whale inflows provides valuable insights for making informed investment decisions. The data suggests that selling pressure hasn’t yet stabilized, meaning we could see continued volatility in the coming weeks. However, it’s important to remember that whale activity doesn’t always predict market direction with absolute certainty. Key indicators to monitor include: Daily exchange inflow volumes Bitcoin price support levels Overall market sentiment indicators Regulatory developments affecting major exchanges Why This Matters for Your Crypto Portfolio The unprecedented scale of these Binance whale inflows serves as a crucial warning signal for all market participants. While some investors might see this as a buying opportunity, others may interpret it as a sign to exercise caution. The truth likely lies somewhere in between – this data emphasizes the importance of risk management and diversified positioning. Remember that whale activity represents just one piece of the market puzzle. Successful crypto investing requires considering multiple factors, including technical analysis, fundamental developments, and broader economic conditions. The current Binance whale inflows should inform your strategy, not dictate it entirely. Frequently Asked Questions What are whale inflows in cryptocurrency? Whale inflows refer to large transfers of cryptocurrency from private wallets to exchange wallets, typically executed by major holders (whales) preparing for significant trading activity. Why do whales move funds to Binance specifically? Binance offers superior liquidity and trading volume compared to most other exchanges, making it the preferred platform for large-scale traders executing substantial orders. Does increased whale activity always mean price will drop? Not necessarily. While whale inflows often precede selling pressure, they can also indicate accumulation or preparation for major purchases. Context and additional market data are crucial for accurate interpretation. How reliable is whale activity as a market indicator? Whale movements provide valuable insights but should be considered alongside other indicators like trading volume, market sentiment, and technical analysis patterns for comprehensive market understanding. What time frame do these Binance whale inflows cover? The reported $7.5 billion in whale inflows occurred over the past month, representing the highest monthly inflow volume recorded in the past year. Can retail investors benefit from monitoring whale activity? Yes, understanding whale movements helps retail investors gauge market sentiment and potential price directions, though it should inform rather than replace comprehensive investment research.

Europe’s police-intelligence agency is about to elect Giuseppe Lopez, a senior Italian law enforcement officer, to lead its financial crime division, as the continent intensifies efforts to combat illicit cross‑border money flows. Lopez, a colonel in Italy’s Guardia di Finanza, the force specializing in financial and economic crimes, is expected to head Europol ’s European Financial and Economic Crime Centre (EFECC), sources familiar with the matter said. While an official announcement could come as early as next month, the appointment has not yet been formally confirmed. Increasing cases of money laundering call for the need for relevant authorities to act Analysts have urged Europe to enhance its defenses against money laundering activities, as cases such as cross-border fraud, organized crime , and evading sanctions are occurring more frequently, surpassing the ability of national enforcement agencies to handle the situation. Additionally, sources noted that prosecutors are facing hardship in dealing with significant amounts of cryptocurrency that criminal organizations use to launder money and other assets. An example of this scenario was recently highlighted when the US successfully confiscated approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin after uncovering an alleged extensive cyber fraud operation that was carried out in Cambodia. Meanwhile, regarding the appointment for the position of Head of Europol’s European Financial Crime Centre, Claire Georges, a representative for Europol, sent an email stating that the official confirmation for the appointment has not been made yet. Notably, the role of the EFECC is to help member countries in tracking financial movements, identifying who truly benefits from those funds and aiding in the seizure of assets when money crosses borders. Since its inception in 2020, the EFECC has focused on coordinating complex international cases and supporting national investigations that may encounter delays at borders. In April 2022, EFECC initiated and launched Operation Oscar, an initiative aimed at tracking and seizing assets of individuals and entities sanctioned in relation to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to reports so far, the project has managed to freeze and seize assets worth more than €2 billion — around $2.3 billion — associated with the enforcement of such sanctions. On the other hand, Europol, located in the Netherlands, acts as the law enforcement agency for the EU. It also provides intelligence and operational support to police forces across the 27 member countries on organized crime, cybercrime, and terrorism. However, reports continue to highlight the increasing instances of money laundering in the region. The US confirms the largest forfeiture case in history Last month, US officials charged a Chinese-born Cambodian tycoon and the founder of the multinational conglomerate Prince Holding Group, Chen Zhi, with running a major cyber fraud operation. This led to the seizure of Bitcoin valued at approximately $15 billion, the largest forfeiture case to date. The announcement was made public after federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, accused the 38-year-old head of Prince Group of being involved in a wire fraud conspiracy and managing a money laundering scheme. His operation reportedly employed forced labor in Cambodia to emotionally manipulate thousands of victims in the US and globally. During this activity, they would inflate these victims’ accounts before draining them using a method called “ pig butchering .” The push to clamp down on abuse and introduce stronger leadership comes as criminals have increasingly used digital assets to mask illicit proceeds. Crypto’s swift, cross-border characteristics, combined with its anonymity, make it an attractive option for laundering.

What Led to the Solar Project Resignation? Nayiem Willems made his announcement through the project’s official blog, providing clear reasons for his departure. He explained that the environment surrounding the Solar project no longer supports its development goals.

How Does This Solar Project Resignation Impact SXP? The immediate question on everyone’s mind is how this Solar project resignation will affect the SXP token and ecosystem. Leadership changes in cryptocurrency projects often create short-term uncertainty, but they can also open doors to new opportunities. The Solar project, formerly known as Swipe, has undergone significant evolution under Willems’ guidance. However, the current regulatory and operational environment appears to have created barriers that hindered further progress. What Challenges Did the Solar Project Face? Understanding the context behind this Solar project resignation requires examining the broader challenges facing blockchain initiatives.

The need for prior approval on innovation initiatives particularly highlights the tension between rapid blockchain development and established regulatory frameworks. What’s Next After This Solar Project Resignation? The cryptocurrency community now watches closely to see how the Solar project navigates this transition. The Solar project resignation creates an opportunity for fresh leadership and potentially new strategic directions. However, it also raises questions about: Project continuity and development roadmap Community confidence and token stability Potential changes in project governance Future innovation capabilities Key Takeaways from the Solar Project Leadership Change This Solar project resignation serves as an important case study for the cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates how external factors and regulatory environments can significantly impact blockchain project leadership and development trajectories. The situation highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing innovation with compliance in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Nayiem Willems resign from the Solar project? Willems cited limited access to public utilities and requirements for prior approval on innovation initiatives as primary reasons for his departure. How will this resignation affect SXP token value? Leadership changes often create short-term uncertainty, but long-term impact depends on how smoothly the transition occurs and the project’s future direction. Who will replace Nayiem Willems as project head? The Solar project team has not yet announced a replacement, but such announcements typically follow within days or weeks of a resignation. Will the project’s roadmap change after this resignation? While immediate changes are unlikely, new leadership often brings fresh perspectives that may influence future development priorities. How can investors stay informed about project developments? Following official Solar project communication channels and reputable cryptocurrency news sources provides the most reliable updates.

The world’s largest crypto surged as much as 4% in 24 hours, briefly touching $91,200, boosted by renewed market optimism, improving liquidity, and growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Related Reading: The 250% Price Surge That Will Send Bitcoin To $300,000 However, despite the rebound, analysts warn that the latest upswing may remain structurally fragile. Risk Appetite Returns as BTC Leads Market Rebound After weeks of volatility, Bitcoin’s latest rise mirrors a broader recovery across the crypto market. A wave of buying pushed Ethereum back above $3,000, while major altcoins, including XRP, BNB, Solana, Cardano, Tron, and Dogecoin, logged gains of over 4%. Market analysts attribute the rally largely to improving macro sentiment. Traders are now pricing in an 85% chance of a Fed rate cut, up from just 44% a week earlier. Lower interest rates typically boost demand for risk assets, including crypto. Additionally, a massive 1.8 million BTC withdrawal from exchanges overnight sparked speculation of increased institutional accumulation. Regardless, caution lingers. The crypto Fear & Greed Index sits deep in “Extreme Fear,” and despite rising prices, market conviction remains thin. As CoinSwitch noted, BTC’s jump was fueled partly by a short squeeze, not purely organic demand. Analysts Warn of Resistance Ahead Even with the recent improvement, several analysts believe Bitcoin’s upside remains limited in the near term. Resistance between $92,000 and $95,000 is expected to be a key test for bulls. Ed Engel of Compass Point notes that BTC’s rebound from the $82,000 Real Market Average suggests early signs of capitulation but not a confirmed bottom. Whale wallets holding 10–10,000 BTC have continued reducing their holdings for six straight weeks, an ongoing bearish indicator. Meanwhile, institutional desks are reportedly trimming exposure into year-end, adding more supply to the market. Some traders expect Bitcoin to retest $82,000 or even dip below $80,000 if momentum fades. Others believe a strong break above $95,000, supported by retail demand, could renew bullish structure and open the path toward fresh highs. A Market at a Crossroads Despite improved liquidity and rebounding prices, Bitcoin’s recovery remains fragile. Sentiment is mixed, leveraged positions are still unwinding, and macro data continues to send conflicting signals. For now, BTC appears stuck between growing optimism and persistent skepticism.

The cryptocurrency landscape is shifting dramatically as decentralized exchanges capture unprecedented market share. This memecoin trading frenzy is reshaping how investors interact with digital assets. Why Is Memecoin Trading Driving DEX Growth? The relationship between memecoin trading and decentralized exchange adoption is stronger than ever. According to recent data from CoinGecko, DEXs achieved a remarkable 37.4% share of total spot trading volume in June. This represents an all-time high for decentralized platforms. Memecoin trading typically involves: Quick entry and exit strategies Lower transaction amounts Community-driven momentum Speculative short-term positions What Makes DEXs Perfect for Memecoin Trading? Decentralized exchanges offer several advantages that align perfectly with memecoin trading behavior. Users enjoy immediate access to new tokens without lengthy verification processes. The permissionless nature of DEXs means traders can jump into emerging memecoin opportunities instantly. Platforms like PancakeSwap demonstrated this perfectly. Their integration with Binance Alpha created a surge in trading volume that contributed significantly to the overall DEX growth. This memecoin trading activity shows no signs of slowing down. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The rise in memecoin trading volume on DEXs indicates a fundamental shift in investor preferences. Traders are increasingly comfortable with decentralized platforms for their speculative activities. This trend suggests that DEXs are becoming mainstream trading venues rather than niche products. However, investors should remember that memecoin trading carries substantial risks. The volatile nature of these assets means prices can swing dramatically within short periods. Always conduct thorough research before participating in any memecoin trading activity. What Does the Future Hold for Memecoin Trading? The current memecoin trading boom appears to be more than just a temporary phenomenon. As DEX technology improves and user experience enhances, we can expect continued growth in decentralized trading volumes. The convenience and accessibility of DEXs make them ideal for the fast-paced world of memecoin trading. Looking ahead, the memecoin trading landscape will likely evolve with: Improved liquidity mechanisms Enhanced security features Better user interfaces Cross-chain compatibility Conclusion: The New Era of Digital Asset Trading The memecoin trading revolution has fundamentally altered the cryptocurrency exchange landscape. DEXs have proven they can compete with centralized counterparts during periods of high speculative activity. As more traders discover the benefits of decentralized platforms, the memecoin trading phenomenon will continue driving innovation across the entire crypto ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is memecoin trading? Memecoin trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrency tokens that originated from internet memes or community jokes. These assets often experience extreme volatility and rely heavily on social media trends. Why are DEXs better for memecoin trading? DEXs offer instant access, no KYC requirements, and direct wallet-to-wallet transactions. This makes them ideal for the fast-paced nature of memecoin trading where timing is crucial. How risky is memecoin trading? Memecoin trading carries high risk due to extreme price volatility, potential liquidity issues, and reliance on social sentiment. Investors should only risk capital they can afford to lose completely. Can beginners participate in memecoin trading? Yes, but beginners should start with small amounts and thoroughly research each project. Understanding basic DEX functionality and wallet security is essential before beginning memecoin trading. What was PancakeSwap’s role in DEX growth? PancakeSwap’s integration with Binance Alpha created significant trading volume increases, demonstrating how strategic partnerships can boost DEX adoption and memecoin trading activity. Will memecoin trading continue growing? While specific tokens may rise and fall, the overall trend of memecoin trading appears sustainable as long as social media communities continue driving interest in these assets.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Liquidity Ratio Has Plunged Recently In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about how liquidity in the Bitcoin market has changed following the recent downturn. Glassnode has gauged the “liquidity” using the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, an on-chain metric that measures the ratio between the profit and loss that BTC investors are realizing through their transactions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst Current demand momentum can be tracked using a version of this indicator that specifically tracks the profitability of the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. As the below chart shows, the STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio was at relatively high levels earlier, but since early October, its value has plummeted. With a value of just 0.07, the indicator is now sitting deep inside the loss region, a sign that the recent Bitcoin buyers have overwhelmingly been capitulating at a loss. “Such overwhelming loss dominance confirms that liquidity has evaporated, especially after the heavy demand absorption seen in Q2–Q3 2025 as long-term holders increased their spending,” explained the analytics firm. The metric fell to similar lows back in Q1 2022, but so far, market weakness hasn’t been as prolonged. The report noted that if the ratio continues to be depressed, market conditions could mirror those from back then. While short-term demand momentum has collapsed, the same hasn’t been true for long-term liquidity, at least not yet. Long-term momentum can be measured using the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio of the long-term holders (LTHs), representing the more resolute section of the market (holding time greater than 155 days). From the above chart, it’s visible that the 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Bitcoin LTH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has witnessed a sharp decline as BTC has crashed. Despite the drop, however, the metric’s value is still 408, implying LTHs are realizing, on average, a profit that’s 408 times the loss. This means that the long-term liquidity is still healthy compared to Q1 2022, or even the major bottom formations from the current cycle. Glassnode warned, however, “if liquidity continues to fade and this ratio compresses toward 10x or lower, the probability of transitioning into a deeper bear market becomes difficult to ignore.” Related Reading: XRP Rebounds From Channel Bottom, Analyst Says $2.60 Could Be Next It now remains to be seen how the LTH Realized Profit/Loss will change for Bitcoin in the near future, and if liquidity will see a further squeeze.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance has identified dollar-pegged stablecoins as a major concern that could significantly impact the South Korean won’s stability in global markets. Why Is the Stablecoin Impact on Won So Concerning? Deputy Prime Minister Koo Yoon-cheol will lead crucial discussions with international finance experts on December 1st. The government has discovered that increased usage of dollar-based stablecoins in cross-border payments could weaken the won and drive up exchange rates. This stablecoin impact on won represents a new challenge for traditional financial regulators. The ministry’s research indicates that stablecoins contribute substantially to foreign exchange market volatility. As more businesses and individuals use dollar-pegged digital assets for international transactions, the demand for actual US dollars might decrease while still affecting currency values. What Specific Dangers Does This Stablecoin Trend Pose? Government analysts have identified several key risks from the growing stablecoin impact on won: Reduced demand for physical won in international trade Increased pressure on won-dollar exchange rates Potential capital flight through digital channels Weakened control over monetary policy effectiveness The new government panel will also examine Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) considerations alongside foreign exchange market dynamics. This comprehensive approach shows how seriously officials are taking the stablecoin impact on won stability. How Will South Korea Address This Challenge? The December 1st meeting represents the inaugural session of a specialized government panel created specifically to monitor digital currency developments. This proactive stance demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to understanding and managing the stablecoin impact on won before it becomes unmanageable. Financial experts suggest several measures might emerge from these discussions: Enhanced monitoring of stablecoin transaction volumes Potential regulatory frameworks for cross-border crypto payments Coordination with international financial organizations Public education about currency stability risks What Does This Mean for Global Cryptocurrency Regulation? South Korea’s attention to stablecoin impact on won sets an important precedent for other nations. As one of Asia’s most technologically advanced economies, their approach could influence how other countries address similar concerns. The stablecoin impact on won discussion highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance and digital assets. This development comes as many nations grapple with balancing innovation and financial stability. The stablecoin impact on won analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers worldwide facing similar challenges with digital currency integration. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Digital Currency Regulation South Korea’s decisive action to examine the stablecoin impact on won marks a critical turning point in global finance. As traditional financial systems increasingly intersect with digital assets, understanding these connections becomes essential for maintaining economic stability. The outcomes of these discussions could shape cryptocurrency regulation for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are dollar-pegged stablecoins? Dollar-pegged stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a consistent value equal to one US dollar, typically backed by dollar reserves or algorithms. Why is South Korea particularly concerned about stablecoins? South Korea maintains significant international trade and has experienced currency volatility before, making authorities especially vigilant about potential threats to the won’s stability. How could stablecoins affect the won-dollar exchange rate? If businesses use dollar stablecoins instead of converting won to dollars, it could reduce demand for physical dollars while still creating dollar-based transaction pressure. When will the government panel make its recommendations? The first meeting occurs December 1st, with initial findings expected in early 2024, though immediate regulatory actions could come sooner if urgent risks are identified. Could this lead to stablecoin restrictions in South Korea? While complete restrictions seem unlikely, enhanced monitoring and specific usage regulations are probable outcomes from these discussions. How are other countries responding to similar concerns? Several nations are studying stablecoin impacts, but South Korea’s formal government panel approach represents one of the most structured responses to date.

The latest Bitcoin on-chain data paints a concerning picture that every crypto enthusiast needs to understand. But here’s the crucial question: what does this mean for your portfolio? What Exactly is Bitcoin On-Chain Data Telling Us? According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, key Bitcoin on-chain indicators have turned bearish. These metrics track actual blockchain activity rather than just price movements. They provide a transparent window into network health and investor behavior. The current Bitcoin on-chain data reveals several worrying trends: Reduced network activity and transaction volume Declining whale accumulation patterns Increased movement to exchanges suggesting selling pressure This comprehensive Bitcoin on-chain data analysis suggests the market lacks the fundamental strength for sustained upward momentum without external support. Why Liquidity Becomes the Deciding Factor Here’s where the story gets interesting. Despite the bearish Bitcoin on-chain data, there’s a potential lifeline. Ki Young Ju emphasized that any significant price recovery will likely depend on macroeconomic liquidity conditions. Think of liquidity as the fuel that drives market movements. When central banks inject money into the economy, that capital often finds its way into risk assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, monitoring Federal Reserve policies and global money supply becomes crucial for crypto investors. How Should Investors Interpret This Bitcoin On-Chain Data? Understanding Bitcoin on-chain data requires looking beyond surface-level indicators. While the current signals appear bearish, they don’t necessarily predict immediate price crashes. Instead, they highlight underlying weakness that needs addressing. Here’s what smart investors should watch: Macroeconomic developments – Federal Reserve announcements and policy changes Institutional flows – ETF movements and corporate buying patterns Network recovery signs – Improvements in the Bitcoin on-chain data metrics This approach helps you make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions to price swings. Actionable Insights From the Bearish Bitcoin On-Chain Data Facing bearish Bitcoin on-chain data doesn’t mean you should panic sell. Instead, consider these strategic moves: Dollar-cost average during periods of weakness Set clear entry and exit points based on your risk tolerance Diversify your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin Keep cash reserves for potential buying opportunities Remember that Bitcoin on-chain data provides context, not certainty. Market conditions can change rapidly with shifting macroeconomic winds. The Bottom Line: Patience and Perspective Pay Off The current Bitcoin on-chain data delivers a clear message: proceed with caution but maintain perspective. While short-term headwinds exist, the long-term Bitcoin narrative remains intact. The key differentiator will be liquidity conditions and how quickly fundamental network strength returns. Successful investors use data like this Bitcoin on-chain analysis to inform their strategy, not dictate panic decisions. By understanding both the technical and fundamental factors at play, you position yourself for smarter investment choices regardless of market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What makes Bitcoin on-chain data bearish? Bearish Bitcoin on-chain data typically shows declining network activity, reduced transaction volumes, increased exchange inflows, and weakening accumulation patterns among large holders.

The Alpine nation, known for its robust financial sector, will delay implementing the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) until at least 2027. This unexpected move raises crucial questions about the future of international crypto taxation and regulatory coordination. Why is Switzerland delaying crypto tax data sharing? Switzerland faces a significant hurdle in implementing the CARF framework. While the country plans to legislate the rules by January 2026, practical execution faces delays. The primary challenge involves selecting partner countries for data exchange. Currently, 75 nations are working to adopt CARF, but Switzerland needs reliable partners to share crypto tax information effectively. The suspension in partnership discussions creates a complex situation. Switzerland must ensure that any crypto tax data sharing agreements protect national interests while meeting international standards. This balancing act requires careful negotiation and thorough due diligence on potential partner countries. What does CARF mean for global crypto taxation? The Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework represents a major step toward international tax transparency. CARF aims to: Standardize reporting requirements across borders Prevent tax evasion through cryptocurrency assets Create a unified approach to crypto taxation Enable automatic exchange of information between countries However, Switzerland’s delay highlights the practical challenges of implementing such a comprehensive system. The framework requires robust technical infrastructure and legal agreements that many nations are still developing. How are other countries approaching crypto tax data sharing? While Switzerland postpones its crypto tax data sharing implementation, other nations are moving forward at different paces. Brazil and the United States are currently reviewing their regulatory approaches. This creates a patchwork of implementation timelines that could complicate international compliance for crypto businesses and investors. The global landscape for crypto tax data sharing remains fragmented. Some countries are pushing for rapid adoption, while others, like Switzerland, are taking a more measured approach. This variation underscores the need for coordinated international effort to create effective crypto taxation systems. What are the implications for cryptocurrency investors? The delay in Switzerland’s crypto tax data sharing implementation provides temporary relief for some investors. However, it’s crucial to understand that this is merely a postponement, not a cancellation. Investors should use this extra time to: Review their cryptocurrency portfolio documentation Understand upcoming reporting requirements Consult with tax professionals about compliance Monitor developments in other jurisdictions Ultimately, the trend toward greater transparency in crypto tax data sharing appears inevitable. Switzerland’s delay simply provides more preparation time for all stakeholders involved. What’s next for international crypto tax cooperation? The path forward for global crypto tax data sharing requires careful navigation. Switzerland’s experience demonstrates that technical implementation often proves more challenging than policy creation. The coming years will likely see: Continued negotiations between nations Refinement of technical standards Gradual alignment of implementation timelines Ongoing adjustments to address emerging challenges While Switzerland’s delay might seem like a setback, it actually represents a pragmatic approach to ensuring the system works effectively when implemented. Proper crypto tax data sharing requires reliable infrastructure and trustworthy partnerships. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Switzerland delay crypto tax data sharing until 2027? Switzerland postponed implementation due to suspended discussions about selecting partner countries for data exchange. The country needs reliable partners to ensure effective and secure information sharing. What is CARF in cryptocurrency taxation? CARF stands for Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, an OECD initiative that standardizes how countries report and share cryptocurrency tax information internationally. Will other countries follow Switzerland’s delay? Some nations might reconsider their timelines, but most of the 75 countries adopting CARF continue with their implementation plans. Each country faces unique challenges in establishing crypto tax data sharing systems. How does this affect individual cryptocurrency investors? Investors gain additional time to prepare for reporting requirements, but should still maintain proper records and consult tax professionals about upcoming obligations. What happens if countries don’t implement CARF? Nations that fail to implement international standards risk being excluded from global financial networks and facing pressure from other countries seeking tax transparency. Can Switzerland change its mind and implement earlier? Yes, if partnership discussions resume successfully, Switzerland could potentially implement crypto tax data sharing before 2027, though this appears unlikely given current circumstances.

Onchain analytics firm Arkham first flagged the move, noting “VITALIK JUST SENT $2.9M $ETH TO RAILGUN. Vitalik holds over $700 MILLION of ETH, and just sent $2.9M into Railgun. What is he cooking?” VITALIK JUST SENT $2.9M $ETH TO RAILGUN Vitalik holds over $700 MILLION of ETH, and just sent $2.9M into Railgun. What is he cooking? pic.twitter.com/2HvDFRDqi2 — Arkham (@arkham) November 26, 2025 Buterin Backs SimpleX And Session Shortly after, Buterin confirmed the donations from his vitalik.eth account and framed them explicitly as a bet on the next frontier of privacy: permissionless and metadata-hardened messaging. “Encrypted messaging, like @signalapp, is critical for preserving our digital privacy,” he wrote. “Two important next steps for the space are (i) permissionless account creation and (ii) metadata privacy.” He then named Session and SimpleX as “two messaging apps pushing these directions forward.” Buterin specified that he had “donated 128 ETH to each” project, providing their official websites for anyone wishing to “follow on,” and then pivoted from philanthropy to adoption: “But also, actually download and use them!” The transactions to SimpleX and Session were executed via Railgun, a zero-knowledge privacy system on Ethereum that obscures the sender, recipient, token type and amount when interacting with smart contracts and DeFi protocols. While Buterin has used Railgun and other privacy-preserving systems repeatedly over the past two years, he has often explained that such transfers typically represent “some donation to a charitable, non-profit, or other project,” rather than personal cash-outs.The latest pattern fits that narrative: funds routed into Railgun and then out to privacy-focused infrastructure and applications, this time in the messaging domain. In his post, Buterin positions encrypted messengers as a crucial layer in the broader privacy stack alongside financial anonymity. He explicitly ties the importance of Signal-style end-to-end encryption to new requirements that go beyond content secrecy: “permissionless account creation” and “metadata privacy.” The first is about removing reliance on centralized, real-world identifiers such as phone numbers or email addresses in order to create an account. The second targets the far less visible but equally revealing exhaust of digital communication: who talks to whom, when, and from where. Why The Ethereum Founder Supports Both Projects Both SimpleX and Session are trying to address those problems in ways that diverge sharply from the mainstream model of phone-number-based, cloud-synced messengers. SimpleX’s own documentation emphasizes “complete privacy of your identity, profile, contacts and metadata,” stressing that the platform “has no identifiers assigned to the users – not even random numbers.” Instead, users establish connections via QR codes or links, and communication routing is designed so that the service itself cannot reconstruct the social graph. Session, originally forked from Signal but rebuilt around onion routing and decentralized service nodes, is pushing a similar line: no phone numbers, Tor-like network-level obfuscation, and attention to metadata minimization. Buterin is clear that his endorsement is not a claim that these apps are already finished products. “Neither of the two are perfect pieces of software, they have a way to go to get to truly optimal user experience and security,” he cautioned. He then sketched the core engineering problems that still need to be solved if “strong metadata privacy” is to coexist with the kind of convenience users now expect from mainstream messengers. “Strong metadata privacy requires decentralization, decentralization is hard, users expecting multi-device support makes everything harder,” he wrote. He also flagged Sybil and denial-of-service resistance as a still-open design space: developers must harden “both in the message routing network and on the user side (without forcing phone number dependence).” The latest donations also underline how Buterin increasingly uses his personal holdings to nudge the ecosystem toward specific priorities: privacy-preserving DeFi, open-source infrastructure, and now, metadata-resistant communication tools. In this case, he explicitly calls for more developer attention: “These problems need more eyes on them. I wish all teams working on these important problems best of luck.” At press time, Ethereum (ETH) traded at $3,007.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ether|ethereum news|ethereum price|vitalik buterin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|ARKM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-28 04:00:26

What The 0% Tax Means Under the new scheme, individual investors who trade crypto through SEC-licensed platforms don’t pay personal income tax on any gains. The exemption applies only if the trade is done on a local approved exchange, broker, or dealer. FACT: THAILAND NOW OFFERS 0% CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON #BITCOIN TRADED ON NATIONAL EXCHANGES GLOBAL GAME THEORY AT WORK ✨ pic.twitter.com/8rf21xJxKT — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) November 26, 2025 Regular income tax rules apply to the same type of income for taxpayers who participate in foreign/unlicensed exchange activity, as well as those who generate crypto income from mining, staking and/or airdrops. The publication of this regulation in the Royal Gazette on September 5th 2025 makes it official and enforceable by law. Reaction to this regulation was also positive from both officials and investors: an official statement indicates the primary purpose of creating this regulation was to provide incentives for current and future traders to use local regulated exchanges as opposed to using foreign/unregulated exchanges. They hope this will strengthen Thailand’s financial system and bring more transparency into crypto trades. Some analysts expect the policy to draw both local and international interest in Thailand’s licensed exchanges. The government seems to try making its digital-asset sector more competitive while ensuring regulatory compliance. What Investors Should Know To benefit from 0% tax, trades must go through valid, licensed channels. Gains from outside platforms or unapproved services don’t qualify. Accurate records of purchase and sale, including dates and exchange receipts, are vital to prove eligibility if asked by tax authorities.

It makes compliant crypto trading cheaper — maybe more attractive — while drawing a clearer line between regulated and unregulated channels.

COIN is expanding recurring revenue through stablecoins and subscriptions while maintaining strong adjusted EBITDA margins around 45%. Trading revenue remains volatile and dependent on altcoins and retail activity, with competition and interest rate risk still present. I upgrade COIN to neutral, seeing a floor at current prices and potential upside if shares dip below $200, reflecting a more attractive valuation. As we battle year-end volatility, one asset that has endured even sharper pessimism than stocks is Bitcoin. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is down ~30% from peaks above $125k. A number of factors are behind the drop, but one of the principal arguments is that bears are fearing that Bitcoin prices have tended to peak in four-year cycles , and we're approaching the end of the current bull run. Bitcoin's sharp fall has taken down everything else in the crypto industry as well, including the second-largest exchange in the U.S., Coinbase ( COIN ). Shares of Coinbase are now down nearly 40% from July peaks near $420, and have erased all of its year-to-date gains. Data by YCharts I last wrote a sell article on Coinbase in September, when the stock was trading near $340 per share. At the time, I had argued that Coinbase was shouldering a very heavy valuation premium, especially amid potential trading volatility. Certainly, trading volatility has not ceased, but now ~20% lower, I do find that Coinbase's valuation is no longer trading at excessive highs, and amid a greater share of recurring revenue from stablecoins and subscriptions, I'm raising my rating on Coinbase to neutral. At current share prices, I see more of a balanced bull and bear thesis for Coinbase. On the bright side for the company: Coinbase is focused on expanding its recurring revenue. As a reminder, Coinbase does not try to guide or control transactional revenue, putting all of its focus on expanding its subscription revenue. Thanks to the rapid growth of USDC stablecoin circulation and the growing popularity of Coinbase One subscriptions (which is now anchored by a credit card that rewards 4% cash back in the form of BTC), the company is achieving substantial growth in recurring revenue. Substantial adjusted EBITDA margins. Coinbase is an immensely profitable business, despite the company's recent investments into headcount to roll out new products like advanced trading tools. The company recently produced a very healthy ~45% adjusted EBITDA margin. At the same time, however, we should be wary of the following factors: Trading volatility can make Coinbase's P&L very lumpy from quarter to quarter. Trading still represents roughly two-thirds of Coinbase's overall revenue. Nearly half of its trading revenue, meanwhile, comes from smaller altcoins, in which Coinbase recently expanded its selection (now assets tradable on Coinbase represent 90% of total crypto market cap). In volatile times, fewer people may trade, especially in altcoins. Interest rate risk. Falling interest rates will reduce net interest income on the company's stablecoin balances, though growing issuance and circulation of USDC helps to offset interest rate declines. Very crowded field. Crypto trading platforms have flooded the market aplenty. Coinbase is head-to-head versus the largest exchange, Binance, alongside other players including Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood ( HOOD ), eToro ( ETOR ), and Bullish ( BLSH ), which just launched its U.S. trading operations on October 31. From a valuation standpoint, Coinbase still sits at a premium, but not as stretched of a multiple as in the past. At current share prices near $265, Coinbase trades at a market cap of $71.97 billion. After we net off the $13.47 billion of cash and USDC and $2.60 billion of crypto held for long-term investment (which may have degraded in value since the September balance sheet close) against $7.20 billion of debt, the company's resulting enterprise value is $65.70 billion. For next year, FY26, Wall Street analysts are expecting Coinbase to hit $8.70 billion in revenue, or 16% y/y growth. If we conservatively assume 45% adjusted EBITDA margins on that revenue profile (flat to Q3 actuals and 3 points underneath 48% LTM margins), adjusted EBITDA on this revenue profile would be $3.91 billion, positioning Coinbase's valuation at ~17x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA. We note, as shown in the chart below, that Coinbase's valuation sits well below the likes of Robinhood ( HOOD ), which is trading more than twice as richly: Data by YCharts In my view, Coinbase is likely to still experience near-term volatility as BTC undergoes its correction. That said, I also think Coinbase's more reasonable valuation puts a floor on this stock. Continue to monitor this position from the sidelines for now, but Coinbase may prove to be a buy if it sails below $200 (indicating a low/mid-teens adjusted EBITDA multiple, and where Coinbase traded in the immediate aftermath of the tariff announcement in April). Q3 download Let's now go through Coinbase's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q3 revenue trends are shown in the chart below: Coinbase revenue trends (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Coinbase's total revenue grew 55% y/y to $1.87 billion, which roundly beat Wall Street's expectations of $1.81 billion (+50% y/y) by a five-point margin. Heightened trading volatility was still the biggest driver of Coinbase's growth, with transactional revenue growing 83% y/y to $1.05 billion. But that's also a rapid change from a much weaker Q2, where transactional revenue declined -2% y/y. As a reminder, Q2 contained the post-tariff selloff across all risk assets. We do expect Q4 to be a similar repeat of Q2 weakness with the sell-off in Bitcoin. We note that many in the crypto community ascribe to a ""HODL"" (""hold on for dear life"") mindset , which may reduce trading volumes as prices fall. The chart below showcases Coinbase's trading volumes. Total volume jumped 59% y/y to $295 billion. Interestingly, the large majority of Coinbase's volume (80%) is institutional, and yet spreads are razor-thin on institutional trading, which made up only 13% of transactional revenue in Q3 despite being the lion's share of volume. This is a strong reminder that Coinbase relies heavily on retail trading activity to drive revenue. Moreover, a growing share of this revenue is shifting toward altcoins, with ""other crypto assets"" growing to 42% of trading volume and 38% of transaction revenue, versus 24% for Bitcoin. Coinbase has expanded its selection of smaller tokens, and again, the proclivity to trade in these altcoins may be much weaker in a crypto bear market. Coinbase trading splits (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) On the subscription side, we do cheer the fact that non-transactional revenue saw strong 35% y/y growth to $746.7 million, or 41% of total revenue. This was driven by two factors. First, Coinbase has noted that attach rates are improving on Coinbase One, especially after the company rolled out its $5/month basic tier. This has proven to be especially popular for shoppers who want the 4% Bitcoin back credit card that Coinbase is offering, available to subscribers of all subscription tiers. Coinbase One (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Coinbase also drove $355 million in revenue in Q3 from its net interest income on stablecoins, or roughly about half of the company's subscription and services revenue, with balances on USDC held in Coinbase growing 9% sequentially to $15 billion. On the profitability front, Coinbase's opex fell -9% sequentially to $1.39 billion, as transactional expenses of 14% of trading revenue fell on the lower end of the company's guidance (calling for a mid-teens percentage). Coinbase opex (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Headcount continued to rise, adding ~500 net-new employees in the quarter. Sales and marketing costs, which is where USDC rewards (interest payments) are recorded, also rose ~10% sequentially. Still, in spite of this, Coinbase drove $801 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q3, up 78% y/y and reflecting a 45% adjusted EBITDA margin that improved 5 points y/y. Coinbase adjusted EBITDA (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Key takeaways Investors should buckle in for more volatility in Coinbase as the stock swings and slides based on trading patterns in the crypto space. That said, I do think that Coinbase has fallen to a more reasonable valuation at a high-teens multiple of adjusted EBITDA. As long as the company is able to continue growing its recurring subscription/stablecoin revenue while growing its bottom line through profitable trading, the stock will remain on an upward long-term trajectory.

This resurgence could signify a pivotal moment for the altcoin, suggesting a potential new upward trend. However, investors remain divided on whether ETH may face further declines or if a year-end rebound could reignite bullish sentiment. ETH’s December Struggles In order to anticipate Ethereum’s probable moves in December, Alex Carchidi, an analyst at The Motley Fool, notes that this month has traditionally been a difficult month for the cryptocurrency. Since 2016, Ethereum has only concluded December higher than it started in four of the nine years studied. In the remaining five cases, the month ended in negative territory. The average December return throughout this span is about 7%, indicating that a strong “Santa rally” is improbable. The median performance shows a 6% drop. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over? Key Levels To Watch Examining the relationship between November and December reveals a more intriguing pattern. Between 2016 and 2024, when November has been weak for ETH, December often followed suit, with three out of four instances showing declines. The only outlier was in 2018, when Ethereum rebounded in December after a particularly harsh downturn in November. This historical context suggests that a poor performance in November could carry over into December, making a cheerful month less probable. But while December’s performance has historically been mixed, the beginning of the year has typically shown strong potential for the Ethereum price, particularly in the first and second quarters. In fact, average returns tend to peak in the first quarter at around 77% and the second quarter at approximately 64%, indicating that there may still be significant growth on the horizon for the leading altcoin. Tom Lee Foresees Ethereum Surging To $7,000 Amidst this hypothetical scenario, Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies and a major industry advocate, predicts a bright future for Ethereum in the near and long term. The executive believes that the cryptocurrency could surge to $7,000 per coin heading into the first quarter of 2026, reflecting a nearly 150% price surge from its current value. Related Reading: Metaplanet In Jeopardy: Bitcoin Needs To Surpass $108,000 By December 18 To Prevent New Crisis Lee is even more optimistic about the long term, predicting that if his vision for a decentralized financial system materializes, the Ethereum price could soar by 2,090% to reach $62,000 by 2035. After a challenging year in which ETH significantly underperformed its peers, it has shown increased resilience, especially following the recent crash in crypto prices that saw the token’s valuation drop to $2,600 last Friday. Currently, ETH is trading just above $3,000. While this is not bullish enough to outpace the recent crash, ETH is positioned to recover significantly if demand and capital flow back into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the year comes to a close.

55025632,635558,1764306035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55025632.jpeg,"Spain’s 47% Crypto Tax Sparks Outrage, Critics Predict Full Regulatory Chaos",https://bitcoinist.com/spains-47-crypto-tax-sparks-outrage-critics-predict-full-regulatory-chaos/,"Spain’s Sumar parliamentary group has submitted a proposal that would change how gains from cryptocurrencies are taxed, potentially pushing the top personal rate to 47%. According to reports, the draft would move profits from crypto out of the current “savings” tax bracket — where gains are taxed up to around 30% — into the general income tax base, which carries higher top rates. Sumar’s Proposal And Key Changes Based on reports , the changes do more than tweak rates. They would treat gains from nonfinancial crypto assets as ordinary income, apply a 30% corporate tax rate to business crypto gains, and label all digital assets as attachable or seizable under certain conditions. The plan also asks Spain’s securities regulator to design a “risk traffic light” that platforms must display to users, showing a simple risk indicator for various tokens. Spain’s Sumar parliamentary group has proposed a legislative reform aimed at significantly increasing taxes on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. The proposal would shift taxation of crypto gains from the current “savings tax base” (capped at 30%) to the “general tax base,” where… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 26, 2025 Lawmakers filed the amendment recently. It targets at least three laws: the General Tax Law, the Income Tax Law and the Inheritance and Gift Tax Law. Reports have made clear the package is broad and could change again as it moves through the legislature. Industry Reaction And Legal Questions The push has drawn sharp criticism from parts of the crypto community and some legal experts. Critics warn that treating crypto like regular income and declaring all tokens seizable could push investors and firms to move holdings abroad. Others say seizing assets becomes tricky when tokens are self-custodied or held on platforms outside Spanish control. Some lawyers argue the proposed seizure rules may be hard to apply in practice. They point to stablecoins and tokens that circulate across borders and systems, noting enforcement could be limited unless platforms or intermediaries cooperate. El Grupo Parlamentario Sumar ha presentado tres enmiendas en el proyecto que transpone la Directiva de la UE sobre criptoactivos que van claramente contra Bitcoin, Ethereum y otras criptomonedas: 1⃣ Quieren que las ganancias por criptoactivos no considerados instrumentos… — José Antonio Bravo Mateu (@jabravo) November 24, 2025 At the same time, supporters inside the Sumar group say stronger rules are needed to close tax loopholes and provide clearer rules for a market they view as risky for retail savers. Market And Policy Risks If enacted as written, the reform would raise the tax bill for many individual holders and traders. Retail investors who now pay up to 30% on gains could face rates near 47% on large profits. Companies that keep crypto on their balance sheets would see a flat 30% corporate tax on gains. Analysts warn that these shifts could reduce trading activity and deter new crypto firms from setting up in Spain.

This significant transaction, reported by on-chain analysis firm OnchainLense, raises crucial questions about institutional crypto adoption and sovereign wealth management strategies. What Does the Bhutan Government Wallet Transaction Mean? The Bhutan government wallet activity represents a fascinating development in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. According to blockchain analysts, this isn’t just a random transaction – there’s a high probability of further deposits, suggesting a potential strategic sale or portfolio rebalancing. The move demonstrates how even smaller nations are actively participating in digital asset markets. Why Should You Care About Government Crypto Moves? Government involvement in cryptocurrency markets signals several important trends: Institutional validation of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles Increased market maturity as sovereign entities participate Potential price impact from large-scale government transactions Regulatory implications for future crypto policies The Bhutan government wallet activity follows a pattern of increasing institutional participation in crypto markets. However, this particular transaction stands out because it involves a national government directly engaging with trading firms rather than traditional financial institutions. How Might This Affect Crypto Market Sentiment? When a government entity like the Bhutan government wallet makes significant moves, market participants pay close attention. The deposit to QCP Capital could indicate several possibilities: Portfolio diversification strategy Liquidity needs for national projects Strategic profit-taking from earlier investments Testing institutional trading channels Market analysts suggest that continued activity from the Bhutan government wallet could influence smaller altcoins and set precedents for other developing nations considering crypto investments. What’s Next for Government Crypto Adoption? The movement from the Bhutan government wallet opens up important discussions about sovereign digital asset management. As more nations explore cryptocurrency investments, we might see: Standardized regulatory frameworks for government holdings Increased transparency in public crypto investments New models for national wealth management Potential for crypto-based economic development The Bhutan government wallet transaction serves as a compelling case study in how nations are adapting to the digital asset revolution. While the immediate impact might be limited to market observers, the long-term implications could reshape how governments approach financial technology and economic sovereignty. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Bhutan government wallet? The Bhutan government wallet refers to cryptocurrency addresses believed to be controlled by the Royal Government of Bhutan for managing digital asset investments. Why would Bhutan deposit ETH to QCP Capital? This could indicate planned selling, portfolio rebalancing, or accessing liquidity through professional trading services while managing market impact. How significant is $480,000 in ETH for a government? While relatively small compared to total national reserves, it demonstrates active participation in crypto markets and could represent test transactions before larger moves. Could other governments make similar moves? Yes, many nations are exploring digital asset investments, and Bhutan’s actions might encourage similar transparent approaches from other countries. What does this mean for Ethereum prices? Single transactions of this size rarely impact prices significantly, but continued government activity could influence long-term institutional adoption sentiment. How reliable is the wallet identification? On-chain analysis firms use multiple data points to identify wallet ownership, but absolute certainty requires official confirmation from the entities involved.

DOGE is now consolidating and might decline sharply if it trades below $0.1490. DOGE price started a fresh increase above $0.1480 and $0.150. The price is trading below the $0.1520 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1495 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1490. Dogecoin Price Consolidates Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1450, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.150 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.1525. A high was formed at $0.1565 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1520 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1495 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1550 level and a connecting bearish trend line on the same chart. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1565 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.160 level. A close above the $0.160 resistance might send the price toward $0.1680. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.1720. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1780. Downside Break In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1550 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1490 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.1450 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. The main support sits at $0.1420. If there is a downside break below the $0.1420 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1330 level or even $0.130 in the near term.

As traders across the world test how well leading AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini and DeepSeek perform when placed into real trading environments, Bitget offers something more tangible: a lineup of AI traders with distinct personalities, strategies, and market philosophies, all running live, trading real accounts, and fully available for one-click copy trading. Each avatar represents a different school of trading logic, ranging from conservative hedging and major-coin momentum to high-beta altcoin breakouts, contrarian reversals and mechanical execution. These include Steady Hedge, Majors Momentum, Altcoin Turbo, CTA Force, Infinite Grid, Dip Sniper, and DeepSeek (base model). All strategies have been built using a multi-factor library of professional trading indicators, extensive backtesting, and iterative refinement inside GetAgent. From 18:00 on November 24 to 18:00 on December 15 (UTC+8), GetAgent users can access a limited one-click copy trading channel, selecting the avatar that aligns most closely with their trading personality. Each AI trader executes autonomously in real time, and users can follow every entry, exit, drawdown and adjustment directly in the Model Arena. With transparent performance curves, strategy documentation and real execution data, the experience offers a front row seat into how different trading strategies act under market pressure. To encourage exploration, Bitget has launched a 10,000 USDT airdrop pool for participating users. Anyone who successfully copy-trades and sends one message to GetAgent qualifies for the reward share, and the first 100 copy trading users each day will receive contract copy trading vouchers worth up to 100 USDT. “People want solutions they can actually use to trade,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. “These avatars make trading feel more personal and more approachable. Whether someone prefers momentum, hedging, or contrarian plays, there’s now an AI companion that thinks the way they do.” Instead of copying blindly, users can speak directly to each avatar. GetAgent allows traders to ask why an avatar entered a position, how it sets stop-loss levels, what signals it prioritizes, and how it adapts to different market cycles. New traders gain clarity and confidence, while experienced users can stress-test ideas or explore unfamiliar strategies without risk to their core portfolios. DeepSeek, included in the lineup as an unmodified base model, serves as a benchmark. At the end of the trading camp, Bitget will publish a comparative review of how each avatar performed relative to DeepSeek, offering one of the industry’s first real-world studies on AI trading behavior across different agent designs. Whether a trader resonates with Steady Hedge’s caution, Altcoin Turbo’s appetite for volatility, or Infinite Grid’s range-based logic, GetAgent offers a way to match strategies with preference, bringing a new layer of relatability to AI-assisted trading. Bitget’s six trading avatars bring that transparency into a single interface, powered by UEX’s infrastructure and GetAgent’s intelligent execution.

Asian currencies are caught in a fascinating tug-of-war between Federal Reserve easing expectations and growing speculation about Bank of Japan policy normalization. The latest Tokyo CPI data has injected fresh uncertainty into currency markets, creating a complex landscape that every serious investor needs to understand. Why Are Asia FX Markets So Muted Despite Fed Easing Bets? The Asia FX complex is displaying remarkable restraint despite growing consensus that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in the coming months. Typically, such dovish signals from the world’s most influential central bank would trigger significant currency movements across emerging markets. However, several factors are contributing to this unusual calm. Regional economic uncertainties are offsetting potential gains China’s ongoing property sector challenges continue to weigh on sentiment Global trade tensions create headwinds for export-dependent economies Investors await clearer signals from multiple central banks How Tokyo CPI Data Is Reshaping BOJ Rate Hike Expectations The latest Tokyo CPI figures have sent shockwaves through monetary policy circles, showing inflation pressures that exceed market expectations. This critical data point from Japan’s capital city often serves as a leading indicator for national trends, making it particularly significant for policy decisions. Indicator Latest Reading Market Expectation Previous Tokyo Core CPI 2.7% 2.5% 2.4% Tokyo CPI Ex-Fresh Food 2.6% 2.4% 2.3% Services Inflation 2.1% 1.9% 1.8% The Growing Case For BOJ Rate Hike Action Market participants are increasingly pricing in a more hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan, with BOJ rate hike probabilities rising significantly following the inflation data. The central bank faces a delicate balancing act as it considers ending years of ultra-loose monetary policy. Key factors supporting policy normalization include: Sustained inflation above the 2% target Wage growth showing meaningful acceleration Corporate pricing power demonstrating resilience Global central bank coordination considerations Fed Easing Timeline: What It Means For Currency Markets The anticipated Fed easing cycle represents a fundamental shift in global liquidity conditions. While the exact timing remains uncertain, the direction of travel is clear, creating both opportunities and risks for currency traders. Historical patterns suggest that initial Fed rate cuts typically: Weaken the US dollar against major counterparts Boost emerging market currencies Increase capital flows into higher-yielding assets Reduce hedging costs for international investors Navigating The Complex Forex Markets Landscape Current forex markets present a challenging environment for traders and investors alike. The conflicting signals from major central banks require careful analysis and risk management strategies. Successful navigation demands attention to: Central bank communication and forward guidance Economic data surprises and revisions Technical levels and market positioning Geopolitical developments affecting trade flows Frequently Asked Questions What is the current outlook for Asian currencies? Asian currencies face mixed prospects with Fed easing providing support but regional economic challenges and potential BOJ policy shifts creating headwinds. How does Tokyo CPI affect global markets? Tokyo CPI serves as an early indicator for Japanese inflation trends, influencing Bank of Japan policy decisions that can impact global capital flows and currency valuations. When might the Federal Reserve begin cutting rates? Market expectations suggest the Federal Reserve could begin easing in the second half of 2024, though timing depends on inflation and employment data. What are the implications of BOJ policy normalization? A Bank of Japan rate hike would represent a historic shift from decades of accommodative policy, potentially strengthening the yen and affecting global bond markets. How should traders position in current market conditions? Traders should maintain flexible positions, monitor central bank communications closely, and implement robust risk management given the elevated uncertainty. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture For Global Currencies The stage is set for a dramatic reshaping of global currency relationships. The tension between anticipated Fed easing and potential BOJ tightening creates a rare convergence of opposing monetary policy cycles. For investors and traders, this environment demands heightened vigilance and strategic positioning. The coming months will likely determine whether Asian currencies can break from their muted trading ranges or remain trapped between competing central bank narratives.

Supporters say the move could drain passive capital, force treasury firms to sell BTC, and depress prices. The controversy led some Bitcoiners to call for a boycott of JPMorgan. JPMorgan Faces More Backlash JPMorgan’s plan to launch a new Bitcoin-backed structured note ignited a fierce backlash among Bitcoin supporters and fans of Strategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC. The notes are set for a December 2025 release according to an SEC filing ,and offer 1.5x leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance through December 2028 — magnifying both gains and losses for investors. While it is framed as another way for traditional finance to engage with digital assets, many in the Bitcoin community see the product as a strategic threat specifically aimed at undercutting firms that hold BTC directly on their balance sheets. Critics argue that JPMorgan effectively positioned itself as a competitor to Bitcoin treasury companies, giving the bank an incentive to diminish the reputation and liquidity of firms like Strategy. People on X said that Michael Saylor’s high-profile adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset opened the door for Wall Street to enter the market, and they accuse JPMorgan of copying the playbook while also benefiting from the narrative pressure placed on BTC-heavy companies. Bitcoin advocate Simon Dixon suggested that the product is designed in a way that could intensify forced selling during market downturns, triggering margin calls on Bitcoin-backed loans and increasing sell-side pressure at moments of vulnerability. The situation escalated even more after MSCI unveiled a proposed rule change that would exclude companies holding 50% or more of their assets in crypto from its major stock indexes starting in January. JPMorgan circulated the proposal in a November research note, which led to claims that the bank was amplifying a policy shift that could directly harm firms like Strategy. The exclusion will block these companies from receiving passive capital flows tied to index-tracking funds and pensions, which could potentially push them to sell large amounts of their Bitcoin reserves to regain eligibility. Bitcoin supporters argue that this could depress crypto asset prices while rewarding traditional financial intermediaries offering synthetic or derivative exposure instead. In response, a growing segment of the Bitcoin community is urging a boycott of JPMorgan, and is encouraging users to close accounts and divest from the bank’s stock. Strategy supporters and other advocates say the timing of JPMorgan’s new product, coupled with the MSCI policy proposal, is part of a coordinated financial pressure campaign against crypto-native treasury strategies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-28 05:30:00

The decisions show a real change in how Hanoi handles technology tied to Beijing, after years of keeping Chinese suppliers away from sensitive systems. New contract filings reveal fresh deals for Huawei and ZTE, even as Western governments warn that these companies pose security risks. The new reality is clear, and every number on the page shows how far this shift has gone. For years, Vietnam held back from buying Chinese gear. That restraint has eased. The government has warmed toward Beijing at the same time relations with Washington cooled over tariffs on Vietnamese goods. While Ericsson and Nokia still run the core of the country’s 5G system and Qualcomm supplies important equipment, Chinese companies are winning more of the supporting work. The pattern appears in recent tenders that were not widely reported. Vietnam awards major 5G contracts to Chinese vendors A group that includes Huawei secured a $23 million contract in April for 5G equipment. That deal landed just weeks after Trump’s team announced new tariffs on Vietnamese exports. ZTE picked up at least two deals, including one signed last week, worth over $20 million for 5G antennas. The first deal disclosed to the public arrived in September, one month after the tariffs went into effect. Reuters said it could not confirm whether the timing was connected to the tariffs, but Western officials voiced concern after learning about the contracts. Washington has long tied its support for advanced technology cooperation with Vietnam to one key rule: no Chinese contractors inside Vietnam’s digital backbone. The U.S. calls Huawei and ZTE an “unacceptable risk” to national security. Sweden and other European governments follow similar restrictions. Ericsson refused to speak on the Chinese firms but said it was “fully committed to support its customers in Vietnam.” Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Qualcomm, the U.S. embassy, the Chinese embassy, Sweden’s foreign ministry, and Vietnam’s tech ministry did not provide comments. Vietnam now sits in the middle of a global contest for influence. Its position next to China and its central role in supply chains for companies such as Apple, Samsung, and Nike make every telecom decision a geopolitical data point. Those companies rely on Chinese-made parts and Western consumers. That mix pulls Vietnam in two directions at the same time. Supply chain scholar Nguyen Hung of RMIT University Vietnam said the country long took “a wait-and-see approach” to Chinese technology because of Western pressure. Nguyen said, “Vietnam has its own priorities,” and he noted that recent deals could push deeper business ties with China. Other projects show the same new mood, including work on cross-border rail lines and special economic zones near the Chinese border that Vietnam once rejected over security fears. Western diplomats raise concerns about network access Huawei lost several 5G bids this year, tender records show. But Huawei still maintains a presence in technical services. In June, the company signed a 5G technology transfer agreement with Viettel, the military-owned telecom operator, based on comments from Vietnam’s defense ministry. Viettel did not reply to questions. These Chinese contract wins surfaced in at least two recent meetings of senior Western officials in Hanoi. In one meeting, a U.S. official warned the contracts could hurt trust in Vietnam’s networks and block future access to U.S. advanced technology. In another meeting this month, officials discussed whether parts of Vietnam’s network that use Chinese technology could be walled off to stop data leaks. Telecom lawyer Innocenzo Genna said sealing off parts of the network would not solve the problem. Genna said antenna and equipment suppliers could still reach data. He added that “Western contractors may face the awkward prospect of working alongside firms they do not trust.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|ericsson|Huawei|Nokia|ZTE,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-28 05:30:03

Key Takeaways: MegaETH will refund all USDm pre-deposits after admitting operational failures during the launch. A misconfigured multisig transaction triggered an early reopening that sent deposits past $400 million. Refunds are pending a smart-contract audit, with a new USDC-USDm bridge planned before mainnet beta. The announcement came on Thursday in a post on X, where the team admitted missteps during the rollout. “Execution was sloppy and expectations weren’t aligned with our goal of preloading collateral to guarantee 1:1 USDm conversion at mainnet,” MegaETH wrote. MegaETH’s USDm Pre-Deposit Launch Stalls After Bridge Outage MegaETH opened pre-deposits for USDm on Tuesday with an initial $250 million limit. The launch, however, encountered repeated disruptions from the start. A technical problem with a third-party bridge provider rendered the service inaccessible for about an hour, while users waited for deposits to resume. Once the platform came back online, the $250 million threshold was reached within minutes. The team then announced it would raise the deposit cap to $1 billion. That decision quickly complicated matters. During the process of increasing the cap, a multisignature transaction that controls the contract parameters was incorrectly configured. Instead of requiring three out of four approvals, the transaction was set to require all four signatures. That error allowed an external party to execute the queued transaction nearly 34 minutes before the bridge was officially meant to reopen. As a result, deposits resumed earlier than planned and quickly surpassed $400 million. MegaETH attempted to contain the situation by reducing the cap to $400 million, then later lifting it to $500 million. The project ultimately scrapped plans to expand the limit to $1 billion entirely. Following the incident, MegaETH confirmed that it will return all funds to participants. The refund contract is currently under audit, with repayments set to begin shortly after the review is completed. “Depositor contributions will not be forgotten,” the team said. USDm is integral to the MegaETH economy and will be supported by many Frontier applications. For this reason, we will re-open the $USDC $USDM conversion bridge ahead of Frontier mainnet to deepen liquidity, easing user onboarding prior to launch. — MegaETH (@megaeth) November 27, 2025 Looking ahead, MegaETH plans to reopen its conversion bridge between USDC and USDm ahead of its Frontier mainnet release, which will serve as the network’s beta phase. The goal, the team said, is to establish stable liquidity before a wider rollout. MegaETH Pitches 100,000 TPS Layer-2 MegaETH is an Ethereum Layer-2 network designed to improve transaction speed and reduce costs for blockchain applications, positioning itself alongside platforms like Base, Polygon, and Arbitrum. While Ethereum processes about 30 transactions per second, MegaETH claims a theoretical capacity of up to 100,000 TPS, with sub-millisecond latency and fees below $0.01. The project uses a proof-of-stake model with a performance-based system to calculate staking rewards. Holders who stake MEGA tokens will also take part in governance through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), allowing them to vote on future changes.

Recent data reveals a startling truth about blockchain fee revenue – just 11 public chains managed to generate over $100,000 in weekly fees. This exclusive insight comes from crypto analytics firm Nansen, highlighting the concentrated nature of blockchain economic activity. Which Blockchains Dominate Fee Revenue? The blockchain fee revenue landscape shows clear winners and surprising gaps. Among the elite group, six chains stood out by crossing the $1 million mark in weekly fees. This demonstrates how blockchain fee revenue becomes increasingly concentrated among top performers. Let’s examine the top blockchain fee revenue generators: Tron (TRX) : $6.16 million Ethereum : $3.87 million Solana : $2.94 million BNB Chain : $2.65 million Bitcoin : $1.78 million Base : $1.13 million Why Does Blockchain Fee Revenue Matter? Blockchain fee revenue serves as a crucial health indicator for any network. It reflects real usage and economic activity rather than speculative interest. When blockchain fee revenue remains consistently high, it signals strong network utility and user adoption. Moreover, sustainable blockchain fee revenue supports network security and development. This revenue funds protocol improvements and ensures long-term viability. Therefore, tracking blockchain fee revenue provides valuable insights into which networks are actually being used versus those merely generating hype. What Challenges Affect Blockchain Fee Revenue? Several factors influence blockchain fee revenue generation. Network congestion, transaction volume, and fee structures all play significant roles. Some networks optimize for low fees to attract users, while others prioritize security through higher fee models. The concentration of blockchain fee revenue among few networks raises important questions about decentralization. However, it also demonstrates market efficiency – users naturally gravitate toward networks providing the best value and utility. Actionable Insights from Blockchain Fee Revenue Data This blockchain fee revenue report offers valuable guidance for investors and developers. The data suggests focusing on networks with proven economic activity rather than speculative promises. Consistent blockchain fee revenue indicates real-world usage and sustainable growth potential. For developers, understanding blockchain fee revenue patterns helps in choosing the right platform for dApp deployment. Networks with healthy fee revenue typically offer better infrastructure and larger user bases. Conclusion: The Future of Blockchain Fee Revenue The blockchain fee revenue landscape reveals a maturing industry where economic fundamentals increasingly matter. As the space evolves, we can expect more sophisticated fee models and revenue-sharing mechanisms. However, the basic principle remains: sustainable blockchain fee revenue correlates strongly with long-term success and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions What is blockchain fee revenue? Blockchain fee revenue represents the total fees collected by a network from transaction processing and smart contract executions over a specific period. Why did only 11 blockchains cross $100K in weekly fees? This reflects market concentration where users prefer established networks with better infrastructure, security, and liquidity, creating a winner-takes-most effect in blockchain fee revenue. How does fee revenue impact blockchain security? Higher fee revenue typically supports better network security by providing more incentives for validators and miners to protect the network against attacks. Can newer blockchains increase their fee revenue? Yes, through strategic partnerships, innovative features, and improving user experience, newer networks can gradually increase their blockchain fee revenue over time. Why is Tron leading in fee revenue? Tron’s leadership in blockchain fee revenue stems from its focus on low-cost transactions and strong adoption in specific use cases like stablecoin transfers and gaming applications. How often does blockchain fee revenue data change? Blockchain fee revenue fluctuates daily based on network activity, market conditions, and specific events like NFT mints or token launches that drive transaction volume.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $895.3 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $931. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $862. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $895.3, as bulls target $931. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.18 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-28 05:53:11

The government plans to expand its crypto Travel Rule to include transactions as small as $724, marking a significant shift in how authorities monitor virtual asset movements. This bold move demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to combating financial crime in the digital asset space. What Does the Crypto Travel Rule Expansion Mean? Financial Services Commission Chairman Lee Eog-weon announced this crucial development during the 19th Anti-Money Laundering Day ceremony. The expanded crypto Travel Rule will now cover transactions valued at 1 million won (approximately $724) or less. This represents a major tightening of existing regulations that previously focused on larger transactions. The government’s approach includes several key measures: Strict crackdowns on money laundering through virtual assets Blocking transactions with high-risk overseas exchanges Enhanced vetting systems for Virtual Asset Service Provider shareholders Why is South Korea Strengthening the Crypto Travel Rule? South Korean authorities recognize that criminals often exploit smaller transactions to avoid detection. By expanding the crypto Travel Rule to lower-value transfers, regulators can track suspicious patterns more effectively. This comprehensive approach ensures that money launderers cannot simply break large transactions into smaller amounts to bypass monitoring systems. The Financial Intelligence Unit will implement rigorous background checks covering: Criminal records of major VASP shareholders Financial health assessments Social standing evaluations How Will This Impact Crypto Users and Exchanges? This expanded crypto Travel Rule means both individual users and exchanges must adapt to stricter reporting requirements. Virtual Asset Service Providers will need to enhance their compliance systems to handle increased monitoring of smaller transactions. However, this also creates a safer environment for legitimate crypto users by reducing illegal activities. The government’s strategy focuses on three main areas: Preventing money laundering through better transaction tracking Protecting investors from risky international exchanges Ensuring VASP operators maintain high integrity standards What Challenges Might This New Approach Face? Implementing the expanded crypto Travel Rule presents several challenges. Monitoring numerous small transactions requires sophisticated technology and significant resources. Additionally, exchanges must balance compliance with user convenience. However, South Korean authorities appear determined to overcome these hurdles to create a more transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem. The success of this enhanced crypto Travel Rule depends on: Effective cooperation between regulators and VASPs Advanced monitoring technology implementation International coordination with other jurisdictions Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Regulation in South Korea South Korea’s decision to expand the crypto Travel Rule represents a watershed moment in digital asset regulation. This proactive approach demonstrates how governments are adapting traditional financial oversight to the cryptocurrency world. While creating additional compliance requirements, these measures ultimately protect the integrity of South Korea’s growing crypto market and set a precedent for other nations considering similar regulations. Frequently Asked Questions What is the crypto Travel Rule? The crypto Travel Rule requires Virtual Asset Service Providers to share sender and receiver information for cryptocurrency transactions, similar to traditional bank wire transfers. When will the expanded rules take effect? While Chairman Lee announced the expansion on November 28th, specific implementation dates will be determined through further regulatory processes. How will this affect everyday crypto users? Regular users may experience additional verification steps for smaller transactions but will benefit from reduced illegal activity in crypto markets. Which exchanges are considered high-risk? The Financial Intelligence Unit maintains a list of overseas exchanges that don’t meet South Korea’s compliance standards, though specific names aren’t publicly disclosed. Can users avoid these rules by using decentralized exchanges? While DEXs operate differently, South Korean authorities are developing comprehensive approaches to cover all types of virtual asset transactions. Will other countries follow South Korea’s approach? Many nations are watching South Korea’s regulatory innovations closely, and similar measures may emerge globally as cryptocurrency adoption increases.

Details,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-bitcoin-and-crypto-holders-have-we-seen-the-worst-yet-details/,"Many investors are questioning whether the recent crypto market volatility marks the end of the downward trend or if further declines are still coming. In a recent video, crypto commentator Austin Hilton examined current market conditions and outlined the factors shaping both optimism and caution among analysts. His remarks provided a detailed overview of price levels, sentiment indicators, policy developments, and on-chain trends that continue to influence Bitcoin and the broader market. Have we seen the worst yet, fellow crypto holders? What to know – has the crypto market bottomed out and going up from here… pic.twitter.com/zdDeCLkXQq — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) November 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Recent Movements and Current Position Hilton began by addressing the central question circulating among market participants: whether the bottom has already formed. He pointed to Bitcoin’s recent fluctuation between approximately $83,000 and $86,000, noting that the asset briefly dropped to around $83,000 before recovering. He explained that while he is not aiming to determine the exact timing of a market bottom, he does recognize the possibility of limited additional downside. Some analysts he follows believe that if negative sentiment intensifies, Bitcoin could fall toward the $74,000 to $75,000 range. Despite this, he said that consensus across various researchers he monitors indicates that the market is close to its lowest point. Sentiment Shifts and Market Indicators Hilton highlighted signs of improving sentiment, even though major indicators still caution. He referenced a Fear and Greed Index reading of 15, up from 12 the previous day, noting that the market remains in an extreme fear phase but is showing early improvement He attributed part of the sentiment shift to expectations that the Federal Reserve may introduce an interest rate reduction in the coming weeks, with 82% probability of such a move. According to Hilton, this expectation is contributing to more constructive conditions across both crypto and equity markets. He also pointed to on-chain data indicating that large Bitcoin holders have begun accumulating again, a trend that often precedes upward movement. Additionally, he emphasized the importance of pending pro-crypto legislation, specifically the Clarity Act , which he expects to advance once congressional delays tied to the government shutdown are resolved. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Remaining Risks and Further Considerations Hilton acknowledged that uncertainty still exists. Macroeconomic concerns, lingering fear among investors, and questions about the relevance of the traditional four-year market cycle all contribute to a cautious environment. He reiterated that sentiment does not reverse quickly and that weakened demand remains visible, though it may gradually improve. He also discussed the Federal Reserve’s decision to end quantitative tightening in early December, a development he believes will increase liquidity and support markets. Despite these positive signals, Hilton maintained that some volatility may continue, and a slight downward move remains possible. Hilton concluded that although conflicting signals persist, the prevailing view among the analysts he engages with, combined with his own research, suggests that the worst phase of the downturn is likely behind the market. While acknowledging uncertainty, he stated that conditions are aligning in a way that indicates the market is near a turning point, with the potential for recovery gradually strengthening.

With price reclaiming key support levels, the path toward the major $98,000 imbalance zone is now back on the table, but bulls still need to prove this rebound has real conviction. FVG Filled, Bearish OB Tagged — What Comes After The Perfect Hit? Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent market update, noted that Bitcoin has now completed a key technical move by filling the Fair Value Gap (FVG) and tapping directly into the Bearish Order Block exactly as previously projected. He emphasized that traders who avoided shorting the $81,000–$85,000 region and instead positioned for the upside likely captured a clean and predictable long setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst With that phase now complete, the focus shifts to Bitcoin’s next major target. Patel highlights the $96,800–$98,000 FVG as the upcoming high-timeframe imbalance zone. From a broader perspective, Patel still expects Bitcoin to make a move toward the $98,000 zone before any significant corrective leg unfolds. This aligns with his macro outlook, which continues to favor a final upward sweep into that region before momentum weakens again. However, he also outlines a clear invalidation point for the bearish bias. A sustained high-timeframe close above $107,550 would negate the existing bearish market structure entirely. Such a breakout would signal the start of a new bullish phase for Bitcoin, potentially setting the stage for a fresh all-time-high trend. Promising Bounce As BTC Defends the $90,000 Support Zone According to The Boss, Bitcoin’s latest price action is showing early signs of strength. After the sharp decline, BTC reacted firmly at the local support and managed to push back above the $90,000 level, indicating that buyers are stepping in with renewed confidence. The chart now reflects a stable support zone that has held up against downward pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 Part of this rebound appears to be driven by improving macro sentiment. Softer expectations around Federal Reserve tightening, a rise in overall risk appetite, and a shift back toward risk-on assets are all contributing to Bitcoin’s recovery attempt. From a technical perspective, The Boss notes that Bitcoin must continue to hold above the $90,000–$91,000 range to form a meaningful upward wave from this base. However, caution is still warranted. Without clear confirmation from momentum indicators and sustained trading volume, the current move has the potential to be limited. The possibility of a dead-cat bounce remains on the table, especially following such an aggressive sell-off.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/prime-suspect-in-upbit-hacker-attack-revealed-details-here/,"The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group is suspected to be behind the approximately 44.5 billion won ($30.4 million) cyberattack targeting South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit. Lazarus Group May Be Behind $30 Million Hack on Upbit According to local media reports, government and industry sources say the attack methods and on-chain movements are similar to Lazarus' past operations. Officials speaking to Yonhap News Agency said that field inspections of Upbit were being prepared amid growing suspicions. The exchange announced Thursday morning that it had detected abnormal outflows of some crypto assets on the Solana network and immediately halted all deposits and withdrawals. Upbit initially announced losses of 54 billion won ($36.8 million), but later revised that figure down to 44.5 billion won. Authorities noted that the methods used in the attack were similar to the 2019 Upbit hack, further bolstering suspicions of Lazarus. South Korean police confirmed last year that Lazarus was behind the 342,000 ETH stolen from Upbit in 2019. Authorities say that instead of attacking servers directly, hackers may have taken over administrator accounts or impersonated administrators to approve transfers. According to data from blockchain analyst Dethective, the wallet associated with the attack began converting SOL holdings into USDC and bridging them to the Ethereum network. This development comes just a day after Naver Financial announced its decision to fully acquire Dunamu, the operator of Upbit. *This is not investment advice.

Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant concern across global markets. Technological competition from emerging blockchain platforms could affect Ethereum’s market dominance. Scalability issues, though improving, continue to present hurdles for mass adoption. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the ETH 2030 projection. Investment Strategies for Ethereum Based on our Ethereum price prediction analysis, several investment approaches emerge. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk in volatile markets. Long-term holding strategies align with Ethereum’s fundamental growth narrative. Diversification across cryptocurrency assets can mitigate specific project risks. Regardless of strategy, thorough research and risk management remain essential when considering the ETH price forecast. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most realistic Ethereum price prediction for 2025?

Justin Sun, Advisor to SunPerp and HTX attended the event and officially announced that SunPerp will rebrand as SunX ( sunx.io ). The upgrade marks SunX’s transformation from a standalone trading platform into a self-reinforcing, self-growing decentralized ecosystem. To celebrate the brand refresh, SunX simultaneously unveiled the first phase of its “Trade to Earn” event with a total prize pool of 1.35 million USDT, offering exceptionally high fee rebates to users worldwide. A Brand Evolution: From Platform to Ecosystem, “X” Signals Infinite Possibilities At the launch, Justin Sun noted that DEXs are gradually becoming a dominant force in the crypto industry, and the shift from a “platform” to an “ecosystem” lies at the heart of the SunX upgrade. The new brand name, SunX, is more concise, globally oriented, and easy for users worldwide to remember. The letter “X” represents: ● eXtension (Infinity) : the limitless expansion of the ecosystem. ● eXperience (Experience) : a superior trading experience. ● eXchange (Future Trading) : the trading model of the future. Justin Sun explained that this reflects the team’s new vision for the future of DeFi and signals that SunX will be smarter, more open, and more liquid than anything we have ever built. Long-Term Vision: Powered by the “Golden Triangle of Decentralized Trading” to Deliver Ultimate User Experience According to Justin Sun, the upgrade to SunX is not happening in isolation but is driven by the strategic collaboration among the “Golden Triangle of Decentralized Trading” formed by HTX, TRON , and SUN: TRON provides the high-performance underlying infrastructure. HTX serves as a global traffic gateway that connects users worldwide. SUN functions as the core engine of innovation and liquidity for the ecosystem. “DEX market share has surged from under 5% to 20%, which is impressive. However, for DEXs to truly become mainstream, challenges such as security, risk management, and user experience must be addressed. On that basis, user experience will remain the core competitive focus for perpetual DEXs in 2026.” To this end, SunX has spent the past two months focused solely on refining order book liquidity, market depth, and a low-latency trading experience. Sun noted that rather than pursuing short-lived traffic spikes, the team prioritizes security and product stability, which are the true determinants of long-term user retention. He added that backed by the two highly profitable ecosystems of TRON and HTX, SunX operates without short-term profit pressure. This allows it to embrace a “long-term” vision and continually subsidize users through zero gas fees and negative maker fee rates until its user experience matches or even surpasses that of centralized exchanges, thereby capturing a greater share of the mainstream market. Strategic Roadmap: Security First, Multi-Chain Development, and Global Expansion During the subsequent media and KOL Q&A session, Justin Sun shared additional strategic insights. Regarding SunX’s strategic roadmap, Sun stressed that security will always come first. Building on this foundation, SunX will no longer be confined to the TRON ecosystem and will gradually expand to more major public chains, with the goal of breaking down cross-chain barriers. In terms of market expansion, SunX will remain committed to serving users around the globe. At the same time, the project aims to onboard the vast user bases of HTX and Poloniex onto SunX, providing them with a truly decentralized perpetual futures trading experience. User Benefits: “Trade to Earn” Goes Live, with Makers Earning 110% Fee Rebates As the first initiative following its rebrand, SunX is rolling out an exceptionally compelling incentive program. The first phase of the “ Trade to Earn ” event will run from 12:00 (UTC) on November 21 to 12:00 (UTC) on December 6, with a total prize pool of 1.35 million USDT. During the event, users who trade perpetual futures in BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, and SUN/USDT will receive a full rebate of all their trading fees, plus additional $SUN token rewards . Maker traders can enjoy fee rebates of up to 110% , while Taker traders receive 107% . Each user can earn up to 500 USDT per hour in rewards. This campaign will also play a major role in empowering the $SUN token economy. All net fees generated from registered participants trading the designated trading pairs during the event will be used to buy back $SUN on HTX, supporting its stable appreciation. The repurchased $SUN will be entirely burned, with burns conducted at the end of each quarter (specific dates to be announced), creating sustained deflation to reward long-term supporters of the ecosystem. On the eve of a major DEX breakout, SunX, backed by the “Golden Triangle of Decentralized Trading” and equipped with an unparalleled user experience, is reshaping the industry standard for on-chain derivatives trading. From this moment onward, a smarter, safer SunX ecosystem with limitless potential is ready to take flight, and we look forward to ushering in a new era of decentralized trading alongside users worldwide. About SunX SunX is the TRON ecosystem’s first native decentralized perpetual futures exchange. It aims to integrate the smooth experience and security of centralized exchanges with the asset sovereignty of decentralized finance to build a new generation of on-chain derivatives infrastructure. With core advantages including the lowest fees, 0 gas trading, secure on-chain custody, high-performance matching, full-chain liquidity integration, and intelligent risk management, the platform is committed to providing fair, efficient, and free DeFi derivatives trading services to global users. As a strategic pivot for TRON’s evolution of its on-chain financial system, SunX is leading a profound financial paradigm shift, propelling the crypto market toward genuine inclusivity and openness.For more information about SunX, please visit www.sunx.io For further inquiries, please contact support@sunx.io .

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-strap-in-xrp-is-about-to-take-the-spotlight-heres-the-latest/,"Japan’s economic position has entered a period of renewed uncertainty, and this shift has become a central topic among market commentators who follow developments in digital finance. A recent post from crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull highlighted the growing integration of XRP within Japan’s financial infrastructure , as the country faces economic pressure. His remarks were paired with a Reuters report from May 16th, 2025, outlining Japan’s weaker-than-expected first-quarter performance and the policy challenges ahead. The combination of these perspectives provides a clearer understanding of how traditional economic concerns and emerging financial technologies intersect. Strap in! $XRP 's about to take the spotlight As Japan’s economy cracks, $XRP lays the rails for the rebuild. By end of year, 80% of Japan’s banks are expected to be using XRP and BOJ collaborating with Ripple, the nation isn’t just reacting, it’s rebuilding its economic… pic.twitter.com/cpTmwgDl7U — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) November 25, 2025 The Economic Context Behind the Technology Push The Reuters segment accompanying the post detailed a 0.7% GDP contraction for Japan over the March quarter. The decline exceeded expectations. It reflected stagnant consumption and slowing exports. The report also noted that the downturn was visible even before tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump were scheduled to take full effect. The United States has imposed a 10% duty on most trading partners. While Japan was poised to face a 24% tariff from July, recent reports show the U.S. is committed to applying a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports. Japanese lawmakers have urged Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to consider stimulus or tax adjustments, while the Bank of Japan reevaluates its expected interest-rate stance in light of the slowdown. How XRP Integration Fits Into the Frame X Finance Bull’s analysis centered on the idea that Japan’s financial institutions are positioning themselves for structural changes rather than relying solely on policy interventions. He said that by the end of the year, a large majority of Japan’s banks are expected to integrate XRP, and he highlighted ongoing collaboration between the Bank of Japan and Ripple .

He emphasized that XRP is increasingly being used in remittances, export-related flows, and the emerging market for tokenized assets, which he argued could generate greater liquidity and operational efficiency. A Shift Toward Efficiency and Global Competitiveness According to X Finance Bull, enhanced payment speed, real-time settlement, and improved access to capital tied up in illiquid assets represent advantages Japan can leverage at a moment when global trade tensions threaten traditional growth channels. He contended that Japan’s competitive position will be defined by its technological infrastructure rather than tariff negotiations or new fiscal measures. His central point was that financial rails, rather than policy adjustments, will shape the next stage of economic strength. This combined view of economic pressure and technological adoption illustrates the factors influencing Japan’s direction as it navigates a challenging year.
