He pointed to Session and SimpleX as two projects working on these areas and disclosed that he has donated 128 ETH to each of them. Major ETH Donations In a post on X this week, Buterin said both applications are attempting to strengthen decentralization and enhance user protections without relying on phone numbers, while also addressing challenges such as multi-device support and resistance to Sybil or denial-of-service attacks. Buterin said the donation addresses are publicly available on the projects’ websites and added that, although the platforms are not yet perfect, they represent active efforts to advance privacy-preserving communication. He also called for more developers to help tackle the technical problems that still remain, and added that these issues “need more eyes on them.” It is important to note that while Signal has emerged as a widely used encrypted messaging app, it faced renewed scrutiny following a March incident in which senior US national security officials accidentally included a reporter in a Signal group discussing strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Days later, a Pentagon-wide advisory warned against using the app for any non-public information, citing a vulnerability tied to its linked-devices feature. The memo said Russian hacking groups were targeting the users of the app through phishing tactics. Signal later attributed the issue to user-targeted attacks rather than problems with its encryption, and that the company had already implemented safeguards and warnings. Buterin’s Privacy Push The Ethereum co-founder has repeatedly spoken this year about treating privacy as a basic necessity for digital systems. Following a recent data breach involving major US banks, where client information from institutions including JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley may have been exposed after a cyberattack on mortgage technology vendor SitusAMC, Buterin responded by describing privacy as a form of “hygiene.” In an essay published in April, he argued that “privacy is an important guarantor of decentralization” and outlined a path for Ethereum to support stealth addresses, selective disclosure, and application-level zero-knowledge tools to help reduce unnecessary data exposure. More recently, he warned that X’s new geo-inference system, which assigns country labels to user accounts, poses privacy risks. He said such systems can still reveal sensitive location information and may endanger vulnerable users, even when only broad regions are disclosed.

While the Shiba Inu price prediction is still taking shape, a powerful buy signal just lit up the charts. On the hourly timeframe, the 50-period simple moving average has surged above the 200-period. This is a classic golden cross pattern that often marks the beginning of a strong upward move. As a result of the latest downturn, SHIB has booked a 60% year-to-date loss. Wall Street seems to have focused on getting a Dogecoin ETF out there first before aiming for other tokens. However, as the regulatory landscape becomes much more supportive, it should be a matter of time for a Shiba Inu ETF to hit the market. Paired with the buy signal mentioned earlier, meme coins could be getting ready to make a comeback in 2026. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal After Key Support Bounce The daily chart indicates that the price has bounced off a key trendline support in the past few days and could begin its ascent from $0.0000080 to $0.000012 in the next few days. This would mean a 50% upside potential in the near term for SHIB, without necessarily pushing the envelope too much. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just popped up the signal line, which also favors a bullish outlook. This indicates that positive momentum is accelerating as macroeconomic conditions improve. Trading volumes need to rise to confirm the relevance of this support bounce, as they are currently a bit low at around 3% of the token’s circulating market cap. ChatGPT said: If the Federal Reserve cuts rates in December, it could trigger a surge in trading volume, setting the stage for meme coins to rally. One project gaining serious traction is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , a mine-to-earn game that makes crypto mining simple, fun, and fully virtual with no hardware needed. With over $2.2 million raised so far, investor interest is building quickly as the presale gains momentum.

All three altcoins could experience an unusually volatile December, either surging or sliding sharply depending on macroeconomic sentiment and industry catalysts. Over the past month, the crypto market has been in a steep correction triggered by a major Bitcoin selloff, with steep pullbacks across most major assets. Bitcoin briefly dipped to an eight-month low around $82,000 last Friday. Even so, the bigger picture remains constructive. Blockchain innovation continues to advance, and high-durability altcoins like XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are still viewed as strong long-term contenders. Once market conditions stabilize, each project could regain upward momentum. Below is how Claude AI breaks down the bullish and bearish paths for December. XRP (XRP): Claude AI Predicts a Possible Swing Toward Either $10 or $1 Based on December Market Conditions Claude AI’s downside projection suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could retreat to around $1.80 by Christmas if market sentiment deteriorates, representing a 17% drop from today’s price near $2.18. Source: Claude Such a reversal would contrast sharply with XRP’s powerful run earlier this year, when it rallied to a seven-year peak of $3.65 in July after Ripple secured a major legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For months, XRP has consolidated within multiple bullish flag formations that failed to resolve. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits near 53, and the token climbed 1.5% during the past 24 hours as the rest of the market collectively climbed 4% to a combined market cap of $3.2 trillion. Under ideal conditions, Claude’s upper-bound target reaches $10. The SEC’s recent approval of nine XRP spot ETFs could steady institutional demand, if the prior Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches are an accurate precedent. Additionally, more high-profile ETF launches could arrive soon. Further regulatory clarity or major institutional partnerships could help propel XRP toward the double-digit range by 2026. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Claude AI Highlights the Potential for a 15× Rally Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , which debuted in 2020 as a playful challenger to Dogecoin, now commands a market capitalization above $5 billion. Trading near $0.0000085, SHIB climbed 2% in the past day, roughly matching Dogecoin’s gains. A move toward the key $0.000025 resistance as November wraps up could pave the way for Claude AI’s projected year-end price window of $0.00005 to $0.00009, representing potential gains of up to 11×. Claude’s bearish outlook for SHIB is notably less severe than its predictions for XRP and Pepe. In a downside scenario, SHIB could rise a little into the $0.00001 support zone and then trade sideways, indicating minimal gains of 18% from its current price. The Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded significantly, with Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling network, offering faster transactions, lower fees, broader developer support, and enhanced privacy tools. These features place SHIB in a more advanced category than typical meme tokens. Pepe ($PEPE): Claude AI Predicts 420% Surge! Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, has grown into the leading non-doge-themed meme coin, with a heady market cap of over $2 billion. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series, Pepe’s cultural influence and meme legacy have helped solidify its ubiquitous presence across social media. Despite fierce competition, Pepe maintains deep liquidity and an active fan base, occasionally boosted by cryptic nods from Elon Musk on X, prompting speculation that he has a Pepe position alongside his known positions in DOGE and BTC. The token trades near $0.0000046 today, still about 84% below its December 2024 high of $0.00002803. Claude AI’s models suggest PEPE could challenge ATH with a 420% rise to reach $0.000024. In the short term, however, the token must break through the stubborn $0.000018 resistance area to confirm a larger trend shift. However, a bear market could see a collapse of 35% to $0.000003. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rising Meme Coin Not Factored Into Claude’s Forecasts While Claude AI anticipates potential pressure on major altcoins, presale projects continue attracting heavy interest. One standout is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has raised $4.2 million and markets itself as the “next Dogecoin.” MAXI’s humorous origin story centers on a character named Maxi Doge, depicted as plotting a comedic takeover after years of watching Dogecoin dominate. The project leans heavily into viral content, community contests, and an active social presence to build momentum. As an ERC-20 token, MAXI benefits from Ethereum’s stronger security, scalability, lower environmental impact, and larger developer ecosystem, advantages that Dogecoin’s older proof-of-work model lacks. The project currently advertises staking rewards of up to 73% APY, though these rates will naturally decrease as staking participation grows. MAXI is priced at $0.00027 in its presale, with scheduled increases in later phases. Purchases can be made via MetaMask or Best Wallet . Dogecoin stands no chance!

The cryptocurrency slid to a recent bottom near $82,000 last Friday, a zone many traders hope will be the bottom. Today, as BTC punches above $91,000, things appear to be fine. Crypto old hands aren’t panicking. Long-term bulls frame the downturn as a healthy cooldown after months of relentless accumulation, a phase designed to shake out excessive leverage, curb overheated speculation, and reset the market to prepare it for the next leg higher. Given that Bitcoin dominance no longer has a complete hold on crypto’s narrative, it’s likely that the next bull phase will be oriented around altcoins. That makes today the best opportunity to load up on XRP, Solana, and Ethereum. XRP (XRP): A Leading Contender for the Future of Global Money Movement Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) leads crypto’s international payments sector with rapid settlement times and ultra-low fees, features that position the XRP Ledger as a more efficient replacement to SWIFT. Ripple’s solution has been spotlighted in research from both the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House. Additionally, Ripple’s expanding roster of banking partners has kept XRP among the three top projects, maintaining a market cap of over $132 billion. Ripple’s introduction of U.S. dollar–pegged stablecoin RLUSD further signals its commitment to cornering the on-chain future of digital payments. Every RLUSD transaction on the XRPLedger removes a small amount of XRP from circulation, tying XRP’s value directly to the expanding popularity of Ripple’s solutions. XRP has risen 53% over the past year, breaking a six-year stagnation period with a new record high of $3.65 in July. Over the same timeframe, Bitcoin fell 2%. With its Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering near 55 and the current price of $2.19 sitting slightly above the 30-day moving average, XRP demand is visibly growing, lifting it 5% thanks to the recent rollout of nine XRP ETFs. More ETFs will follow, which will draw significant institutional capital. If the U.S. finally delivers long-promised crypto regulation, XRP could realistically approach $10 or more by 2026. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Challenger Sets Its Sights on $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has cemented its reputation as one of the fastest and most cost-efficient smart-contract networks in the industry. With a market cap approaching $80 billion and over $9 billion in TVL in its DeFi ecosystem, it is Ethereum’s most formidable rival. Last month’s launch of Solana spot ETFs from Grayscale and Bitwise grants large institutions direct access, a catalyst that historically triggered explosive growth for both Bitcoin and Ethereum during prior cycles. SOL bottomed near $100 earlier in the year, and at around $142 today, it’s hovering in a support zone. A bullish flag pattern has been forming since mid-September, suggesting a potential breakout, with strong psychological support up at the next leg, $200, and significant resistance around $250. A decisive move above those ranges could send SOL past its record high of $293.31, with optimistic projections targeting $750 during a robust Q4 rally. Meanwhile, Solana’s ultra-low fees and high-speed transactions continue drawing Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization projects, with major financial firms, such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, issuing tokenized real-world assets on Solana. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart-Contract Titan Gears Up for Major Expansion Ethereum ($ETH) retains its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and the wider Web3 economy, supported by a market cap of over $366 billion. With nearly $70 billion in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols, Ethereum remains the dominant force in smart contracts and decentralized applications, underscoring its foundational importance across the blockchain landscape. In a bull market, ETH could hit $10,000 by year-end, a dramatic leap from today’s $3,000 price and nearly twice its previous peak of $4,946 set in August. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, expected in early December, aims to significantly boost data availability for Layer-2 networks while improving security, sustainability, and scalability. These enhancements could help drive ETH closer to the $5,000 level by month’s end. However, ETH’s path toward $10,000 will depend on clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks and a favourable macro-environment, both of which could unlock major institutional entry. Earlier this year, Ethereum broke out of a bullish flag formation, rallying from $1,800 to its all-time high. Stronger momentum will be required to propel it into five-figure territory. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Culture Meets High-Speed Bitcoin Layer-2 Innovation An emerging candidate for 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling solution cosplaying as a meme coin. Despite its playful branding, the project supercharges Bitcoin with fast throughput, extremely low fees, and full smart-contract functionality. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables fluid Bitcoin transfers across different blockchains. The HYPER presale has already surpassed $28.5 million in funding, and popular crypto analyst Borch Crypto has suggested the token could see gains up to 100×. A recent audit by Coinsult confirmed no smart-contract vulnerabilities, highlighting the project’s credibility. The HYPER token powers network fees, governance, and staking, with early presale investors receiving yields of up to 40% APY. Next year, Bitcoin is going HYPER!

Source: AVAXUSD on Tradingview Securitize Wins EU Approval and Selects Avalanche for Settlement System Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. AVAX Price Holds Key Support as Technical Signals Improve While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Institutional Accumulation Strengthens Bullish Outlook Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over?

According to reports, about 54 billion Korean won — roughly $36–37 million — was taken in what the company called an “abnormal withdrawal” detected at 04:42 KST. Upbit Suspends Solana Services According to the exchange, deposits and withdrawals for assets on the Solana chain were halted immediately after the breach was found. Company engineers moved remaining Solana holdings into cold storage to limit further access. Some tokens were later frozen on-chain while investigators traced transfers. Reports have disclosed that about 12 billion won (around $8–9 million) in LAYER tokens has been frozen so far. NEW: UPBIT DISCLOSES ~$37M HACK ON SOLANA NETWORK – “TO PREVENT ANY DAMAGE TO MEMBER ASSETS, THE ENTIRE AMOUNT WILL BE COVERED BY UPBIT’S HOLDINGS.

Stolen tickers reportedly include ACS, BONK, RAY, JUP, PYTH, ORCA, JTO, LAYER, RENDER, MOODENG, and TRUMP, among others. The list is long, and tracking continues as some tokens move through multiple wallets. At this stage, several of the addresses holding the funds are under active monitoring. Upbit( @Official_Upbit ) has been hacked — 54B KRW (~36.8M USD) in assets on #Solana have been transferred to unknown wallets. https://t.co/plbmBz2G4N https://t.co/YOHoqDVfqa pic.twitter.com/DM5BxSTtXA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 27, 2025 Exchange Operator Pledges Coverage Dunamu , Upbit’s parent company, has said the exchange will cover the full loss from its own reserves so that customer balances will not be reduced. According to the company, this decision was made to protect users while the technical and forensic reviews are under way. A security review of the deposit and withdrawal systems has been launched, and outside experts are reported to be assisting with the investigation. Past Incidents And Timing Raise Questions Reports note the timing was awkward: the breach came just after a high-profile corporate announcement involving Naver Financial on November 26, 2025. Upbit is not new to major hacks; a 2019 attack cost the platform a large amount of ETH. Hot wallets, which are connected to the internet, remain a known weak point for centralized exchanges. That risk was exposed again here. On-Chain Tracking And Recovery Hopes Blockchain analysts are following the trail of transfers and identifying the wallets that received funds. Some tokens can be frozen if their issuers or governing authorities cooperate, which is how the reported LAYER freeze was achieved. Still, many assets may be hard to recover, and legal routes can be slow. It was reported that the exchange attempted to freeze what it could while moving other assets offline. What This Means For Users And Market Confidence For now, Upbit users have been assured their funds are safe because the operator pledged to absorb the loss. Market reaction could include temporary liquidity issues for certain Solana tokens listed on the platform while services remain limited.

Over six XRP-linked ETFs have debuted in recent days, with combined assets nearing $800 million — yet XRP has posted just a 3% gain in the past week. Wall Street’s crypto appetite shows no signs of slowing, but the market’s muted response is raising eyebrows. One possible reason for XRP’s muted reaction could be the lack of retail participation, as much of the recent demand appears to be coming from institutional flows. Open interest in XRP futures currently sits at $4 billion, which is the same level it reached in June, just days before XRP surged to its 2025 high of around $3.65. This parallel is now fueling speculation that a breakout could still be on the table if retail traders begin to re-enter. XRP Price Prediction: Historical Patterns Suggest That XRP Could Soon Explode Looking at the daily chart, a confirmed breakout out of the token’s descending price channel could set in motion a trend reversal for XRP. The price would have to climb to $2.40 at least to achieve that. In that case, the first target could be the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2.60. Then, we could expect a much more pronounced move to $3.10 if positive momentum accelerates. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just sent a buy signal after rising above the 14-day moving average. Hence, it seems that XRP is already on the move. As the market shows early signs of recovery, top presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are quickly gaining momentum. This Dogecoin-themed meme coin has already raised over $4 million, giving traders a rare early-day chance to join a high-energy project before it hits the market. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Tapping Into the Spirit of Early Dogecoin Maxi Doge ($MAXI) brings back the feel of Dogecoin’s early days, when meme coins were fun, fast-moving, and full of potential. Built on Ethereum, it’s designed for traders who want to get in early and ride the momentum as the community grows.

They also get access to an exclusive idea hub through which they can share insights , trading setups , their biggest Ws and Ls, and more. Finally, the project plans to invest up to 25% of the presale funds into a handful of YOLO trades and use the money to pay for marketing. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, simply head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

Prices have responded positively after U.S. stock markets rose yesterday, as increased expectations of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month buoyed sentiment. BTC is up by 5% today, while Ethereum and Solana have risen by 4% and 3.5%, although many major tokens remain down in the past week and month. Yet today’s bounce may signal a sustained turnaround, so we’ve picked the best altcoin to buy now, in order to take advantage of a surge in bullishness. This token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that’s aiming to make mining much more accessible. Crypto Price Prediction: Best Altcoin to Buy During the Crypto Crash PEPENODE kicked off its increasingly popular presale at the end of September, and now it has raised more than $2.2 million from enthusiastic investors. As noted above, its unique selling point is that it offers a unique mining system, one that removes the massive cost that comes with traditional crypto mining. Namely, it enables users to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow simply by spending PEPENODE on more nodes. Excitingly, more nodes equal greater rewards, implying that there may be a big demand for PEPENODE tokens. PEPENODE pays out mining rewards in the form of external coins, such as Pepe and Fartcoin, while it will add additional coins at later dates. On top of this, holders of PEPENODE can stake the token for a passive income , and at the moment, the coin is paying a very attractive yield of 586% APY. We could therefore see the token shoot up in price steadily over time, given the bullishness of its tokenomics. Mapping your next move in Pepenode isn’t flavor. It’s core gameplay that determines how fast you climb upgrade those Nodes! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/vY69IDm3C1 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 27, 2025 And what’s also interesting is that miners can sell on their virtual nodes once they’re finished with them, providing them with an exit and another source of income. PEPENODE Could Be One of the Biggest New Coins of 2026 Such features make PEPENODE one of the most exciting presale tokens in the market right now, and it has every chance of surging once it lists in the coming weeks. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, which its team has allocated between marketing, development, listings, mining rewards, and its treasury. Investors can join its sale by going to the PEPENODE website , where they can connect a suitable wallet and buy as much of the token as they like. It’s currently selling at a price of $0.0011685, although this will rise again in two days. In fact, it will rise every few days until the sale ends, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later. Given that the market looks ready to recover, now could be a perfect time to buy.

55013426,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90839,1764286232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Reveals The Fastest Road To XRP Price Growth,https://timestabloid.com/expert-reveals-the-fastest-road-to-xrp-price-growth/,"Market analyst Chad Steingraber has reiterated his view that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now represent the most influential and fastest-acting force capable of driving XRP price growth. In a series of recent comments, he emphasized that ETF inflows are expanding at a pace that surpasses every other potential catalyst, including increasing network activity and broader market sentiment. Rapid Expansion of XRP ETF Holdings Steingraber’s assessment is anchored in the surge of institutional accumulation taking place through newly launched XRP ETFs. Among the most prominent examples is Bitwise , which now manages more than 80.5 million XRP, valued at roughly $178.8 million. This position increased following a single-day inflow of $7.46 million, marking the largest increase among all XRP ETF issuers for that session. This is the fastest road to a higher price. All other options are much longer. — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 27, 2025 Other managers are seeing similar results. Canary Capital added $5.21 million in inflows, pushing its total XRP assets to $336.98 million. Grayscale and Franklin Templeton also recorded steady increases of $4.32 million and $4.83 million, raising their respective totals to $84.68 million and $76 million. Across all providers, XRP ETFs collectively oversee $676.49 million in assets, an amount accumulated within just nine trading days of the ETFs becoming available. Steingraber expects this figure to grow substantially as more firms begin trading XRP products. Projected Increase in ETF Trading Activity Three additional funds are set to join the group, which Steingraber believes will significantly expand daily trading activity. Once the new ETFs become active, he predicts the average daily trading volume across all issuers could rise by an additional $35 million. Under these conditions, overall daily ETF trading could fall within the $75 million to $80 million range. Higher volume directly translates to greater XRP acquisition requirements from issuers, a factor that he sees as central to near-term market dynamics. Based on the projected trading range, Steingraber calculates that the combined ETFs may eventually need between 20 million and 30 million XRP each day. Even at the lower end of that estimate, accumulation would occur at a substantial pace. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If seven ETFs collectively purchased 20 million XRP in a single session, that would equal 100 million XRP across a standard trading week. Over one month, this could rise to 400 million XRP, and over a full year, the total could reach approximately 4.8 billion XRP. He stresses that the market may not require a full year to feel the impact. According to him, if prices do not adjust upward quickly, the decrease in available supply could become noticeable within a matter of months. Why ETF Demand Is the Most Immediate Catalyst Steingraber argues that no other factor, including corporate integrations, cross-border payment expansion, or broader crypto-market optimism, currently matches the immediate effect of ETF-related buying. ETF inflows draw directly from the circulating supply, and issuers must secure XRP to create new shares when investor demand increases. This link between capital inflow and actual XRP acquisition makes ETFs a direct mechanism for tightening supply, unlike developments that may influence price more gradually. Despite the rapid accumulation, XRP continues to trade around the $2 mark. Analysts note that this is partly because early ETF demand is often routed through over-the-counter desks, delaying its influence on public order books. As more ETFs begin operations and daily accumulation reaches the levels Steingraber projects, he expects the market to respond more quickly. He concludes that ETF-driven demand represents the most immediate path to notable XRP price appreciation, arguing that all other potential catalysts, while valuable, operate on much slower timelines and therefore cannot generate comparable short-term impact.

After falling nearly 45% this month, the meme coin may still have room to drop — with top analyst Ali Martinez suggesting a further 60% decline could be on the table. Martinez points to a clear head-and-shoulders breakdown, with Pepe slipping below its neckline on November 3 and still tracking toward a potential target of $0.0000015. Keep an eye on $PEPE ! pic.twitter.com/YGIsHu6u1A — Ali (@ali_charts) November 26, 2025 Derivatives markets appear to be trailing the setup. Speculative demand has plunged, with Open Interest down 65% since the breakdown, now sitting at $238 million. Pepe Open Interest (OI). Source: Coinglass . Traders have disengaged with price movements, but a $46 million pickup in OI this week and a Long Short Ratio of 1.03 show bullishness creeping back in. The majority of traders are betting on further price increases, showing potential for an early bailout from the head-and-shoulders pattern. Pepe Price Prediction: Will Pepe Vanish? Not all marker commentators share Martinez’s view. Analyst GalaxyBTC cites historical support as grounds for the meme coin still “ looks good ” at its current position. This support stands to be confirmed as a launchpad level yet again with a 6-week descending channel approaching a breakout as momentum indicators flip bullish. PEPE / USD 12-hour chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView. The RSI teeters on a cross back above the 50 neutral line, while the MACD maintains a wide lead above the signal line. Both of these metrics point to this week’s pickup as the early stages of a lasting uptrend as buyers step back in. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout sits around $0.0000047, with a bounce likely to rule out a false breakout. Fully realised, the pattern targets the $0.000009 demand zone for a 95% gain. And as the bull market matures with anticipated U.S. interest rate cuts to fuel risk appetite, this push could go even further, eying a 5x move to all-time highs at $0.000028. PepeNode: Earn Meme Coins with a Virtual Miner Tired of trying to time meme coin pumps? PepeNode ($PEPENODE) makes it easy to earn from the market without trading, guessing entries, or buying hardware. Just build virtual mining rigs, upgrade your setup, and start collecting rewards in top tokens like $PEPE , $FARTCOIN , and more. The more rigs you launch, the more you earn — and top miners also unlock exclusive airdrops. It’s fun, fast to set up, and already gaining serious traction. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.2 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 585% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside, all without having to worry about timing the perfect entry.

Adding to the uncertainty, new data from Arkham reveals that SpaceX transferred out another 1,163 BTC—worth approximately $105.23 million—just a few hours ago. The transfer appears to have been routed to Coinbase Prime, suggesting a potential custody shift by the company. Such large movements often spark concern in the market, as they may signal repositioning, selling preparation, or treasury adjustments by major corporate holders. While Bitcoin’s push above $90K provides temporary relief, it does little to change the broader narrative: the market remains under pressure, liquidity is thinning, and macro-driven uncertainty continues to shape price action. The coming sessions will determine whether BTC can build momentum or slip back into deeper correction territory. SpaceX’s Bitcoin Movements Add New Layer of Market Uncertainty According to data from Arkham, SpaceX currently holds 6,095.45 BTC, valued at roughly $550 million at today’s prices. This substantial treasury position places the company among the larger corporate Bitcoin holders, and its recent on-chain activity has quickly drawn attention across the market. The latest transfer—1,163 BTC moved just hours ago—marks a meaningful shift in activity for SpaceX, especially considering the company has been largely inactive in terms of BTC movements for months. Arkham reports that this is SpaceX’s first notable transaction since October 29, when the company transferred 281 BTC to a new wallet address. While the motives behind these transfers remain unknown, traders typically monitor such moves closely, as large corporate holders can influence market sentiment. Transfers to Coinbase Prime—as suspected in the latest movement—often suggest custody adjustments, treasury restructuring, or preparations for strategic repositioning. For now, there is no clear indication that SpaceX is reducing its Bitcoin exposure. However, the renewed on-chain activity comes at a sensitive moment for the market, which is struggling with selling pressure, fear, and broad speculation about an emerging bear phase. As long as major smart-money entities remain active, Bitcoin’s short-term direction may continue to experience heightened volatility. Attempted Recovery but Still Under Pressure Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after plunging to new local lows last week, with the price now pushing back above $91,000. The chart shows a sharp bounce from the sub-$82,000 zone, which acted as a temporary support during the capitulation phase. However, despite this rebound, BTC remains below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—which reinforces the broader bearish structure. The recent upswing reflects short-term relief rather than a confirmed trend reversal. Volume spiked heavily during the sell-off, indicating forced liquidations and panic selling. But the current bounce is happening on lighter volume, suggesting that buyers are cautious and not yet committing with strong conviction. Structurally, Bitcoin must reclaim the $95,000–$98,000 zone, where the 50-day and 100-day moving averages converge. This area represents the first major resistance cluster and will determine whether the market is transitioning into a recovery or simply forming a lower high before another leg down. Failure to break above this band could invite renewed selling pressure.

Banks will be allowed to offer accounts, custody and payment services tied to stablecoins such as USDT, government statements and local reports disclosed. The move follows a sharp rise in crypto use as people seek ways to hold dollar-pegged value amid currency pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Banks To Offer USDT Accounts Reports have disclosed that Economy Minister Jose Gabriel Espinoza announced the change, and at least one lender, Banco Bisa, has already begun offering custody and transfer services for USDT. Based on reports, crypto transactions in Bolivia jumped dramatically last year, with some counts showing growth of more than 500% and figures putting crypto activity at $294 million in the first half of 2025. Those numbers have pushed regulators and banks to respond more directly. 💥 BREAKING: 🇧🇴 Bolivia to integrate Bitcoin and crypto into its financial system, starting with stablecoins pic.twitter.com/Qb0Tj7pern — Bitcoin Archive (@BitcoinArchive) November 26, 2025 Everyday Payments And Savings People and businesses are reportedly testing USDT for real payments. Some shops and service providers have shown prices in USDT, and certain sectors — such as car dealers and firms handling imports — are said to be accepting stablecoin payments for some transactions. According to market observers, the change is partly a response to shortages of physical US dollars and to rising costs that make the local currency less stable for saving. Banks will be able to create savings products denominated in stablecoins, and may offer loans or payment options tied to them. Cross-Border Transfers And Remittances Based on reports, one obvious use will be cross-border transfers. Stablecoins can offer a dollar-pegged option when access to actual US dollars is limited. That could help businesses that buy fuel or other imports and families that receive money from abroad. Still, practical hurdles remain: many people are unbanked or lack easy internet access, and broad adoption will take infrastructure, training and clear consumer protections. Regulatory Limits And Risks According to analysts, the government’s plan does not make stablecoins legal tender in place of the boliviano. Rather, it lets regulated banks provide crypto-linked services under the financial system. That means accepting USDT will likely stay voluntary for merchants. There are also risks to watch: stablecoin liquidity, custody safety, and how well banks manage anti-money-laundering rules. Consumer education and stronger oversight will be needed to protect ordinary users. What Comes Next Several months of rollout and pilot programs are expected, and observers will be watching transaction volumes and how many banks and businesses sign on. If the system grows, Bolivia could become an example for neighboring countries facing similar currency stress. But the deeper economic problems that pushed people to crypto — inflation and limited dollar access — will still need government solutions beyond new payment rails.

His comments were made during a recent shareholder briefing, where he underscored SBI’s involvement in a developing XRP treasury project managed by Evernorth. Although the presentation was originally delivered in Japanese, an English-language version was later circulated by community commentator Crypto Eri. Overview of Evernorth Treasury Project Evernorth recently announced plans to join forces with Armada Acquisition Corp II through a merger that would create what the company describes as a large-scale XRP treasury entity. As part of this plan, Evernorth has launched a fundraising effort valued at $1 billion. SBI Group is one of the major contributors to this initiative and has allocated $200 million specifically to the acquisition of XRP on the open market. XRP | Ripple @evernorthxrp ""This will be very interesting."" pic.twitter.com/i0KMgEIJCK — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) November 26, 2025 The fundraising round also includes a substantial contribution from Ripple, which is providing a mix of XRP and cash exceeding $500 million. Participation extends further to individual and institutional investors. Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has already supplied 50 million XRP personally, while other companies, such as Kraken, Pantera Capital, and Arrington Capital, have collectively added more than $600 million. SBI’s Position and Expectations The merger is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2026. Once finalized, the combined entity plans to begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol XRPN. Kitao referred to the project as noteworthy due to the expectations around its market performance and strategic value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As one of the investors backing the treasury, SBI Group may benefit from any gains that arise once the shares become publicly traded. The arrangement allows SBI to hold a direct stake in an entity built around long-term XRP accumulation and management. Current Holdings and Status As of early November, Evernorth reported holding approximately 473.27 million XRP, valued at around $1.03 billion based on prevailing market prices at the time. These assets are spread across a series of wallets operating on the XRP Ledger. According to available data, two of the primary wallets hold roughly 45 million XRP and 42 million XRP each, while the remainder is distributed across several other custodial accounts. Kitao’s remarks signal SBI Group’s continued interest in the broader XRP ecosystem and reaffirm its ongoing collaboration with Ripple. The upcoming merger and public listing represent the next phase of this involvement, positioning SBI to play a prominent role in the development of the new treasury-focused enterprise.

This bold proposal aims to reduce the tax burden on American workers while leveraging an unconventional funding source: tariff revenue. What Does Trump’s Income Tax Cut Plan Actually Mean? President Trump’s proposal centers on using revenue generated from tariffs to fund reductions in income taxes. This approach represents a fundamental shift in how the government might collect and redistribute funds. The income tax cut would potentially put more money back into the pockets of American taxpayers. According to multiple media reports, the President believes tariff collections could cover a substantial portion of the proposed income tax reduction. This strategy connects international trade policy directly with domestic tax relief, creating an innovative economic model. How Would This Income Tax Cut Actually Work? The mechanics behind this income tax cut proposal involve several key components. First, tariffs collected on imported goods would flow into government coffers. Then, these funds would offset the revenue loss from lowering income tax rates. Key aspects of the plan include: Reduced income tax rates across multiple brackets Increased reliance on tariff revenue Potential changes to international trade relationships Possible impacts on consumer prices What Are the Potential Benefits of This Income Tax Cut Strategy? This innovative approach to funding an income tax cut offers several potential advantages. American workers could see immediate benefits through higher take-home pay. Moreover, businesses might experience reduced payroll costs and increased consumer spending power. The income tax cut could stimulate economic growth by putting more disposable income in circulation. However, the success of this strategy depends heavily on maintaining sufficient tariff revenue streams while managing potential trade relationship impacts. Could This Income Tax Cut Face Implementation Challenges? While the income tax cut proposal sounds promising, several hurdles could emerge. Congress must approve any significant tax changes, and political opposition might complicate passage. Additionally, fluctuating tariff revenues could create budget uncertainty. International trade partners might respond with their own tariffs, potentially affecting American exports. The income tax cut’s sustainability also depends on maintaining consistent trade flows and tariff collections over time. What Makes This Income Tax Cut Different From Previous Proposals? This income tax cut stands apart because of its unique funding mechanism. Unlike traditional tax cuts funded through spending reductions or increased borrowing, this plan uses tariff revenue as the primary offset. This creates a direct link between trade policy and domestic tax relief. The income tax cut proposal represents a departure from conventional fiscal thinking. It suggests that protectionist trade policies could finance domestic economic benefits, potentially reshaping how governments approach revenue generation. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Approach to Tax Policy President Trump’s income tax cut proposal marks a significant departure from traditional economic thinking. By linking tariff revenue to domestic tax relief, this plan could redefine how governments balance international trade and domestic fiscal policy. The success of this income tax cut will depend on careful implementation and ongoing evaluation of its economic impacts. Frequently Asked Questions How would tariff revenue fund the income tax cut? Money collected from tariffs on imported goods would be used to replace revenue lost from lowering income tax rates, creating a new funding stream for tax relief. When might this income tax cut take effect? The timeline depends on congressional approval and implementation details. The process could take several months or longer if political negotiations become complex. Would all taxpayers benefit from this income tax cut? While details are still emerging, the proposal appears aimed at providing broad-based tax relief, though specific impacts might vary across income brackets. How might this affect international trade relationships? Increased reliance on tariff revenue could strain trade partnerships, potentially leading to retaliatory measures from other countries. What are the risks of funding tax cuts through tariffs? Primary risks include trade disruption, potential consumer price increases, and revenue volatility if trade patterns change significantly. How does this compare to previous tax cut proposals? This approach is unique in its direct linkage between tariff collections and income tax reductions, representing an innovative funding mechanism.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.33 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $3.79. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.3847 Market cap $382.73M Trading volume $114.29M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.393 24-hour low $0.3759 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 14.11% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.4983 14-Day RSI 42.80 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.6970 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is stabilizing but still needs to reclaim $0.407 for real upside. The coin’s short-term trend is up, but momentum is cooling. The resistance at $0.395 and $0.407 remains the barrier to expansion. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As of November 27, WIF is stabilizing after the sharp drop seen around Nov 21–22. The price has recovered from the lower Bollinger Band but remains below the middle band near $0.407, which continues to act as resistance. WIF’s momentum is improving, as shown by a positive MACD histogram, though both MACD lines remain below zero, indicating the broader trend is still in a recovery phase. Also, PVT has begun rising again but remains subdued. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart shows a clearer short-term uptrend, with price trading above the Alligator lines and the structure sloping upward. However, the candles show repeated hesitation around $0.39–$0.395, where rejection wicks appear. The MACD remains positive but is losing strength as the histogram contracts, indicating a cooling momentum.

WIF is in recovery mode but not yet in a full bullish trend. Traders can expect continued grinding upward with pullbacks, and watch for a decisive break above $0.407, which would confirm strength and open higher targets. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $1 by the end of 2025 and between $3.4 and $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

This massive expiration event represents one of the largest in crypto history and could significantly influence Bitcoin price action in the coming days. What Does This Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean for Traders? According to data from Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange, these Bitcoin options contracts will expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC on November 28. The sheer scale of this expiration demands attention from every serious crypto investor. The put/call ratio of 0.56 indicates more call options than put options, suggesting overall bullish sentiment among traders. The max pain price sits at $100,000, representing the strike price where the maximum number of options would expire worthless. This level often acts as a gravitational pull on the underlying asset’s price as expiration approaches. Understanding these Bitcoin options dynamics helps traders anticipate potential market movements. How Do Options Expirations Affect Bitcoin Price? Options expirations create significant market pressure as traders adjust their positions. Here’s what typically happens: Gamma exposure forces market makers to hedge their positions Large expirations can lead to increased volatility Price often gravitates toward the max pain level Post-expiration frequently brings relief rallies or sell-offs The current Bitcoin options landscape shows substantial open interest that must be resolved. Market participants should prepare for potential price swings as these contracts reach their expiration date. The $100,000 max pain price becomes particularly relevant for short-term price predictions. Ethereum Options Join the Expiration Party Meanwhile, Ethereum options worth $1.7 billion will expire simultaneously. These Ethereum contracts feature a put/call ratio of 0.48 and a max pain price of $3,400. The coordinated expiration of both major cryptocurrency options creates a compounded market event that could amplify volatility across the entire crypto space. The lower put/call ratio for Ethereum options indicates even stronger bullish sentiment compared to Bitcoin. This divergence between the two largest cryptocurrencies provides interesting insights into trader positioning and market expectations. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? Following this massive Bitcoin options expiration, traders should monitor several key factors: Immediate price reaction after 8:00 a.m. UTC Volume and liquidity changes in derivatives markets Open interest reset for new options contracts Spot market correlation with derivatives activity Historical patterns suggest that large Bitcoin options expirations often precede significant price movements. However, market conditions and external factors can always override typical expiration effects. The current macroeconomic environment adds another layer of complexity to this already dramatic Bitcoin options event. Navigating Post-Expiration Market Conditions Once these Bitcoin options contracts settle, the market typically experiences a period of recalibration. Market makers reduce their hedging activities, and traders establish new positions based on updated market outlooks. This transition period often creates trading opportunities for alert investors. The resolution of $13.4 billion in Bitcoin options exposure will undoubtedly leave its mark on market structure. Whether this leads to sustained trends or temporary disruptions remains to be seen, but the magnitude guarantees market impact. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin Markets Today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration represents a critical inflection point for cryptocurrency markets. The $13.4 billion notional value underscores the growing maturity and sophistication of crypto derivatives. While short-term volatility seems inevitable, the long-term implications for market development are profoundly positive as institutional participation continues to grow. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin options expiration? Bitcoin options expiration is when options contracts reach their expiry date and are either exercised or expire worthless based on the underlying asset’s price. How does the put/call ratio affect market sentiment? A put/call ratio below 1 indicates more call options than puts, suggesting bullish sentiment among traders expecting price increases. What is max pain price in options trading? Max pain price is the strike price where the maximum number of options contracts expire worthless, causing the most financial pain to option holders. Can options expirations predict Bitcoin price movement? While not perfectly predictive, large options expirations often influence short-term price action as market makers adjust their hedging strategies. How often do Bitcoin options expire? Major crypto exchanges typically have monthly options expirations, with some offering weekly contracts for more frequent trading opportunities. Should retail traders worry about options expirations? Retail traders should be aware of expiration dates but focus more on their overall investment strategy rather than timing markets around single events. Found this analysis helpful?

Interpol just dropped a bombshell revelation that will make you think twice about online opportunities. The international police organization has officially designated crypto-based scam compounds as a serious transnational criminal threat, exposing a dark underworld that spans multiple countries and exploits thousands of victims. What Are Crypto-Based Scam Compounds? Interpol’s investigation reveals these crypto-based scam compounds operate like modern-day criminal enterprises. They lure unsuspecting victims with fake job postings, promising legitimate employment opportunities. However, once recruits arrive at compounds in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, they find themselves trapped in nightmare scenarios. Victims face forced labor conditions where they must execute various fraudulent schemes including: Voice phishing operations Romance scams targeting lonely individuals Sophisticated investment frauds Direct cryptocurrency scams How Do These Criminal Networks Operate? The sophistication of these crypto-based scam compounds demonstrates why Interpol considers them a transnational threat. These organizations use cryptocurrency for several key reasons that make them particularly dangerous. Cryptocurrency provides these criminals with: Borderless transaction capabilities Enhanced anonymity features Quick money movement across jurisdictions Difficulty in tracing funds Why Is This Designation So Important? Interpol’s classification of crypto-based scam compounds as a transnational criminal threat marks a significant shift in global law enforcement priorities. This designation triggers enhanced cooperation between member countries and allocates additional resources to combat these networks. The international police organization emphasizes that no single country can tackle this problem alone. The cross-border nature of these crypto-based scam compounds requires coordinated efforts across multiple jurisdictions to effectively dismantle the networks and rescue victims. What Can You Do to Stay Protected? While authorities work to dismantle these crypto-based scam compounds , individuals need to remain vigilant. Understanding the warning signs can help you avoid falling victim to these sophisticated operations. Watch for these red flags in job offers: Unusually high salaries for minimal qualifications Vague job descriptions Requests for upfront payments Pressure to relocate quickly Companies with limited online presence The Global Response to Crypto-Based Scam Compounds Interpol’s announcement signals a new era in fighting crypto-based scam compounds . The organization calls for improved information sharing between national police forces and enhanced training for identifying cryptocurrency-related crimes. Moreover, financial intelligence units worldwide are developing better tools to track transactions involving crypto-based scam compounds . This coordinated approach aims to disrupt the financial flows that keep these criminal enterprises operating. Frequently Asked Questions What makes crypto-based scam compounds different from regular scams? These compounds operate as organized criminal enterprises with physical locations where victims are held against their will and forced to commit fraud, making them far more dangerous than typical online scams. Which countries have the highest concentration of these compounds? Interpol specifically identified Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos as primary locations, though the networks operate across multiple Southeast Asian countries. How do victims typically get recruited? Most victims respond to fraudulent job postings that promise high salaries and good working conditions, only to discover the reality once they arrive at the compounds. What types of cryptocurrency scams do they run? These compounds typically execute investment frauds, romance scams, fake exchange platforms, and phishing operations targeting cryptocurrency holders. How can I verify if a job offer is legitimate? Always research companies thoroughly, verify contact information through official channels, and be wary of offers that seem too good to be true. What should I do if I suspect someone is trapped in such a compound? Contact local authorities immediately and provide any available information about the location and circumstances. You can also reach out to international organizations that specialize in human trafficking cases. Help spread awareness about this critical issue – share this article on social media to ensure more people understand the dangers of crypto-based scam compounds and can protect themselves and their loved ones from falling victim to these transnational criminal operations.

This movement signals important changes in market sentiment that could impact your investment decisions. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency market dynamics. This important metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. However, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clear picture of genuine market movements.

The current reading of 21 suggests we’re firmly in Bitcoin season territory.

When the index remains low, it might indicate better opportunities in Bitcoin or established projects.

Dogecoin (DOGE), the first meme currency, however, has been encountering strong technological challenges since it fell below its vital support level of $0.14, which triggered a prediction of the currencies falling to $0.07. In this environment of uncertainty, the presale scheme of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has managed to attract capital through the provision of utility and growth trends. In the emerging environment of investing in the best crypto to buy today and achieve significant gains, there’s a clear shift towards initiatives that exhibit proper foundations. Dogecoin’s Tough Spot The market trend of Dogecoin has shifted to the bear side, and its recent break below the support level of $0.14 indicates its possibility of dropping even further. According to various analysts, the break below this crucial support level makes the downward movement of Dogecoin to levels of $0.13, $0.12, and even $0.10 possible, along with the structural support level of $0.07. Although the meme coin community engagement of 19,000 posts and 2.2 million reactions in a day leads the chart, this level of community engagement has not been enough to halt the fall. The bearish signals from the MACD indicator continue, although the RSI indicator has yet to reach the oversold levels before turning the tide. The disparity from the levels of hype and price performance makes this particular option less attractive as a platform that identifies the best cryptocurrencies to invest in safely. Dominant Presale to Near Completion of Phase 6 In contrast to Dogecoin’s challenges, there lies a tempting and urgent opportunity in the almost presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The platform has shown great support because it has managed to raise over $19,020,000 and has attracted a community of 18,250 holders. The sixth phase of the fundraising has been reached: the platform has sold 95% of the tokens at the current price of $0.035, which has shown a 250% jump from the first phase. This phase will be sold out at a rapid pace and will be the last opportunity to obtain MUTM without its price rising to $0.040 in the next phase. The intended progression towards hitting the $0.06 launch price will allow existing investors to generate substantial growth possibilities and will continue to remain a prime option to consider when investing in the cryptocurrencies available to buy at the current time. Competitive Leaderboard Incentive And adding a level of engagement to its fundraising activities, the Mutuum Finance platform has also improved its presales through the installation of a 24-hour leaderboard. This will create a level of competition to encourage the most active participants. The participant who makes the highest transaction in the 24-hour period will win the bonus of MUTM $500 daily. The leaderboard system also automatically reinitializes at the start of each day at UTC 00:00. This helps to ignite the already existing community and also form the agenda of bringing in new investors who will be interested in the best possible option of investing in the best-crypto available in the market because of the instant benefit provided above its value appreciation in the presale. Sustainable Buy-and-Distribute Strategy Apart from the presale model, the Mutuum Finance platform has been built to retain the value of its tokens through the novel “Buy and Distribute” model. The platform utilizes its fee income to automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. The bought tokens are then distributed to the users who stake their mtTokens. The mtTokens are the interest-bearing receipts received as liquidity. This leads to a virtuous cycle because the usage of the protocol and the generation of fees will be directly proportional to the pressure exerted on the MUTM token from the buy side. This directly relates the success of the platform to the demand for the token. The basic utility of this approach plays a crucial role in making choices about what to buy in the world of cryptocurrencies today when it comes to the mostly non-performing nature of meme coins. Comparing Dogecoin And Mutuum Finance’s Performance Paths DOGE’s failed support levels and bearish outlook point to the dangers of hype coins. MUTM’s close to sold-out presale phase, engaging rewards programs, and sound tokenomics provide a tangible prospect of immense growth. The limited duration of the opportunity to participate at the price of $0.035 is noted. The data-driven momentum presented at Mutuum Finance makes it an attractive option for the type of investor who prioritizes the identification of the best available option in the world of crypto to invest in.

55016474,635467,1764291603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55016474.jpeg,Australia Signals Big Crypto Ambitions With $24B Framework and Tighter Custody Standards,https://bitcoinist.com/australia-signals-crypto-ambitions-24b-framework/,"Australia is accelerating its push into digital finance with the introduction of the Corporations Amendment (Digital Assets Framework) Bill 2025, a comprehensive regulatory overhaul designed to strengthen crypto custody standards, improve investor protection, and unlock an estimated $24 billion in annual economic value. The bill establishes the country’s first comprehensive framework for digital asset platforms and crypto custodians, positioning Australia as one of the most proactive jurisdictions in the global race for crypto regulation. A New Licensing Regime to Protect Consumers The cornerstone of the legislation is a requirement for crypto exchanges and custody providers to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL). This brings them under the supervision of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) , a major structural shift for an industry that previously operated in a fragmented regulatory space. Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino emphasized that Australia must “keep pace” with financial innovation. The bill specifically targets firms holding customer crypto, rather than blockchain technology itself, addressing a widespread concern that companies can currently store unlimited digital assets for clients without adequate safeguards. To close this gap, the bill introduces two new regulated categories: Digital asset platforms Tokenized custody platforms Both will be subject to strict standards for transactions, settlements, asset storage, and mandatory disclosure of risks and fees. Balancing Innovation With Oversight While the legislation imposes tough standards, it also aims to support responsible growth in the digital asset sector. Companies handling less than A$10 million in annual transactions or participating in crypto only as an incidental activity will be exempt from licensing. Industry response has been broadly positive, with firms like Crypto.com and DECA calling the bill a long-awaited step that provides regulatory clarity without stifling innovation. A phased rollout, a 12-month preparation period followed by a six-month transition window, gives platforms time to meet the new requirements. ASIC’s recent crackdown on scams underscores the urgency. Since mid-2023, the regulator has removed over 14,000 phishing and scam sites, approximately 20% of which were related to cryptocurrency. A Transformational Step for Australia’s Digital Finance Future Treasurer Jim Chalmers noted that digital assets, from cryptocurrencies to tokenized real-world assets, represent a significant economic opportunity. Research cited by the government suggests that the reforms could help unlock up to $24 billion annually in productivity and efficiencies across the financial sector. However, industry experts warn that coordination across ASIC, AUSTRAC, and the ATO will be essential. The bill’s success will depend on whether the final regulatory framework is both enforceable and flexible enough to adapt to rapid innovation in tokenization and blockchain services. As the bill moves through Parliament, with easy passage expected in the House, the key question is whether crossbench support in the Senate will solidify Australia’s position as a global leader in secure, innovation-friendly crypto regulation.

Got zeroed.” Scaramucci framed the last 20 trading days as another brutal reminder of crypto’s structural volatility. “I know I have a trap door on my portfolio,” he said. “Once in a while I’ll be walking across the living room feeling beautiful about myself. And then, boom, a trap door opens and I have fallen into the basement of the house.” Related Reading: Will Crypto Explode If Kevin Hassett Takes Over The Fed In 2026? According to Novogratz, this particular trap door opened at Binance. “It started really by, you know, at Binance, they had an oracle which set price misfunction,” he said. That error hit a synthetic stablecoin and “created a cascade where people were getting stopped out because there was the wrong price.” The dislocation then bled into levered perpetual markets “like Hyperliquid, like Uniswap,” where “as prices went down, people started getting liquidated.” He argued that the way crypto participants use leverage turned a technical glitch into a systemic event. “What people don’t understand about crypto is that the crypto investor doesn’t play for 10, 11, 12 percent returns,” he said. “Crypto investor call themselves degens with pride. They want to turn one into 15. And so they trade a very volatile asset with a lot of leverage.” Perpetual futures make that leverage particularly dangerous for liquidity providers. “Perpetual futures are not normal futures,” Novogratz said, crediting “the genius that Arthur Hayes and his group of people” for a design where “as longs get liquidated, they’re paired off against shorts.” In a fast collapse, “you could be short and you lose your short position. Well, if you’re long on another exchange against that short position, you’re shit out of luck. And that happened to a lot of market makers.” Will The Crypto Market Recover? The result, he said, was a sharp loss of liquidity and retail capital. “We lost a lot of liquidity in the market. We lost a lot of retail punters who lost their stack,” he noted, adding that after such a wipeout “it takes a while for Humpty Dumpty to get put back together again.” Novogratz said he initially expected higher levels to hold. “I actually, to be fair, thought we were going to hold at higher levels at $90,000,” he admitted. “And we went all the way to $80,000. $80,000 was a maximum pain point… Got to $1.80 on XRP. We got to $125 on Solana. Real pain points.” He links the subsequent rebound to macro tailwinds, not healed sentiment. “Now we bounce up. We bounce because of the Fed. But we’re not out of the woods,” he said. “I do think Bitcoin will climb back towards $100,000 by the end of the year, but there’ll be sellers waiting there. We’ve done some medium-term damage to the psychology of the market.” Related Reading: Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran On the spot side, he highlighted massive profit-taking by early holders against ETF-driven inflows. “We had one $9 billion seller,” he said. “That’s one-third of all of IBIT’s flows of the year.” As US wealth channels move “from a zero weighting to a 3 to 4 percent weighting” in Bitcoin, that “was met with OG sellers.” “In the long run, that’s healthy,” he said. “In the short run, that’s painful.” Novogratz also argued that crypto is being repriced as a real business ecosystem rather than a pure story. “It’s a transition from just being a story — ‘we’re the most important industry… we’re going to decentralize the world’ — to ‘show me what crypto actually does,’” he said. “Some businesses are making money. Some businesses aren’t. There are some token ecosystems that make common sense to an investor and there’s some that all feel like they’re just an association.” Overlaying it all is a macro backdrop he views as increasingly supportive. He called the Fed’s recent signals and plans to ease bank cash requirements in repo “a monstrous liquidity boom that’s coming,” adding that “they’re going to bring rates down to 2 percent in the next 16 months” and that inflation will “creep higher,” implying negative real rates. For crypto, the message is double-edged: structurally de-levered, with fewer market makers and wounded sentiment, but still tied to a global liquidity cycle that Novogratz believes is turning in its favor — once Humpty Dumpty gets put back together again. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,115.

Bitcoin and Ethereum remain range bound while mid caps show uneven recovery patterns. Avalanche, Sui, and Hedera have posted sharp intraday swings, and XRP continues to react heavily to liquidity shifts. In unstable markets like this, analysts say the smartest positioning comes from mixing established assets with early-stage presales that offer fixed entry levels. Because the broader market is still struggling for direction, accumulating strong assets now is becoming a key strategy for traders expecting a turnaround. Assets to Watch in the Next Crypto Bull Run Here are the five assets analysts believe could lead the next expansion cycle. 1. Noomez ($NNZ) Noomez ($NNZ) has quickly become one of the most watched early-stage opportunities after its price advanced from $0.0000187 to $0.0000230 , confirming the start of Stage 5. With Stage 6 approaching , buyers understand that the next increase is automatic once the current allocation is cleared. The presale has already gathered 196 holders with $43,512.28 raised , and demand is rising because entries remain fixed and shielded from open market volatility. Key elements driving Noomez’s traction include: 28-stage model with transparent pricing Unsold tokens permanently burned each stage Vault events at Stage 14 and Stage 28 Up to 66% APY through Noom Rewards Early interest described as massive as demand continues to explode With prices low at this phase, many buyers choose to buy Noomez now before the next jump. The referral system also gives both sides a 10 percent bonus. 2. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera, currently priced at $0.1478 , remains one of the most stable enterprise focused networks. Key details supporting Hedera’s long-term outlook include: $6.28B market cap with strong institutional backing 42.47B circulating supply and steady on-chain usage Predictable, low-cost network fees High throughput suited for enterprise applications 3. Sui (SUI) Sui trades at $1.53 with a $5.66B market cap and nearly $787M in daily volume . Core strengths driving Sui’s relevance include: 3.68B circulating supply with strong liquidity Expanding Move-based ecosystem Heavy focus on gaming and high-speed apps Growing validator network and developer activity 4. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, priced at $14.94 , maintains a strong $6.41B market cap with nearly $500M in 24h volume . Key Avalanche advantages include: Rapid growth of custom subnets for institutions 428.93M AVAX circulating with strong liquidity A leading ecosystem for scaling independent chains Broad developer adoption across gaming and enterprise apps 5. XRP XRP trades at $2.19 with a massive $132.53B market cap and $3.93B daily volume . Reasons XRP remains essential for large-cap exposure include: 60.33B tokens circulating with high liquidity Ongoing global settlement integrations Strong institutional visibility A proven asset during macro liquidity rotations Accumulating Noomez Coin Is Emerging as the Smartest Strategy for 2025 Noomez is attracting early accumulation for one simple reason: it provides fixed, predictable entry levels at a time when open-market assets move aggressively with every liquidity shift. Each stage increases the price automatically, which means anyone entering now secures a lower cost basis than future buyers. The presale also burns all unsold tokens, tightening supply as demand grows. With Stage 6 approaching and momentum accelerating, many traders see Noomez as the most strategic bet for buyers preparing for the next major market expansion. Why Noomez Could Lead the Next Crypto Bull Run Noomez is gaining momentum because demand rises at every stage while supply shrinks from automatic burns. Prices increase with each new phase, and staking boosts long-term upside with up to 66 percent APY. Fixed pricing protects buyers during volatile markets, and Stage 6 is nearing activation, meaning the time is running out for early entries before higher tiers take over.

According to a recent SEC filing , CalPERS acquired 448,157 Strategy (MSTR) shares in the third quarter, paying over $144m for the position. The stake, which gave the fund direct equity exposure to one of the most volatile Bitcoin plays in traditional markets, is now worth roughly $80m. In the context of CalPERS, the hit is manageable. The fund manages over $550b in assets for more than 2m public sector workers and retirees, making it the largest public pension plan in the US, so the Strategy stake represents only a tiny slice of its portfolio. Index Risk Looms With JPMorgan Flagging Possible MSCI And Nasdaq Exits Strategy’s stock has done the damage. The shares closed around $175 on Wednesday and are down about 45% so far this quarter. The drop largely tracks Bitcoin’s own swings, as well as a broader risk-off tone that has weighed on high-beta tech and crypto-related names. Sentiment has also taken a hit from Wall Street. JPMorgan analysts recently warned that Strategy could be removed from major equity benchmarks such as the MSCI USA index and the Nasdaq 100. They estimated that MSCI exclusion alone might trigger up to $2.8b in outflows, with more selling pressure if other index providers follow. Strategy’s spot @MicroStrategy in major indexes is now at risk, with JPMorgan warning that a removal from MSCI USA or the Nasdaq 100 could spark billions in outflows. #Strategy #CryptoStocks https://t.co/ozDjakVUm7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 21, 2025 The index angle matters because passive money is already deeply tied to the name. Funds that track benchmarks and hold Strategy as part of those indices account for nearly $9b of market exposure, and a decision on its index status is expected by Jan. 15. A removal would likely force some of those vehicles to sell, regardless of their view on Bitcoin or the company. Strategy’s Premium Vanishes As Investors Turn Wary Of Leveraged Bitcoin Plays For a business that built its brand on wrapping Bitcoin inside an equity ticker, index risk hits more than daily volumes. Strategy became a favoured tool for institutions that wanted listed market access to Bitcoin but were not ready to hold the token directly, so any loss of benchmark status threatens that role as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto. The company’s rise followed a simple pattern. It sold stock into the market, used the proceeds to buy more Bitcoin, then leaned on each crypto rally to justify fresh issuance and even larger purchases. At the height of that cycle, Strategy’s market value traded far above the worth of its Bitcoin holdings, reflecting a rich premium for its aggressive strategy. That premium has largely evaporated. The firm’s valuation now sits only slightly above the value of its Bitcoin reserves, a sign that investors are no longer willing to pay as much extra for its leveraged play on the asset. For CalPERS and other large funds using listed proxies to tap crypto, the episode is a reminder that Bitcoin exposure packaged in equity form can still deliver sharp drawdowns when sentiment turns.

AllianceDAO founder Qiao Wang recently dropped a bombshell revelation about Layer 1 tokens and their fundamental competitive challenges. His insights explain why these foundational blockchain networks struggle to maintain value in today’s rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Why Are Layer 1 Tokens Losing Their Competitive Edge? Qiao Wang argues that Layer 1 tokens face an existential threat: they lack distinct competitive advantages. Cross-chain bridges have become incredibly user-friendly, allowing developers to migrate between networks with surprising ease. This mobility creates a highly competitive environment where no single chain can maintain dominance for long. The situation becomes more challenging when you consider that launching new chains has never been simpler. Wang emphasizes that switching blockchain ecosystems costs significantly less than migrating between cloud platforms like AWS. This low switching cost fundamentally undermines the long-term value proposition of Layer 1 tokens. How Cross-Chain Technology Changes Everything Cross-chain bridges have revolutionized how applications operate across different blockchain networks. Here’s what makes migration so accessible: Most applications can move between chains without major technical hurdles Only applications with highly complex smart contracts face migration challenges Development tools and frameworks have standardized across multiple chains User experience has improved dramatically across bridge interfaces This interoperability means developers can chase better incentives, lower fees, or improved performance without being locked into a single ecosystem. Consequently, Layer 1 tokens must constantly compete to retain their application base. The Vertical Integration Solution: Chains Owning Their Applications Wang proposes a compelling solution for Layer 1 networks seeking sustainable competitive advantages. He suggests that chains must vertically integrate by directly owning their application layers. This strategy creates natural ecosystem lock-in and strengthens network effects. Several prominent chains have already embraced this approach: Solana has developed strong native applications and ecosystem projects Base leverages its Coinbase integration for built-in user acquisition Hyperliquid focuses on specialized financial applications Tempo builds payment-focused solutions directly into its chain This vertical integration creates stronger moats around Layer 1 tokens, making them more resilient to competitive pressures and migration trends. What Does This Mean for Blockchain Investors? For investors believing in blockchain technology’s long-term growth, Wang suggests focusing on chains that control their application layers. These Layer 1 tokens demonstrate stronger defensive characteristics and sustainable competitive advantages. The traditional model of generic Layer 1 tokens competing purely on technical specifications appears increasingly vulnerable. Instead, chains with strategic vertical integration and owned application ecosystems show greater promise for long-term value retention. Conclusion: The Future of Layer 1 Competition The blockchain landscape is undergoing a fundamental shift. Layer 1 tokens can no longer rely on technical superiority alone. Sustainable competitive advantages now require strategic ecosystem development and application layer control. Chains that successfully implement vertical integration strategies will likely outperform their generic counterparts in the long run. Frequently Asked Questions What are Layer 1 tokens? Layer 1 tokens are the native cryptocurrencies of base blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin. They form the foundation upon which other applications and tokens are built. Why do Layer 1 tokens lack competitive advantages? They face intense competition because cross-chain bridges make migration easy, and launching new chains has become simpler, reducing switching costs for developers and users. What is vertical integration in blockchain? Vertical integration occurs when a blockchain network directly owns or controls applications built on its platform, creating stronger ecosystem lock-in and network effects. Which chains are successfully implementing vertical integration? Solana, Base, Hyperliquid, and Tempo are examples of chains that have adopted vertical integration strategies by developing or controlling key applications within their ecosystems. How does this affect my investment strategy? Focus on Layer 1 tokens with strong vertical integration and owned application ecosystems, as they demonstrate better defensive characteristics against competitive pressures. Are all Layer 1 tokens facing these challenges? While most face similar competitive pressures, chains with unique technological advantages or strong ecosystem development may maintain better competitive positioning. Found this analysis insightful?

South Korean authorities are pointing fingers at the infamous Lazarus Group following a devastating $32.2 million Upbit hack that occurred last Thursday. This security breach raises serious questions about exchange safety and the ongoing threat from state-sponsored hacking collectives. What Exactly Happened in the Upbit Hack? The Upbit hack resulted in the loss of 44.5 billion won, equivalent to $32.2 million in cryptocurrency assets. According to Maeil Business Newspaper, the attack took place on Thursday, with investigators quickly identifying patterns consistent with previous Lazarus Group operations. The timing and methodology suggest this was no ordinary cybercrime but a carefully orchestrated assault. Security experts note that the Upbit hack follows a familiar pattern seen in other North Korean-linked cryptocurrency thefts. However, the scale and precision of this particular attack have raised alarms throughout the crypto community. Exchange officials are working around the clock to strengthen security measures and prevent future breaches. Why is Lazarus Group the Prime Suspect? South Korean authorities didn’t arrive at this conclusion randomly. Several key factors point to Lazarus Group’s involvement in the Upbit hack: Technical fingerprints match previous Lazarus operations Similar malware deployment patterns Consistent with North Korea’s cryptocurrency funding strategy Advanced social engineering techniques used Infrastructure overlaps with known Lazarus command centers The Lazarus Group has a well-documented history of targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, making them the logical suspect for investigators. Their sophisticated methods and state backing make them particularly dangerous adversaries in the digital asset space. How Does This Upbit Hack Affect Crypto Investors? For everyday cryptocurrency users, the Upbit hack serves as a stark reminder about exchange security. While Upbit has assured users that customer funds remain protected through insurance reserves, the incident highlights several critical concerns: Even major exchanges remain vulnerable to sophisticated attacks The importance of using hardware wallets for long-term storage Need for enhanced security measures across all trading platforms Ongoing threat from state-sponsored hacking groups This Upbit hack incident should prompt investors to review their security practices immediately. Consider diversifying where you store assets and always enable two-factor authentication wherever available. What Security Lessons Can We Learn? The recent Upbit hack provides valuable insights for both exchanges and individual users. First, exchanges must implement more robust cold storage solutions and regular security audits. Second, users should never keep large amounts on any single exchange. Third, the crypto industry needs better information sharing about emerging threats. Moreover, this Upbit hack demonstrates that even well-established exchanges can become targets. The Lazarus Group specifically chooses high-value targets, meaning no platform is completely safe from determined attackers. Therefore, continuous security upgrades and user education become essential defenses. Looking Forward: The Future of Exchange Security Following this Upbit hack, we can expect several developments in cryptocurrency security. Exchanges will likely increase their insurance coverage and implement more sophisticated monitoring systems. Regulatory bodies may introduce stricter security requirements for trading platforms. Meanwhile, users will become more conscious about where and how they store their digital assets. The Upbit hack represents more than just a financial loss—it’s a wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. As hacking groups become more sophisticated, security measures must evolve even faster to protect user funds and maintain trust in digital asset ecosystems. Frequently Asked Questions How much was stolen in the Upbit hack? The hackers stole 44.5 billion won, which equals approximately $32.2 million in various cryptocurrencies. Has Upbit recovered any of the stolen funds? As of now, Upbit has not announced any recovery of the stolen funds, but investigations are ongoing. Are user funds safe after this hack? Upbit has stated that customer assets remain protected through their insurance reserves, and no user funds were directly affected. Why do authorities suspect Lazarus Group? Technical evidence, attack patterns, and infrastructure links all point to Lazarus Group’s involvement based on their known methods. What should Upbit users do now? Users should enable all available security features, consider moving large holdings to hardware wallets, and monitor official communications from Upbit. How often do major exchanges get hacked?

55018400,635342,1764295207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55018400.jpeg,Coinbase Wallet Rebalancing Creates False $68B LTH Distribution Signal – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-wallet-rebalancing-creates-false-68b-lth/,"The crypto market is facing a wave of misinterpretation as Coinbase’s large-scale wallet rebalancing, which began on November 22, 2025, continues to distort major on-chain indicators. Many dashboards now display what appears to be an unprecedented $68 billion Long-Term Holder (LTH) “sell” spike — but according to analysts, this is not real distribution. Instead, it’s the direct result of Coinbase transferring coins internally as part of its routine wallet restructuring process. This distinction is critical. Several prominent analysts and market commentators have highlighted massive outflows, huge shifts in LTH supply, and unusual wallet movements, yet many have failed to mention the underlying cause: Coinbase’s internal reshuffling. Without this context, market participants might wrongly conclude that long-term holders are panic-selling at scale, reinforcing fear during an already fragile market environment. These rebalancing events have happened before, but the size of Coinbase’s holdings means even normal internal operations can trigger dramatic spikes in on-chain metrics such as LTH Net Position Change, Exchange Netflow, and Spent Output Age Bands. Coinbase Internal Transfers Distorted Key On-Chain Metrics According to detailed analysis by Axel Adler, Coinbase’s internal migration of approximately 800,000 BTC created one of the largest distortions in on-chain data ever recorded — without a single coin being sold. The exchange executed 286 transactions totaling 798,636 BTC, moving funds from legacy P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash) addresses to modern P2WPKH (SegWit) addresses. This technical reorganization produced an artificial $68 billion “realized profit” spike, misleading many market observers into interpreting it as massive long-term holder distribution. This large UTXO migration disrupted several major on-chain indicators. LTH and STH Supply metrics were temporarily skewed, showing a sharp drop in Long-Term Holder supply and a rise in Short-Term Holder supply — a pattern typically associated with heavy “smart money” selling. In reality, no distribution occurred; Coinbase simply restructured its internal wallets. The distortion also affected LTH Realized Profit/Loss models, which reflected tens of billions in phantom gains, and HODL Waves, where UTXO ages were “reset,” suggesting long-term holders had suddenly spent old coins. Even Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) showed a significant spike, mimicking an “old coin awakening,” though the activity was entirely internal. These disruptions highlight how exchange operations can temporarily break the reliability of on-chain metrics, requiring careful interpretation from analysts and investors. Total Market Rebounds but Remains Under Critical Pressure The Total Crypto Market Cap chart shows a sharp rebound after tagging the $2.88T zone, a level that aligns closely with the 100-week moving average (green), acting as a key structural support in previous cycles. This bounce has pushed total valuation back above the $3T mark, but the broader trend remains fragile after weeks of heavy selling across majors like BTC and ETH. Price structure highlights a clear breakdown from the $3.6T–$3.8T consolidation zone, followed by a fast, impulsive decline—mirroring the speed of corrections seen during 2021 and mid-2022. Despite the latest recovery candle, the market remains below the 50-week moving average (blue), signaling that buyers must regain momentum quickly to avoid deeper downside toward the 200-week moving average near $2T. Volume has surged on recent sell-offs, showing widespread forced selling and capitulation behavior—a pattern consistent with cycle mid-reset phases. The rebound, however, shows reduced sell volume, suggesting exhaustion from bearish participants. To confirm strength, total market cap must reclaim the $3.25T–$3.3T area, which currently acts as the first major resistance. Failure to break above this zone risks further consolidation or a retest of the $2.8T support. For now, the market shows early signs of stabilization, but broader recovery depends on Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its own rebound and restore confidence across altcoins.

This moment of market volatility is a profound inflection point, where the interplay of rising institutional adoption and changing global macroeconomic conditions is converging. Historical Breakout Zones Align With Price Structure Bitcoin is currently sitting at a thrilling crossroads. In an X post, an analyst known as CryptoCrewU has stated that BTC is witnessing the strongest bearish divergence in years, paired with a rare 2-week close below the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) of this bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Flees, But Sharks & Whales Quietly Growing: Data Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently dipping into levels reminiscent of past pivotal moments in 2015, 2018, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2022 bottoms. Meanwhile, the Stoch RSI has yet to cross upwards, hinting at the full extent of the potential move ahead. While fear is at its peak in the market right now, history shows that buying during these market lows has consistently led to significant profits over the past 5 years. “Let data guide you, not emotions,” CryptoCrewU noted. Trader_XO highlighted that since 2015, one pattern has remained remarkably consistent in Bitcoin’s cycle. Historically, whenever breaks below the 50-week Moving Average (MA), it has often signaled a deeper move toward the 200-week MA, or even the 300-week MA. Meanwhile, BTC tends to treat the 200-week MA as a major cycle support area. The price has only dipped below the 300-week MA once in history, and anything trading below the 200-week MA has been relatively short-lived, aligning with the best part of the cycle lows. According to Trader_XO, if the price were to revisit those lower moving average levels, and the broader market context aligns, that area would be viewed as a high-probability buying opportunity, unless this time the move is different. Market Structure Shows Early Signs Of Strength Returning Bitcoin is finally showing signs of strength again. A Full-time crypto teacher, Sykodelic, has pointed out that for the first time since the drop from $116,000, the price has broken above its previous low-time-frame (LTF) range, with a strong push above the 50 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Powers Over $90K as Buyers Suddenly Regain Control of the Trend Since the $116,000 rejection, every time BTC attempts to move into an upper range, it gets rejected and makes new lows. This time, BTC has finally pushed higher. Currently, this is simply an LTF action, but these subtle shifts are exactly what to watch out for when it comes to understanding the nature of trend reversals. A daily close above $87,000 will confirm the breakout of the trend. Sykodelic concluded that moving higher after a drop like that is intricate, and it can take time. Therefore, observe the signs and move accordingly to see how the daily close goes.

The update came after the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Court issued an indefinite worldwide asset freeze on Aria Commodities DMCC and related entities, the first global freeze in the case. Justin Sun continues to campaign for justice The order, issued by the Dubai International Financial Centre Court on October 17, blocks any movement of the disputed funds and applies across jurisdictions. Sun has praised the DIFC Courts and its Digital Economy Court for its “fair and resolute ruling,” while claiming the missing funds are being actively traced around the globe to make a full recovery of all the reserve assets. He wrote: “Justice may be delayed, but it will never be denied.” According to Sun , the priority remains “full recovery and restitution” of TUSD’s reserves. Investigations have been speeding up, with more evidence expected from ongoing probes into Chok, Matthew Brittain (linked to Aria entities), and former TrueCoin executives. Since the freeze order is now active, the case is entering a new phase, and legal actions in areas like Hong Kong, Dubai, the Cayman Islands, and other regions are expected to increase, with more evidence and additional recovery steps underway. How the $456M went missing The origin of the fraud can be traced back to 2020 when Techteryx acquired TUSD, while TrueCoin – its original operator – remained the manager of the reserves. In the year that followed, as well as the subsequent one, TrueCoin, First Digital Trust (FDT), Legacy Trust, and offshore entities linked to Matthew Brittain allegedly joined hands to create forged documents, submit misleading filings, and move reserves out of regulated custody. Those funds were ultimately sent to bank accounts linked to Aria DMCC, a Dubai company owned by Brittain’s spouse, and according to available information, FDT CEO Vincent Chok approved these transfers and directed funds into private accounts in exchange for undisclosed kickbacks. The U.S. SEC later accused TrueCoin of misleading investors about the safety of TUSD’s reserves, which exposed deeper operational issues. Despite the drama, TUSD has shown great strength, remaining pegged near $1; however, this is mostly thanks to Sun’s involvement and quarantined reserves. The famous crypto thought leader in April accused the FDT and related parties of embezzling the funds and has worked hard to prevent TUSD’s collapse by protecting holders, even going as far as to support Techteryx with a loan of around $450 million as reported by Cryptopolitan. FDT has denied his claims, and CEO Chok claims there is no evidence to back it up while announcing plans for legal action against Sun. Despite the drama, Sun is unbothered and is more than willing to contend in court, framing his actions as safeguarding the broader crypto ecosystem.

The largest cryptocurrency traded in a tight band between about $90,600 and $91,400 after touching roughly $91,800 in the past 24 hours. A global equity gauge was little changed, yet still on track for its best week since June as traders leaned into the idea that the Federal Reserve is finally ready to start cutting interest rates. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $90,868, down 0.2% Ether : $3,001, down 1.6% XRP : $2.17, down 2.2% Total crypto market cap: $3.18 trillion, down 0.9% China Remains In Focus After JPMorgan Turns Overweight On The Market Asian equities opened mixed. Indexes in South Korea and Japan slipped at the open, while Australia edged higher in thin, holiday-affected trading after the US Thanksgiving break. Chinese shares stayed in focus after JPMorgan lifted its view on the market to overweight, arguing that the potential upside next year now outweighs the risk of further losses, even as stress at developers such as China Vanke kept property names under pressure. JPMorgan has raised its recommendation for China’s stocks to “overweight,” stating that the prospect of large gains next year now outweighs the risk of significant losses https://t.co/a9n8bgCenA — Bloomberg (@business) November 27, 2025 Across assets, the week’s tone has been driven by Fed expectations. Futures markets are now pricing in roughly an 80% to 85% chance of a quarter-point cut next month and are leaning toward three reductions by the end of 2026. That shift has helped global stocks recover most of their November losses, which had been driven by worries that richly valued AI names were flashing bubble warnings. In bonds, a sharp rally in Treasuries has cooled. The 10-year yield held around 4% after stronger-than-expected US labour market data interrupted the slide. Jobs Data And Fed Signals Strengthen Case For A December Cut Yields had been falling since late last week after delayed September jobs figures painted a mixed picture, then dropped further when New York Fed President John Williams said he saw room for a rate cut in the near term as the labour market softened. Trading volumes have been thinner than usual. A holiday-shortened week and the earlier 43-day US government shutdown, which left official data releases badly delayed, have pushed investors to lean more on Fed speakers for guidance. Recent comments from officials including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Governor Christopher Waller have reinforced expectations for a December move. ETF Flows Slow But Stay Positive With BlackRock Still Dominant On the crypto side, US spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to pull in money, although at a slower pace than during the early-year surge. Data from SoSoValue showed daily total net inflows of about $21.m on Nov. 26, bringing cumulative net inflows to roughly $57.6b. Total trading value for the day reached about $4.6b, with net assets across the ETF complex at around $117.7b, equal to about 6.6% of Bitcoin’s market value. Flows again centred on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, which saw roughly $42.8m in net inflows for the day and now holds about $69.9b in assets. Fidelity’s FBTC posted an outflow of about $33.3m, while Grayscale’s converted GBTC vehicle recorded a modest $5.6m inflow but still shows cumulative net outflows of about $25b since spot ETFs launched. Smaller products from Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, VanEck and others were broadly flat on the day, with only single digit millions of fresh money moving in. Those numbers show the significant shift in structural demand toward regulated vehicles. IBIT alone accounts for roughly 3.9% of the Bitcoin market, according to the SoSoValue dashboard, while the broader ETF suite now represents a meaningful slice of circulating supply. For traders in Asia waking up to a slightly softer crypto board and wobbling local equities, the combination of heavy ETF ownership and rising Fed cut odds is likely to set the tone into the year-end, even if price action in both Bitcoin and stocks looks more cautious after an explosive week.

Binance has just dropped important news that could impact your trading strategy. The world’s largest crypto exchange announced it will Binance delist margin trading pairs from its platform, affecting 18 different trading combinations. This move signals significant changes coming to the margin trading landscape. Which Margin Trading Pairs Are Being Removed? Binance confirmed the Binance delist margin trading pairs action will take place on December 4 at 6:00 a.m. UTC. The exchange is removing both cross margin and isolated margin pairs, primarily affecting Bitcoin trading pairs. This decision reflects the platform’s ongoing evaluation of trading pair performance and liquidity requirements. The affected pairs include some well-known cryptocurrencies. For cross margin trading, the following pairs will be delisted: WAXP/BTC SXP/BTC ONT/BTC ID/BTC ZRX/BTC CHR/BTC ENJ/BTC What Does This Mean for Isolated Margin Traders? Isolated margin traders face even more changes with the Binance delist margin trading pairs announcement. The platform will remove these isolated margin pairs: WAXP/BTC ONG/BTC POWR/BTC SXP/BTC ONT/BTC ID/BTC AGLD/BTC ZRX/BTC CHR/BTC ENJ/BTC UMA/BTC Why Is Binance Delisting These Trading Pairs? Exchanges regularly review their trading pairs to ensure optimal market conditions. The decision to Binance delist margin trading pairs typically stems from several factors including low trading volume, liquidity concerns, or strategic repositioning. This helps maintain healthy markets and protects traders from potential slippage issues. Moreover, such delistings often indicate the exchange’s focus on pairs with stronger performance metrics. Traders should view this as part of normal market evolution rather than alarm. However, it does require immediate attention to adjust trading strategies accordingly. What Should Affected Traders Do Immediately? If you currently hold positions in any of the affected Binance delist margin trading pairs , take these crucial steps: Close all open positions before December 4 deadline Transfer funds to other trading pairs or wallets Update your trading bots and automated strategies Monitor official Binance announcements for updates Remember, failing to close positions before delisting could result in automatic liquidation by the exchange. Therefore, proactive management is essential to protect your investments. How Will This Impact the Crypto Market? The Binance delist margin trading pairs decision may create temporary price volatility for the affected cryptocurrencies. However, experienced traders understand that such routine adjustments are normal in evolving markets. The long-term impact depends on each project’s fundamentals and community support. Interestingly, this move might redirect trading volume to other pairs, potentially benefiting remaining margin trading options on the platform. It also demonstrates Binance’s commitment to maintaining high-quality trading environments for its users. Final Thoughts: Navigating Exchange Changes Successfully The announcement to Binance delist margin trading pairs serves as an important reminder for all cryptocurrency traders. Staying informed about exchange updates and adapting quickly to changes separates successful traders from the rest. While such news might seem concerning initially, it represents the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. Always maintain diversified trading strategies and stay updated with official exchange communications. This approach ensures you can navigate market changes effectively while protecting your investment portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions What happens if I don’t close my positions before delisting? Binance will automatically close any remaining positions in the affected pairs at the time of delisting. This could result in unexpected losses, so we strongly recommend closing positions manually. Will these cryptocurrencies still be available for spot trading? Yes, most of these cryptocurrencies will remain available for spot trading. The delisting only affects margin trading pairs against Bitcoin. Can these pairs be relisted in the future? While possible, there’s no guarantee. Exchanges may relist pairs if trading conditions improve significantly, but traders should not count on this happening. How often does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance regularly reviews and adjusts its trading pairs, typically making such announcements several times per year as market conditions evolve. Should I be worried about other pairs being delisted? Not necessarily. This is a normal part of exchange operations. However, always monitor official announcements and maintain diversified trading strategies. Where can I get official updates about such changes? Always check Binance’s official website and announcement channels for the most accurate and timely information about platform changes.

Recent data reveals a stunning development: Binance whale inflows have skyrocketed to $7.5 billion over the past month, marking the highest level we’ve seen in an entire year. This massive movement of funds signals important changes in market sentiment that every crypto investor should understand. What Do These Massive Binance Whale Inflows Really Mean? According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, these substantial Binance whale inflows tell us crucial information about market dynamics. When large-scale holders transfer their assets to Binance, they’re typically preparing for significant trading activity. The exchange serves as a major liquidity provider, making it the go-to platform for whales during periods of market uncertainty. Here’s why this matters right now: Large holders move funds to exchanges when expecting price volatility Binance provides the liquidity needed for major trades Current patterns mirror March’s high-volatility period Selling pressure may not have stabilized yet How Does This Compare to Previous Market Cycles? The current surge in Binance whale inflows closely resembles the pattern we observed last March. During that period, Bitcoin experienced dramatic price swings, dropping from around $102,000 to the low $70,000s. This historical parallel suggests we might be entering another phase of significant market turbulence. Market analysts note that when whales accumulate this much exchange-bound capital, it often precedes major price movements. The $7.5 billion in Binance whale inflows represents one of the largest capital movements we’ve witnessed, indicating that institutional and large retail players are positioning themselves for potential market shifts. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For Next? Understanding these Binance whale inflows provides valuable insights for making informed investment decisions. The data suggests that selling pressure hasn’t yet stabilized, meaning we could see continued volatility in the coming weeks. However, it’s important to remember that whale activity doesn’t always predict market direction with absolute certainty. Key indicators to monitor include: Daily exchange inflow volumes Bitcoin price support levels Overall market sentiment indicators Regulatory developments affecting major exchanges Why This Matters for Your Crypto Portfolio The unprecedented scale of these Binance whale inflows serves as a crucial warning signal for all market participants. While some investors might see this as a buying opportunity, others may interpret it as a sign to exercise caution. The truth likely lies somewhere in between – this data emphasizes the importance of risk management and diversified positioning. Remember that whale activity represents just one piece of the market puzzle. Successful crypto investing requires considering multiple factors, including technical analysis, fundamental developments, and broader economic conditions. The current Binance whale inflows should inform your strategy, not dictate it entirely. Frequently Asked Questions What are whale inflows in cryptocurrency? Whale inflows refer to large transfers of cryptocurrency from private wallets to exchange wallets, typically executed by major holders (whales) preparing for significant trading activity. Why do whales move funds to Binance specifically? Binance offers superior liquidity and trading volume compared to most other exchanges, making it the preferred platform for large-scale traders executing substantial orders. Does increased whale activity always mean price will drop? Not necessarily. While whale inflows often precede selling pressure, they can also indicate accumulation or preparation for major purchases. Context and additional market data are crucial for accurate interpretation. How reliable is whale activity as a market indicator? Whale movements provide valuable insights but should be considered alongside other indicators like trading volume, market sentiment, and technical analysis patterns for comprehensive market understanding. What time frame do these Binance whale inflows cover? The reported $7.5 billion in whale inflows occurred over the past month, representing the highest monthly inflow volume recorded in the past year. Can retail investors benefit from monitoring whale activity? Yes, understanding whale movements helps retail investors gauge market sentiment and potential price directions, though it should inform rather than replace comprehensive investment research.

Europe’s police-intelligence agency is about to elect Giuseppe Lopez, a senior Italian law enforcement officer, to lead its financial crime division, as the continent intensifies efforts to combat illicit cross‑border money flows. Lopez, a colonel in Italy’s Guardia di Finanza, the force specializing in financial and economic crimes, is expected to head Europol ’s European Financial and Economic Crime Centre (EFECC), sources familiar with the matter said. While an official announcement could come as early as next month, the appointment has not yet been formally confirmed. Increasing cases of money laundering call for the need for relevant authorities to act Analysts have urged Europe to enhance its defenses against money laundering activities, as cases such as cross-border fraud, organized crime , and evading sanctions are occurring more frequently, surpassing the ability of national enforcement agencies to handle the situation. Additionally, sources noted that prosecutors are facing hardship in dealing with significant amounts of cryptocurrency that criminal organizations use to launder money and other assets. An example of this scenario was recently highlighted when the US successfully confiscated approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin after uncovering an alleged extensive cyber fraud operation that was carried out in Cambodia. Meanwhile, regarding the appointment for the position of Head of Europol’s European Financial Crime Centre, Claire Georges, a representative for Europol, sent an email stating that the official confirmation for the appointment has not been made yet. Notably, the role of the EFECC is to help member countries in tracking financial movements, identifying who truly benefits from those funds and aiding in the seizure of assets when money crosses borders. Since its inception in 2020, the EFECC has focused on coordinating complex international cases and supporting national investigations that may encounter delays at borders. In April 2022, EFECC initiated and launched Operation Oscar, an initiative aimed at tracking and seizing assets of individuals and entities sanctioned in relation to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to reports so far, the project has managed to freeze and seize assets worth more than €2 billion — around $2.3 billion — associated with the enforcement of such sanctions. On the other hand, Europol, located in the Netherlands, acts as the law enforcement agency for the EU. It also provides intelligence and operational support to police forces across the 27 member countries on organized crime, cybercrime, and terrorism. However, reports continue to highlight the increasing instances of money laundering in the region. The US confirms the largest forfeiture case in history Last month, US officials charged a Chinese-born Cambodian tycoon and the founder of the multinational conglomerate Prince Holding Group, Chen Zhi, with running a major cyber fraud operation. This led to the seizure of Bitcoin valued at approximately $15 billion, the largest forfeiture case to date. The announcement was made public after federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, accused the 38-year-old head of Prince Group of being involved in a wire fraud conspiracy and managing a money laundering scheme. His operation reportedly employed forced labor in Cambodia to emotionally manipulate thousands of victims in the US and globally. During this activity, they would inflate these victims’ accounts before draining them using a method called “ pig butchering .” The push to clamp down on abuse and introduce stronger leadership comes as criminals have increasingly used digital assets to mask illicit proceeds. Crypto’s swift, cross-border characteristics, combined with its anonymity, make it an attractive option for laundering.

Leadership changes in cryptocurrency projects often create short-term uncertainty, but they can also open doors to new opportunities.

Understanding the context behind this Solar project resignation requires examining the broader challenges facing blockchain initiatives.

The Solar project resignation creates an opportunity for fresh leadership and potentially new strategic directions. However, it also raises questions about: Project continuity and development roadmap Community confidence and token stability Potential changes in project governance Future innovation capabilities Key Takeaways from the Solar Project Leadership Change This Solar project resignation serves as an important case study for the cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates how external factors and regulatory environments can significantly impact blockchain project leadership and development trajectories. The situation highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing innovation with compliance in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Nayiem Willems resign from the Solar project? Willems cited limited access to public utilities and requirements for prior approval on innovation initiatives as primary reasons for his departure. How will this resignation affect SXP token value? Leadership changes often create short-term uncertainty, but long-term impact depends on how smoothly the transition occurs and the project’s future direction. Who will replace Nayiem Willems as project head? The Solar project team has not yet announced a replacement, but such announcements typically follow within days or weeks of a resignation.

The world’s largest crypto surged as much as 4% in 24 hours, briefly touching $91,200, boosted by renewed market optimism, improving liquidity, and growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Related Reading: The 250% Price Surge That Will Send Bitcoin To $300,000 However, despite the rebound, analysts warn that the latest upswing may remain structurally fragile. Risk Appetite Returns as BTC Leads Market Rebound After weeks of volatility, Bitcoin’s latest rise mirrors a broader recovery across the crypto market. A wave of buying pushed Ethereum back above $3,000, while major altcoins, including XRP, BNB, Solana, Cardano, Tron, and Dogecoin, logged gains of over 4%. Market analysts attribute the rally largely to improving macro sentiment. Traders are now pricing in an 85% chance of a Fed rate cut, up from just 44% a week earlier. Lower interest rates typically boost demand for risk assets, including crypto. Additionally, a massive 1.8 million BTC withdrawal from exchanges overnight sparked speculation of increased institutional accumulation. Regardless, caution lingers. The crypto Fear & Greed Index sits deep in “Extreme Fear,” and despite rising prices, market conviction remains thin. As CoinSwitch noted, BTC’s jump was fueled partly by a short squeeze, not purely organic demand. Analysts Warn of Resistance Ahead Even with the recent improvement, several analysts believe Bitcoin’s upside remains limited in the near term. Resistance between $92,000 and $95,000 is expected to be a key test for bulls. Ed Engel of Compass Point notes that BTC’s rebound from the $82,000 Real Market Average suggests early signs of capitulation but not a confirmed bottom. Whale wallets holding 10–10,000 BTC have continued reducing their holdings for six straight weeks, an ongoing bearish indicator. Meanwhile, institutional desks are reportedly trimming exposure into year-end, adding more supply to the market. Some traders expect Bitcoin to retest $82,000 or even dip below $80,000 if momentum fades. Others believe a strong break above $95,000, supported by retail demand, could renew bullish structure and open the path toward fresh highs. A Market at a Crossroads Despite improved liquidity and rebounding prices, Bitcoin’s recovery remains fragile. Sentiment is mixed, leveraged positions are still unwinding, and macro data continues to send conflicting signals. For now, BTC appears stuck between growing optimism and persistent skepticism.

The cryptocurrency landscape is shifting dramatically as decentralized exchanges capture unprecedented market share. This memecoin trading frenzy is reshaping how investors interact with digital assets. Why Is Memecoin Trading Driving DEX Growth? The relationship between memecoin trading and decentralized exchange adoption is stronger than ever. According to recent data from CoinGecko, DEXs achieved a remarkable 37.4% share of total spot trading volume in June. This represents an all-time high for decentralized platforms. Memecoin trading typically involves: Quick entry and exit strategies Lower transaction amounts Community-driven momentum Speculative short-term positions What Makes DEXs Perfect for Memecoin Trading? Decentralized exchanges offer several advantages that align perfectly with memecoin trading behavior. Users enjoy immediate access to new tokens without lengthy verification processes. The permissionless nature of DEXs means traders can jump into emerging memecoin opportunities instantly. Platforms like PancakeSwap demonstrated this perfectly. Their integration with Binance Alpha created a surge in trading volume that contributed significantly to the overall DEX growth. This memecoin trading activity shows no signs of slowing down. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The rise in memecoin trading volume on DEXs indicates a fundamental shift in investor preferences. Traders are increasingly comfortable with decentralized platforms for their speculative activities. This trend suggests that DEXs are becoming mainstream trading venues rather than niche products. However, investors should remember that memecoin trading carries substantial risks. The volatile nature of these assets means prices can swing dramatically within short periods. Always conduct thorough research before participating in any memecoin trading activity. What Does the Future Hold for Memecoin Trading? The current memecoin trading boom appears to be more than just a temporary phenomenon. As DEX technology improves and user experience enhances, we can expect continued growth in decentralized trading volumes. The convenience and accessibility of DEXs make them ideal for the fast-paced world of memecoin trading. Looking ahead, the memecoin trading landscape will likely evolve with: Improved liquidity mechanisms Enhanced security features Better user interfaces Cross-chain compatibility Conclusion: The New Era of Digital Asset Trading The memecoin trading revolution has fundamentally altered the cryptocurrency exchange landscape. DEXs have proven they can compete with centralized counterparts during periods of high speculative activity. As more traders discover the benefits of decentralized platforms, the memecoin trading phenomenon will continue driving innovation across the entire crypto ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is memecoin trading? Memecoin trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrency tokens that originated from internet memes or community jokes. These assets often experience extreme volatility and rely heavily on social media trends. Why are DEXs better for memecoin trading? DEXs offer instant access, no KYC requirements, and direct wallet-to-wallet transactions. This makes them ideal for the fast-paced nature of memecoin trading where timing is crucial. How risky is memecoin trading? Memecoin trading carries high risk due to extreme price volatility, potential liquidity issues, and reliance on social sentiment. Investors should only risk capital they can afford to lose completely. Can beginners participate in memecoin trading? Yes, but beginners should start with small amounts and thoroughly research each project. Understanding basic DEX functionality and wallet security is essential before beginning memecoin trading. What was PancakeSwap’s role in DEX growth? PancakeSwap’s integration with Binance Alpha created significant trading volume increases, demonstrating how strategic partnerships can boost DEX adoption and memecoin trading activity. Will memecoin trading continue growing? While specific tokens may rise and fall, the overall trend of memecoin trading appears sustainable as long as social media communities continue driving interest in these assets.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Liquidity Ratio Has Plunged Recently In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about how liquidity in the Bitcoin market has changed following the recent downturn. Glassnode has gauged the “liquidity” using the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, an on-chain metric that measures the ratio between the profit and loss that BTC investors are realizing through their transactions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst Current demand momentum can be tracked using a version of this indicator that specifically tracks the profitability of the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. As the below chart shows, the STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio was at relatively high levels earlier, but since early October, its value has plummeted. With a value of just 0.07, the indicator is now sitting deep inside the loss region, a sign that the recent Bitcoin buyers have overwhelmingly been capitulating at a loss. “Such overwhelming loss dominance confirms that liquidity has evaporated, especially after the heavy demand absorption seen in Q2–Q3 2025 as long-term holders increased their spending,” explained the analytics firm. The metric fell to similar lows back in Q1 2022, but so far, market weakness hasn’t been as prolonged. The report noted that if the ratio continues to be depressed, market conditions could mirror those from back then. While short-term demand momentum has collapsed, the same hasn’t been true for long-term liquidity, at least not yet. Long-term momentum can be measured using the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio of the long-term holders (LTHs), representing the more resolute section of the market (holding time greater than 155 days). From the above chart, it’s visible that the 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Bitcoin LTH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has witnessed a sharp decline as BTC has crashed. Despite the drop, however, the metric’s value is still 408, implying LTHs are realizing, on average, a profit that’s 408 times the loss. This means that the long-term liquidity is still healthy compared to Q1 2022, or even the major bottom formations from the current cycle. Glassnode warned, however, “if liquidity continues to fade and this ratio compresses toward 10x or lower, the probability of transitioning into a deeper bear market becomes difficult to ignore.” Related Reading: XRP Rebounds From Channel Bottom, Analyst Says $2.60 Could Be Next It now remains to be seen how the LTH Realized Profit/Loss will change for Bitcoin in the near future, and if liquidity will see a further squeeze.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance has identified dollar-pegged stablecoins as a major concern that could significantly impact the South Korean won’s stability in global markets. Why Is the Stablecoin Impact on Won So Concerning? Deputy Prime Minister Koo Yoon-cheol will lead crucial discussions with international finance experts on December 1st. The government has discovered that increased usage of dollar-based stablecoins in cross-border payments could weaken the won and drive up exchange rates. This stablecoin impact on won represents a new challenge for traditional financial regulators. The ministry’s research indicates that stablecoins contribute substantially to foreign exchange market volatility. As more businesses and individuals use dollar-pegged digital assets for international transactions, the demand for actual US dollars might decrease while still affecting currency values. What Specific Dangers Does This Stablecoin Trend Pose? Government analysts have identified several key risks from the growing stablecoin impact on won: Reduced demand for physical won in international trade Increased pressure on won-dollar exchange rates Potential capital flight through digital channels Weakened control over monetary policy effectiveness The new government panel will also examine Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) considerations alongside foreign exchange market dynamics. This comprehensive approach shows how seriously officials are taking the stablecoin impact on won stability. How Will South Korea Address This Challenge? The December 1st meeting represents the inaugural session of a specialized government panel created specifically to monitor digital currency developments. This proactive stance demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to understanding and managing the stablecoin impact on won before it becomes unmanageable. Financial experts suggest several measures might emerge from these discussions: Enhanced monitoring of stablecoin transaction volumes Potential regulatory frameworks for cross-border crypto payments Coordination with international financial organizations Public education about currency stability risks What Does This Mean for Global Cryptocurrency Regulation? South Korea’s attention to stablecoin impact on won sets an important precedent for other nations. As one of Asia’s most technologically advanced economies, their approach could influence how other countries address similar concerns. The stablecoin impact on won discussion highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance and digital assets. This development comes as many nations grapple with balancing innovation and financial stability. The stablecoin impact on won analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers worldwide facing similar challenges with digital currency integration. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Digital Currency Regulation South Korea’s decisive action to examine the stablecoin impact on won marks a critical turning point in global finance. As traditional financial systems increasingly intersect with digital assets, understanding these connections becomes essential for maintaining economic stability. The outcomes of these discussions could shape cryptocurrency regulation for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are dollar-pegged stablecoins? Dollar-pegged stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a consistent value equal to one US dollar, typically backed by dollar reserves or algorithms. Why is South Korea particularly concerned about stablecoins? South Korea maintains significant international trade and has experienced currency volatility before, making authorities especially vigilant about potential threats to the won’s stability. How could stablecoins affect the won-dollar exchange rate? If businesses use dollar stablecoins instead of converting won to dollars, it could reduce demand for physical dollars while still creating dollar-based transaction pressure. When will the government panel make its recommendations? The first meeting occurs December 1st, with initial findings expected in early 2024, though immediate regulatory actions could come sooner if urgent risks are identified. Could this lead to stablecoin restrictions in South Korea? While complete restrictions seem unlikely, enhanced monitoring and specific usage regulations are probable outcomes from these discussions. How are other countries responding to similar concerns? Several nations are studying stablecoin impacts, but South Korea’s formal government panel approach represents one of the most structured responses to date.

The latest Bitcoin on-chain data paints a concerning picture that every crypto enthusiast needs to understand. But here’s the crucial question: what does this mean for your portfolio? What Exactly is Bitcoin On-Chain Data Telling Us? According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, key Bitcoin on-chain indicators have turned bearish. These metrics track actual blockchain activity rather than just price movements. They provide a transparent window into network health and investor behavior. The current Bitcoin on-chain data reveals several worrying trends: Reduced network activity and transaction volume Declining whale accumulation patterns Increased movement to exchanges suggesting selling pressure This comprehensive Bitcoin on-chain data analysis suggests the market lacks the fundamental strength for sustained upward momentum without external support. Why Liquidity Becomes the Deciding Factor Here’s where the story gets interesting. Despite the bearish Bitcoin on-chain data, there’s a potential lifeline. Ki Young Ju emphasized that any significant price recovery will likely depend on macroeconomic liquidity conditions. Think of liquidity as the fuel that drives market movements. When central banks inject money into the economy, that capital often finds its way into risk assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, monitoring Federal Reserve policies and global money supply becomes crucial for crypto investors. How Should Investors Interpret This Bitcoin On-Chain Data? Understanding Bitcoin on-chain data requires looking beyond surface-level indicators. While the current signals appear bearish, they don’t necessarily predict immediate price crashes. Instead, they highlight underlying weakness that needs addressing. Here’s what smart investors should watch: Macroeconomic developments – Federal Reserve announcements and policy changes Institutional flows – ETF movements and corporate buying patterns Network recovery signs – Improvements in the Bitcoin on-chain data metrics This approach helps you make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions to price swings. Actionable Insights From the Bearish Bitcoin On-Chain Data Facing bearish Bitcoin on-chain data doesn’t mean you should panic sell. Instead, consider these strategic moves: Dollar-cost average during periods of weakness Set clear entry and exit points based on your risk tolerance Diversify your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin Keep cash reserves for potential buying opportunities Remember that Bitcoin on-chain data provides context, not certainty. Market conditions can change rapidly with shifting macroeconomic winds. The Bottom Line: Patience and Perspective Pay Off The current Bitcoin on-chain data delivers a clear message: proceed with caution but maintain perspective. While short-term headwinds exist, the long-term Bitcoin narrative remains intact. The key differentiator will be liquidity conditions and how quickly fundamental network strength returns. Successful investors use data like this Bitcoin on-chain analysis to inform their strategy, not dictate panic decisions. By understanding both the technical and fundamental factors at play, you position yourself for smarter investment choices regardless of market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What makes Bitcoin on-chain data bearish? Bearish Bitcoin on-chain data typically shows declining network activity, reduced transaction volumes, increased exchange inflows, and weakening accumulation patterns among large holders.

The Alpine nation, known for its robust financial sector, will delay implementing the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) until at least 2027. This unexpected move raises crucial questions about the future of international crypto taxation and regulatory coordination. Why is Switzerland delaying crypto tax data sharing? Switzerland faces a significant hurdle in implementing the CARF framework. While the country plans to legislate the rules by January 2026, practical execution faces delays. The primary challenge involves selecting partner countries for data exchange. Currently, 75 nations are working to adopt CARF, but Switzerland needs reliable partners to share crypto tax information effectively. The suspension in partnership discussions creates a complex situation. Switzerland must ensure that any crypto tax data sharing agreements protect national interests while meeting international standards. This balancing act requires careful negotiation and thorough due diligence on potential partner countries. What does CARF mean for global crypto taxation? The Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework represents a major step toward international tax transparency. CARF aims to: Standardize reporting requirements across borders Prevent tax evasion through cryptocurrency assets Create a unified approach to crypto taxation Enable automatic exchange of information between countries However, Switzerland’s delay highlights the practical challenges of implementing such a comprehensive system. The framework requires robust technical infrastructure and legal agreements that many nations are still developing. How are other countries approaching crypto tax data sharing? While Switzerland postpones its crypto tax data sharing implementation, other nations are moving forward at different paces. Brazil and the United States are currently reviewing their regulatory approaches. This creates a patchwork of implementation timelines that could complicate international compliance for crypto businesses and investors. The global landscape for crypto tax data sharing remains fragmented. Some countries are pushing for rapid adoption, while others, like Switzerland, are taking a more measured approach. This variation underscores the need for coordinated international effort to create effective crypto taxation systems. What are the implications for cryptocurrency investors? The delay in Switzerland’s crypto tax data sharing implementation provides temporary relief for some investors. However, it’s crucial to understand that this is merely a postponement, not a cancellation. Investors should use this extra time to: Review their cryptocurrency portfolio documentation Understand upcoming reporting requirements Consult with tax professionals about compliance Monitor developments in other jurisdictions Ultimately, the trend toward greater transparency in crypto tax data sharing appears inevitable. Switzerland’s delay simply provides more preparation time for all stakeholders involved. What’s next for international crypto tax cooperation? The path forward for global crypto tax data sharing requires careful navigation. Switzerland’s experience demonstrates that technical implementation often proves more challenging than policy creation. The coming years will likely see: Continued negotiations between nations Refinement of technical standards Gradual alignment of implementation timelines Ongoing adjustments to address emerging challenges While Switzerland’s delay might seem like a setback, it actually represents a pragmatic approach to ensuring the system works effectively when implemented. Proper crypto tax data sharing requires reliable infrastructure and trustworthy partnerships. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Switzerland delay crypto tax data sharing until 2027? Switzerland postponed implementation due to suspended discussions about selecting partner countries for data exchange. The country needs reliable partners to ensure effective and secure information sharing. What is CARF in cryptocurrency taxation? CARF stands for Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, an OECD initiative that standardizes how countries report and share cryptocurrency tax information internationally. Will other countries follow Switzerland’s delay? Some nations might reconsider their timelines, but most of the 75 countries adopting CARF continue with their implementation plans. Each country faces unique challenges in establishing crypto tax data sharing systems. How does this affect individual cryptocurrency investors? Investors gain additional time to prepare for reporting requirements, but should still maintain proper records and consult tax professionals about upcoming obligations. What happens if countries don’t implement CARF? Nations that fail to implement international standards risk being excluded from global financial networks and facing pressure from other countries seeking tax transparency. Can Switzerland change its mind and implement earlier? Yes, if partnership discussions resume successfully, Switzerland could potentially implement crypto tax data sharing before 2027, though this appears unlikely given current circumstances.

Onchain analytics firm Arkham first flagged the move, noting “VITALIK JUST SENT $2.9M $ETH TO RAILGUN. Vitalik holds over $700 MILLION of ETH, and just sent $2.9M into Railgun. What is he cooking?” VITALIK JUST SENT $2.9M $ETH TO RAILGUN Vitalik holds over $700 MILLION of ETH, and just sent $2.9M into Railgun. What is he cooking? pic.twitter.com/2HvDFRDqi2 — Arkham (@arkham) November 26, 2025 Buterin Backs SimpleX And Session Shortly after, Buterin confirmed the donations from his vitalik.eth account and framed them explicitly as a bet on the next frontier of privacy: permissionless and metadata-hardened messaging. “Encrypted messaging, like @signalapp, is critical for preserving our digital privacy,” he wrote. “Two important next steps for the space are (i) permissionless account creation and (ii) metadata privacy.” He then named Session and SimpleX as “two messaging apps pushing these directions forward.” Buterin specified that he had “donated 128 ETH to each” project, providing their official websites for anyone wishing to “follow on,” and then pivoted from philanthropy to adoption: “But also, actually download and use them!” The transactions to SimpleX and Session were executed via Railgun, a zero-knowledge privacy system on Ethereum that obscures the sender, recipient, token type and amount when interacting with smart contracts and DeFi protocols. While Buterin has used Railgun and other privacy-preserving systems repeatedly over the past two years, he has often explained that such transfers typically represent “some donation to a charitable, non-profit, or other project,” rather than personal cash-outs.The latest pattern fits that narrative: funds routed into Railgun and then out to privacy-focused infrastructure and applications, this time in the messaging domain. In his post, Buterin positions encrypted messengers as a crucial layer in the broader privacy stack alongside financial anonymity. He explicitly ties the importance of Signal-style end-to-end encryption to new requirements that go beyond content secrecy: “permissionless account creation” and “metadata privacy.” The first is about removing reliance on centralized, real-world identifiers such as phone numbers or email addresses in order to create an account. The second targets the far less visible but equally revealing exhaust of digital communication: who talks to whom, when, and from where. Why The Ethereum Founder Supports Both Projects Both SimpleX and Session are trying to address those problems in ways that diverge sharply from the mainstream model of phone-number-based, cloud-synced messengers. SimpleX’s own documentation emphasizes “complete privacy of your identity, profile, contacts and metadata,” stressing that the platform “has no identifiers assigned to the users – not even random numbers.” Instead, users establish connections via QR codes or links, and communication routing is designed so that the service itself cannot reconstruct the social graph. Session, originally forked from Signal but rebuilt around onion routing and decentralized service nodes, is pushing a similar line: no phone numbers, Tor-like network-level obfuscation, and attention to metadata minimization. Buterin is clear that his endorsement is not a claim that these apps are already finished products. “Neither of the two are perfect pieces of software, they have a way to go to get to truly optimal user experience and security,” he cautioned. He then sketched the core engineering problems that still need to be solved if “strong metadata privacy” is to coexist with the kind of convenience users now expect from mainstream messengers. “Strong metadata privacy requires decentralization, decentralization is hard, users expecting multi-device support makes everything harder,” he wrote. He also flagged Sybil and denial-of-service resistance as a still-open design space: developers must harden “both in the message routing network and on the user side (without forcing phone number dependence).” The latest donations also underline how Buterin increasingly uses his personal holdings to nudge the ecosystem toward specific priorities: privacy-preserving DeFi, open-source infrastructure, and now, metadata-resistant communication tools. In this case, he explicitly calls for more developer attention: “These problems need more eyes on them. I wish all teams working on these important problems best of luck.” At press time, Ethereum (ETH) traded at $3,007.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ether|ethereum news|ethereum price|vitalik buterin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|ARKM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-28 04:00:26

What The 0% Tax Means Under the new scheme, individual investors who trade crypto through SEC-licensed platforms don’t pay personal income tax on any gains. The exemption applies only if the trade is done on a local approved exchange, broker, or dealer. FACT: THAILAND NOW OFFERS 0% CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON #BITCOIN TRADED ON NATIONAL EXCHANGES GLOBAL GAME THEORY AT WORK ✨ pic.twitter.com/8rf21xJxKT — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) November 26, 2025 Regular income tax rules apply to the same type of income for taxpayers who participate in foreign/unlicensed exchange activity, as well as those who generate crypto income from mining, staking and/or airdrops. The publication of this regulation in the Royal Gazette on September 5th 2025 makes it official and enforceable by law. Reaction to this regulation was also positive from both officials and investors: an official statement indicates the primary purpose of creating this regulation was to provide incentives for current and future traders to use local regulated exchanges as opposed to using foreign/unregulated exchanges. They hope this will strengthen Thailand’s financial system and bring more transparency into crypto trades. Some analysts expect the policy to draw both local and international interest in Thailand’s licensed exchanges. The government seems to try making its digital-asset sector more competitive while ensuring regulatory compliance. What Investors Should Know To benefit from 0% tax, trades must go through valid, licensed channels. Gains from outside platforms or unapproved services don’t qualify. Accurate records of purchase and sale, including dates and exchange receipts, are vital to prove eligibility if asked by tax authorities.

It makes compliant crypto trading cheaper — maybe more attractive — while drawing a clearer line between regulated and unregulated channels.

COIN is expanding recurring revenue through stablecoins and subscriptions while maintaining strong adjusted EBITDA margins around 45%. Trading revenue remains volatile and dependent on altcoins and retail activity, with competition and interest rate risk still present. I upgrade COIN to neutral, seeing a floor at current prices and potential upside if shares dip below $200, reflecting a more attractive valuation. As we battle year-end volatility, one asset that has endured even sharper pessimism than stocks is Bitcoin. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is down ~30% from peaks above $125k. A number of factors are behind the drop, but one of the principal arguments is that bears are fearing that Bitcoin prices have tended to peak in four-year cycles , and we're approaching the end of the current bull run. Bitcoin's sharp fall has taken down everything else in the crypto industry as well, including the second-largest exchange in the U.S., Coinbase ( COIN ). Shares of Coinbase are now down nearly 40% from July peaks near $420, and have erased all of its year-to-date gains. Data by YCharts I last wrote a sell article on Coinbase in September, when the stock was trading near $340 per share. At the time, I had argued that Coinbase was shouldering a very heavy valuation premium, especially amid potential trading volatility. Certainly, trading volatility has not ceased, but now ~20% lower, I do find that Coinbase's valuation is no longer trading at excessive highs, and amid a greater share of recurring revenue from stablecoins and subscriptions, I'm raising my rating on Coinbase to neutral. At current share prices, I see more of a balanced bull and bear thesis for Coinbase. On the bright side for the company: Coinbase is focused on expanding its recurring revenue. As a reminder, Coinbase does not try to guide or control transactional revenue, putting all of its focus on expanding its subscription revenue. Thanks to the rapid growth of USDC stablecoin circulation and the growing popularity of Coinbase One subscriptions (which is now anchored by a credit card that rewards 4% cash back in the form of BTC), the company is achieving substantial growth in recurring revenue. Substantial adjusted EBITDA margins. Coinbase is an immensely profitable business, despite the company's recent investments into headcount to roll out new products like advanced trading tools. The company recently produced a very healthy ~45% adjusted EBITDA margin. At the same time, however, we should be wary of the following factors: Trading volatility can make Coinbase's P&L very lumpy from quarter to quarter. Trading still represents roughly two-thirds of Coinbase's overall revenue. Nearly half of its trading revenue, meanwhile, comes from smaller altcoins, in which Coinbase recently expanded its selection (now assets tradable on Coinbase represent 90% of total crypto market cap). In volatile times, fewer people may trade, especially in altcoins. Interest rate risk. Falling interest rates will reduce net interest income on the company's stablecoin balances, though growing issuance and circulation of USDC helps to offset interest rate declines. Very crowded field. Crypto trading platforms have flooded the market aplenty. Coinbase is head-to-head versus the largest exchange, Binance, alongside other players including Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood ( HOOD ), eToro ( ETOR ), and Bullish ( BLSH ), which just launched its U.S. trading operations on October 31. From a valuation standpoint, Coinbase still sits at a premium, but not as stretched of a multiple as in the past. At current share prices near $265, Coinbase trades at a market cap of $71.97 billion. After we net off the $13.47 billion of cash and USDC and $2.60 billion of crypto held for long-term investment (which may have degraded in value since the September balance sheet close) against $7.20 billion of debt, the company's resulting enterprise value is $65.70 billion. For next year, FY26, Wall Street analysts are expecting Coinbase to hit $8.70 billion in revenue, or 16% y/y growth. If we conservatively assume 45% adjusted EBITDA margins on that revenue profile (flat to Q3 actuals and 3 points underneath 48% LTM margins), adjusted EBITDA on this revenue profile would be $3.91 billion, positioning Coinbase's valuation at ~17x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA. We note, as shown in the chart below, that Coinbase's valuation sits well below the likes of Robinhood ( HOOD ), which is trading more than twice as richly: Data by YCharts In my view, Coinbase is likely to still experience near-term volatility as BTC undergoes its correction. That said, I also think Coinbase's more reasonable valuation puts a floor on this stock. Continue to monitor this position from the sidelines for now, but Coinbase may prove to be a buy if it sails below $200 (indicating a low/mid-teens adjusted EBITDA multiple, and where Coinbase traded in the immediate aftermath of the tariff announcement in April). Q3 download Let's now go through Coinbase's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q3 revenue trends are shown in the chart below: Coinbase revenue trends (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Coinbase's total revenue grew 55% y/y to $1.87 billion, which roundly beat Wall Street's expectations of $1.81 billion (+50% y/y) by a five-point margin. Heightened trading volatility was still the biggest driver of Coinbase's growth, with transactional revenue growing 83% y/y to $1.05 billion. But that's also a rapid change from a much weaker Q2, where transactional revenue declined -2% y/y. As a reminder, Q2 contained the post-tariff selloff across all risk assets. We do expect Q4 to be a similar repeat of Q2 weakness with the sell-off in Bitcoin. We note that many in the crypto community ascribe to a ""HODL"" (""hold on for dear life"") mindset , which may reduce trading volumes as prices fall. The chart below showcases Coinbase's trading volumes. Total volume jumped 59% y/y to $295 billion. Interestingly, the large majority of Coinbase's volume (80%) is institutional, and yet spreads are razor-thin on institutional trading, which made up only 13% of transactional revenue in Q3 despite being the lion's share of volume. This is a strong reminder that Coinbase relies heavily on retail trading activity to drive revenue. Moreover, a growing share of this revenue is shifting toward altcoins, with ""other crypto assets"" growing to 42% of trading volume and 38% of transaction revenue, versus 24% for Bitcoin. Coinbase has expanded its selection of smaller tokens, and again, the proclivity to trade in these altcoins may be much weaker in a crypto bear market. Coinbase trading splits (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) On the subscription side, we do cheer the fact that non-transactional revenue saw strong 35% y/y growth to $746.7 million, or 41% of total revenue. This was driven by two factors. First, Coinbase has noted that attach rates are improving on Coinbase One, especially after the company rolled out its $5/month basic tier. This has proven to be especially popular for shoppers who want the 4% Bitcoin back credit card that Coinbase is offering, available to subscribers of all subscription tiers. Coinbase One (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Coinbase also drove $355 million in revenue in Q3 from its net interest income on stablecoins, or roughly about half of the company's subscription and services revenue, with balances on USDC held in Coinbase growing 9% sequentially to $15 billion. On the profitability front, Coinbase's opex fell -9% sequentially to $1.39 billion, as transactional expenses of 14% of trading revenue fell on the lower end of the company's guidance (calling for a mid-teens percentage). Coinbase opex (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Headcount continued to rise, adding ~500 net-new employees in the quarter. Sales and marketing costs, which is where USDC rewards (interest payments) are recorded, also rose ~10% sequentially. Still, in spite of this, Coinbase drove $801 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q3, up 78% y/y and reflecting a 45% adjusted EBITDA margin that improved 5 points y/y. Coinbase adjusted EBITDA (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Key takeaways Investors should buckle in for more volatility in Coinbase as the stock swings and slides based on trading patterns in the crypto space. That said, I do think that Coinbase has fallen to a more reasonable valuation at a high-teens multiple of adjusted EBITDA. As long as the company is able to continue growing its recurring subscription/stablecoin revenue while growing its bottom line through profitable trading, the stock will remain on an upward long-term trajectory.

This resurgence could signify a pivotal moment for the altcoin, suggesting a potential new upward trend. However, investors remain divided on whether ETH may face further declines or if a year-end rebound could reignite bullish sentiment. ETH’s December Struggles In order to anticipate Ethereum’s probable moves in December, Alex Carchidi, an analyst at The Motley Fool, notes that this month has traditionally been a difficult month for the cryptocurrency. Since 2016, Ethereum has only concluded December higher than it started in four of the nine years studied. In the remaining five cases, the month ended in negative territory. The average December return throughout this span is about 7%, indicating that a strong “Santa rally” is improbable. The median performance shows a 6% drop. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over? Key Levels To Watch Examining the relationship between November and December reveals a more intriguing pattern. Between 2016 and 2024, when November has been weak for ETH, December often followed suit, with three out of four instances showing declines. The only outlier was in 2018, when Ethereum rebounded in December after a particularly harsh downturn in November. This historical context suggests that a poor performance in November could carry over into December, making a cheerful month less probable. But while December’s performance has historically been mixed, the beginning of the year has typically shown strong potential for the Ethereum price, particularly in the first and second quarters. In fact, average returns tend to peak in the first quarter at around 77% and the second quarter at approximately 64%, indicating that there may still be significant growth on the horizon for the leading altcoin. Tom Lee Foresees Ethereum Surging To $7,000 Amidst this hypothetical scenario, Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies and a major industry advocate, predicts a bright future for Ethereum in the near and long term. The executive believes that the cryptocurrency could surge to $7,000 per coin heading into the first quarter of 2026, reflecting a nearly 150% price surge from its current value. Related Reading: Metaplanet In Jeopardy: Bitcoin Needs To Surpass $108,000 By December 18 To Prevent New Crisis Lee is even more optimistic about the long term, predicting that if his vision for a decentralized financial system materializes, the Ethereum price could soar by 2,090% to reach $62,000 by 2035. After a challenging year in which ETH significantly underperformed its peers, it has shown increased resilience, especially following the recent crash in crypto prices that saw the token’s valuation drop to $2,600 last Friday. Currently, ETH is trading just above $3,000. While this is not bullish enough to outpace the recent crash, ETH is positioned to recover significantly if demand and capital flow back into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the year comes to a close.

55025632,635558,1764306035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55025632.jpeg,"Spain’s 47% Crypto Tax Sparks Outrage, Critics Predict Full Regulatory Chaos",https://bitcoinist.com/spains-47-crypto-tax-sparks-outrage-critics-predict-full-regulatory-chaos/,"Spain’s Sumar parliamentary group has submitted a proposal that would change how gains from cryptocurrencies are taxed, potentially pushing the top personal rate to 47%. According to reports, the draft would move profits from crypto out of the current “savings” tax bracket — where gains are taxed up to around 30% — into the general income tax base, which carries higher top rates. Sumar’s Proposal And Key Changes Based on reports , the changes do more than tweak rates. They would treat gains from nonfinancial crypto assets as ordinary income, apply a 30% corporate tax rate to business crypto gains, and label all digital assets as attachable or seizable under certain conditions. The plan also asks Spain’s securities regulator to design a “risk traffic light” that platforms must display to users, showing a simple risk indicator for various tokens. Spain’s Sumar parliamentary group has proposed a legislative reform aimed at significantly increasing taxes on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. The proposal would shift taxation of crypto gains from the current “savings tax base” (capped at 30%) to the “general tax base,” where… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 26, 2025 Lawmakers filed the amendment recently. It targets at least three laws: the General Tax Law, the Income Tax Law and the Inheritance and Gift Tax Law. Reports have made clear the package is broad and could change again as it moves through the legislature. Industry Reaction And Legal Questions The push has drawn sharp criticism from parts of the crypto community and some legal experts. Critics warn that treating crypto like regular income and declaring all tokens seizable could push investors and firms to move holdings abroad. Others say seizing assets becomes tricky when tokens are self-custodied or held on platforms outside Spanish control. Some lawyers argue the proposed seizure rules may be hard to apply in practice. They point to stablecoins and tokens that circulate across borders and systems, noting enforcement could be limited unless platforms or intermediaries cooperate. El Grupo Parlamentario Sumar ha presentado tres enmiendas en el proyecto que transpone la Directiva de la UE sobre criptoactivos que van claramente contra Bitcoin, Ethereum y otras criptomonedas: 1⃣ Quieren que las ganancias por criptoactivos no considerados instrumentos… — José Antonio Bravo Mateu (@jabravo) November 24, 2025 At the same time, supporters inside the Sumar group say stronger rules are needed to close tax loopholes and provide clearer rules for a market they view as risky for retail savers. Market And Policy Risks If enacted as written, the reform would raise the tax bill for many individual holders and traders. Retail investors who now pay up to 30% on gains could face rates near 47% on large profits. Companies that keep crypto on their balance sheets would see a flat 30% corporate tax on gains. Analysts warn that these shifts could reduce trading activity and deter new crypto firms from setting up in Spain.

This significant transaction, reported by on-chain analysis firm OnchainLense, raises crucial questions about institutional crypto adoption and sovereign wealth management strategies. What Does the Bhutan Government Wallet Transaction Mean? The Bhutan government wallet activity represents a fascinating development in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. According to blockchain analysts, this isn’t just a random transaction – there’s a high probability of further deposits, suggesting a potential strategic sale or portfolio rebalancing. The move demonstrates how even smaller nations are actively participating in digital asset markets. Why Should You Care About Government Crypto Moves? Government involvement in cryptocurrency markets signals several important trends: Institutional validation of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles Increased market maturity as sovereign entities participate Potential price impact from large-scale government transactions Regulatory implications for future crypto policies The Bhutan government wallet activity follows a pattern of increasing institutional participation in crypto markets. However, this particular transaction stands out because it involves a national government directly engaging with trading firms rather than traditional financial institutions. How Might This Affect Crypto Market Sentiment? When a government entity like the Bhutan government wallet makes significant moves, market participants pay close attention. The deposit to QCP Capital could indicate several possibilities: Portfolio diversification strategy Liquidity needs for national projects Strategic profit-taking from earlier investments Testing institutional trading channels Market analysts suggest that continued activity from the Bhutan government wallet could influence smaller altcoins and set precedents for other developing nations considering crypto investments. What’s Next for Government Crypto Adoption? The movement from the Bhutan government wallet opens up important discussions about sovereign digital asset management. As more nations explore cryptocurrency investments, we might see: Standardized regulatory frameworks for government holdings Increased transparency in public crypto investments New models for national wealth management Potential for crypto-based economic development The Bhutan government wallet transaction serves as a compelling case study in how nations are adapting to the digital asset revolution. While the immediate impact might be limited to market observers, the long-term implications could reshape how governments approach financial technology and economic sovereignty. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Bhutan government wallet? The Bhutan government wallet refers to cryptocurrency addresses believed to be controlled by the Royal Government of Bhutan for managing digital asset investments. Why would Bhutan deposit ETH to QCP Capital? This could indicate planned selling, portfolio rebalancing, or accessing liquidity through professional trading services while managing market impact. How significant is $480,000 in ETH for a government? While relatively small compared to total national reserves, it demonstrates active participation in crypto markets and could represent test transactions before larger moves. Could other governments make similar moves? Yes, many nations are exploring digital asset investments, and Bhutan’s actions might encourage similar transparent approaches from other countries. What does this mean for Ethereum prices? Single transactions of this size rarely impact prices significantly, but continued government activity could influence long-term institutional adoption sentiment. How reliable is the wallet identification? On-chain analysis firms use multiple data points to identify wallet ownership, but absolute certainty requires official confirmation from the entities involved.

DOGE is now consolidating and might decline sharply if it trades below $0.1490. DOGE price started a fresh increase above $0.1480 and $0.150. The price is trading below the $0.1520 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1495 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1490. Dogecoin Price Consolidates Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1450, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.150 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.1525. A high was formed at $0.1565 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1520 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1495 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1550 level and a connecting bearish trend line on the same chart. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1565 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.160 level. A close above the $0.160 resistance might send the price toward $0.1680. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.1720. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1780. Downside Break In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1550 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1490 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.1450 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. The main support sits at $0.1420. If there is a downside break below the $0.1420 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1330 level or even $0.130 in the near term.

As traders across the world test how well leading AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini and DeepSeek perform when placed into real trading environments, Bitget offers something more tangible: a lineup of AI traders with distinct personalities, strategies, and market philosophies, all running live, trading real accounts, and fully available for one-click copy trading. Each avatar represents a different school of trading logic, ranging from conservative hedging and major-coin momentum to high-beta altcoin breakouts, contrarian reversals and mechanical execution. These include Steady Hedge, Majors Momentum, Altcoin Turbo, CTA Force, Infinite Grid, Dip Sniper, and DeepSeek (base model). All strategies have been built using a multi-factor library of professional trading indicators, extensive backtesting, and iterative refinement inside GetAgent. From 18:00 on November 24 to 18:00 on December 15 (UTC+8), GetAgent users can access a limited one-click copy trading channel, selecting the avatar that aligns most closely with their trading personality. Each AI trader executes autonomously in real time, and users can follow every entry, exit, drawdown and adjustment directly in the Model Arena. With transparent performance curves, strategy documentation and real execution data, the experience offers a front row seat into how different trading strategies act under market pressure. To encourage exploration, Bitget has launched a 10,000 USDT airdrop pool for participating users. Anyone who successfully copy-trades and sends one message to GetAgent qualifies for the reward share, and the first 100 copy trading users each day will receive contract copy trading vouchers worth up to 100 USDT. “People want solutions they can actually use to trade,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. “These avatars make trading feel more personal and more approachable. Whether someone prefers momentum, hedging, or contrarian plays, there’s now an AI companion that thinks the way they do.” Instead of copying blindly, users can speak directly to each avatar. GetAgent allows traders to ask why an avatar entered a position, how it sets stop-loss levels, what signals it prioritizes, and how it adapts to different market cycles. New traders gain clarity and confidence, while experienced users can stress-test ideas or explore unfamiliar strategies without risk to their core portfolios. DeepSeek, included in the lineup as an unmodified base model, serves as a benchmark. At the end of the trading camp, Bitget will publish a comparative review of how each avatar performed relative to DeepSeek, offering one of the industry’s first real-world studies on AI trading behavior across different agent designs. Whether a trader resonates with Steady Hedge’s caution, Altcoin Turbo’s appetite for volatility, or Infinite Grid’s range-based logic, GetAgent offers a way to match strategies with preference, bringing a new layer of relatability to AI-assisted trading. Bitget’s six trading avatars bring that transparency into a single interface, powered by UEX’s infrastructure and GetAgent’s intelligent execution.

Asian currencies are caught in a fascinating tug-of-war between Federal Reserve easing expectations and growing speculation about Bank of Japan policy normalization. The latest Tokyo CPI data has injected fresh uncertainty into currency markets, creating a complex landscape that every serious investor needs to understand. Why Are Asia FX Markets So Muted Despite Fed Easing Bets? The Asia FX complex is displaying remarkable restraint despite growing consensus that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in the coming months. Typically, such dovish signals from the world’s most influential central bank would trigger significant currency movements across emerging markets. However, several factors are contributing to this unusual calm. Regional economic uncertainties are offsetting potential gains China’s ongoing property sector challenges continue to weigh on sentiment Global trade tensions create headwinds for export-dependent economies Investors await clearer signals from multiple central banks How Tokyo CPI Data Is Reshaping BOJ Rate Hike Expectations The latest Tokyo CPI figures have sent shockwaves through monetary policy circles, showing inflation pressures that exceed market expectations. This critical data point from Japan’s capital city often serves as a leading indicator for national trends, making it particularly significant for policy decisions. Indicator Latest Reading Market Expectation Previous Tokyo Core CPI 2.7% 2.5% 2.4% Tokyo CPI Ex-Fresh Food 2.6% 2.4% 2.3% Services Inflation 2.1% 1.9% 1.8% The Growing Case For BOJ Rate Hike Action Market participants are increasingly pricing in a more hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan, with BOJ rate hike probabilities rising significantly following the inflation data. The central bank faces a delicate balancing act as it considers ending years of ultra-loose monetary policy. Key factors supporting policy normalization include: Sustained inflation above the 2% target Wage growth showing meaningful acceleration Corporate pricing power demonstrating resilience Global central bank coordination considerations Fed Easing Timeline: What It Means For Currency Markets The anticipated Fed easing cycle represents a fundamental shift in global liquidity conditions. While the exact timing remains uncertain, the direction of travel is clear, creating both opportunities and risks for currency traders. Historical patterns suggest that initial Fed rate cuts typically: Weaken the US dollar against major counterparts Boost emerging market currencies Increase capital flows into higher-yielding assets Reduce hedging costs for international investors Navigating The Complex Forex Markets Landscape Current forex markets present a challenging environment for traders and investors alike. The conflicting signals from major central banks require careful analysis and risk management strategies. Successful navigation demands attention to: Central bank communication and forward guidance Economic data surprises and revisions Technical levels and market positioning Geopolitical developments affecting trade flows Frequently Asked Questions What is the current outlook for Asian currencies? Asian currencies face mixed prospects with Fed easing providing support but regional economic challenges and potential BOJ policy shifts creating headwinds. How does Tokyo CPI affect global markets? Tokyo CPI serves as an early indicator for Japanese inflation trends, influencing Bank of Japan policy decisions that can impact global capital flows and currency valuations. When might the Federal Reserve begin cutting rates? Market expectations suggest the Federal Reserve could begin easing in the second half of 2024, though timing depends on inflation and employment data. What are the implications of BOJ policy normalization? A Bank of Japan rate hike would represent a historic shift from decades of accommodative policy, potentially strengthening the yen and affecting global bond markets. How should traders position in current market conditions? Traders should maintain flexible positions, monitor central bank communications closely, and implement robust risk management given the elevated uncertainty. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture For Global Currencies The stage is set for a dramatic reshaping of global currency relationships. The tension between anticipated Fed easing and potential BOJ tightening creates a rare convergence of opposing monetary policy cycles. For investors and traders, this environment demands heightened vigilance and strategic positioning. The coming months will likely determine whether Asian currencies can break from their muted trading ranges or remain trapped between competing central bank narratives.

Supporters say the move could drain passive capital, force treasury firms to sell BTC, and depress prices. The controversy led some Bitcoiners to call for a boycott of JPMorgan. JPMorgan Faces More Backlash JPMorgan’s plan to launch a new Bitcoin-backed structured note ignited a fierce backlash among Bitcoin supporters and fans of Strategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC. The notes are set for a December 2025 release according to an SEC filing ,and offer 1.5x leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance through December 2028 — magnifying both gains and losses for investors. While it is framed as another way for traditional finance to engage with digital assets, many in the Bitcoin community see the product as a strategic threat specifically aimed at undercutting firms that hold BTC directly on their balance sheets. Critics argue that JPMorgan effectively positioned itself as a competitor to Bitcoin treasury companies, giving the bank an incentive to diminish the reputation and liquidity of firms like Strategy. People on X said that Michael Saylor’s high-profile adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset opened the door for Wall Street to enter the market, and they accuse JPMorgan of copying the playbook while also benefiting from the narrative pressure placed on BTC-heavy companies. Bitcoin advocate Simon Dixon suggested that the product is designed in a way that could intensify forced selling during market downturns, triggering margin calls on Bitcoin-backed loans and increasing sell-side pressure at moments of vulnerability. The situation escalated even more after MSCI unveiled a proposed rule change that would exclude companies holding 50% or more of their assets in crypto from its major stock indexes starting in January. JPMorgan circulated the proposal in a November research note, which led to claims that the bank was amplifying a policy shift that could directly harm firms like Strategy. The exclusion will block these companies from receiving passive capital flows tied to index-tracking funds and pensions, which could potentially push them to sell large amounts of their Bitcoin reserves to regain eligibility. Bitcoin supporters argue that this could depress crypto asset prices while rewarding traditional financial intermediaries offering synthetic or derivative exposure instead. In response, a growing segment of the Bitcoin community is urging a boycott of JPMorgan, and is encouraging users to close accounts and divest from the bank’s stock. Strategy supporters and other advocates say the timing of JPMorgan’s new product, coupled with the MSCI policy proposal, is part of a coordinated financial pressure campaign against crypto-native treasury strategies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-28 05:30:00

The decisions show a real change in how Hanoi handles technology tied to Beijing, after years of keeping Chinese suppliers away from sensitive systems. New contract filings reveal fresh deals for Huawei and ZTE, even as Western governments warn that these companies pose security risks. The new reality is clear, and every number on the page shows how far this shift has gone. For years, Vietnam held back from buying Chinese gear. That restraint has eased. The government has warmed toward Beijing at the same time relations with Washington cooled over tariffs on Vietnamese goods. While Ericsson and Nokia still run the core of the country’s 5G system and Qualcomm supplies important equipment, Chinese companies are winning more of the supporting work. The pattern appears in recent tenders that were not widely reported. Vietnam awards major 5G contracts to Chinese vendors A group that includes Huawei secured a $23 million contract in April for 5G equipment. That deal landed just weeks after Trump’s team announced new tariffs on Vietnamese exports. ZTE picked up at least two deals, including one signed last week, worth over $20 million for 5G antennas. The first deal disclosed to the public arrived in September, one month after the tariffs went into effect. Reuters said it could not confirm whether the timing was connected to the tariffs, but Western officials voiced concern after learning about the contracts. Washington has long tied its support for advanced technology cooperation with Vietnam to one key rule: no Chinese contractors inside Vietnam’s digital backbone. The U.S. calls Huawei and ZTE an “unacceptable risk” to national security. Sweden and other European governments follow similar restrictions. Ericsson refused to speak on the Chinese firms but said it was “fully committed to support its customers in Vietnam.” Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Qualcomm, the U.S. embassy, the Chinese embassy, Sweden’s foreign ministry, and Vietnam’s tech ministry did not provide comments. Vietnam now sits in the middle of a global contest for influence. Its position next to China and its central role in supply chains for companies such as Apple, Samsung, and Nike make every telecom decision a geopolitical data point. Those companies rely on Chinese-made parts and Western consumers. That mix pulls Vietnam in two directions at the same time. Supply chain scholar Nguyen Hung of RMIT University Vietnam said the country long took “a wait-and-see approach” to Chinese technology because of Western pressure. Nguyen said, “Vietnam has its own priorities,” and he noted that recent deals could push deeper business ties with China. Other projects show the same new mood, including work on cross-border rail lines and special economic zones near the Chinese border that Vietnam once rejected over security fears. Western diplomats raise concerns about network access Huawei lost several 5G bids this year, tender records show. But Huawei still maintains a presence in technical services. In June, the company signed a 5G technology transfer agreement with Viettel, the military-owned telecom operator, based on comments from Vietnam’s defense ministry. Viettel did not reply to questions. These Chinese contract wins surfaced in at least two recent meetings of senior Western officials in Hanoi. In one meeting, a U.S. official warned the contracts could hurt trust in Vietnam’s networks and block future access to U.S. advanced technology. In another meeting this month, officials discussed whether parts of Vietnam’s network that use Chinese technology could be walled off to stop data leaks. Telecom lawyer Innocenzo Genna said sealing off parts of the network would not solve the problem. Genna said antenna and equipment suppliers could still reach data. He added that “Western contractors may face the awkward prospect of working alongside firms they do not trust.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|ericsson|Huawei|Nokia|ZTE,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-28 05:30:03

Key Takeaways: MegaETH will refund all USDm pre-deposits after admitting operational failures during the launch. A misconfigured multisig transaction triggered an early reopening that sent deposits past $400 million. Refunds are pending a smart-contract audit, with a new USDC-USDm bridge planned before mainnet beta. The announcement came on Thursday in a post on X, where the team admitted missteps during the rollout. “Execution was sloppy and expectations weren’t aligned with our goal of preloading collateral to guarantee 1:1 USDm conversion at mainnet,” MegaETH wrote. MegaETH’s USDm Pre-Deposit Launch Stalls After Bridge Outage MegaETH opened pre-deposits for USDm on Tuesday with an initial $250 million limit. The launch, however, encountered repeated disruptions from the start. A technical problem with a third-party bridge provider rendered the service inaccessible for about an hour, while users waited for deposits to resume. Once the platform came back online, the $250 million threshold was reached within minutes. The team then announced it would raise the deposit cap to $1 billion. That decision quickly complicated matters. During the process of increasing the cap, a multisignature transaction that controls the contract parameters was incorrectly configured. Instead of requiring three out of four approvals, the transaction was set to require all four signatures. That error allowed an external party to execute the queued transaction nearly 34 minutes before the bridge was officially meant to reopen. As a result, deposits resumed earlier than planned and quickly surpassed $400 million. MegaETH attempted to contain the situation by reducing the cap to $400 million, then later lifting it to $500 million. The project ultimately scrapped plans to expand the limit to $1 billion entirely. Following the incident, MegaETH confirmed that it will return all funds to participants. The refund contract is currently under audit, with repayments set to begin shortly after the review is completed. “Depositor contributions will not be forgotten,” the team said. USDm is integral to the MegaETH economy and will be supported by many Frontier applications. For this reason, we will re-open the $USDC $USDM conversion bridge ahead of Frontier mainnet to deepen liquidity, easing user onboarding prior to launch. — MegaETH (@megaeth) November 27, 2025 Looking ahead, MegaETH plans to reopen its conversion bridge between USDC and USDm ahead of its Frontier mainnet release, which will serve as the network’s beta phase. The goal, the team said, is to establish stable liquidity before a wider rollout. MegaETH Pitches 100,000 TPS Layer-2 MegaETH is an Ethereum Layer-2 network designed to improve transaction speed and reduce costs for blockchain applications, positioning itself alongside platforms like Base, Polygon, and Arbitrum. While Ethereum processes about 30 transactions per second, MegaETH claims a theoretical capacity of up to 100,000 TPS, with sub-millisecond latency and fees below $0.01. The project uses a proof-of-stake model with a performance-based system to calculate staking rewards. Holders who stake MEGA tokens will also take part in governance through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), allowing them to vote on future changes.

Recent data reveals a startling truth about blockchain fee revenue – just 11 public chains managed to generate over $100,000 in weekly fees. This exclusive insight comes from crypto analytics firm Nansen, highlighting the concentrated nature of blockchain economic activity. Which Blockchains Dominate Fee Revenue? The blockchain fee revenue landscape shows clear winners and surprising gaps. Among the elite group, six chains stood out by crossing the $1 million mark in weekly fees. This demonstrates how blockchain fee revenue becomes increasingly concentrated among top performers. Let’s examine the top blockchain fee revenue generators: Tron (TRX) : $6.16 million Ethereum : $3.87 million Solana : $2.94 million BNB Chain : $2.65 million Bitcoin : $1.78 million Base : $1.13 million Why Does Blockchain Fee Revenue Matter? Blockchain fee revenue serves as a crucial health indicator for any network. It reflects real usage and economic activity rather than speculative interest. When blockchain fee revenue remains consistently high, it signals strong network utility and user adoption. Moreover, sustainable blockchain fee revenue supports network security and development. This revenue funds protocol improvements and ensures long-term viability. Therefore, tracking blockchain fee revenue provides valuable insights into which networks are actually being used versus those merely generating hype. What Challenges Affect Blockchain Fee Revenue? Several factors influence blockchain fee revenue generation. Network congestion, transaction volume, and fee structures all play significant roles. Some networks optimize for low fees to attract users, while others prioritize security through higher fee models. The concentration of blockchain fee revenue among few networks raises important questions about decentralization. However, it also demonstrates market efficiency – users naturally gravitate toward networks providing the best value and utility. Actionable Insights from Blockchain Fee Revenue Data This blockchain fee revenue report offers valuable guidance for investors and developers. The data suggests focusing on networks with proven economic activity rather than speculative promises. Consistent blockchain fee revenue indicates real-world usage and sustainable growth potential. For developers, understanding blockchain fee revenue patterns helps in choosing the right platform for dApp deployment. Networks with healthy fee revenue typically offer better infrastructure and larger user bases. Conclusion: The Future of Blockchain Fee Revenue The blockchain fee revenue landscape reveals a maturing industry where economic fundamentals increasingly matter. As the space evolves, we can expect more sophisticated fee models and revenue-sharing mechanisms. However, the basic principle remains: sustainable blockchain fee revenue correlates strongly with long-term success and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions What is blockchain fee revenue? Blockchain fee revenue represents the total fees collected by a network from transaction processing and smart contract executions over a specific period. Why did only 11 blockchains cross $100K in weekly fees? This reflects market concentration where users prefer established networks with better infrastructure, security, and liquidity, creating a winner-takes-most effect in blockchain fee revenue. How does fee revenue impact blockchain security? Higher fee revenue typically supports better network security by providing more incentives for validators and miners to protect the network against attacks. Can newer blockchains increase their fee revenue? Yes, through strategic partnerships, innovative features, and improving user experience, newer networks can gradually increase their blockchain fee revenue over time. Why is Tron leading in fee revenue? Tron’s leadership in blockchain fee revenue stems from its focus on low-cost transactions and strong adoption in specific use cases like stablecoin transfers and gaming applications. How often does blockchain fee revenue data change? Blockchain fee revenue fluctuates daily based on network activity, market conditions, and specific events like NFT mints or token launches that drive transaction volume.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $895.3 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $931. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $862. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $895.3, as bulls target $931. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.18 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-28 05:53:11

The government plans to expand its crypto Travel Rule to include transactions as small as $724, marking a significant shift in how authorities monitor virtual asset movements. This bold move demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to combating financial crime in the digital asset space. What Does the Crypto Travel Rule Expansion Mean? Financial Services Commission Chairman Lee Eog-weon announced this crucial development during the 19th Anti-Money Laundering Day ceremony. The expanded crypto Travel Rule will now cover transactions valued at 1 million won (approximately $724) or less. This represents a major tightening of existing regulations that previously focused on larger transactions. The government’s approach includes several key measures: Strict crackdowns on money laundering through virtual assets Blocking transactions with high-risk overseas exchanges Enhanced vetting systems for Virtual Asset Service Provider shareholders Why is South Korea Strengthening the Crypto Travel Rule? South Korean authorities recognize that criminals often exploit smaller transactions to avoid detection. By expanding the crypto Travel Rule to lower-value transfers, regulators can track suspicious patterns more effectively. This comprehensive approach ensures that money launderers cannot simply break large transactions into smaller amounts to bypass monitoring systems. The Financial Intelligence Unit will implement rigorous background checks covering: Criminal records of major VASP shareholders Financial health assessments Social standing evaluations How Will This Impact Crypto Users and Exchanges? This expanded crypto Travel Rule means both individual users and exchanges must adapt to stricter reporting requirements. Virtual Asset Service Providers will need to enhance their compliance systems to handle increased monitoring of smaller transactions. However, this also creates a safer environment for legitimate crypto users by reducing illegal activities. The government’s strategy focuses on three main areas: Preventing money laundering through better transaction tracking Protecting investors from risky international exchanges Ensuring VASP operators maintain high integrity standards What Challenges Might This New Approach Face? Implementing the expanded crypto Travel Rule presents several challenges. Monitoring numerous small transactions requires sophisticated technology and significant resources. Additionally, exchanges must balance compliance with user convenience. However, South Korean authorities appear determined to overcome these hurdles to create a more transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem. The success of this enhanced crypto Travel Rule depends on: Effective cooperation between regulators and VASPs Advanced monitoring technology implementation International coordination with other jurisdictions Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Regulation in South Korea South Korea’s decision to expand the crypto Travel Rule represents a watershed moment in digital asset regulation. This proactive approach demonstrates how governments are adapting traditional financial oversight to the cryptocurrency world. While creating additional compliance requirements, these measures ultimately protect the integrity of South Korea’s growing crypto market and set a precedent for other nations considering similar regulations. Frequently Asked Questions What is the crypto Travel Rule? The crypto Travel Rule requires Virtual Asset Service Providers to share sender and receiver information for cryptocurrency transactions, similar to traditional bank wire transfers. When will the expanded rules take effect? While Chairman Lee announced the expansion on November 28th, specific implementation dates will be determined through further regulatory processes. How will this affect everyday crypto users? Regular users may experience additional verification steps for smaller transactions but will benefit from reduced illegal activity in crypto markets. Which exchanges are considered high-risk? The Financial Intelligence Unit maintains a list of overseas exchanges that don’t meet South Korea’s compliance standards, though specific names aren’t publicly disclosed. Can users avoid these rules by using decentralized exchanges? While DEXs operate differently, South Korean authorities are developing comprehensive approaches to cover all types of virtual asset transactions. Will other countries follow South Korea’s approach? Many nations are watching South Korea’s regulatory innovations closely, and similar measures may emerge globally as cryptocurrency adoption increases.

Details,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-bitcoin-and-crypto-holders-have-we-seen-the-worst-yet-details/,"Many investors are questioning whether the recent crypto market volatility marks the end of the downward trend or if further declines are still coming. In a recent video, crypto commentator Austin Hilton examined current market conditions and outlined the factors shaping both optimism and caution among analysts. His remarks provided a detailed overview of price levels, sentiment indicators, policy developments, and on-chain trends that continue to influence Bitcoin and the broader market. Have we seen the worst yet, fellow crypto holders? What to know – has the crypto market bottomed out and going up from here… pic.twitter.com/zdDeCLkXQq — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) November 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Recent Movements and Current Position Hilton began by addressing the central question circulating among market participants: whether the bottom has already formed. He pointed to Bitcoin’s recent fluctuation between approximately $83,000 and $86,000, noting that the asset briefly dropped to around $83,000 before recovering. He explained that while he is not aiming to determine the exact timing of a market bottom, he does recognize the possibility of limited additional downside. Some analysts he follows believe that if negative sentiment intensifies, Bitcoin could fall toward the $74,000 to $75,000 range. Despite this, he said that consensus across various researchers he monitors indicates that the market is close to its lowest point. Sentiment Shifts and Market Indicators Hilton highlighted signs of improving sentiment, even though major indicators still caution. He referenced a Fear and Greed Index reading of 15, up from 12 the previous day, noting that the market remains in an extreme fear phase but is showing early improvement He attributed part of the sentiment shift to expectations that the Federal Reserve may introduce an interest rate reduction in the coming weeks, with 82% probability of such a move. According to Hilton, this expectation is contributing to more constructive conditions across both crypto and equity markets. He also pointed to on-chain data indicating that large Bitcoin holders have begun accumulating again, a trend that often precedes upward movement. Additionally, he emphasized the importance of pending pro-crypto legislation, specifically the Clarity Act , which he expects to advance once congressional delays tied to the government shutdown are resolved. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Remaining Risks and Further Considerations Hilton acknowledged that uncertainty still exists. Macroeconomic concerns, lingering fear among investors, and questions about the relevance of the traditional four-year market cycle all contribute to a cautious environment. He reiterated that sentiment does not reverse quickly and that weakened demand remains visible, though it may gradually improve. He also discussed the Federal Reserve’s decision to end quantitative tightening in early December, a development he believes will increase liquidity and support markets. Despite these positive signals, Hilton maintained that some volatility may continue, and a slight downward move remains possible. Hilton concluded that although conflicting signals persist, the prevailing view among the analysts he engages with, combined with his own research, suggests that the worst phase of the downturn is likely behind the market. While acknowledging uncertainty, he stated that conditions are aligning in a way that indicates the market is near a turning point, with the potential for recovery gradually strengthening.

With price reclaiming key support levels, the path toward the major $98,000 imbalance zone is now back on the table, but bulls still need to prove this rebound has real conviction. FVG Filled, Bearish OB Tagged — What Comes After The Perfect Hit? Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent market update, noted that Bitcoin has now completed a key technical move by filling the Fair Value Gap (FVG) and tapping directly into the Bearish Order Block exactly as previously projected. He emphasized that traders who avoided shorting the $81,000–$85,000 region and instead positioned for the upside likely captured a clean and predictable long setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst With that phase now complete, the focus shifts to Bitcoin’s next major target. Patel highlights the $96,800–$98,000 FVG as the upcoming high-timeframe imbalance zone. From a broader perspective, Patel still expects Bitcoin to make a move toward the $98,000 zone before any significant corrective leg unfolds. This aligns with his macro outlook, which continues to favor a final upward sweep into that region before momentum weakens again. However, he also outlines a clear invalidation point for the bearish bias. A sustained high-timeframe close above $107,550 would negate the existing bearish market structure entirely. Such a breakout would signal the start of a new bullish phase for Bitcoin, potentially setting the stage for a fresh all-time-high trend. Promising Bounce As BTC Defends the $90,000 Support Zone According to The Boss, Bitcoin’s latest price action is showing early signs of strength. After the sharp decline, BTC reacted firmly at the local support and managed to push back above the $90,000 level, indicating that buyers are stepping in with renewed confidence. The chart now reflects a stable support zone that has held up against downward pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 Part of this rebound appears to be driven by improving macro sentiment. Softer expectations around Federal Reserve tightening, a rise in overall risk appetite, and a shift back toward risk-on assets are all contributing to Bitcoin’s recovery attempt. From a technical perspective, The Boss notes that Bitcoin must continue to hold above the $90,000–$91,000 range to form a meaningful upward wave from this base. However, caution is still warranted. Without clear confirmation from momentum indicators and sustained trading volume, the current move has the potential to be limited. The possibility of a dead-cat bounce remains on the table, especially following such an aggressive sell-off.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/prime-suspect-in-upbit-hacker-attack-revealed-details-here/,"The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group is suspected to be behind the approximately 44.5 billion won ($30.4 million) cyberattack targeting South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit. Lazarus Group May Be Behind $30 Million Hack on Upbit According to local media reports, government and industry sources say the attack methods and on-chain movements are similar to Lazarus' past operations. Officials speaking to Yonhap News Agency said that field inspections of Upbit were being prepared amid growing suspicions. The exchange announced Thursday morning that it had detected abnormal outflows of some crypto assets on the Solana network and immediately halted all deposits and withdrawals. Upbit initially announced losses of 54 billion won ($36.8 million), but later revised that figure down to 44.5 billion won. Authorities noted that the methods used in the attack were similar to the 2019 Upbit hack, further bolstering suspicions of Lazarus. South Korean police confirmed last year that Lazarus was behind the 342,000 ETH stolen from Upbit in 2019. Authorities say that instead of attacking servers directly, hackers may have taken over administrator accounts or impersonated administrators to approve transfers. According to data from blockchain analyst Dethective, the wallet associated with the attack began converting SOL holdings into USDC and bridging them to the Ethereum network. This development comes just a day after Naver Financial announced its decision to fully acquire Dunamu, the operator of Upbit. *This is not investment advice.

Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant concern across global markets. Technological competition from emerging blockchain platforms could affect Ethereum’s market dominance. Scalability issues, though improving, continue to present hurdles for mass adoption. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the ETH 2030 projection. Investment Strategies for Ethereum Based on our Ethereum price prediction analysis, several investment approaches emerge. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk in volatile markets. Long-term holding strategies align with Ethereum’s fundamental growth narrative. Diversification across cryptocurrency assets can mitigate specific project risks. Regardless of strategy, thorough research and risk management remain essential when considering the ETH price forecast. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most realistic Ethereum price prediction for 2025?

Justin Sun, Advisor to SunPerp and HTX attended the event and officially announced that SunPerp will rebrand as SunX ( sunx.io ). The upgrade marks SunX’s transformation from a standalone trading platform into a self-reinforcing, self-growing decentralized ecosystem. To celebrate the brand refresh, SunX simultaneously unveiled the first phase of its “Trade to Earn” event with a total prize pool of 1.35 million USDT, offering exceptionally high fee rebates to users worldwide. A Brand Evolution: From Platform to Ecosystem, “X” Signals Infinite Possibilities At the launch, Justin Sun noted that DEXs are gradually becoming a dominant force in the crypto industry, and the shift from a “platform” to an “ecosystem” lies at the heart of the SunX upgrade. The new brand name, SunX, is more concise, globally oriented, and easy for users worldwide to remember. The letter “X” represents: ● eXtension (Infinity) : the limitless expansion of the ecosystem. ● eXperience (Experience) : a superior trading experience. ● eXchange (Future Trading) : the trading model of the future. Justin Sun explained that this reflects the team’s new vision for the future of DeFi and signals that SunX will be smarter, more open, and more liquid than anything we have ever built. Long-Term Vision: Powered by the “Golden Triangle of Decentralized Trading” to Deliver Ultimate User Experience According to Justin Sun, the upgrade to SunX is not happening in isolation but is driven by the strategic collaboration among the “Golden Triangle of Decentralized Trading” formed by HTX, TRON , and SUN: TRON provides the high-performance underlying infrastructure. HTX serves as a global traffic gateway that connects users worldwide. SUN functions as the core engine of innovation and liquidity for the ecosystem. “DEX market share has surged from under 5% to 20%, which is impressive. However, for DEXs to truly become mainstream, challenges such as security, risk management, and user experience must be addressed. On that basis, user experience will remain the core competitive focus for perpetual DEXs in 2026.” To this end, SunX has spent the past two months focused solely on refining order book liquidity, market depth, and a low-latency trading experience. Sun noted that rather than pursuing short-lived traffic spikes, the team prioritizes security and product stability, which are the true determinants of long-term user retention. He added that backed by the two highly profitable ecosystems of TRON and HTX, SunX operates without short-term profit pressure. This allows it to embrace a “long-term” vision and continually subsidize users through zero gas fees and negative maker fee rates until its user experience matches or even surpasses that of centralized exchanges, thereby capturing a greater share of the mainstream market. Strategic Roadmap: Security First, Multi-Chain Development, and Global Expansion During the subsequent media and KOL Q&A session, Justin Sun shared additional strategic insights. Regarding SunX’s strategic roadmap, Sun stressed that security will always come first. Building on this foundation, SunX will no longer be confined to the TRON ecosystem and will gradually expand to more major public chains, with the goal of breaking down cross-chain barriers. In terms of market expansion, SunX will remain committed to serving users around the globe. At the same time, the project aims to onboard the vast user bases of HTX and Poloniex onto SunX, providing them with a truly decentralized perpetual futures trading experience. User Benefits: “Trade to Earn” Goes Live, with Makers Earning 110% Fee Rebates As the first initiative following its rebrand, SunX is rolling out an exceptionally compelling incentive program. The first phase of the “ Trade to Earn ” event will run from 12:00 (UTC) on November 21 to 12:00 (UTC) on December 6, with a total prize pool of 1.35 million USDT. During the event, users who trade perpetual futures in BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, and SUN/USDT will receive a full rebate of all their trading fees, plus additional $SUN token rewards . Maker traders can enjoy fee rebates of up to 110% , while Taker traders receive 107% . Each user can earn up to 500 USDT per hour in rewards. This campaign will also play a major role in empowering the $SUN token economy. All net fees generated from registered participants trading the designated trading pairs during the event will be used to buy back $SUN on HTX, supporting its stable appreciation. The repurchased $SUN will be entirely burned, with burns conducted at the end of each quarter (specific dates to be announced), creating sustained deflation to reward long-term supporters of the ecosystem. On the eve of a major DEX breakout, SunX, backed by the “Golden Triangle of Decentralized Trading” and equipped with an unparalleled user experience, is reshaping the industry standard for on-chain derivatives trading. From this moment onward, a smarter, safer SunX ecosystem with limitless potential is ready to take flight, and we look forward to ushering in a new era of decentralized trading alongside users worldwide. About SunX SunX is the TRON ecosystem’s first native decentralized perpetual futures exchange. It aims to integrate the smooth experience and security of centralized exchanges with the asset sovereignty of decentralized finance to build a new generation of on-chain derivatives infrastructure. With core advantages including the lowest fees, 0 gas trading, secure on-chain custody, high-performance matching, full-chain liquidity integration, and intelligent risk management, the platform is committed to providing fair, efficient, and free DeFi derivatives trading services to global users. As a strategic pivot for TRON’s evolution of its on-chain financial system, SunX is leading a profound financial paradigm shift, propelling the crypto market toward genuine inclusivity and openness.For more information about SunX, please visit www.sunx.io For further inquiries, please contact support@sunx.io .

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-strap-in-xrp-is-about-to-take-the-spotlight-heres-the-latest/,"Japan’s economic position has entered a period of renewed uncertainty, and this shift has become a central topic among market commentators who follow developments in digital finance. A recent post from crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull highlighted the growing integration of XRP within Japan’s financial infrastructure , as the country faces economic pressure. His remarks were paired with a Reuters report from May 16th, 2025, outlining Japan’s weaker-than-expected first-quarter performance and the policy challenges ahead. The combination of these perspectives provides a clearer understanding of how traditional economic concerns and emerging financial technologies intersect. Strap in! $XRP 's about to take the spotlight As Japan’s economy cracks, $XRP lays the rails for the rebuild. By end of year, 80% of Japan’s banks are expected to be using XRP and BOJ collaborating with Ripple, the nation isn’t just reacting, it’s rebuilding its economic… pic.twitter.com/cpTmwgDl7U — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) November 25, 2025 The Economic Context Behind the Technology Push The Reuters segment accompanying the post detailed a 0.7% GDP contraction for Japan over the March quarter. The decline exceeded expectations. It reflected stagnant consumption and slowing exports. The report also noted that the downturn was visible even before tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump were scheduled to take full effect. The United States has imposed a 10% duty on most trading partners. While Japan was poised to face a 24% tariff from July, recent reports show the U.S. is committed to applying a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports. Japanese lawmakers have urged Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to consider stimulus or tax adjustments, while the Bank of Japan reevaluates its expected interest-rate stance in light of the slowdown. How XRP Integration Fits Into the Frame X Finance Bull’s analysis centered on the idea that Japan’s financial institutions are positioning themselves for structural changes rather than relying solely on policy interventions. He said that by the end of the year, a large majority of Japan’s banks are expected to integrate XRP, and he highlighted ongoing collaboration between the Bank of Japan and Ripple . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In his view, this transition is not simply a response to economic strain but part of a wider strategy to modernize the country’s financial rails. He emphasized that XRP is increasingly being used in remittances, export-related flows, and the emerging market for tokenized assets, which he argued could generate greater liquidity and operational efficiency. A Shift Toward Efficiency and Global Competitiveness According to X Finance Bull, enhanced payment speed, real-time settlement, and improved access to capital tied up in illiquid assets represent advantages Japan can leverage at a moment when global trade tensions threaten traditional growth channels. He contended that Japan’s competitive position will be defined by its technological infrastructure rather than tariff negotiations or new fiscal measures. His central point was that financial rails, rather than policy adjustments, will shape the next stage of economic strength. This combined view of economic pressure and technological adoption illustrates the factors influencing Japan’s direction as it navigates a challenging year.

This powerful vision became reality as The Giving Block processed an incredible $100 million in crypto donations this year, demonstrating how digital assets can create real-world impact. How Are Crypto Donations Changing Philanthropy? The cryptocurrency donation platform revealed that Bitcoin led the way as the most donated asset, followed by stablecoins USDT, USDC, and RLUSD. This massive influx of crypto donations represents a fundamental shift in how people approach charitable giving. Donors are increasingly recognizing the benefits of contributing digital assets directly to causes they care about. What makes crypto donations particularly appealing? The process eliminates traditional banking intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and provides immediate access to funds for urgent humanitarian needs. Moreover, donors can potentially benefit from tax advantages when contributing appreciated cryptocurrency assets. Where Did These Crypto Donations Make an Impact? The tangible results from this year’s crypto donations are nothing short of remarkable. The platform shared specific outcomes that demonstrate how digital currency transformed into real-world solutions: 28.5 million children received meals 357,000 people gained access to clean water 22,160 animals were rescued and cared for These numbers represent families fed, communities transformed, and vulnerable creatures saved. Each crypto donation contributed to building a better world through the power of blockchain technology and human generosity. Why Choose Crypto Donations Over Traditional Giving? Crypto donations offer several distinct advantages that traditional payment methods cannot match. The blockchain’s transparency allows donors to track how their contributions are used, creating unprecedented accountability in philanthropy. Additionally, the global nature of cryptocurrency means donors can support causes anywhere in the world without currency conversion hassles. The speed of crypto transactions proves crucial during emergency situations. When natural disasters strike or urgent humanitarian crises emerge, crypto donations can reach organizations within minutes rather than days. This immediate access to funds can literally mean the difference between life and death in critical situations. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Philanthropy? The $100 million milestone signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate tool for social good. As more people become comfortable with digital assets, we can expect crypto donations to become increasingly mainstream. This trend represents a significant opportunity for charitable organizations to tap into new funding sources. However, challenges remain. Some potential donors still hesitate due to cryptocurrency volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Education about the tax benefits and security measures will be crucial for expanding participation in crypto donations. Frequently Asked Questions What cryptocurrencies can I donate through The Giving Block? The platform accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, and numerous other cryptocurrencies including stablecoins like USDT and USDC. They continuously add support for new digital assets to make crypto donations accessible to more people. Are crypto donations tax-deductible? Yes, in many countries, including the United States, crypto donations to qualified charitable organizations can provide tax benefits. Donors typically avoid capital gains tax on appreciated cryptocurrency and can deduct the fair market value. How do I know my crypto donation reaches the intended cause? The Giving Block partners with vetted charitable organizations and provides transparency reports. The blockchain’s inherent transparency also allows for some level of transaction tracking, though personal details remain private. Can I make anonymous crypto donations? While cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous, most legitimate charitable organizations require some identification for tax receipt purposes and regulatory compliance. However, the process typically offers more privacy than traditional donations. What makes crypto donations better than cash donations? Crypto donations often have lower processing fees, faster transfer times, and potential tax advantages. They also allow donors to contribute appreciated assets without converting to cash first, potentially maximizing the impact of their giving. How quickly do organizations receive crypto donations? Most crypto donations are processed within the same day, with funds typically available to charities within 1-3 business days after the blockchain confirmation, making them ideal for urgent fundraising needs.

Lawmakers say the measure could finally settle the long-running dispute over whether tokens should be treated as commodities or securities, a decision that would determine which regulator takes charge. Senate Targets December Markup As proposed by the committee, the markup for the crypto market structure bill will be on December 8, 2025; this allows senators to debate and change parts of the text before moving it forward. According to reports, the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee plan to move forward with their own drafts and then unify them into one text for the second phase. If both committees clear their drafts, the unified text would be forwarded for a vote by the full Senate. BREAKING U.S. SENATE TO VOTE ON CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL IN DECEMBER.

Both committees must agree on one system or talks could hit another dead end. The industry groups say they want clarity. Regulators have stayed cautious while waiting to see where Congress lands. What’s At Stake For Markets According to sources tracking the talks, a passed bill could give exchanges and crypto firms a set of clearer rules on how to register, list assets, and manage user funds. That might encourage more companies to operate in the US. People trading crypto could also see better protections. Critics worry that strict rules might push startups abroad. The choices lawmakers make will influence how money flows into the sector. Key Issues Around DeFi Oversight According to sources, the most contentious disagreements over changes involve DeFi. Senators continue to disagree over how such protocols should be regulated and who is liable when something goes wrong. While some lawmakers prefer narrow rules that won’t hurt small developers, others are pushing for broader authority over platforms that increasingly resemble traditional financial services.

Some analysts believe this movement is merely a relief rally preceding another downturn, while others maintain that a bull market is still in play despite a recent 30% correction. Current Data Suggests No Cycle Top Market analyst OxChain went on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), focusing on on-chain data to shed light on the current market dynamics and what investors might expect in the near future. He argues that the recent downturn does not exhibit characteristics typical of a cycle top. In October, Bitcoin reached the mid-$120,000 range before experiencing a subsequent decline of approximately 35%. Notably, this drop transpired without the hype, fervor, or speculation that usually accompany a market peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over? Key Levels To Watch The loss of nearly $1 trillion in market value underscores the underlying challenges. As Ethereum (ETH) and mid-cap cryptocurrencies simultaneously declined, there wasn’t an evident frenzy of speculation driving the downturn. Instead, OxChain attributes the decline primarily to a drop in demand. A slowdown in stablecoin creation and diminished inflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have led to reduced buying activity. Derivatives traders have also stepped back, with funding conditions softening and open interest unwinding. With market expectations recently leaning toward a potential interest rate cut in December, many buyers have opted to remain on the sidelines, preferring not to chase riskier assets. This hesitancy has led to a “fragile liquidity environment,” the analyst asserted. OxChain notes that even medium-sized orders can cause price changes of several percentage points due to the scarcity of resting bids. An examination of order book snapshots reveals that market depth has been waning during active trading periods, leading to a scenario where the market appears to be “running on fumes.” Bitcoin Market Struggles Without Conviction The situation in the derivatives market further supports this cautious outlook. Volatility has risen, with traders now leaning toward protective measures rather than building long positions. Interestingly, interest in futures contracts has decreased even amid small relief rallies, indicating that many traders are hesitant to take on larger positions. OxChain highlights a crucial trend: without leveraged conviction, market trends often struggle to gain momentum. On-chain data shows a more cautious sentiment among investors rather than outright fear. While the coin days destroyed (CDD) metric has risen due to older coins moving, much of the long-held Bitcoin remains with patient holders who are not in a rush to sell. Related Reading: Metaplanet In Jeopardy: Bitcoin Needs To Surpass $108,000 By December 18 To Prevent New Crisis Furthermore, the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR), hovering near 1, signals that there is neither extensive profit-taking nor widespread panic selling taking place. The analyst identified that the majority of selling activity has come from mid-term holders, contributing to a muted and indecisive market flow. Additionally, institutional investors remained relatively inactive throughout November. Significant outflows were reported in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which further contributed to the current state of the market. OxChain concluded his analysis by saying: The broader bullish narrative isn’t gone, but the near-term setup is fragile. Until a strong catalyst appears, expect a wandering market that drifts, chops, and tests lower levels.

55031107,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90855,1764313347,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Holders Were Sold on a 3-4 Digits This Year,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-holders-were-sold-on-a-3-4-digits-this-year/,"Discussion around XRP price expectations has intensified, and recent comments from crypto analyst Zach Rector have brought the community’s changing outlook into clear focus. Rector noted that many people in the community had believed XRP would reach extremely high levels this year, and he said some now direct their frustration at him for offering a more measured outlook. The analyst explained that despite disagreements, XRP continues to show strength , and he believes there is still meaningful long-term price appreciation ahead . He focused on keeping expectations realistic while recognizing the progress already made. Based off recent comments I can tell that many in the XRP community were sold on a 3-4 digit XRP this year. Now they take out their anger on me for saying $20 in 2026 I just want us to celebrate how well we are holding up and the significant price appreciation on the way! — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) November 25, 2025 Rector’s Forecast and the Reaction to It Rector pointed out that some XRP supporters have expected 3-4 digit prices in the near term. In contrast, he has stated that $20 by 2026 is a more reasonable target. According to him, this estimate has led some community members to respond with disappointment or criticism. He stressed that even if the asset does not reach extreme valuations quickly, long-term growth remains possible, and focusing on XRP’s stability gives a clearer picture of its performance. Emphasis on Learning and Long-Term Thinking X user Rohit Chaudhary supported Rector’s perspective by encouraging the community to let go of the idea of instant wealth. He stated that investors should spend more time understanding the market and developing the conviction needed to hold assets through various conditions. Chaudhary described XRP as a project with the potential to achieve strong value over a longer period, provided that holders remain patient and informed. He agreed with Rector’s general position and highlighted that growth comes from knowledge rather than urgency. Concerns About Influencer Predictions Another X user, New England Patriot, offered a different view by calling on influencers to move away from price predictions altogether. He argued that models and projections have been repeated for years without results, stating that the focus should instead be on what Ripple is actually accomplishing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that many people follow influencers because they want to believe in the possibility of sudden wealth, which encourages unrealistic expectations. His message to Rector was to keep coverage factual and straightforward rather than speculative. The discussion about Rector’s comments reveals clear differences in how XRP supporters think about the asset’s future. Some believe in steady, informed long-term growth, while others prefer a strict focus on verifiable developments rather than projections. Together, these viewpoints reflect an ongoing debate within the community about expectations, patience, and the role of influencers in shaping sentiment.

Our ENA price prediction expects a maximum of $0.82 in 2025. In 2031, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethena Ticker ENA Price $0.28 (-0.1%) Market cap $3.59 Trading volume (24-hour) $457M Circulating supply 7.15B ENA All-time high $1.52 (11 April, 2024) All-time low $0.1858 (11 October, 2025) ENA technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.28 Price Prediction $ 0.2240 (-1.24%) Fear & Greed Index 42 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 13.66% (Very High) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.5147 200-Day SMA $ 0.4819 14-Day RSI 32.19 (Neutral) ENA price analysis Resistance for ENA is at $0.3001 Support for ENA/USD is at $0.2517 The ENA price analysis for November 28 confirms that ENA witnessed bearish pressure as it declines toward $0.28. Currently, the ENA price is preparing for a bearish rally. Ethena price analysis 1-day chart: ENA price triggers bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of ENA tokens, ENA witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price toward support lines. Sellers are now aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels around $0.28. The 24-hour volume dropped toward $37.97 million, showing a decline in trading interest today. Ethena’s price is currently trading at $0.28, which has dropped by over 0.1% in the last 24 hours. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers within the neutral level at 27, showing that bears control price momentum slightly. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. ENA/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour ENA price chart suggests that ENA experienced a bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, buyers aim for a strong rebound above the EMA20 trend line. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.16, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening selling positions. ENA price predictions: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.4590 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.4286 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.4654 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.4656 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.5147 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.6009 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.4819 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.4700 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.5112 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.5680 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.6112 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.5906 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.5263 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.4938 SELL What to expect from ENA price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the ENA price from an immediate surge. However, if the ENA price successfully breaks above $0.3001, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.3590. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2517, resulting in a correction to $0.2166. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price down today? ENA’s price gained selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a minor downward push. This created a decline toward $0.28. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.3 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2032 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on ENA Terminal Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) incubated by Ethena Labs, has attracted more than $262 million in total value locked (TVL) ahead of its upcoming launch. Ethena (ENA) price prediction November 2025 Over the last few days, ENA prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $120K in November, we might see a solid surge in the ENA price. According to technical analysis, the ENA price might record a maximum level of $0.44 and a minimum of $0.25, with an average value of $0.35 throughout November.

ENA historical price sentiment ENA Price History: Coinmarketcap Ethena’s price history from mid-2024 to late 2025 shows a period of intense volatility marked by sharp fluctuations in both price and market capitalization. In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October. Throughout this period, Ethena’s market cap ranged from $1 billion to over $5 billion. In early November, the price of ENA declined toward $0.3.",Crypto Price Predictions|ENA|Ethena,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-28 07:06:37

The bulls are attempting to shape the uptrend toward key hurdles at $2.36 and $2.52, with the resistance level around $2.3 still proving to be difficult for the bulls to overcome. Despite the current market conditions, XRP spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to record steady inflows, indicating growing institutional interest. Ripple RLUSD receives regulatory approval in the UAE XRP is up by less than 1% in the last 24 hours and is trading around $2.2 per coin. This performance comes despite Ripple USD (RLUSD), a Ripple-backed stablecoin, gaining approval as an Accepted Fiat-Reference Token by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in Abu Dhabi . This regulatory approval allows the use of RLUSD within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). As such, RLUSD is now eligible for use by Authorised Persons licensed by the FSRA to provide regulated financial services, as long as they comply with the set regulations. While commenting on the approval, Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of Stablecoins at Ripple, stated that, “The FSRA’s recognition of RLUSD as a Fiat-Referenced Token reinforces our commitment to regulatory compliance and trust – two non-negotiables when it comes to institutional finance.” Arvind Ramamurthy, the Chief Market Development Officer at ADGM, added that he looks forward to Ripple making use of the region’s robust regulatory framework, designed to support the sustainable growth of innovative firms and ensure the highest international standards of governance and compliance. RLUSD is fast becoming one of the leading stablecoins in the crypto space, with a market cap of over $1.2 billion. The stablecoin launched in 2024 and is issued under the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). In addition to the adoption, XRP ETFs continue to attract inflows. They recorded nearly $22 million in inflows on Wednesday, making it the ninth consecutive day of steady inflows. This brings the cumulative net volume to approximately $644 million and net assets to $676 million, indicating that institutional investors are paying attention to altcoin-based ETFs. XRP bulls eye the $2.35 mark The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bearish and inefficient as XRP has failed to push past the $2.35 resistance level over the past few days. XRP tested and found support around the $1.85 level during the weekend and has surged past $2.0 since then. However, RP has been consolidating around $2.20 mark since Tuesday. At press time, XRP is still trading around $2.2. If XRP recovers, it could rally towards the first major resistance level at $2.35, which coincides with the 50-day EMA at $2.36. The 4-hour RSI of 54 is above the neutral level, indicating a growing bullish narrative. In addition to that, the MACD lines are also within the positive territory as buyers have been in control this week. However, if the bulls fail to push above the key resistance level, XRP could extend its decline towards the daily support level around $1.96.

As per data released on Friday, core prices in the country rose 2.8%, the same as last month and exceeding the forecast of 2.7%. The persistent inflation stats arrive as other economic indicators point to pockets of strength. The rising inflation in Japan shows the Bank of Japan where prices are headed Economists had predicted that consumer prices would increase by 2.7% in November, but they actually rose by 2.8%, the same rate as in October. The costs of energy increased rapidly, resulting in higher bills for households. The prices of processed foods also increased, but more slowly. However, it was not enough to slow inflation down. These new numbers indicate to the BOJ that inflation is steady and spreading to various areas of the economy. Investors, traders, and businesses argue that the bank will need to take action soon, as prices are affecting household budgets and the economy as a whole. It’s not only the cost of goods that is increasing, but also the prices of services, and companies are slowly passing their higher costs to consumers. Costs in services increased by 1.5%, which is still slower than the rise in goods such as food and electricity. Some of the fastest-growing prices are starting to slow down, as the price of rice has increased by 37.9% compared to 93.8% in April. Still, families are paying significantly more for electricity, food, and other essentials, making life harder for them, and businesses raise their prices or adjust wages to cover the increased costs. Inflation is affecting every part of the economy, and traders say the BOJ now has every reason to increase its rates in December or when 2026 starts. The data indicate that inflation is likely to persist, so adjusting interest rates will help support long-term economic growth. New economic data shows that inflation will keep increasing even with help from the government The Japanese economy is still growing, despite rising costs of goods and services. The BOJ can use this data to know the strengths and pressures that the economy faces and determine the best time or period to increase rates. Factories and businesses continue to produce more goods, and industrial production even increased by 1.4%. The unemployment rate also remained at 2.6%, and the jobs-to-applicant ratio decreased to 1.18. These numbers indicate that most people seeking employment can find work, as there are more job openings than available candidates to fill them. Consequently, salaries may increase over time as companies compete for workers. However, higher wages could force companies to increase the prices of goods, and in turn, inflation will rise even higher. Nevertheless, households will have more money to spend. This loop indicates that Japan’s economy is not slowing down. Investors and policymakers even believe the economy can handle higher interest rates without collapsing. The government is also taking measures to help households manage the rising cost of living and slow down inflation. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently announced a ¥17.7 trillion ($113 billion) stimulus package to subsidize the impact of the rising costs of goods and services. Analysts at SMBC Nikko Securities predict that the stimulus could lower the core consumer price index by approximately 0.38 % points next year, resulting in a slight slowdown in inflation. However, households may continue to struggle with rising costs, even with this stimulus, because real wages in the country have fallen for nine consecutive months and cannot keep pace with the increasing prices of food, fuel, and services. Labor unions also said that inflation will continue to rise faster than wages if the yen remains weak, so the stimulus won’t have a significant long-term effect, even though it will offer some relief.

Prominent macro investor Raoul Pal just dropped a bombshell comparison that puts the Bitcoin growth stage in perspective. He suggests we’re witnessing something similar to Google’s position back in 2017 – already successful but with massive runway ahead. What Does the Bitcoin Growth Stage Comparison Really Mean? When Raoul Pal compares Bitcoin to Google in 2017, he’s highlighting several key similarities. Both had achieved significant market penetration but were far from reaching their full potential. The Bitcoin growth stage today mirrors that exciting period where mainstream adoption was accelerating rapidly. Consider these parallel developments: Increasing institutional adoption Growing regulatory clarity Expanding real-world use cases Maturing infrastructure and technology Why Is Bitcoin’s Commercialization So Significant? Pal emphasizes that Bitcoin’s rapid commercialization doesn’t mean the party’s over. Actually, it signals the opposite. The current Bitcoin growth stage represents the beginning of widespread acceptance rather than the end of innovation. Think about Google in 2017. The company was already dominant in search, but cloud computing, AI, and other revenue streams were just beginning to explode. Similarly, Bitcoin’s potential extends far beyond its current applications. Where Does Ethereum Fit in This Growth Picture? Here’s where things get even more interesting. Pal suggests Ethereum is at an even earlier Bitcoin growth stage than Bitcoin itself. This positioning implies potentially greater upside for ETH investors who understand the technology’s evolving role. Key factors supporting Ethereum’s growth trajectory: DeFi ecosystem expansion NFT market maturation Enterprise blockchain adoption Upcoming protocol improvements What Challenges Could Affect Bitcoin’s Growth Trajectory? While the comparison to Google’s 2017 position is exciting, investors should remain aware of potential hurdles. The Bitcoin growth stage faces unique challenges that traditional companies like Google didn’t encounter. These include regulatory uncertainty, technological scalability issues, and market volatility. However, each challenge also represents an opportunity for further development and maturation. How Can Investors Position Themselves for This Growth Phase? Understanding where we are in the Bitcoin growth stage cycle helps investors make informed decisions. Pal’s analysis suggests we’re still in the early innings of cryptocurrency adoption, particularly for assets like Ethereum. Actionable insights for investors: Dollar-cost averaging into established cryptocurrencies Researching emerging use cases and technologies Monitoring regulatory developments closely Maintaining a long-term perspective What’s the Ultimate Takeaway from This Comparison? Raoul Pal’s Google comparison provides a powerful framework for understanding cryptocurrency’s potential. The current Bitcoin growth stage represents not a peak, but rather a launching pad for the next phase of digital asset evolution. Just as early Google investors were rewarded for recognizing the company’s long-term potential, today’s cryptocurrency investors might look back at this period as a golden opportunity. The parallel suggests we’re witnessing history in the making. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Raoul Pal say about Bitcoin’s growth stage? Raoul Pal stated that Bitcoin is at a growth stage similar to Google’s position in 2017, meaning it has achieved significant commercialization but still has enormous potential for future expansion. How does Ethereum compare to Bitcoin in terms of growth potential? According to Pal, Ethereum is at an even earlier stage in its growth cycle than Bitcoin, suggesting it may have greater upside potential as its ecosystem continues to develop. Why is the Google comparison relevant for cryptocurrency investors? The comparison helps investors understand where we are in the adoption cycle and provides context for evaluating future growth potential based on historical tech company trajectories. What risks should investors consider during this growth stage? Investors should be aware of regulatory changes, market volatility, technological challenges, and competition from other blockchain projects. How long might this growth stage last? While impossible to predict exactly, growth stages in technology adoption typically last several years, with multiple phases of expansion and consolidation. What indicators should I watch to track Bitcoin’s growth progress? Key indicators include institutional adoption rates, regulatory developments, technological improvements, trading volume, and real-world use case expansion. Found this analysis insightful?

This expiry event is larger than usual because it is the end of the month, so there may be some impact on spot markets, which have been mostly struggling to recover from this month’s meltdown. US government economic data has started to flow again this week, with PPI inflation data coming in higher than expected, which is bearish for crypto markets. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.58, meaning that there are significantly more long contracts expiring than shorts. Max pain is around $100,000, according to Coinglass. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $100,000, which has $2.2 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also almost $2 billion in OI at $80k and $85k targeted by short sellers. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is at $57 billion, according to Coinglass. Earlier this week, CryptoQuant reported that the market “just witnessed the largest drop in Open Interest of the current cycle.” “This move does not signal the start of a bear market; rather, it reflects a major leverage washout (Long Squeeze).” “Positioning appears to have stabilized following recent volatility, with open interest now clustering around the $100K level, despite the fear,” reported Deribit. “This elevated call interest may indicate improving sentiment after the volatility we have seen.” November Options Expiry Alert. Over $15.4B in BTC + ETH options expire tomorrow at 08:00 UTC on Deribit, closing out a month of dramatic volatility. $BTC : Put/Call: 0.58 (calls dominate) | Max Pain: $100K Positioning appears to have stabilized following recent volatility,… pic.twitter.com/xloKXU8fWQ — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) November 27, 2025 In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 573,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $1.7 billion, max pain at $3,400, and a put/call ratio of 0.50. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $11.5 billion. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $15 billion. “Following the recent deleveraging across crypto markets, positioning has cooled into a more neutral stance around a key support and resistance zone,” observed Deribit. Spot Market Outlook Crypto markets haven’t moved much over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization remaining at $3.2 trillion. Bitcoin tapped $91,800 three times over the past day but was beaten back by resistance every time. It currently floats just below $91,000. Ether has struggled to maintain any momentum over $3,000 and had fallen back below it at the time of writing on Friday morning in Asia.

Related News: Legendary Analyst il Capo Shares His Expectations for Altcoins Following Recent Bitcoin Rally Hassett's rapid rise to prominence is critical for markets. The economist is known for his long-standing advocacy of faster and deeper interest rate cuts, his growth-focused and market-friendly approach, his support for the Fed's independence, and his overall macro vision, which is perceived as positive for both stock and crypto markets. Consequently, recent trends in prediction markets have fueled increased optimism, particularly in risk assets. Investors interpret Hassett's approach to the presidency as a sign of a stronger likelihood of looser monetary policy heading into 2025. Donald Trump has long been a harsh critic of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

The Dvision delisting from both Bithumb and Coinone marks a crucial moment for this blockchain project and its community. Why Are Major Exchanges Delisting Dvision? Bithumb and Coinone announced they will remove DVI trading pairs effective 6:00 a.m. UTC on December 29. This Dvision delisting follows extensive reviews by both exchanges. They determined the project’s materials failed to address initial investment warnings adequately. The exchanges specifically cited concerns about: Insufficient project disclosures Questionable business viability Uncertain sustainability metrics Failure to meet continued trading criteria What Does This Dvision Delisting Mean for Investors? If you hold DVI tokens on either exchange, immediate action is required. The Dvision delisting means trading will cease completely. However, you still have time to withdraw your tokens to private wallets. Consider these critical steps: Withdraw DVI tokens before December 29 deadline Research alternative exchanges that support DVI Evaluate your investment strategy carefully Monitor official project announcements How Do Exchanges Make Delisting Decisions? Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone follow strict evaluation processes. The Dvision delisting resulted from failing to meet multiple criteria. Exchanges regularly assess projects based on: Technical development progress Community engagement levels Regulatory compliance status Trading volume and liquidity Project transparency and communication What’s Next After the Dvision Delisting? The December 29 Dvision delisting creates significant challenges for the project. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean the end for DVI. Many projects continue trading on other platforms or rebuild their exchange relationships. Key factors to watch include: Project team response and action plan Potential listings on other exchanges Community support and development continuity Market reaction and price impact Frequently Asked Questions What happens to my DVI tokens after delisting? You must withdraw them to a compatible wallet before December 29. After delisting, you cannot trade or withdraw DVI from Bithumb or Coinone. Can Dvision get relisted in the future? Yes, if the project addresses exchange concerns and meets listing criteria again. However, this typically requires significant improvements and time. Are other exchanges delisting DVI too? Currently, only Bithumb and Coinone have announced delisting. Monitor other exchanges for similar announcements. Should I sell my DVI tokens immediately? This depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Consider consulting with financial advisors and researching alternative trading platforms. What wallet should I use for DVI tokens? Use wallets that support ERC-20 tokens or check Dvision’s official website for recommended wallet options. How does delisting affect token price? Delisting typically creates selling pressure and reduced liquidity, which often negatively impacts price in the short term.

Memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) fill the headlines due to price actions and community-driven stories, but beneath the hype lie pitfalls. Meanwhile, there’s a new promising altcoin known as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has been steadily moving through its highly successful presale. As presale phase six of Mutuum Finance draws to a close, the platform is exhibiting the characteristics of the next big cryptocurrency to break through and provides a realistic alternative to the unpredictable hype of meme coins. For the investor who doesn’t necessarily live from trend to trend, this $0.035 token provides a calculated risk of the growth prospects of this protocol. Shiba Inu’s Volatility due Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently saw a significant fall, going as low as $0.0000071 and registering a steep fall of 15% in a week. However, early indications of the beginning of a recovery phase driven by the increasing interest and liquidity in the meme markets are also evident in the price movement of SHIB. The value of its asset price is driven entirely by hype cycles because the ecosystem itself, which has the Shibarium layer 2 network, is developing but the financial utility benefits it has been providing its users remain questionable. As far as investors who are looking at growth prospects that can be dealt with through proper planning are concerned, the landscape has become pretty uncertain for SHIB. Presale Phase Six Nears Total Sellout While the Shiba Inu market has the characteristics of a speculative market, MUTM has already shown measurable levels of demand through its clear-cut presale event. Already, MUTM has raised $19,020,000 from its holders who number 18,250. The presale has entered its sixth level and has sold about 95% of its allocation at the current price of $0.035. This price reflects a jump of 250% from the first phase, signifying intense initial momentum. The window of opportunity for the acquisition of MUTM at this price will soon be closing as the next phase will see the price jump to $0.040 before resting at a $0.06 launch price. The quickly narrowing window presents MUTM as a promising prospect for those interested in pre-exchange investing and exchange listing momentum. Innovative Dual Lending Model In addition to the pre-sale success, the interesting thing about the ecological development of Mutuum Finance is the sophistication of the lending platform the company has been developing. One of the innovations the protocol has introduced is the two-layer lending market combining the P2C and P2P models. In the P2C model, there’s automated pool liquidity for in-demand assets such as ETH and USDT. These assets generate passive income when users deposit them. However, the P2P platform also allows users to create customized loaning contracts involving a broader array of digital assets. This allows them to take control of the loaning circumstances. The hybrid approach of the platform assures efficient use of capital as well as easy access to the market. This utility ranks high compared to the hype-driven value of meme coins and provides a tangible reason to regard MUTM as one of the best cryptos to buy. Streamlined Purchases To minimize the entry barrier, the company has introduced direct card payments for the MUTM token. This move will benefit the users of the platform as the company has a strong emphasis on security. The lending and borrowing smart contract of the protocol has been undergoing an audit at Halborn Security, which is a recognized security company. This thorough code review of the completed code is an entirely crucial step in building trust and functionality before being used on live user exchange transactions. The amalgamation of easy token access and the best possible security approach provides MUTM a rather attractive and secure new entry in the world of cryptocurrency because many coins rely solely on the hype factor of their momentum. Secure Your Position Before the Launch While Shiba Inu deals with marketing mania, Mutuum Finance sets the pace for the sustainable future of decentralized finance. The almost sold-out presale phase presents the last chance for investors to enter the promising project offered by the unique technological solution and its high market value. The option to buy at $0.035 has an expiration date when Phase 6 completes. Those waiting for the next crypto to explode based on real-world applications should do best to not wait.

Recent analysis reveals a fascinating development: Bitcoin is experiencing a temporary Bitcoin decoupling from global liquidity trends. This unexpected shift could signal important changes ahead for cryptocurrency investors and market watchers. What Does Bitcoin Decoupling Mean for Investors? According to BeInCrypto’s latest research, Bitcoin has shown a clear Bitcoin decoupling from the growth of global broad money since mid-2025. This separation from traditional liquidity patterns marks a significant departure from historical behavior. Historically, BTC typically reacts to liquidity expansion after a 60 to 70 day delay. This temporary Bitcoin decoupling suggests the current cycle’s bull rally might arrive later than expected. Analysis indicates we could see the major price movement delayed until late 2025 or even 2026. The pattern break shows Bitcoin maturing as an asset class. Why Is This Bitcoin Decoupling Happening Now? Several factors contribute to this unexpected Bitcoin decoupling . Market dynamics are shifting as global economic conditions evolve. The traditional relationship between money supply and Bitcoin price appears to be undergoing transformation. Key factors influencing this Bitcoin decoupling include: Changing institutional adoption patterns Evolving regulatory landscapes Shifting investor sentiment toward digital assets Global economic uncertainty driving alternative investments What Market Shocks Could Impact Bitcoin in 2026? Market analyst NoLimitGains projects several global shock factors emerging simultaneously in 2026. These potential disruptions could significantly affect the ongoing Bitcoin decoupling trend. The analyst identifies three major risk areas that could converge. The projected shock factors include: Weakening demand for U.S. Treasurys Reduction in Japanese yen carry trade activity Credit risks emerging in Chinese markets How Will Central Bank Responses Affect Bitcoin? When central banks eventually provide liquidity to address these shocks, hedge assets like Bitcoin typically strengthen. This Bitcoin decoupling phase might precede a period where Bitcoin reconnects with traditional safe-haven assets. The analyst suggests Bitcoin, gold, and commodities could see significant strength during this phase. The current Bitcoin decoupling provides valuable insight into how digital assets behave during economic transitions. Understanding these patterns helps investors make informed decisions about portfolio allocation and risk management. What Should Investors Watch During This Bitcoin Decoupling? Monitoring this Bitcoin decoupling requires attention to specific indicators. Watch global money supply data, central bank announcements, and Bitcoin’s price reactions. The temporary nature of this decoupling means investors should prepare for potential reconnection scenarios. Key monitoring areas include: Global M2 money supply trends Central bank policy announcements Bitcoin trading volume patterns Institutional investment flows Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Decoupling Landscape The current Bitcoin decoupling from global liquidity represents both challenge and opportunity. While it may delay the expected bull rally, it also demonstrates Bitcoin’s evolving market role. Investors who understand these dynamics can position themselves advantageously for the eventual market reconnection. This temporary separation highlights Bitcoin’s growing maturity as an asset class. The Bitcoin decoupling phase offers valuable lessons about digital asset behavior in changing economic conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What causes Bitcoin to decouple from global liquidity? Bitcoin decoupling occurs when market factors like changing investor behavior, regulatory developments, or unique cryptocurrency dynamics cause Bitcoin to move independently from traditional financial indicators. How long do Bitcoin decoupling phases typically last? Historical patterns suggest temporary decoupling phases can last several months, though the current analysis indicates this particular separation began in mid-2025. Should investors worry about Bitcoin decoupling? Not necessarily. Decoupling phases often represent normal market evolution and can create buying opportunities for informed investors who understand the underlying causes. Will Bitcoin eventually reconnect with global liquidity trends? Analysis suggests yes – most decoupling phases are temporary, though the reconnection timing and strength can vary based on broader economic conditions. How does Bitcoin decoupling affect portfolio strategy? During decoupling phases, investors might consider adjusting their allocation strategies to account for Bitcoin’s independent price movements and reduced correlation with traditional assets. What indicators signal the end of a Bitcoin decoupling phase? Watch for returning correlation with global money supply data, synchronized price movements with other hedge assets, and changing institutional investment patterns. Found this analysis helpful?

According to recent technical analysis, this stunning Bitcoin price prediction might become reality based on Fibonacci retracement patterns that have accurately forecasted major moves in the past. What Makes This Bitcoin Price Prediction So Compelling? FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich revealed to CoinDesk that BTC has broken through the crucial $91,000 resistance level. This recovery represents the 61.8% Fibonacci golden ratio level from the November decline. The current Bitcoin price prediction suggests that maintaining this level could trigger the next major upward movement. Fibonacci retracement works by identifying key support and resistance levels based on mathematical ratios. Traders watch these levels closely because they often predict where price reversals might occur. The current analysis indicates that Bitcoin has successfully tested one of the most important Fibonacci levels. How Fibonacci Analysis Supports the $100K Bitcoin Price Prediction The Fibonacci tool measures the depth of pullbacks within larger trends. When prices bounce strongly from these key levels, it signals continued bullish momentum. Kuptsikevich’s Bitcoin price prediction relies on this precise technical setup. Key factors supporting this Bitcoin price prediction include: • Golden ratio breakthrough at 61.8% retracement • Sustained momentum above $91,000 • Historical pattern consistency in crypto markets • Growing institutional interest in Bitcoin Why Should Traders Trust This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Fibonacci analysis has proven remarkably accurate in cryptocurrency markets. The mathematical nature of these patterns removes emotional bias from trading decisions. However, remember that all predictions carry risk, and market conditions can change rapidly. Successful traders use multiple confirmation signals before acting on any Bitcoin price prediction. They combine technical analysis with fundamental factors and market sentiment. This comprehensive approach helps validate whether a Bitcoin price prediction has strong supporting evidence. What Are the Potential Challenges to This Bitcoin Price Prediction? While the current Bitcoin price prediction appears promising, several factors could affect its accuracy. Market volatility remains high, and unexpected regulatory news could impact prices. Additionally, the broader economic environment influences cryptocurrency values. Traders should monitor these key indicators: • Trading volume confirmation • Market sentiment shifts • Global economic developments • Technical breakdown levels Actionable Insights From This Bitcoin Price Prediction If you’re considering this Bitcoin price prediction for trading decisions, start with proper risk management. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market perfectly. The most successful traders use Bitcoin price predictions as one tool among many. They combine technical analysis with their own research and risk tolerance. Remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, even with reliable tools like Fibonacci retracement. Final Thoughts on This Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction The current Bitcoin price prediction offers an exciting glimpse into potential market movements. The Fibonacci analysis provides mathematical support for the $100,000 target, but market conditions remain dynamic. Whether this Bitcoin price prediction materializes depends on sustained buying pressure and positive market sentiment. As always, conduct your own research and consult financial advisors before making investment decisions. The cryptocurrency market offers tremendous opportunities but requires careful navigation and risk management. Frequently Asked Questions What is Fibonacci retracement in cryptocurrency trading? Fibonacci retracement uses mathematical ratios to identify potential support and resistance levels in price charts, helping traders predict where reversals might occur. How reliable are Bitcoin price predictions based on technical analysis? While technical analysis provides valuable insights, no prediction is 100% accurate. Successful traders use multiple indicators and risk management strategies. What time frame does this Bitcoin price prediction cover? The analyst suggests the $100,000 target could be reached “soon” if current support levels hold, typically meaning weeks rather than months in crypto trading terms. Should I invest based solely on this Bitcoin price prediction? Never make investment decisions based on a single analysis. Consider multiple factors including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. What other indicators confirm this Bitcoin price prediction? Traders should watch for sustained volume, positive market sentiment, and confirmation from other technical indicators like moving averages and RSI. What happens if Bitcoin fails to reach $100,000? All predictions carry risk. If the price doesn’t reach the target, traders should have exit strategies and risk management plans in place. Found this Bitcoin price prediction analysis helpful?

The stock surged for the fifth consecutive day on Friday, driven by investor enthusiasm over Google’s AI chip deals and new Gemini model, which brought its weekly climb to over 20%. MediaTek is collaborating with a division of Alphabet Inc. for the design of tensor processing units (TPUs), which are reportedly being viewed as a possible rival to Nvidia’s chips in AI applications. However, the company has allegedly been facing a bleak outlook for its end products. It has also faced increased margin pressure due to high development costs and competition. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analysts Daniel Yen and Charlie Chan noted that MediaTek’s business in China has remained challenging throughout the year and is likely to continue into next year. However, the upside of Google’s TPUs should offset the headwind in MediaTek’s smartphone department. The analysts upgraded the company’s stock from equal-weight to overweight on November 27 as AI news brought relief for its shares. However, the stock is still down roughly 2% YTD. UBS analysts raise MediaTek’s 2027 TPU sales estimate to $4B Sunny Lin led UBS Group AG analysts in raising their projections for the contribution of TPUs in MediaTek’s 2027 sales from $1.8 billion to $4 billion. The analysts also estimate that the chips will account for nearly 20% of MediaTek’s operating profit by 2028, depending on execution by both Google and MediaTek. Meanwhile, the analysts observed that training LLMs using mostly Nvidia’s GPUs is soon coming to an end, as a shift in focus to inference is putting a spotlight on TPUs. They noted that part of the excitement during this week was due to news that Meta plans to use Google’s TPUs for its data centers in 2027. MediaTek is expected to see further potential upside from the additional Meta ASIC projects, according to UBS. Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts led by Arthur Lai also said that, in terms of investing in AI stocks in the future, they lean more towards MediaTek over other Google partners and Nvidia’s supply chain. The sell-side is bullish on MediaTek, with 23 buy recommendations, 10 holds, and no sell recommendations. The company’s stock is also expected to rise 9% over the next year. MediaTek’s cloud AI chips to generate $1B in 2026 revenue Rick Tsai, MediaTek’s Vice Chairman and CEO, stated that his company is poised to generate $1 billion in 2026 revenue from its cloud AI chips. He disclosed that the company’s first project is expected to generate multiple billions in 2027, while another project will start generating revenue from 2028 and beyond. Tsai also estimated that the TAM (total addressable market) for data center ASIC chips is currently at $50 billion, and MediaTek aims to capture at least a 10%-15% market share over the next two years. He noted that even Nvidia’s $5 billion investment in Intel could not impact his company’s prospects. Tsai also believes the news will not affect his company’s joint effort with Nvidia on the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. The GB10 chip is used in Nvidia’s personal AI supercomputer DGX Spark, which went on sale last month. Meanwhile, in October, MediaTek reported Q3 revenue of $4.64 million (T$142.1 million), up 7.8% YoY but down 5.5% QoQ. The net income also decreased by 0.5% YoY to T$25.5 million, while the consolidated net income was down 9.3% QoQ. The consolidated operating income was down 24.5% QoQ and 7% YoY at T$22.18 million.

Our PENGU price prediction expects a maximum of $0.0791 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the PENGU price to achieve $0.2. Pudgy Penguins is a set of 8,888 flightless bird NFTs that launched in July 2021 for about $90 each. It sold out quickly and gained attention, even appearing on the cover of the New York Times a month later. Within a few months, the cheapest penguin on the market was selling for over $6,000. However, prices dropped to around $1,000 in early 2022 as the NFT hype faded and issues arose within the community. Many were unhappy with the founder, Cole Villemain (aka ColeThereum), due to accusations of poor management. This led to a community vote to remove Cole. In January 2022, investor Luca Netz offered to buy the project for about $2.5 million. The deal went through a few months later. After Netz took over, the project’s value bounced back—floor prices doubled in just a few days. With new leadership and a fresh roadmap, Pudgy Penguins started rebuilding its reputation as a top NFT project. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Pudgy Penguins price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will Pengu reach $1?” and explore the factors behind PENGU token price prediction, providing insights into the role and utility of the PENGU token.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the PENGU price from an immediate surge. However, if the PENGU price successfully breaks above $0.016, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.026. PENGU/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, PENGU price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0098, resulting in a correction to $0.0038. Is PENGU a good investment? Whether PENGU is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. The coin has support from the popular Pudgy Penguins brand, which has grown through NFTs, merchandise, and big deals like selling toys at Walmart—these could help increase interest in the coin. But the price is still very unpredictable and can change quickly. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the PENGU price down today? PENGU’s price gained strong selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $0.011. Will Pudgy Penguins price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.015 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will PENGU reach $0.2? Pengu price might reach the $0.2 mark in 2031 if buying demand surges and Pengu attracts altcoin investors. Will Pengu reach $1? The $1 mark is a distant dream for Pengu token. This price level is achievable in the long run if Pengu continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Pudgy Penguins a good long-term investment? Pengu token has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, seek independent professional consultation into their long-term potential to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

55033434,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=223899,1764316510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Stablecoin Issuers Explosion: Polygon Visionary Predicts 100,000+ Players in 5 Years",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoin-issuers-growth-prediction/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Issuers Explosion: Polygon Visionary Predicts 100,000+ Players in 5 Years Imagine a world where stablecoin issuers multiply from hundreds to over 100,000 in just five years. This isn’t science fiction – it’s the bold prediction from Polygon’s payments chief that could reshape global finance as we know it. Why Are Stablecoin Issuers Set for Explosive Growth? Aishwary Gupta, Head of Payments and RWAs at Polygon, sees an incoming super cycle for digital currencies. He believes we’ll witness an unprecedented surge in stablecoin issuers globally. This transformation represents more than just technological advancement – it’s a fundamental shift in how we perceive and use money. Gupta’s vision extends beyond simple cryptocurrency adoption. He sees stablecoin issuers becoming as common as local businesses. The current financial landscape, dominated by traditional banks and limited digital options, will give way to a diverse ecosystem of stablecoin providers. How Do Stablecoins Actually Strengthen National Currencies? Contrary to popular belief, stablecoin issuers don’t weaken central bank authority. Gupta explains they actually expand currency demand. When more people use dollar-pegged stablecoins, for example, it increases global demand for US dollars. This creates a powerful reinforcement cycle: More stablecoin usage means more underlying currency demand Increased demand strengthens the national currency’s global position Central banks maintain control while benefiting from expanded influence What Does This Mean for Traditional Banking? The rise of stablecoin issuers will fundamentally challenge traditional banks. As capital moves into stablecoins, bank deposits will naturally decrease. This shift forces global banks to adapt or risk becoming irrelevant. Gupta predicts banks will respond by issuing Deposit Tokens. These represent tokenized versions of customer deposits, blending traditional banking with blockchain technology. It’s not about replacement – it’s about evolution and coexistence. Who Will Become the New Stablecoin Issuers? The future landscape of stablecoin issuers will be incredibly diverse. We’re not just talking about tech companies and financial institutions. Local businesses, community organizations, and even individuals could become stablecoin providers. This democratization of currency issuance represents: Greater financial inclusion for underserved communities More competition leading to better services and lower fees Innovation driven by diverse perspectives and needs What Challenges Will These Stablecoin Issuers Face? While the growth potential is massive, new stablecoin issuers must navigate significant hurdles. Regulatory compliance will be paramount, requiring clear frameworks and transparent operations. Security concerns demand robust protection systems, while user trust becomes the ultimate currency. Successful stablecoin issuers will need to balance innovation with responsibility, creating systems that are both cutting-edge and reliable. The Future Is Already Here Gupta’s prediction of 100,000 stablecoin issuers might seem ambitious, but the foundations are already being laid. The infrastructure supporting this expansion continues to mature daily, while regulatory clarity gradually emerges across jurisdictions. Most importantly, user adoption grows exponentially as people recognize the benefits of digital currencies. We’re witnessing the early stages of a financial revolution that will make stablecoin issuers as commonplace as website domains. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are stablecoin issuers? Stablecoin issuers are entities that create and manage digital currencies pegged to stable assets like national currencies or commodities. They ensure the stablecoin maintains its value and can be redeemed for the underlying asset. Why would we need so many stablecoin issuers? Different stablecoin issuers can serve various markets, regions, and use cases. Some might focus on cross-border payments, others on specific industries, creating a diverse ecosystem that better serves global financial needs. How do stablecoins strengthen national currencies? When stablecoins are pegged to a national currency, increased usage creates more demand for that currency internationally. This expanded usage actually strengthens the currency’s global position rather than weakening it. What are Deposit Tokens? Deposit Tokens are bank-issued digital tokens representing customer deposits on blockchain networks. They’re traditional banking’s response to stablecoins, combining bank security with blockchain efficiency. Is this growth prediction realistic? Given current adoption rates and technological advancements, the prediction aligns with similar digital transformations we’ve witnessed in other industries. The infrastructure and demand both support this projected growth. How will regulation affect stablecoin issuers? Clear regulations will actually help legitimate stablecoin issuers by providing frameworks for operation and building public trust. Well-designed regulation supports growth while protecting users.

Kim introduced his intrinsic value dashboard, which he prepared on social media, using the phrase, “How much is ETH actually worth? The crypto industry deserves better than pure price speculation.” Kim's dashboard is based on a total of 10 different valuation methodologies, combining both traditional finance models and crypto-specific metrics to determine Ethereum's fair value. Classic finance tools like DCF, price-to-sales ratio, and revenue yield are also considered, as are crypto-native models like TVL multiplier, MC/TVL, Metcalfe's Law, staking rarity, Layer 2 ecosystem, loyalty bonus, and execution capital.

Here's the Probability According to the system, Ethereum's current price is $3,037.5, while the fair value calculated based on the average of 10 models is $4,574. This suggests that ETH is approximately 50.6% “underpriced.” ETH is trading at $3,037.5, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours, with a total market capitalization of $366.5 billion and trading volume of $854.1 million. The asset is still 37.7% below its all-time high of $4,946.1. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin Puell Multiple Has Dropped To 0.67 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple. The “Puell Multiple” refers to a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily BTC mining revenue (in USD) and 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be At Risk Of A Deeper Bear If This Ratio Compresses, Says Glassnode Miners earn their income through two sources: block subsidy and transaction fees. In the context of the metric, however, only the former part of their revenue is relevant. Block subsidy is a fixed BTC-denominated reward that miners receive when they add the next block to the chain. Usually, it makes up for the dominant and stable part of miner income. When the value of the Puell Multiple is greater than 1, it means that the network validators are earning a higher revenue from block subsidy than the average for the past year. On the other hand, the metric being under the mark implies miners are making less than usual. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has witnessed a rapid decline recently that has taken its value below the 1 level. This drop in the metric is a result of the bearish price action that the cryptocurrency has faced. The block subsidy is fixed in BTC value and is more-or-less also fixed in rate of time, so the daily BTC income from it is about constant for miners. The USD value of the reward, however, is dependent on the asset’s spot price, which is indeed variable. The earlier bull run resulted in the Puell Multiple rising above the 1 mark as miner revenue from block subsidy surged. Similarly, the market downturn has led to a decline in the USD miner income. Today, the metric’s value is 0.67, meaning that the chain validators are making just 67% of the average revenue from the last 365 days. Historically, miners being under a high amount of pressure has made bottoms more probable for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, the major bottoms since 2015 have generally formed when the Puell Multiple has dipped below 0.50. If the current cycle is also going to follow a similar pattern, then miner pain may not be enough for a bottom yet. BTC Price The latest rebound in the Bitcoin price has sustained for now as its price is still trading around $91,600.

Terra’s Do Kwon Says Five Years In Prison Will Suffice On Wednesday, Terraform Labs’ co-founder and former CEO, Do Kwon, requested a maximum five-year prison term for his involvement in the $40 billion collapse of TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin in 2022. According to the sentencing recommendation reviewed by Bloomberg, Kwon’s legal team affirmed that the Terraform co-founder should receive a five-year sentence, as he has already spent nearly three years locked up, “with more than half that time in brutal conditions in Montenegro.” The former CEO’s lawyers argued that he had “suffered substantially for his crimes,” and the requested prison term would suffice, adding that the prosecutor’s expected recommendation of a 12-year sentence is “‘far greater than necessary’ to achieve justice.” Moreover, the court filing reportedly stressed that Kwon had already agreed to forfeit more than $19 million and some properties as part of the August plea deal. As reported by Bitcoinist, Kwon pleaded guilty in August to two of the nine charges indicted by US authorities. Notably, he initially pleaded not guilty in January to a nine-count indictment that charged him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. However, he changed his stance in August, pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud. At the time, Kwon also apologized for his actions, affirming that he “made false and misleading statements” about why TerraUSD regained its peg in 2021 by “failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg,” adding, “What I did was wrong.” Prosecutors are expected to file their sentencing recommendation soon. As part of the plea deal, they previously agreed not to seek more than 12 years in prison for the Terraform Labs co-founder. The sentencing by US District Judge Paul Engelmayer is scheduled for December 11, 2025, in Manhattan. South Korea’s Prosecution Pending In the sentencing recommendation, Kwon’s lawyers stressed that the former CEO still faces trial in his home country, South Korea, for the same conduct, noting that local prosecutors there are seeking a prison term of up to 40 years. Following the collapse of Terraform Labs, both South Korean and US authorities sought to bring Kwon to justice. Nonetheless, he had been on the run for months, fleeing his home country and Singapore ahead of the company’s downfall. In March 2023, Montenegrin authorities detained him along with Terraform Lab’s former finance officer, Han Chang-joon, for trying to travel with fake documents at the Podgorica Airport. Notably, Kwon was under Montenegro’s custody for over a year and a half and faced a four-month sentence, later receiving an extra two months at the request of the US and South Korea. The two countries entered a prolonged battle to bring the crypto entrepreneur to trial in each country. Initially, Montenegrin authorities approved South Korea’s extradition request, but he was ultimately extradited to the US on December 31, 2024, after Montenegro’s interior ministry signed their request.",Crypto News|Do Kwon|Do Kwon Sentence|Do Kwon trial|South Korea authorities|Terra co-founder|Terra Collapse|Terraform Labs|TerraUSD|total|total crypto market cap|US prosecutors,EN,0,0,ASIA|LUNA|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-28 08:00:48

His latest video emphasizes a development he considers more significant than the recent wave of ETF-related news, focusing on a deeper connection between traditional market systems and entities already linked to Ripple. A Direct Link to Critical U.S. Market Infrastructure According to the analyst, Hidden Road, a well-established global liquidity partner, has been connected directly to the DTCC’s netting system. He underscores that this is the same Hidden Road that is already collaborating with Ripple . His video explains that the DTCC occupies a central role in U.S. financial operations, overseeing processes that move trillions of dollars daily. He refers to the DTCC as the key operational layer for equities, derivatives, settlement, and related risk controls. Ripple Bull Winkle stresses that this access point into the DTCC framework indicates a shift in how liquidity providers linked to Ripple may soon interact with broader market functions. He notes that the DTCC is considered the most critical clearing institution in the United States, placing it at the core of the system that underpins major financial instruments and high-volume transactions.

Instead, he emphasizes that the connection between Hidden Road and the DTCC represents an alignment with high-value institutional operations. He describes the development as part of a global settlement integration rather than short-term enthusiasm or promotional activity. Ripple Bull Winkle emphasizes that this advancement is unfolding in real-time and that many observers may not yet recognize the potential scale. His explanation suggests that the combination of a major liquidity provider and critical market infrastructure may create opportunities for more efficient settlement processes, particularly in areas where Ripple has already established relationships.

One user, Seven Crypto, noted that XRP’s position appears to have gained privileged access within traditional finance, adding a light-hearted remark about the process ahead. The comment reflects ongoing interest in how developments involving Ripple’s partnerships may influence the role of XRP in institutional frameworks. This latest analysis from Ripple Bull Winkle contributes to expanding conversations within the crypto sector about increasing connections between digital asset-related infrastructure and established financial systems. His focus on the details of the DTCC relationship highlights the importance of monitoring how liquidity partners tied to Ripple may interact with the mechanisms that support major financial markets.

Fragmented multichain activity and chaotic presale access highlight the need for a unified, mobile‑first wallet hub with built‑in economic incentives. Best Wallet Token builds a Fireblocks‑powered, non‑custodial wallet with multichain DEX aggregation and curated presale access through its Upcoming Tokens portal. $BEST underpins reduced fees, staking rewards, and higher APY opportunities, aligning user growth with token demand as Best Wallet targets mass adoption. Crypto has quietly shifted back into ‘build and buy infrastructure’ mode. Traders aren’t just chasing memecoins anymore – they’re hunting tools that actually make Web3 usable: safer wallets, better UX, and lower friction for multichain swaps and presales. Wallets sit at the center of that stack, but most haven’t evolved in years. You still juggle browser extensions, clunky mobile apps, and centralized providers that can freeze you out or blow up overnight. On the other hand, hardcore non-custodial wallets often feel hostile to newcomers, with confusing approvals, no real benefits for loyal users, and little support for cross-chain flows. That gap is where Best Wallet is trying to plant its flag. It positions itself as ‘The Next Gen Crypto Wallet,’ aiming to merge institutional-grade security, clean mobile UX, and actual economic perks for holders. And Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the official token of this ecosystem. With 1 $BEST still priced at $0.026015 in presale and the raise already above $18.1M, the market has effectively pre‑voted on the thesis before any exchange listing. You can read our analysis of Best Wallet Token for more context. Best Wallet Builds A Mobile-First, Benefit-Driven Web3 Hub Best Wallet is designed as a mobile-first, non‑custodial wallet that tries to feel like a fintech app, not a developer tool. You get an intuitive interface, no KYC, and support for thousands of assets across 6+ chains, while still retaining self-custody of your keys and funds at every step. Under the hood, it’s the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP wallet in this segment, combining advanced key management with custom multi-wallet portfolios for more sophisticated users. An Upcoming Tokens portal curates the best crypto presales , giving you simplified access to vetted early‑stage opportunities instead of trawling Telegram threads or DEX listings alone. For trading, the Best DEX aggregator is powered by Rubic, routing orders across 50+ chains, 330+ DEXs, and 30 cross‑chain bridges to seek competitive pricing and fewer failed swaps. And what powers all of this is the wallet’s official token, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – here’s how to buy $BEST now and join the presale. How High Could $BEST Go If Adoption Lands? If Best Wallet captures 5% of the global crypto wallet market, $BEST could reach a speculative $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, delivering roughly 97% returns from the current presale price of $0.026015. Read our $BEST price prediction to see why this estimation is within reason. Token utility is designed to reinforce that adoption loop. An 8% allocation – 800M $BEST – is reserved for staking rewards via a dynamic pool where your yield scales with your share of total staked tokens. Crucially, staking is available during presale, giving early participants a way to put idle allocations to work immediately. On top of that, $BEST holders are set to receive reduced fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher APY options in the staking aggregator, and access to exclusive presales and iGaming partnerships through the Upcoming Tokens portal. If those perks pull users away from older wallets, the upside case becomes less theoretical and more realistic and promising. Best Wallet’s pitch is simple: combine institutional‑grade security, a mainstream‑ready mobile experience, deep multichain connectivity, and actual token‑holder benefits into a single app. With the presale still at $0.026015 and over $18.1M already raised, the project is trying to lock in a user base before the next wave of wallet competition hits. Whales have bought over $155K yesterday and today ($84.5K here , $59.3K here , and $12k here ). If you think the next cycle rewards usable infrastructure over pure speculation, $BEST is positioned as a leveraged bet on that thesis. You’re not just backing a token – you’re backing a wallet that aims to be the first screen every new crypto user opens. Join the $BEST presale before it ends in under 3 hours.

HYPE Poised For A New Rebound Market analyst OxMakeSense has highlighted the potential roadmap for HYPE to reach $50 in the short term, just below all-time high levels of $59, indicating that the token is starting to show the first signs of a significant shift. He emphasizes that the upcoming levels are filled with untouched liquidity, which could facilitate a climb for HYPE. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over? Key Levels To Watch Following a month of pressure, the analyst asserted that the asset recently formed its first solid rebound, suggesting that the selling pressure has begun to ease and market reactions are gaining strength. OxMakeSense identifies a crucial checkpoint for Hyperliquid in the $37–$38 price range, marking where the last breakdown occurred. If HYPE can reclaim this level, he suggested that it could lead to a squeeze of “trapped sellers.” Additionally, surpassing the $38 threshold would open up the chart for a direct move toward the $41–$42 range, an area described as “thin” with little major resistance left from prior sell-offs. Analyst Warns Of Potential Retracement To $25 In his social media analysis, OxMakeSense noted that the momentum pivot sits at a significant level of $44. He stated that strong trends typically begin by reclaiming mid-range levels like this one. Should HYPE flip this resistance into support, it is expected to accelerate further. Above $44, HYPE would enter a clearer trajectory, with targets aligning at $48 and ultimately at $50, where a substantial amount of untouched liquidity resides.

Fellow analyst Crypto TXG has expressed concerns regarding HYPE’s recent performance, pointing out that it lost the $35.8 level and found a temporary bottom near $28.5. While HYPE has reversed the trend, it is currently testing the $35.8 mark from below, which acts as a barrier. If HYPE can break through this resistance, the next target would be $42.3. Conversely, if it fails at $35.8, another pullback could occur, potentially retesting the $28.5 support more decisively. Adding to the cautious sentiment, market expert Ali Martinez has indicated that if the token retests the breakdown zone, there is a possibility it could revisit the $25 mark. This suggests that, despite the recent uptick, a short-term retracement of approximately 28% could be on the horizon.

His latest video emphasizes that investors holding XRP , BNB, ETH, or BTC should be prepared for significant volatility and a series of developments he believes will shape the next several months. The message is direct: the market is entering a period in which close monitoring of technical indicators may be essential. If You Own Ripple #XRP , BNB, ETH, BTC – ACT FAST! THIS HAPPENS NEXT! (Crypto Bear Market Prediction) pic.twitter.com/ZABrYI2IiX — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) November 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Recent Death Cross and Historical Comparisons In the video, BullRunners begins by highlighting a new death cross on Bitcoin’s daily chart in which the 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average. He explains that his approach centers on comparing current price action with historical data rather than speculating based on sentiment. According to his review, recent market behavior mirrors several previous cycles where Bitcoin experienced sharp declines before recovering to retest major moving averages. He revisits past death crosses from earlier in the current cycle—as well as those from 2021, 2020, and 2018—showing a recurring pattern of a sell-off into the death cross followed by a recovery toward the 50-day or 200-day moving averages. In his view, the latest decline to the $80,000 range demonstrates a more aggressive move than prior examples, which he interprets as a sign that a recovery could unfold over the coming weeks. BullRunners notes that the 50-day moving average is still positioned far above current price levels near $105,000, meaning Bitcoin would require sustained upward momentum in December for a full retest. He predicts that the 50-day average will continue trending downward into the $99,000 to $100,000 range before price interaction becomes possible. Indicators Suggesting a Temporary Rebound He also examines the stochastic RSI and the traditional RSI on the daily chart. Both indicators show conditions he associates with previous short-term bottoms. The RSI recently dipped below 30, and the stochastic RSI has formed a bullish cross in oversold territory. He notes that during the prior bull cycle, identical conditions preceded a multi-month recovery. BullRunners states that he expects an aggressive move back toward the 50-day moving average, consistent with how Bitcoin performed following past death crosses. However, he also explains that a recovery does not automatically imply a return to new all-time highs. Based on his interpretation of long-term data, he believes this rebound has a higher probability of forming a lower high, which would align with late-cycle behavior from historical market patterns. Risk of a Bear Market and Levels to Watch The analyst compares today’s setup with the 2022 bear market, indicating that Bitcoin also rallied back to major moving averages before continuing its decline. He notes that if Bitcoin reaches the 200-day moving average in the range of $100,000 to $110,000 and fails to reclaim it, this could signal a strong rejection similar to previous bear-market transitions. In his view, that level may become an important decision point for long-term holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Altcoins and the Importance of Yield Strategies BullRunners said that an upward move in Bitcoin would likely trigger a broad recovery across altcoins such as XRP , BNB, Ethereum (ETH), etc. Shifting to a broader commentary on investor strategy, the analyst stressed that many holders leave capital idle on exchanges without earning yield. He warns against keeping funds on centralized platforms, citing past security incidents, and argues that investors should consider decentralized yield methods if they choose to remain in the market. The analyst concludes by stating that while he expects a recovery phase over the next few months, the outcome will depend on how Bitcoin behaves when it approaches major moving averages. His view is that the probability favors a lower high unless market conditions change.

As first reported by the FT , the partnership has sparked accusations that the club is desperately chasing revenue while potentially exposing fans to financial risks through a company that offers minimal transparency into its operations or leadership. The Catalan giant announced the agreement on November 15, making ZKP its official blockchain technology partner, despite the company’s thin digital footprint and offshore registration in a jurisdiction the European Union lists as a tax haven.

Red Flags and Missing Details ZKP introduced itself with its first post on X, which had only 33 followers, following only FC Barcelona, Bitcoin, and Andrew Tate. The company held its first auction of 200 million coins on November 21. While ZKP’s website claims commitment to transparency, it provides scant detail about who runs the operation or who provided the $100 million financing it claims to have secured. “ Everyone asks, ‘Who’s behind this?’ As if knowing the names would make the code stronger. It won’t. We’re real — engineers, cryptographers, ex-founders, system killers. But we’re not playing the PR game, ” the company states on its website. Martin Calladine, author of No Questions Asked: How football joined the crypto con, described the information deficit as “ deeply concerning ” and warned that Barcelona fans could be lured into purchasing coins “ that could easily end up being worthless. “ Former Barcelona board director Xavier Vilajoana questioned what due diligence the club conducted before finalizing the agreement.

On November 26, Barcelona issued a statement distancing itself from ZKP’s newly announced FCB token, clarifying that the club has “ no connection whatsoever ” to it.

The club has been punished repeatedly for breaching Spanish football’s spending limit, with its latest accounts showing net debt of €469 million plus more than €900 million in stadium-related borrowing. Barcelona has attempted to improve its finances through asset sales, including portions of its long-term television income. Still, costly delays to its stadium renovation have made revenue generation more urgent. Barcelona’s other Web3 ventures have also faltered. The club booked a €141 million writedown last year after a deal to sell a stake in Barça Vision collapsed when investors failed to make payments. Despite setbacks, Barcelona has maintained its digital asset initiatives, including selling its first NFT for $693,000 at Sotheby’s in July 2022 and launching FC Barcelona Fan Tokens through Chiliz and Socios in June 2020, which sold out for $1.3 million in less than 2 hours.

However, many deals have ended in acrimony, with Inter Milan, Roma, Chelsea, and Atlético Madrid among clubs that entered agreements that were terminated early. Despite cautionary tales, the trend continues to accelerate. Paris Saint-Germain revealed in May 2025 that it had become the first sports entity to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. A Sport Quake study found that football accounted for 43% of all crypto and digital asset sponsorships in the 2024/25 season, representing a 64% year-over-year increase. Recent partnerships include Kadena’s four-year agreement with the Croatian Football Federation in February and Tether’s acquisition of a minority stake in Juventus FC . Barcelona’s partnership with ZKP nevertheless stands apart for the opacity surrounding the company and the speed at which red flags emerged.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-files-new-request-in-terra-luna-case-details-here/,"Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon has asked a US court to limit his prison sentence to a maximum of five years after pleading guilty to fraud in connection with the $40 billion collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem. Do Kwon Requests 5-Year Sentence Maximum in $40 Billion Terra Collapse Case In a 23-page petition filed in the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York on November 26, Kwon's lawyers argued that a sentence of up to five years would be “sufficient and appropriate.” The prosecution had previously proposed seeking a prison sentence of up to 12 years for Kwon. However, his defense team argued that this request failed to consider all the circumstances, and that Kwon's actions were not motivated by personal gain or enrichment, but rather by “overconfidence and the mistakes of a young founder made under pressure.” Kwon pleaded guilty in August to two charges of fraud related to the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin and the Luna token, which crashed in May 2022. The petition attributed the crash in part to third-party companies exploiting vulnerabilities in the system through coordinated transactions. It was also emphasized that Kwon’s failure to disclose to investors a secret agreement with Jump Trading in 2021 to maintain the stability of UST seriously overshadowed the risks associated with the project. The defense noted that Kwon had been detained in Montenegro for nearly two years after being caught with a fake passport in March 2023, even spending time in solitary confinement, and argued that this should factor into the sentence. It was also reported that Kwon will face trial in South Korea on the same charges, with a potential prison sentence of up to 40 years. Do Kwon's sentence will be announced on December 11th. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Terraform Labs Founder Do Kwon Files New Request in Terra-Luna Case!

The 5B EUR fund is now available both through traditional channels and in its tokenized form. Amundi has tokenized the AMUNDI FUNDS CASH EUR fund, a facility with 5B EUR. The fund chose Ethereum to offer an alternative channel. Money funds are a conservative and liquid investment, where price discovery does not depend on blockchain events. “Tokenization is a transformation that will accelerate globally in the coming years. This first initiative demonstrates our expertise and we will continue expanding our projects to benefit our clients in France and internationally,” said Jean-Jacques Barbéris from Amundi. The tech infrastructure for the fund will be provided by CACEIS, a major digital asset hub for European companies, and a top European transfer agent. CACEIS will control the technology to tokenize the fund units, build digital portfolios for investors, and handle subscriptions and redemptions. CACEIS announced the fund will be available through stablecoins, or eventually official digital currencies. Subscriptions and redemptions will be available around the clock with no breaks. Tokenized money market funds expand in 2025 Amundi follows the general growth of tokenized money market funds. Recently, the sector expanded to $9B in value under management, sparking a warning from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). Tokenized funds are usually sold to selected clients and used as a liquid, secure collateral for the creation of stablecoins. Those tokens are rarely traded as general Ethereum assets, and do not spread across unvetted DeFi protocols. Despite this, ongoing fund tokenization has raised the possibility for a bridge between traditional finance and on-chain value. The current money fund market is still considered relatively small compared to general money market funds. In total, those funds represent over $7T in value, as the tokenized portion is barely making a dent. Despite this, even a small fraction moving to Ethereum has raised the concerns of regulators. Ethereum remains a leader in RWA tokenization Ethereum is still selected most often to launch new tokens, due to its legacy status. Its main competitors include Solana and Ondo’s native chain. Tokenization on Ethereum expanded in 2025, with a proliferation of new tokenized money market funds. | Source: RWA.xyz . Tokenized assets have reached over $36B, with most of the value coming from private credit. Ethereum locks in nearly $12B in value, excluding the stablecoins. Ethereum tokenized assets are diverse, and have grown across all categories. Most of the growth happened in 2025, with significant inflows from multiple US-based money market funds. Ethereum tries to position itself as the go-to chain for asset tokenization due to its security and legacy adoption. To date, the chain carries 303 tokenized assets. Another 129 assets are tokenized through Arbitrum, one of the most active L2 chains from the Ethereum ecosystem. BNB Chain comes a close second, with 112% tokenization growth in the past month.

Key Takeaways: The Philippines could build a $60 billion tokenized-asset market by 2030, led by equities and government bonds. More Filipinos hold crypto than traditional investments, with 14% owning crypto versus fewer than 5% owning stocks or funds. Digital wallets like GCash and PDAX are making tokenized bonds accessible with entry levels as low as P500. The report argues that the country’s deep engagement with digital wallets and crypto creates a “tokenized-first” pathway to investing in stocks, bonds, and funds. Crypto Ownership in Philippines Outpaces Stock Investing Despite being one of the most digitally connected nations in Southeast Asia, participation in conventional investing remains limited. The report shows that while around 14% of Filipinos hold cryptocurrencies, fewer than 5% own stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, a gap between access to digital tools and exposure to the broader financial system. “The Philippines has a unique advantage: blockchain wallets are already mainstream,” said Nichel Gaba, founder and CEO of PDAX. “We’re not starting from scratch. The infrastructure to deliver tokenized assets to millions of Filipinos already exists in their pockets. Our focus now is to connect that infrastructure to real, regulated financial products.” Project Bayani estimates equities will account for the largest share of the tokenized market at $26 billion, followed by $24 billion in government bonds, $6 billion in mutual funds, and $4 billion in other assets. Early examples already show how lower barriers can widen access. REPORT: @pdaxph , @OnigiriVC , and @SaisonCapital published a research that forecasts a $60B tokenized asset surge in the Philippines by 2030, using blockchain wallets to leapfrog traditional finance. pic.twitter.com/Ar5j26FdEl — BitPinas (@bitpinas) November 27, 2025 Tokenized government bonds distributed through PDAX and payments app GCash reduced minimum investments to just P500, opening the market to smaller savers previously shut out by higher entry thresholds. The initiative also points to the Bureau of the Treasury’s partnership with PDAX and GCash as evidence of growing momentum. “This partnership brought government bonds directly to the fingertips of millions of Filipinos,” said Sharon Almanza, Treasurer of the Philippines. “It represents a bold leap forward in democratizing access to public financial instruments, further promoting financial inclusion.” Large consumer apps already serve as distribution channels, according to the report. Wallets such as GCash, PDAX, Maya, and Coins.ph allow users to hold digital assets without forcing companies or regulators to rebuild infrastructure from scratch. Tokenized Real-World Assets May Unlock $400T TradFi Market In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 . Tokenized US Treasuries alone are projected to reach $4.2 billion this year, with short-term government bonds driving most of the activity.

The recent Upbit hack has set a new standard for transparency and accountability in the crypto space. South Korea’s leading exchange is demonstrating what responsible leadership looks like during a security crisis. What Exactly Happened in the Upbit Hack? The Upbit hack represents one of the most significant security breaches in recent crypto history. The exchange immediately acknowledged the incident and took full responsibility, stating that insufficient security management caused the breach. This level of honesty is refreshing in an industry where transparency can sometimes be lacking. Upbit reported the cyberattack as required by law and launched a comprehensive investigation. The exchange identified the cause and scale of the breach quickly, showing their commitment to resolving the situation. Their prompt action demonstrates how established exchanges should handle security incidents. How Much Was Lost in the Upbit Security Breach? The financial impact of the Upbit hack totals approximately 44.5 billion won ($32.2 million). However, here’s what sets this situation apart: User assets accounted for 38.6 billion won ($28.0 million) Upbit’s corporate losses amount to 5.9 billion won ($4.3 million) 2.3 billion won ($1.7 million) of affected funds have been frozen These numbers reveal that user protection remained the top priority throughout the Upbit hack response. The exchange’s willingness to absorb significant corporate losses shows their dedication to customer security. What Protection Measures Did Upbit Implement? Following the Upbit hack, the exchange took immediate and comprehensive action. They pledged to cover all user losses using their own corporate assets, eliminating financial worry for affected customers. This commitment goes beyond what many traditional financial institutions offer during security breaches. The company is currently overhauling its entire wallet system to prevent future incidents. Deposits and withdrawals will resume only after stability is confirmed through rigorous testing. This cautious approach ensures that security improvements are thoroughly implemented before normal operations resume. Why Does This Upbit Hack Response Matter for Crypto? The handling of the Upbit hack establishes important precedents for the entire cryptocurrency industry. When exchanges take full responsibility for security failures, they build long-term trust with users. This incident shows that proper security protocols and transparent communication can turn a crisis into an opportunity to demonstrate reliability. Moreover, the Upbit hack response highlights the importance of regulatory compliance. By reporting the incident as required by law and cooperating with authorities, Upbit sets a positive example for other exchanges facing similar challenges. What Can We Learn From the Upbit Security Incident? The Upbit hack teaches valuable lessons about cryptocurrency security and corporate responsibility. First, transparency during crises builds stronger user relationships. Second, having sufficient corporate reserves to cover potential losses is essential for exchange operations. Finally, continuous security improvements must remain a top priority for all crypto platforms. As the industry matures, incidents like the Upbit hack will inevitably occur. However, the response matters more than the incident itself. Upbit’s approach shows that taking full responsibility and protecting users can transform a negative event into a trust-building opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions Will Upbit users get their money back? Yes, Upbit has pledged to cover all user losses from corporate assets. Users affected by the hack will receive full compensation. When will deposits and withdrawals resume? Upbit will resume normal operations only after completing wallet system overhauls and confirming stability. The exchange has not provided a specific timeline but emphasizes security over speed. How did the Upbit hack happen? The exchange acknowledged insufficient security management caused the breach, though specific technical details remain under investigation. Are other exchanges at risk for similar hacks? All cryptocurrency exchanges face security risks, but Upbit’s transparent response sets a positive example for handling such incidents responsibly. What security improvements is Upbit making? Upbit is completely overhauling its wallet system and implementing enhanced security protocols to prevent future breaches. How much of the stolen funds were recovered? Approximately 2.3 billion won ($1.7 million) has been frozen, representing partial recovery of the affected funds.

His forecast is coming on the back of U.S. and Asian exchanges like CBOE and SGX getting ready to roll out their own perpetual products by the end of 2025. Hayes frames this as an “adapt or die” moment for traditional finance (TradFi), claiming that if established exchanges don’t copy crypto’s perp model and socialized loss margin systems, they’ll lose liquidity and relevance to more nimble crypto venues and DEXs. Perps Go Mainstream as Crypto and TradFi Converge In his latest essay, the crypto trader revisited how BitMEX’s invention of the perpetual swap, a futures-like product with no expiry, reshaped crypto trading by concentrating liquidity into a single “delta one” contract that tracks spot prices closely while allowing high leverage. He made the case that perps, combined with socialized loss systems and insurance funds, solved two things retail traders want most: access to big leverage and deep liquidity, without the legal risk of owing more than their initial margin if a trade goes wrong. That design, according to Hayes, is now leaking into equities. He highlighted Hyperliquid’s HIP-3, a permissionless protocol that allowed a firm called XYZ to launch a Nasdaq 100 equity perp that already trades over $100 million in daily volume. In his view, equity perps will become “the hottest product of 2026,” with both centralized exchanges and decentralized platforms racing to list them by the end of next year. The former BitMEX CEO also pointed to changes in the U.S. regulatory landscape. After years of hostility following the FTX collapse and his own legal battles with the CFTC, he says the mood shifted again in 2025 under President Trump, whose administration has taken a more crypto-friendly stance. That, he believes, has opened the door to sandbox-style experiments for new derivatives and encouraged global regulators to follow Washington’s lead, giving exchanges like SGX confidence to pursue perp listings. Why Hayes Thinks Perps Will Overtake the CME Hayes’ central claim is that, by late this decade, the largest derivatives on key U.S. benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 will be perps traded on crypto exchanges, not futures listed on CME and other incumbents. He said that traditional clearinghouses are constrained by under-capitalized guarantee funds, strict rules around retail leverage, and legacy operating hours that cannot keep up with a 24/7 information cycle. In his telling, perpetual swaps have flipped that model by letting traders post less collateral while still accessing meaningful exposure, thus reducing the need to park large sums with an exchange, which is becoming a sensitive issue in an industry that has endured multiple hacks and failures. Hayes himself remains an active and sometimes controversial trader. Recent on-chain data showed him offloading sizable positions in ETH, ENA, ETHFI, LDO, AAVE, and UNI after a steep market drop, even though he had previously hinted he would not take profits on his ETH stack. The clear outlier in his recent positioning is privacy coin ZEC, which he praised on X after it outperformed the broader altcoin market with triple-digit monthly gains.

Traders remain uncertain about whether the breakouts will continue or if there will be a deeper pullback as momentum shifts in the coming days and weeks. However, the interest of the community has been shifting to promising opportunities that display far more convincing growth trends than the previous ones. This has introduced Mutuum Finance , the top crypto to buy now, which has been accelerating its presale at a speed no experienced analyst had predicted. Priced at a low of $0.035 and progressing through Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already sold out almost 95% of its allocation and has raised almost $19.02 million, cementing its status as the best crypto to invest in. Bitcoin Faces Downward Pressure Amid Extreme Fear in the Market Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck in a short-term bearish trend due to its sharp fall from the October peaks and the clear break of the psychological level of $100,000. This fall has been fueled not only by the net outflows of almost $3 billion from the ETFs in November but also due to the macroeconomic uncertainty and the large unwind of the leverage market, which has pushed the sentiment levels to the state of Extreme Fear. Meanwhile, the recent Death Cross pattern has again proven the dominance of the fall trend, and the level of $90,000 has been identified as the critical level of support to be defended immediately because immediate failure to do so will trigger the fall towards the final structural support at $80,000. However, due to the high level of market conservatism at this point in time, the community of traders actually starts searching for MUTM, recognizing it as a strong DeFi crypto opportunity. Mutuum Finance Engages DeFi Investors Mutuum Finance has already become one of the most in-demand DeFi crypto projects of the year 2025. The current presales campaign presents a unique chance to own MUTM tokens before they are available at exchange platforms. Phase 6 has already begun, and the tokens are sold at $0.035 each, which is three times the price of Phase 1. Early contributors can benefit from large gains at this price. The presales managed to collect over $19.02 million from the contributions of 18,250 participants, and Phase 6 has already achieved over 95% completion. This makes MUTM the best crypto to invest in available today and the top DeFi crypto to consider in the coming year of 2026. Independent Audit Reinforces Security and Reliability The lending and borrowing smart contracts of Mutuum Finance are also undergoing an exhaustive audit review at the hands of Halborn Security . The audit will confirm the proper functionality of the code and the security of the users’ assets. The schedule regarding the testnet launch will be shared once the audit test has been completed. This exhaustive security measure allows MUTM to be at the forefront of a secure and scalable platform used in DeFi crypto applications and makes it the best crypto to invest in before the market bounce. To encourage the early users to participate in the platform, there will be a giveaway of $100,000, where the first ten participants will win $10,000 each. This move confirms the project’s dedication to developing a community of loyal users who are actively involved. By doing this, the project will encourage users to be involved in the ecosystem, which will help MUTM stand out from the competition as the top DeFi crypto tokens available in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as one of the most attractive DeFi crypto opportunities of the year 2025. Currently undergoing Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has already managed to collect almost $19.02 million from over 18,250 participants at the current price of $0.035, registering the sale of over 95% of the tokens. The next phase will see the price rising to $0.04, presenting one of the final opportunities to participate before the presale ends. The MUTM platform presents the unique combination of practical DeFi capabilities and immense growth prospects. Those willing to grow their investments exponentially must not miss the opportunity to grab the MUTM tokens before the presale ends, making it the best crypto to invest in today.

Trump announced that his administration is considering slashing and potentially eliminating the federal income tax for the next few years, arguing that soaring tariff revenue could replace the lost revenue. The proposal comes amid a dramatic surge in customs duty collections since Trump enacted a sweeping new tariff regime earlier in 2025. In October alone, customs duties reportedly reached around $31–$34 billion, part of a trend of record‑high monthly tariff revenues Trump told some U.S. military service members, “Over the next couple of years, I think we’ll substantially be cutting and maybe cutting out completely, but we’ll be cutting income tax. It could be almost completely cutting it because the money we’re taking in is going to be so large.” He did not, however, provide an outline of how he aims to phase out most income tax. President Trump pushes to replace income tax with tariffs On multiple occasions, the president has claimed that tariffs will pave the way for sizable cuts to Americans’ income taxes. In April, Trump, on his Truth Social platform, commented, “When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year.” These remarks are consistent with his 2024 claims, in which he floated the notion of scrapping the federal income tax and relying mainly on tariffs, as was done in the 1800s. Reports in October indicated that Trump told Bronx barbers there could be a way forward if his proposal materialized, explaining that the 1890s system was funded solely by tariffs. In a Joe Rogan podcast, Trump said he had truly aimed to substitute federal income taxes with tariffs, giving a casual, “Yeah, sure, why not?” So far, Trump has imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on most U.S. imports , with the exact rate varying by country. He said the tariffs would bring in more money for the government and steer shoppers toward American goods, adding that other countries have long taken advantage of the U.S. His goal, he said, is to shrink the trade deficit — the gap between what America imports and what it exports. However, the American President has used the taxes to make other demands. He specifically cited China, Mexico, and Canada, insisting they improve controls over migration and fentanyl reaching U.S. soil. Trump’s tariffs have faced multiple legal challenges Trump’s tariff policies have faced repeated legal scrutiny regarding the manner in which they were enacted. The Trump administration had bypassed Congress by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, allowing immediate action. In August, a U.S. appeals court ruled that most of the tariffs were illegal, yet left them in effect. The White House appealed to the Supreme Court to reverse the decision, but a ruling could take months. Negotiations are ongoing with multiple nations, including China, Canada, and Mexico, which have been informed that they could face particularly steep tariffs. Though quite recently, the U.S. president suggested a tariff dividend plan, pledging at least $2,000 per individual, excluding high-income Americans, and addressing detractors of the tariffs.

Ethereum Price Prediction: Is This the Start of a New Uptrend? While Derivatives traders bet on Bitcoin’s last bottom, Ethereum is flashing its own as it affirms the left shoulder of a potential bullish head-and-shoulders pattern. Supportive momentum indicators point to a decisive bounce from a historical demand zone around $2,750 as a launchpad. ETH / USD 1-day chart, bullish head-and-shoulders pattern. Source: TradingView. The RSI has made a sharp reversal from oversold conditions, while the MACD forms a golden cross above the signal line. Both metrics are typical of local bottoms as sellers exhaust and buyers step in. A fully realised pattern breakout targets a return to its neckline around $5,500, an 80% gain and a push into new price discovery, setting new all-time highs. But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum continues to see adoption among TradFi investors through ETFs and inclusion on mainstream balance sheets, this could extend 230% to $10,000.

The expert asserts that only the notorious North Korean hacker group Lazarus possessed the sophisticated capabilities to deduce private keys through transaction analysis. This alarming disclosure raises critical questions about blockchain security and the evolving threats facing digital assets. What Makes the Upbit Hack So Concerning? The Upbit hack represents one of the most sophisticated security breaches in cryptocurrency history. Unlike typical exchange hacks that exploit system vulnerabilities, this attack involved deducing private keys by analyzing wallet transactions. This method demonstrates an unprecedented level of technical expertise that few entities worldwide possess. Ju Ki-young’s analysis suggests the attackers didn’t just bypass security measures – they fundamentally understood blockchain transaction patterns at a deep mathematical level. The ability to infer private keys from transaction data requires: Advanced cryptographic knowledge Extensive blockchain analysis capabilities Sophisticated computing resources Deep understanding of elliptic curve cryptography Why Does Lazarus Group Stand Out in the Upbit Hack Investigation? The Lazarus Group connection to the Upbit hack isn’t just speculation – it’s based on their unique operational signature. This state-sponsored hacking collective has demonstrated capabilities that match the sophistication required for this type of attack. Their previous operations show a pattern of advanced cryptographic attacks that align perfectly with the Upbit hack methodology. Moreover, the Lazarus Group has consistently targeted cryptocurrency exchanges as part of North Korea’s revenue-generation strategy. Their technical prowess and specific focus on digital assets make them the prime suspect in this sophisticated Upbit hack scenario. How Can Users Protect Against Similar Upbit Hack Threats? While the Upbit hack targeted exchange infrastructure, individual users can take proactive measures to enhance their security. The incident serves as a crucial reminder that even reputable exchanges face sophisticated threats. Therefore, implementing robust personal security practices becomes essential. Consider these protective strategies: Use hardware wallets for long-term storage Enable multi-factor authentication on all exchange accounts Diversify storage across multiple platforms Monitor transaction patterns regularly Stay informed about emerging security threats What Does the Upbit Hack Mean for Blockchain Security? The Upbit hack represents a paradigm shift in how we perceive blockchain security. While blockchain technology itself remains secure, the interfaces and implementations surrounding it face evolving threats. This incident highlights that even the most secure systems can be vulnerable to nation-state level attacks. However, it’s crucial to understand that the Upbit hack doesn’t represent a fundamental flaw in blockchain technology. Rather, it demonstrates the need for enhanced security protocols around key management and transaction monitoring. The industry must develop more robust safeguards against such sophisticated analytical attacks. Conclusion: Learning from the Upbit Hack Experience The Upbit hack serves as a sobering reminder of the sophisticated threats facing the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ju Ki-young’s analysis points to Lazarus Group’s unique capabilities in executing this complex attack. While concerning, this revelation also pushes the industry toward developing stronger security measures and more vigilant monitoring systems. As blockchain technology evolves, so must our security approaches. The Upbit hack experience teaches us that continuous innovation in security protocols is not just beneficial – it’s essential for the long-term health and adoption of cryptocurrency technologies. Frequently Asked Questions What made the Upbit hack different from other cryptocurrency exchange breaches? The Upbit hack was unique because attackers allegedly deduced private keys through transaction analysis rather than exploiting system vulnerabilities or social engineering. Why do experts believe only Lazarus Group could execute this Upbit hack? Lazarus Group possesses nation-state level resources, advanced cryptographic expertise, and a documented history of sophisticated cryptocurrency attacks matching the Upbit hack methodology. How can users verify if their assets were affected by the Upbit hack? Users should check official Upbit communications, monitor their transaction history, and use blockchain explorers to verify fund movements during the attack period. What security improvements has Upbit implemented since the hack? Upbit has enhanced its security infrastructure with improved monitoring systems, multi-signature wallets, and advanced transaction analysis tools to prevent similar incidents. Can individual wallet users be targeted by similar private key deduction attacks? While possible, individual wallets present smaller targets and different transaction patterns, making them less attractive for such sophisticated analytical attacks. How does private key deduction through transaction analysis work? This complex method involves analyzing multiple transactions to identify patterns and mathematical relationships that could reveal private key information through advanced cryptographic techniques.

55038320,636043,1764323152,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55038320.jpeg,UK New DeFi Tax Push Brings DeFi Apps Like Best Wallet Token Into the Spotlight,https://bitcoinist.com/uk-defi-tax-rallies-best-wallet-token-18m-presale/,"Quick Facts: The UK’s move toward ‘no gain, no loss’ taxation for DeFi lending and liquidity pools could normalize on‑chain yield strategies and reduce tax‑driven user friction. As DeFi stops feeling like a tax minefield, demand is likely to tilt from centralized custodians toward secure, mobile‑first, non‑custodial wallets that double as DeFi control centers. Best Wallet aims to capture 40% of the wallet market by end-2026 with Fireblocks‑backed MPC security, multi‑wallet portfolios, and integrated DeFi utilities. The $BEST presale has reached $18M just three hours away from completion with whales making big moves ahead of the public launch. For years, DeFi in the UK has felt like a tax booby trap. Every interaction with a lending protocol or liquidity pool potentially triggered capital gains, even when you never ‘cashed out’ to fiat. That complexity has kept many users parked on centralized exchanges instead of going fully on‑chain. Now UK regulators are moving toward a ‘no gain, no loss’ tax treatment for DeFi lending and liquidity pools, meaning those moves would no longer crystallize a taxable event by default. If implemented as proposed, it would make yield strategies and liquidity provision feel far less like walking through a minefield with your accountant on speed dial. A friendlier DeFi tax regime pushes activity away from centralized custodians toward non‑custodial wallets where you control the keys, access DEXs and lending markets directly, and avoid relying on a single failure point. That’s where new wallet infrastructure starts to matter more than the next exchange token. Best Wallet sits directly in that slipstream. It’s positioned as a mobile‑first, non‑custodial wallet plus utility token designed for exactly this moment: when mainstream users want DeFi access without arcane UX, and regulators finally stop punishing on‑chain experimentation. If UK DeFi participation ramps up, wallet‑centric plays like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) become a direct bet on that shift. Buy your $BEST before the presale ends; less than 3 hours left. How Friendlier DeFi Tax Rules Reshape Wallet Demand If DeFi lending and LP positions move to a ‘no gain, no loss’ tax stance , you’re suddenly free to rebalance, migrate liquidity, or change strategies without fearing a spreadsheet nightmare. That reduces friction for frequent on‑chain interactions, especially for power users who roll rewards or rotate between protocols weekly. More activity means more surface area for risk. Centralized exchanges still offer staking and yield products, but they remain custody bottlenecks and single points of regulatory failure. Hardware wallets are secure yet clunky for daily DeFi, while many browser wallets were built for early adopters, not the next 50M users arriving through mobile. Competing wallets are trying to bridge that gap. MetaMask has added swaps and DeFi integrations; Trust Wallet and Coinbase Wallet lean into mobile and multichain; Phantom is expanding beyond Solana. All push toward ‘wallet as DeFi hub,’ but trade‑offs remain across security models, UX quality, and value‑add features. In that crowd, Best Wallet is angling to be one more – and potentially differentiated – option by tying a feature‑rich, non‑custodial wallet directly to a utility token that powers staking rewards, fee discounts, and curated presale access aimed at everyday DeFi users. Buy $BEST via the official Best Wallet Token website while you still can. Inside Best Wallet Token’s Wallet‑First DeFi Thesis Best Wallet’s pitch is ambitious: capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026 by being the easiest and safest option with the most tangible user benefits. That’s a bold target in a crowded field, but the architecture leans on serious security primitives rather than buzzwords. The wallet is one of the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP mobile wallets, using multi‑party computation to remove single key failure points while keeping a smooth, app‑like experience. On top sits support for thousands of assets across 330 DEXs and 30 bridges, plus custom multi‑wallet portfolios so you can separate trading, yield, and long‑term holdings without juggling seed phrases. The $BEST token ties it together: holders get reduced fees inside the Best Wallet ecosystem and access to higher‑APY opportunities via a staking aggregator, with 8% of the total supply (800M tokens) allocated to staking rewards. The presale has reached the $18M mark, partly thanks to whales hoarding $BEST just hours before the presale’s end. Three massive buys came through today alone ( $87.072K , $61.103K , $12.22K ), showcasing investor trust in Best Wallet’s value proposition. The $BEST token stands to gain a lot from this. Our price prediction for $BEST puts it at a potential $0.62 in 2026, for an ROI of 2,283% if the hype builds and the market remains loyal. By 2030, we expect a possible $0.82 price point – perhaps higher – once the wallet’s features roll in and the project touches upon its main roadmap milestones. From a technical standpoint, the market has positioned $BEST to become one of the best altcoins to buy in 2026 and beyond. The presale is set to end in under three hours, so you don’t have much time left; read our guide on how to buy $BEST today . This is your final chance to buy $BEST before the presale ends at 12 pm UTC, and the token lists on KuCoin two hours later. Join the $BEST presale while you still can.

This shift lands right before the Fusaka upgrade, a change designed to grow capacity and improve how Ethereum scales. Ethereum Raises Block Gas Limit to 60 M Before Fusaka upgrade Ethereum has increased its block gas limit from 45 million to 60 million gas units. The decision followed a vote by validators. More than half signaled approval, triggering an automatic update under the network’s consensus rules. This change ensures Ethereum can accommodate more transactions and smart-contract operations per block. The increase reflects a coordinated effort by developers and node-client teams over the past year. The boost arrives days before the Fusaka upgrade, which introduces further improvements to data availability, block efficiency, and Layer-2 support. The new 60 M limit aims to help the network handle higher traffic and better support decentralized applications and rollups. Analyst Sees Possible Bottom in Ethereum Treasury Stocks Meanwhile, Ethereum-focused treasury companies may have found a local price floor, according to analyst Ted Pillows. Charts for BitMine Immersion Technologies, SharpLink Gaming, Dynamix Corporation, and Bit Digital show steep declines over recent months, followed by a short bounce from recent lows. The move suggests sellers may be losing momentum as dip buyers test support. Ethereum Treasury Stocks Performance. Source: TedPillows BitMine Immersion Technologies also announced a dividend, which could draw fresh inflows from investors seeking yield. A cash return can signal confidence from management and sometimes stabilizes price after a long slide. However, other names in the group have not yet confirmed a similar shift in sentiment. Ted Pillows said these stocks still need to show stronger price action before they can support a powerful rally in Ethereum itself. He pointed to the need for sustained upside, higher lows, and healthier trading volumes rather than a single bounce. Until that happens, Ethereum treasury equities may remain in a rebuilding phase, even if the worst of the selling pressure has passed. Analyst Maps Key Ethereum Price Levels Around $3,000 GalaxyTrading says Ethereum turns bullish again if price climbs above 3,350 dollars. A move over 3,680 dollars would mark a “very bullish” phase as it clears the recent resistance band on the weekly chart.

Will BTC and ETH Reach These Levels?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-expect-a-15-billion-options-quake-today-will-btc-and-eth-reach-these-levels/,"Bitcoin, which failed to experience the expected rise in October and November, known as the bullish months, is preparing to close out its worst November in the last six years since 2019. At this point, while the hopes for an uptrend remain in December, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has arrived, as it does every Friday. These options are more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to weekly data, approximately $15.1 billion worth of crypto options will expire on November 28 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. According to Deribit data, $13.4 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $1.7 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.54, the maximum loss point is $100,000 and the notional value is $13.4 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.48, a maximum loss point of $3,400, and a notional value of $1.7 billion. What Do Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Mean? While the put/call ratio is 0.56 for Bitcoin and 0.48 for Etheruem, these ratios indicate that investors are betting for more profit and expecting a rise. Max pain can often act as a magnet during expiration in option markets. In the options market, maximum pain is the price level at which investors incur the greatest losses and options sellers feel most comfortable. In other words, it acts as a magnet for the market as contracts expire. At this point, the maximum pain level for Bitcoin was $100,000, while the maximum pain level for Ethereum was $3,400. As a result, Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently below their maximum pain levels of $91,100 and $3,010, respectively. Analysts believe this suggests investors are anticipating limited upward movement in the short term. However, it doesn't necessarily mean a definitive rise or fall. With billions of dollars worth of options expiring, liquidity conditions can change rapidly in both BTC and ETH. *This is not investment advice.

According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, that future is closer than we think, driven by the rise of perpetual futures. This innovative model, already popular in crypto, is set to revolutionize how we trade everything from stocks to commodities. But what makes perpetual futures so powerful, and why should you care? Let’s dive into the details. What Are Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts without expiration dates, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. Unlike traditional futures that settle on specific dates, perpetual futures use funding mechanisms to keep prices aligned with spot markets. This model offers flexibility and continuous exposure, making it attractive for both retail and institutional investors. Hayes argues that perpetual futures eliminate the hassle of rolling over contracts, providing a seamless trading experience. Moreover, they enable high leverage and deep liquidity, key factors driving their adoption. How Do Perpetual Futures Outperform Traditional Systems? Traditional trading systems often involve complex settlement processes and limited leverage. In contrast, perpetual futures simplify trading with features like: No expiration dates, reducing administrative overhead High leverage options, amplifying potential gains Deep liquidity, ensuring tight spreads and efficient execution Loss limits capped to initial margin, protecting investors from unlimited losses Hayes highlights that these advantages make perpetual futures superior to legacy structures. For example, traders can maintain positions without worrying about contract rollovers, saving time and costs. Additionally, the model’s liquidity pools attract more participants, creating a virtuous cycle of market depth. Who Is Adopting Perpetual Futures in Traditional Finance? Major exchanges like the CBOE and Singapore Exchange (SGX) are planning to launch perpetual futures products by year-end. This move signals a shift toward crypto-inspired innovations in mainstream finance. Hayes points to regulatory changes under the Trump administration as a catalyst, easing restrictions on derivatives. As traditional institutions embrace perpetual futures, we can expect increased competition and innovation. This adoption could democratize access to sophisticated trading tools, leveling the playing field for smaller investors. What Challenges Could Slow Down the Perpetual Futures Revolution? Despite their benefits, perpetual futures face hurdles like regulatory scrutiny and market volatility. Regulators may impose stricter rules on leverage to protect retail traders. Moreover, funding rate mechanisms can lead to unexpected costs in volatile markets. However, Hayes believes these challenges are manageable with proper risk management. Education and transparent platforms will be crucial to building trust and ensuring sustainable growth. How Can You Prepare for the Perpetual Futures Era? To capitalize on this trend, start by understanding the mechanics of perpetual futures. Practice with demo accounts on crypto exchanges to gain hands-on experience. Monitor announcements from traditional exchanges like CBOE for new product launches. Diversify your portfolio to include assets traded via perpetual futures, and stay updated on regulatory developments.

That focus became clear during the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference held on October 21, where traditional finance and digital asset firms examined the changing landscape of settlement infrastructure. The event outlined how new technologies may shape the next cycle of payment system modernization. Bitcoin Munari enters this environment with a fixed 21,000,000 BTCM supply, a multi-stage migration plan, and published reviews supporting early technical transparency ahead of its January SPL launch. Fed Conference Outlines Priorities In Emerging Payment Infrastructure The Payments Innovation Conference included representatives from BlackRock, Circle, Chainlink, Fireblocks, Ark Investment, and other organizations active in payment integration and blockchain adoption. The session opened with remarks from Governor Christopher J. Waller, who noted that technological shifts in payments are ongoing and emphasized the need to balance innovation with security and operational resilience. Waller highlighted the importance of examining both opportunities and risks to maintain efficiency within the US payment system. Stablecoins formed a central topic throughout the conference. Discussions evaluated current use cases, operational models, and potential impacts on financial stability. The presentations detailed how dollar-pegged digital assets are being tested as fast and cost-efficient settlement tools, while regulatory participants assessed risk factors associated with their broader adoption. A separate track explored the application of artificial intelligence in fraud detection, transaction monitoring, and process optimization, noting both advantages and challenges concerning data transparency and model oversight. A recent analysis by Token Empire examined Bitcoin Munari’s development trajectory in the context of themes discussed at the conference, noting that the project’s fixed-supply model and planned Layer-1 migration align with broader industry interest in stablecoin settlement infrastructure and AI-supported payment verification. Bitcoin Munari’s Two-Phase Architecture Reflects The Shift Toward Structured Digital Settlement Bitcoin Munari’s development sequence aligns with several themes outlined across the Fed’s sessions. The project launches initially as a Solana SPL token to provide low-cost transaction access before migrating to an independent Layer-1 chain. The mainnet design includes delegated Proof-of-Stake validation, an EVM-compatible execution environment, governance capabilities, and privacy configuration tools. A 1:1 migration bridge maintains continuity across both phases without altering the capped supply. The fixed-supply model allocates 11,130,000 BTCM to the public presale, 6,090,000 BTCM to validator rewards, 1,680,000 BTCM to liquidity reserves, 1,050,000 BTCM to the team under vesting, and 1,050,000 BTCM to marketing and ecosystem activity. The distribution provides a defined structure through the SPL period and the mainnet transition, matching the demand for clear operational frameworks highlighted during the conference. Presale Structure Progresses Toward Bitcoin Munari’s January Deployment Bitcoin Munari’s presale advances through ten rounds. Current round 2 is priced at $0.22, progressing toward a $6.00 benchmark launch price and a ROI of 2,627%. Presale tokens carry no vesting, enabling access upon the SPL launch before the transition to the dedicated Layer-1 chain. The progression aligns with increased market attention on assets that disclose long-term supply structures and migration timelines. The presale stage gives participants defined entry points during a period when stablecoin settlement and AI integration are being evaluated as components of future payment ecosystems. Tiered Validator Participation Reflects Bitcoin Munari’s Long-Term Incentive Design The validator reward pool totals 6,090,000 BTCM distributed across ten years, forming the foundation of the project’s staking model. Participation is structured across three tiers that remain consistent during both the SPL and Layer-1 phases. Full validators stake 10,000 BTCM and operate server-grade hardware including an 8-core CPU, 32GB RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a 1Gbps connection. Rewards correlate with uptime and stake proportion. Mobile validators participate using a 1,000 BTCM stake on supported Android devices, receiving rewards at a reduced rate relative to full validators. Delegators may contribute from 100 BTCM , assigning stake to existing validators and receiving proportional rewards after commission without managing hardware. The tier system outlines how participation, emissions, and block production responsibilities will be organized once the mainnet is active. Audit Materials Establish Bitcoin Munari’s Early Technical Profile Independent assessments have been published ahead of the SPL launch. Solidproof completed a comprehensive audit of the initial SPL contract logic, and Spy Wolf conducted a separate review confirming the behavior of early deployment components. Spy Wolf’s KYC verification documents team identity and internal accountability procedures. These materials provide presale participants with reference points for evaluating technical readiness, project oversight, and early-stage implementation as the Layer-1 migration approaches. The alignment between emerging payment models highlighted at the Federal Reserve’s conference and Bitcoin Munari’s structured development sequence has drawn attention from participants evaluating assets with fixed issuance and transparent operational plans. The January SPL launch marks the next step in this progression as the project moves toward its Layer-1 environment.

Under the leadership of CEO Paolo Ardoino, Tether has broadened its focus beyond digital assets, becoming a significant player in the commodity market, particularly with substantial gold reserves. Tether’s Gold Ambition Recent reports from the Financial Times reveal that Tether has stirred the gold markets this year by becoming the largest holder of the precious metal outside of central banks. According to Bryce Elder’s analysis, the crypto firm’s stockpile is comparable to that of smaller central banks, such as those in Korea, Hungary, and Greece. Last quarter, the company’s gold acquisitions accounted for nearly 2% of total gold demand, equating to almost 12% of central bank purchases. Sources indicate that Tether’s investments in gold reflect the belief among its insiders that the commodity serves as “a superior store of value” and a “better hedge against inflation” compared to digital currencies. Although Tether has significant holdings in Bitcoin, its investment in gold has surpassed its exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Throughout the year, Tether purchased 26 tons of gold, bringing its total gold stockpile to over 116 tons. However, Tether’s ambitions in the gold sector extend beyond mere accumulation; the firm is actively pursuing deals related to gold royalty companies, which finance mining operations in exchange for a percentage of future revenues. Plans To Dominate The Gold Royalty Space In June, Tether Investments—responsible for managing the company’s profits—acquired a minority stake in Toronto-listed Elemental Altus for $105 million. An additional $100 million was invested in September amid Elemental’s merger with rival EMX, resulting in Tether holding a controlling stake in the company. Insiders suggest that the crypto giant has broader plans, aiming to consolidate small to mid-cap gold royalty firms to strengthen its position in the market. “Their goal is to keep consolidating the small to mid-cap gold royalty space,” said an insider familiar with Tether’s strategy. However, while some view this approach as savvy, others are skeptical, with one commodity industry executive labeling Tether as “the weirdest company I have ever dealt with.” Gold royalties offer the company a unique advantage over traditional bullion; they provide fixed exposure to gold, insulating the stablecoin issuer from fluctuations in gold prices. Yet, amid these ventures, Tether has faced scrutiny regarding its financials. NewsBTC reported on Wednesday that S&P Global downgraded Tether’s assets to its lowest rating, “weak,” citing concerns over the firm’s rising exposure to high-risk reserve assets, which could undermine the collateral backing its stablecoin during a financial crisis. According to a research note from S&P Global, this downgrade was part of a new assessment system introduced in 2023, which classifies stablecoins on a scale from 1 to 5 based on risk. The firm’s USDT stablecoin received a rating of “5 (weak),” reflecting a decline from its previous score of “4 (constrained).” Analysts expressed concerns regarding Tether’s limited transparency concerning the creditworthiness of its custodians and counterparties. In response to the downgrade, the firm’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to address the concerns, stating, “We wear your loathing with pride.” He contended that traditional credit rating methodologies used by agencies like S&P stem from “outdated systems that have proven unreliable,” leading to renewed regulatory scrutiny of these legacy models.

55038898,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90866,1764324024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Top Cryptos for Aggressive Growth in 12 Months, With Mutuum Finance Leading With Presale Phase 6 Nearing Sellout",https://timestabloid.com/top-cryptos-for-aggressive-growth-in-12-months-with-mutuum-finance/,"The search for what crypto to buy now has intensified as investors chase the best crypto to buy for aggressive 12-month gains while the broader market stabilizes. Conditions have shifted just enough to pull attention toward assets with improving technical setups or accelerating presale momentum, especially among those reviewing the best cryptos to buy now. Against this backdrop, XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have emerged as timely candidates, each benefiting from unique catalysts that continue to influence short-term and long-term positioning. XRP Builds Strength Near Key Support XRP has been recovering from a sharp drawdown, and this week’s movement has started reshaping sentiment around the asset. The token fell more than 29% during the recent broader pullback, yet XRP has now rebounded from the $1.85 support region, a zone that repeatedly delivered strong reactions in the past. Traders assessing what crypto to invest in have been closely watching this region because nearly 1.80 billion XRP was accumulated around the deeper $1.75 level, reinforcing its importance. Furthermore, XRP has been forming a bullish Morning Star structure on the daily timeframe as the price attempts to reclaim higher ground. The uptick to $2.03 has generated attention from investors evaluating the best crypto to invest in even though the trading volume has thinned by more than 50%. Market participants remain cautious, but the rising Average Directional Index above 34 has signalled that directional strength is building. Meanwhile, falling exchange reserves on Binance have supported the view that accumulation is underway, especially as leveraged traders position around the $2.006 and $2.072 liquidation zones. These dynamics continue to shape XRP’s appeal among those monitoring the top crypto to buy for short-term momentum plays. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Acceleration Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been gaining traction as Phase 6 of its presale reaches 95% completion. The current pricing at $0.035 has already risen 250% from its Phase 1 level of $0.01, and the next stage will lift the token to $0.04. Consequently, investors searching for a new crypto coin with a defined pricing structure have been entering before Phase 6 closes. Total funds raised have reached $19,020,000 and the presale now includes 18,250 holders, reinforcing confidence that participation is expanding smoothly. Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the opportunity to secure tokens at this discounted level is ending, since the launch price is set at $0.06, positioning current buyers for an estimated 380% gain. This dynamic alone has placed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among the best cryptocurrency to invest in for those prioritizing near-term upside while still entering before liquidity shifts into the open market. V1 Lending Protocol Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also confirmed that the V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia testnet in 2025 will introduce a Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot, enhancing the foundation for its dual-market lending system. ETH and USDT are set as the initial collateral and lending assets, increasing the protocol’s practical utility ahead of mainnet deployment. This update has reinforced its standing among investors tracking top cryptocurrencies with actual development progress rather than speculative narratives. Giveaway Incentives and Card Purchases The project introduced a $100,000 giveaway , split into ten $10,000 prizes, adding another layer of incentives for newcomers reviewing crypto to buy now. Alongside this, the recent addition of card-based MUTM purchases without limits, announced through the team’s updates, has simplified access and encouraged broader participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to build momentum as these updates align with its structured presale and upcoming protocol deployment. Investors evaluating the best cryptocurrency to invest in today have been monitoring this rapid progress as the window to enter Phase 6 tightens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is climbing toward its next presale milestone, and anyone targeting aggressive growth over the next 12 months may want to consider positioning early before the next price increase.

Related Reading: Ethereum’s End-Of-Year Rally Still At Play? Analysts Eye 50% December Jump Solana Bounces Despite ETF Outflows The crypto market has surged above the $3 trillion mark for the first time in a week, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most leading cryptocurrencies reclaiming crucial support levels lost during the latest market pullback. Solana joined the market rally and jumped from the recently recovered $135-$140 area to the upper zone of its local range on Wednesday afternoon. Notably, the altcoin has been trading between the $130-$145 price range over the past two weeks, briefly losing the lower boundary during last week’s correction. This week, SOL’s price has reclaimed some crucial ground, surging over 10% since Monday’s opening and nearing the $145 resistance. Amid this performance, analyst Ted Pillows noted institutional participation, as SOL treasury companies have started to show early signs of recovery. He also highlighted that Solana Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have experienced record inflows this month despite the correction. According to Farside Investors’ data, the SOL-based investment products have registered $613 million in inflows since their launch on October 28. It’s worth noting that throughout the recent pullbacks, Solana funds have seen a strong demand, with a 22-day positive streak while the altcoin’s price descended to multi-month lows. However, as its price recovered, SOL’s ETFs registered their first negative in nearly a month. 21Shares’ TSOL, which launched a week ago, saw $34 million in outflows on Wednesday, outshining the over $13 million and $10 million in inflows of Bitwise’s BSOL and Grayscale’s GSOL. As a result, the whole category recorded net outflows of $8.1 million. In his analysis, Ted Pillows also noted that “It seems like SOL has bottomed for a while, but institutional buying needs to accelerate here. Otherwise, it won’t take long for Solana to make new lows.” SOL Ready For December Recovery? Analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Solana’s pain might be over as its price “usually bottoms when investors capitulate… And for the past two weeks, that’s exactly what’s been happening.” According to the chart, SOL’s price has historically found a floor when the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator reaches the capitulation zone, which it has recently fallen to. Meanwhile, Crypto Patel highlighted that Solana is breaking out of a one-month downtrend, which could trigger a 25% recovery rally near the key $180 barrier in the coming weeks. Another market observer warned that the altcoin is “walking straight into the lion’s den” as its price nears the $144-$146 resistance levels. Trader Mr. Ape noted that Solana’s price has been rejected three times from this heavy supply area, and momentum “is slowing again as we hit the zone.” Related Reading: XRP ETFs Outshine BTC, ETH, And SOL Funds With $164M Single-Day Inflows To the trader, this is the crucial level to watch, as another rejection could send the price to the $132 support, where strong demand lies from the previous bounce. On the contrary, a successful breakout from this level and reclaiming it as support could confirm the shift and trigger a surge to the $157 area. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $142, a 7.7% increase on the weekly timeframe.

The company, led by Tom Lee, now holds 3% of all Ethereum after purchasing. According to recent market commentary, this purchase is seen as a strong vote of confidence in ETH and may signal that BitMine anticipates significant upside ahead. Data from Arkham Intelligence indicates that BitMine purchased ETH from BitGo at $3,033 each using the wallet address “0xbd0…E75B8.” BitMine has not officially confirmed this, but it is likely to grow its holdings, as it recently purchased $200 million worth of ETH. BitMine continues to purchase more Ethereum despite the market decline Analysts say the crypto market has been highly unpredictable recently, with prices fluctuating frequently; however, this hasn’t stopped BitMine from purchasing more ETH to support its long-term investment strategy. The company now holds 3% of the total ETH supply, with 3,629,701 ETH ($10.9 billion at current market prices), and states that it is not yet done, as it aims to own up to 5% of all the Ethereum in existence. BitMine is establishing a strong and influential position that will enhance the value of its treasury and demonstrate to the market its confidence in the long-term value of ETH. However, there are widespread effects on investor sentiment, trading activity, and price changes when a popular institution like BitMine buys large amounts of cryptocurrency at once. Such a significant purchase can increase trading volume in the market, cause prices to surge, and even draw more attention from both retail and professional traders. In the past, similar purchases of ETH have resulted in price increases of 5% to 10% within 24 to 48 hours. Traders closely monitor these significant activities because they indicate the market’s direction and provide opportunities for investment. Ethereum now trades at nearly $3,018, with support levels at around $2,800 and resistance near $3,500. The presence of big players like BitMine could push the price towards resistance. However, the effects of this significant purchase extend beyond ETH itself, as it also increases traders’ and investors’ confidence in other altcoins and blockchain projects built on Ethereum’s network. The support that BitMine has shown for Ethereum will encourage both retail and professional investors to buy or hold ETH, as they know influential institutions are backing the asset. Tom Lee says Ethereum could reach $9,000 BitMine chair and popular cryptocurrency analyst, Tom Lee, said the price of ETH could increase significantly in the next few months, even after the market falls. He said the price could first drop to around $2,500 and then climb steadily to between $7,000 and $9,000 by the end of January 2026. Lee also predicts that the price of Bitcoin could surpass $100,000 by the end of the year, as more companies and individuals will seek to buy and utilize cryptocurrency. The BitMine chair also said the Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates low to encourage investors to put more money into cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC. With easier rates, people and companies will take more risks, invest more, and encourage others to join the market. Lee says investors can plan better, hold their investments longer, and avoid panicking during market fluctuations when they are sure of what to expect from big agencies like the Federal Reserve. His predictions also impact stock markets, particularly tech-heavy indexes, as some investors perceive correlations between cryptocurrency and technology companies. So, when one grows, it will boost the other.

Bitcoin Sentiment Reset Puts Bitcoin Hyper in the Conversation for the Next Crypto to Explode November 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Crypto sentiment just climbed out of the basement while $BTC trades at $90.9K , with the Fear & Greed Index rising to 25, still in ‘Extreme Fear’ but up nearly 10 points from mid-November. That kind of backdrop usually rewards patient accumulation rather than chasing candles, especially when December’s historic average return sits near 4.75% and volatility compresses before bigger moves. In that kind of setup, infrastructure plays linked to $BTC’s next wave of adoption start to matter. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on Solana Virtual Machine tech, pushing transactions down to seconds and opening the door to Solana-style dApps on Bitcoin’s settlement layer. As network load and fees spike whenever $BTC makes a run toward six figures, users rotate to L2 rails that preserve speed and predictability. With $28.64M already raised at a presale price of $0.013345, you get direct exposure to that scaling narrative at an earlier stage than the underlying asset. Explore what Bitcoin Hyper is here. Altcoin Season Reignites as Best Wallet Token Emerges as a Potential Next Crypto to Explode November 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Analysts are watching pairs like ETH/BTC, XRP/BTC, and ADA/BTC as they grind sideways while $BTC cools, a pattern that historically sets up classic altcoin seasons once liquidity rotates out of the benchmark. Rising trading volumes and stronger market structure around majors suggest you stand near the late-bear, early-cycle handoff, where infrastructure and tooling plays tend to outperform higher-beta memes on a risk-adjusted basis. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) sits right in that lane. It powers a top non-custodial wallet that already aggregates altcoins, meme coins, and even curated presales in one interface, with plans to support 60+ chains, NFT galleries, and a debit card stack. Because $BEST is wired into that routing layer, every uptick in on-chain usage and altcoin speculation reinforces token utility across governance, rewards, and ecosystem access. The presale has raised $18.12M so far at a price of $0.026015, giving you exposure at infrastructure level rather than chasing late-cycle charts. Find out how to buy Best Wallet Token.

He references the continued relevance of Judge Torres’ 2023 ruling , confirming that XRP is not considered a security when traded on secondary markets, a determination he views as essential for institutional comfort. He also references market indicators surrounding XRP at the time of his post, noting a price of $2.18 and a market capitalization of approximately $136 billion. He highlights that Bitwise’s XRP ETF had gathered more than $422 million in inflows by November 21. With representatives from BlackRock, Coinbase, and Nasdaq scheduled to participate in the SEC’s December 4 meeting, Vincent considers the timing important for evaluating blockchain-based equity settlement. Technical Foundations of XRPL A central part of Vincent’s commentary focuses on the XRP Ledger’s operational history and the upgrades that have been added over time. He cites more than 3.9 billion processed transactions, over 70 million ledgers, settlement speeds between three and five seconds , and minimal transaction costs. He also highlights version 2.5.0, released in June 2025, which introduced batch transactions and permissioned decentralized exchange controls that he believes are suitable for institutional requirements. Vincent notes a common misunderstanding around transaction throughput. He explains that wholesale settlement processes rely on a relatively modest volume of daily instructions compared to retail trading volumes. According to his view, batched settlement on XRPL could meet these needs at fewer than 100 transactions per second, making capacity concerns less significant than often assumed.

Together with permissioned domains implemented in October 2025, he believes these features create a compliance structure that may appeal to panelists at the SEC meeting, including academic specialists and market experts. His assessment outlines how major brokers could theoretically use XRPL for the tokenization and settlement of equity shares, reducing reliance on conventional clearing systems. He contrasts this with Ethereum’s ecosystem, which he describes as strong for retail activity but less suitable for wholesale financial infrastructure due to cost and risk considerations. Vincent concludes by suggesting that the outcome of the December 4 meeting could influence how regulators view blockchain-based settlement frameworks. He further stated that if the SEC acknowledges the relevance of XRPL’s compliance features, it may open the way for broader institutional evaluation of the ledger’s role in future market infrastructure.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) published its updated position this week, showing support for a “no gain, no loss” model that would align tax events with actual economic outcomes rather than every token movement. Source: HMRC UK Proposes Taxing DeFi Gains Only at Withdrawal, Not at Deposit Under the current system, DeFi users can incur a capital gains tax charge simply by depositing tokens into a protocol, even if they retain exposure to the same asset. That interpretation treats deposits as disposals, forcing users into complex record-keeping and potential tax bills before any real profit is made. The proposed change would defer tax until users eventually sell, swap, or otherwise dispose of their assets in a way that reflects a genuine gain or loss. HMRC’s revised approach follows more than two years of consultations, including a public call for evidence in 2022 and a formal consultation in mid-2023 . A newly published summary shows that 32 organizations and individuals submitted detailed responses, including Aave, Binance, Deloitte, CryptoUK, and several major accounting firms. Many respondents argued that the current rules distort economic reality and place disproportionate administrative burdens on everyday DeFi participants. The “no gain, no loss” model would apply to both single-token lending arrangements and more complex multi-token setups such as automated market makers. That means users supplying liquidity to pools would no longer be taxed at the point of deposit. Instead, tax would be calculated when tokens are withdrawn and ultimately sold. If users receive more tokens back than they deposited, the excess would be taxable as a gain. If they receive fewer, it would be treated as a loss. The framework would also apply to crypto borrowing arrangements. When users borrow tokens and later repay them, the disposal would be calculated only from the difference between what was borrowed and what is returned. Notably, this will ensure the tax bill reflects real gains rather than notional movements between smart contracts. Aave Founder Calls UK DeFi Tax Update a “Major Win” as HMRC Backs NGNL Model Aave founder Stani Kulechov described the update as a “major win for U.K. DeFi users,” noting that HMRC’s willingness to treat deposits as non-disposals reflects how decentralized protocols function in practice. HMRC has published its consultation outcome in the UK regarding the taxation of DeFi activities related to lending and staking. A particularly interesting conclusion is that when users deposit assets into Aave, the deposit itself is not treated as a disposal for capital gains… — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) November 27, 2025 Industry participants responding to the consultation consistently backed the NGNL model over alternatives, warning that repo-style rules or treating every token movement as a taxable event would introduce even more complexity, particularly for retail users. The changes do not show a loosening of the U.K.’s overall crypto tax regime. Cryptoassets remain classified as property, and disposals such as selling, swapping, or spending tokens are still subject to capital gains tax. Income from mining, staking rewards, airdrops, and employment-related crypto continues to fall under income tax rules. HMRC emphasized that even under the revised framework, users may still be required to report high volumes of transactions, though the agency is working with software providers to assess the burden. The updated DeFi tax approach comes as the U.K. steps up enforcement efforts across the crypto sector. HMRC issued 65,000 “nudge letters” to suspected under-reporters this year, a 134% increase from 2024, using exchange-supplied data to identify potential cases. UK tax authority sent 65,000 warning letters to crypto investors, a 134% jump from last year, signaling tougher enforcement. #UK #Tax https://t.co/Um572G9yGj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 19, 2025 A broader crackdown is scheduled for 2026 when the global Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework comes into force, requiring platforms to collect and report customer tax reference numbers.

Key Takeaways: Balancer plans to reimburse about $8 million to affected users after a $128 million exploit hit its V2 pools. Around $28 million was recovered in total through whitehat actions and internal rescue efforts. The remaining $19.7 million will be repaid separately by StakeWise through its own governance process. A proposal published Thursday by two community members lays out a framework to return roughly $8 million in recovered assets to affected liquidity providers. The funds come from a mix of whitehat interventions and internal recovery efforts carried out during and after the attack. Community feedback is now being sought before any final decision is made. Balancer Recovers $28M After Exploit Forces Protocol Shutdown The exploit affected pools on five different networks and forced Balancer to pause portions of the protocol as security teams and outside researchers rushed to safeguard vulnerable assets. In total, around $28 million of the stolen funds were eventually recovered through coordinated rescue efforts involving independent security researchers, Balancer’s internal team, and third parties. Under the proposal, the reimbursement plan will cover only the $8 million rescued directly by whitehats and Balancer’s internal operations. The remaining $19.7 million, held in osETH and osGNO, will be reimbursed separately through the governance process of Ethereum liquid staking protocol StakeWise, which has committed to returning funds to its impacted users. The framework follows Balancer DAO’s Safe Harbor Agreement, which outlines the terms for whitehat recoveries and compensation. Bounties are issued in the same assets recovered and cannot be taken directly from user funds. Whitehat participants are set to receive a 10% bounty, capped at $1 million per operation, once they complete identity verification, compliance screening, and other legal checks.

One hacker, referred to as “Anon #1,” accounted for the largest single recovery after securing $2.68 million in assets on Polygon, including WPOL, MaticX, TruMATIC, and stMatic tokens. Balancer also coordinated internal rescue operations with security firm Certora, recovering an additional $4.1 million from metastable pools on Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum that were deemed at risk but had not yet been exploited. To claim funds, affected users will be required to digitally accept new terms and release Balancer Labs, its DAO, and related entities from legal liability tied to the incident. A 180-day claim window is included, after which any unclaimed funds may be reassigned through future governance votes. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.

CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn said the current spike in whale inflows is similar to patterns seen in March 2025, when Bitcoin moved from around $102K to the low $70K range . “ In those situations, whales typically send funds to exchanges either to take profit or to manage risk when the market weakens. With the 30-day inflow measure still climbing, the data does not yet suggest that selling pressure has stabilized,” he added. Whale Inflows to Binance Hit $7.5B — a New Yearly High “The current spike in inflows is similar to patterns seen in earlier high-volatility periods, such as March 2025, when Bitcoin moved from around $102K to the low $70K.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/Esprsxd516 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 27, 2025 For investors, this means the risk zone for Bitcoin has not fully cleared, and the market remains too fragile to determine whether a trend reversal is imminent or if Bitcoin will continue visiting the lows to trigger a long-term bear market . Bitcoin November Crash Mirrors 2021 Bear Market, Not 2023 Dip Ki Young Ju, Founder and CEO at CryptoQuant, pointed out that “ Bitcoin on-chain indicators are bearish, and further upside likely depends on macro liquidity. “ Expert Bitcoin and Commodities Investor G. Martín believes the $126,000 high in October has likely printed Bitcoin’s post-halving top, and the current move looks less like a dip and more like the start of a traditional bear market . In his Substack post titled “Bitcoin is in a Bear Market,” Martín argued that the October 10 de-leveraging event, which saw $19 billion wiped from the crypto market, was more similar to the 2021-2022 early bear market stage rather than the 2023 bull market OI flush. “We can clearly see how the trend is finally broken, and OI is starting to pick up again, which could mean traders are positioning for lower prices,” he said. Source: GMartin Substack Martín added that the last two months, during which Bitcoin fell from $126k to $80k , show how much asset prices are driven by sentiment, greed, and fear, not just fundamentals. He described Bitcoin as an asset with no cash flows whose price is mainly driven by liquidity and propelled by new narratives each cycle. “Over the last six months, 95% of retail bought Bitcoin with an average cost of ~$115k, mostly during the ‘Crypto President Trump’ euphoria. Few stopped to consider that we had already gone through a +700% bull run over three years,” he said. When BTC price was chopping around $100k, the narratives felt less like rational analysis and more like denial. “It seemed people weren’t truly bullish; instead, they were scared because their entry price was underwater,” Martín concluded. Martín identified Michael Saylor’s Strategy’s MSTR mNAV as a vital indicator for a Bitcoin-led bear market, noting it’s now behaving similarly to the early stages of the 2021–2022 bear market. Source: GMartin Substack Fed Rate Cuts Won’t Save Bitcoin -Analyst Warns Martín also addressed the Fed rate cut expectation in December, which many view as bullish for a Bitcoin Santa rally as QT ends next week. Bitcoin may slip to $60K – $80K if the Fed holds rates steady, but analysts call it a “healthy recalibration"", not a new crypto winter. #Bitcoin #InterestRates #Fed https://t.co/Mheh7KZH9T — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 He explained that if the Fed reduces its balance sheet from long-term holdings, capital to buy these assets will come from the private sector, draining liquidity from markets. Source: Blockworks “Rate cuts will be positive for the economy in general, but not necessarily bullish for Bitcoin,” he said. He believes current Fed policies might end the Bitcoin 4-year cycle and see the asset bottom out in late 2026 when liquidity returns. According to his analysis, Bitcoin must reclaim several major resistances after November’s selloff to mark a proper bottom around its 200-Week SMA before a bullish rally can resume. Source: TradingView In this scenario, Bitcoin might likely revisit the $73k or even $70k lows, followed by a relief rally toward $95k–$105k in the mid-term.

Joining XRP, blockchain leaders Algorand (ALGO) and Stellar (XLM) are also verified, marking a major milestone in integrating digital assets into Europe’s financial ecosystem. ”The European Ledger aims to revolutionize finance by uniting tokenized central bank money, commercial bank money, and other digital assets on a single, programmable platform,” said fintech expert Mr. Cipollone. ”This shared infrastructure could redefine how Europe manages and transacts digital value.” The initiative transforms T2S, the centralized European securities settlement system, into a cutting-edge DLT-based infrastructure. Central banks provide the foundational 'rails,' while market participants operate the 'trains,' enabling seamless liquidity and asset flows across this next-generation ecosystem. Verification of XRP, Algorand, and Stellar on the European Ledger marks a key step toward institutional recognition and mainstream adoption in regulated markets. XRP’s payment-focused utility positions it for pivotal cross-border settlements, while Algorand’s scalable blockchain and Stellar’s fast, low-cost payments advance the ledger’s mission of interoperability and efficiency. Industry experts highlight Europe’s shift toward a DLT-based single market as a reflection of global trends in programmable money and tokenized assets. By combining regulatory oversight with blockchain efficiency, the European Ledger could become a blueprint for integrating traditional finance with emerging digital ecosystems. Banks, fintech innovators, and other market participants stand to gain from faster, more transparent, and cost-effective settlement processes. The initiative underscores Europe’s commitment to fostering financial innovation while upholding strict regulatory standards, a balance key to the continent’s future financial resilience. Conclusion With XRP, Algorand, and Stellar officially verified, the European Ledger takes a decisive leap toward a unified, DLT-powered financial system, turning tokenized assets and programmable money from theory into integral, operational pillars of Europe’s economy.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,ALGO|WALLET|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-28 11:20:54

Over the last 24 hours, the asset has slipped slightly, according to CoinGecko data. Market participants are now monitoring whether current levels will hold or shift further due to recent activity from large wallet addresses. Whale Movements Trigger Caution Across Market Data from Santiment, shared by Ali Martinez, shows a steep drop in holdings among wallets holding 1 million to 10 million XRP. This group of wallets offloaded 460 million tokens over a four-day span. The movement reflects profit-taking after recent gains and a redistribution of tokens into smaller or institutional wallets. 460 million $XRP sold or redistributed by whales in 96 hours! pic.twitter.com/QkcXgp6SAC — Ali (@ali_charts) November 27, 2025 Recent on-chain data also show that whale activity isn’t new. CryptoPotato recently reported that whales moved close to 1.5 billion XRP over the past month, with an additional 180 million dumped earlier this week. The scale of movement may add pressure on smaller holders. While some whales are offloading, exchange reserves are declining. According to recent data, Binance reserves for XRP have dropped to around 2.7 billion, down sharply since early October. The decrease suggests accumulation by long-term and institutional buyers. “Long consolidation periods in XRP followed by squeezes above key moving averages have historically been followed by strong moves,” the analyst stated. Source: CryptosRUs/X The report also mentioned that recent spot XRP ETF inflows crossed $21 million, aligning with the supply drop on exchanges. These conditions often occur before market volatility returns. Technical Structure Holds Above $2.00 ChartNerdTA noted that XRP is currently repeating a structure last seen in 2017. Back then, the asset saw a 3-month cool-off before launching higher. The setup now includes a return to the 3-month 20-EMA. “If history is shaping up to repeat, then we’re missing at least a 10x upside move,” the analyst wrote. According to the analysis, the structure remains intact as long as XRP stays above $1.20. Currently, $2.00 is acting as the nearest support zone. If that level holds, the next target sits around $2.60—mid-range resistance within recent trading activity. Short-Term Outlook Remains Mixed CRYPTOWZRD posted an update on XRP’s recent daily close, calling it “indecisive.” The analyst noted that XRPBTC is under pressure due to Bitcoin’s dominance rising. A move above the $2.2770 resistance could open the door for further gains, with $2.7500 identified as a potential support area. On lower time frames, traders are looking for a clear breakout structure. “We now need to wait for the market to form the next mature chart structure,” the update added. Sideways movement is expected in the short term unless Bitcoin shifts direction during weekly and monthly closes.

The big question now is whether this explosive growth can continue. This article dives into the details, exploring the potential for SPX6900 and other promising coins poised for a breakout. Find out which cryptocurrencies might be the next to soar. SPX6900 Eyes Resistance Levels After Recent Gains Source: tradingview The price of SPX6900 (SPX) is between 43 and 59 cents. It's seen a one-week increase of about 46% despite a drop of nearly 28% over the past month. This suggests some recovery. The nearest hurdle is around 67 cents, and breaking it could mean a jump of around 14% from its current peak. Further growth could push SPX towards the next resistance at 83 cents, a potential rise of almost 42%. However, recent trends show the coin has been below the 100-day simple moving average of nearly 64 cents. The increased buying interest, reflected in a relative strength index of 60, suggests optimism around SPX's future. Conclusion SPX has seen an impressive rise of 56% this week. This momentum might indicate a continued upward trend. However, the market's next moves remain to be seen. Factors influencing SPX's future include broader market conditions and investor sentiment. If positive trends persist, SPX could extend its gains. Careful monitoring of market indicators may provide more insights on whether SPX can sustain its parabolic run.

Currently at an advanced level of over 95% completed in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM’s popularity has skyrocketed due to its impending release of its V1 protocol and the ever-expanding support of its DeFi ecosystem. Priced at a meager $0.035, the token has already been purchased by over 18,250 buyers, raising nearly $19.02 million in this short period. As the best DeFi token requiring immediate support through tangible applications and community support rather than just hype and market speculations, MUTM has proven itself as the best-performing and best-to-own asset at this moment in the next market cycle. Mutuum Finance Presales Continue to Rise Mutuum Finance is emerging as one of the most awaited DeFi crypto platforms of 2025. Phase 6 of the presale has been valued at $0.035 and will be the last phase from which early users can benefit before the price rises to $0.04 in Phase 7. The platform also allows users to invest through direct Credit and Debit Card transactions, which ended the traditional hurdles of investing. As the level of market interest rises, MUTM also becomes one of the top crypto to buy before the presale phase moves ahead. Scalable and Trustworthy DeFi The Mutuum Finance platform focuses on the development of a decentralized lending and borrowing system which will promote the efficient and secure financing of digital assets. The platform allows users to lend assets in order to generate passive income streams through smart contract-driven transactions of every asset. In contrast to the purely speculatory-driven projects, according to the characteristics of Mutuum Finance, the platform predominantly focuses on functionality. The platform’s liquidity pools bind lenders and borrowers together. Currently, the Presale has managed to raise above $19.02 million from over 18,250 participants. This shows the community’s interest in the platform and the level of development being achieved. MUTM has established itself as a leading DeFi crypto for investors seeking practical yield and innovation. The presale has a transparent allocation system that aims to promote growth alongside sustainability. For example, from a pool of 4 billion MUTM tokens, the allocation for the presale amounts to 45.5% of the tokens, which is approximately 1.82 billion tokens. In this case, over 795 million tokens have been sold. Direct card transactions are also possible at this point without restrictions. This has made it easy for both novice and veteran investors to participate. The impact of this move has been to see that Mutuum Finance ranks as one of the most active top crypto to buy in the current year. MUTM Roadmap Currently, Mutuum Finance is at Phase 2 of its roadmap – “Building Mutuum” which involves technological development. The development involves the final coding of smart contracts, internal testing, and the development of the front-end and back-end applications of the DApp. This phase also involves the incorporation of advanced functionality and the risk management tools before the testnet launch. Next will be the Phase 2 completion and the transition to Phase 3: Finalizing Mutuum Finance, the final phase prior to the deployment of the mainnet. This phase will see testnet beta testing and the beginning of security audits prior to the impending V1 launch within Sepolia. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also proven itself to be the top crypto to buy and one of the most promising DeFi crypto initiatives of 2025 because Phase 6 of the project has been sold above 95% at the price of $0.035. The project has managed to attract the support of more than 18,250 investors who have invested almost $19.02 million. The project has entered the development phase of Phase 2 and has initiated the development of smart contract code and risk management protocols. Presale phase 7 is coming in at $0.04. This makes the current moment one of the final opportunities to get involved in the early stages of what has been identified as the best cryptocurrency to invest in before its mainnet launch.

His projection follows governments, banks, and corporates reevaluating the role of tokenized money and its ability to shape the allocation of capital, as well as settlement processes and financial flows between countries. Banks battle liquidity shifts as atablecoin adoption expands Gupta cited developments in Japan as evidence that digital tokens can be used in formal economic systems without undermining the power of monetary authorities. By using stablecoins like JPYC to purchase government bonds and distribute stimulus, Japan has shown that central banks can maintain control of the situation using traditional macroeconomic tools, including interest rate adjustments. Gupta stated that these mechanisms continue to influence the behavior of stablecoins in the same manner as they affect national currencies. The forecast explosion in new issuers, however, presents difficulties for banking models based on cheap deposits. According to Gupta, yields on offer in digital-asset markets are attracting capital away from traditional accounts, increasing the cost of funding for banks, which limits their ability to extend credit. He said that this shift is relative to a structural pressure point that will intensify as more stablecoins enter circulation. In response, Gupta envisions the broadening of deposit token applications, which will enable customers to operate in the digital space without withdrawing actual money from financial institutions. He referred to the system developed by J.P. Morgan , where one can borrow a deposit token and utilize it elsewhere. Meanwhile, the actual balance is maintained under the bank’s custody, thereby maintaining balance-sheet stability without hindering blockchain-based transactions. Neutral settlement layers expected to manage high fragmentation Gupta predicted that a failure would occur with tens of thousands of stablecoins expected. He identified neutral settlement layers as the most probable method of linking several tokens, allowing payments to be made when the sender uses a particular stablecoin and the recipient uses a different one. This method is similar to the current payment-network infrastructure, in which the complexity is concealed from the consumer. Corporate adoption strengthens as infrastructure matures Standard Chartered’s recent analysis supports the view that stablecoins are becoming increasingly integrated into mainstream financial activity. The bank reported an increase in corporate use of dollar-linked tokens in treasury management, cross-border payments, currency hedging, and access to U.S. dollar-equivalent liquidity. It showcased the upcoming partnership between StraitsX, Ant International, and Grab in 2024, which utilizes a regulated Singapore-dollar stablecoin to enable merchants to receive instant payments, regardless of the customer’s currency. The bank also noted that stablecoins are gaining ground in regions of the world with currency volatility, where businesses and individuals are using the coins as an alternative store of value. According to Standard Chartered, the ongoing regulatory discussions and revised accounting guidelines are leading to a greater institutional involvement as companies explore efficiency gains from blockchain-based settlement. With a stronger infrastructure in place, the bank stated that corporates are increasingly exploring ways to integrate stablecoins into payment processes and treasury systems, particularly in areas where conventional cross-border systems are either slow or costly.

Discover which coins might be poised for growth in this evolving landscape. Injective Price Moves: Can INJ Bounce Back? Source: tradingview Injective (INJ) is currently priced between the higher $4 and $6.5 range. It recently saw a one-week rise of over 5%, but the one-month change shows a drop of about 25%. The coin might face resistance around $7.65 and further up at $9.45. The nearest safety net for buyers is at $4.03. If market sentiment shifts, there's space for recovery. With a relative strength index of over 60, INJ could aim for the $7 to $9 range, potentially rising by 20% to 40% from its current standing, but there's also caution as it has declined by almost half over the past six months. Conclusion INJ saw a significant increase of 15% this week. This rise may hint at a potential trend change. Similar movements in other coins like BTC, ETH, and BNB could further validate this. Monitoring market trends and patterns will provide clearer insights. It's crucial to keep an eye on how these coins behave in the coming days.

This progressive move positions the country as a potential hub for blockchain innovation in the region. What Does Turkmenistan’s Digital Assets Law Actually Mean? The new legislation, effective January 1 next year, represents a comprehensive framework for digital assets regulation. Turkmenistan aims to diversify its economy beyond traditional sectors by embracing blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets. The law establishes clear guidelines for: Licensing cryptocurrency exchanges operating within the country Regulating mining companies and their operations Defining legal status for various types of digital assets Creating storage and circulation protocols for secure transactions Why Is Turkmenistan Embracing Digital Assets Now? Turkmenistan’s decision comes at a crucial time when many nations are still debating cryptocurrency regulation. The country recognizes the economic potential of digital assets and blockchain technology to attract foreign investment and modernize its financial infrastructure. This strategic move could position Turkmenistan as a regional leader in digital finance. By establishing clear regulations early, the country creates a stable environment for businesses and investors interested in digital assets development. How Will This Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? The legalization of digital assets in Turkmenistan signals growing global acceptance of cryptocurrency. This development could encourage other Central Asian nations to follow suit, potentially creating a larger, integrated market for digital assets in the region. Key benefits for the cryptocurrency ecosystem include: Increased legitimacy for digital assets globally New market opportunities for exchanges and service providers Enhanced security standards through proper regulation Economic diversification for Turkmenistan’s economy What Challenges Might Turkmenistan Face? While the legalization of digital assets presents significant opportunities, Turkmenistan must address several challenges. Implementing effective regulatory frameworks requires technical expertise and infrastructure development. The country will need to balance innovation with consumer protection and financial stability. However, the potential rewards make these challenges worth addressing.

The exploit drained $128 million in user funds from the protocol. Balancer has initiated a reimbursement program proposal that will oversee the repayment of $8 million to the protocol’s users. The proposal suggests that the protocol’s whitehat actors and internal rescue operations recovered $8 million across multiple networks. Balancer recovers $8 million across various chains Asset recovery from external whitehat activities. Source: Balancer Forum The proposal highlighted that the whitehat hackers recovered $2.681 million from Polygon, $963,832 from the Ethereum mainnet, $161,274 from Base, and close to $50,000 from Arbitrum. The proposal noted that the whitehat hackers who helped recover funds from the Arbitrum network waived their bounty by not identifying themselves and refusing to KYC. StakeWise assisted the protocol in recovering an additional $19.7 million tied to osETH and osGNO. The proposal detailed that these funds will be handled separately and distributed through StakeWise’s own internal mechanisms. The proposal , dated November 27, highlighted that the white-hat hackers who aided the recovery process will receive 10% of the recovered assets. The bounty will be distributed in the same tokens the bounty hunters recovered. The proposal also indicated that its implementation complements the previously approved white-hat reimbursement policy under its S afe Harbor Agreement , including the breakdown of assets recovered by the network and whitehat contributors, as well as the reimbursement of victims affected. The protocol’s Safe Harbor Agreement requires that LPs undergo KYC screening, complete identity verification, and sanctions checks before funds are released to their wallets. The proposal also illustrates that whitehat contributors will also need to pass KYC checks and sanctions screening to receive the bounty proceeds. The proposal also explained that the internal rescue operations involved joint efforts between the protocol’s DAO and Certora team. The alliance targeted metastable pools [CSPv5] (including rETH and other similar pools) that were vulnerable but not yet exploited by attackers. According to the proposal, the distribution of recovered funds to LPs will follow a structured framework that relies on liquidity pools. The process will involve three distribution frameworks, including a non-socialized approach where rescued funds are distributed to liquidity providers of a specific pool or network. The process will also follow a pro-rata by BPT holdings process that will oversee the distribution process in line with each holder’s share of the pool’s BPT at the snapshot block. The payment will be distributed in kind, where LPs will receive the same tokens that were rescued. The proposal finalized that the protocol will establish a claiming mechanism for distributing funds to LPs. Balancer suffers v2 exploit, loses $119 million On November 3, Cryptopolitan reported that Balancer was hit with multiple exploits across various networks, resulting in a loss of $116 million. The news revealed that the bad actors had exploited wrapped ETH on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism. The report noted that the hackers may have exploited a flaw in a smart contract on the DeFi protocol, allowing them to mint unauthorized tokens. Balancer confirmed on its Discord channel that the attackers compromised its v2 pools, gaining access to users’ funds. The attack occurred after Garden Finance suffered a similar fate, resulting in a loss of more than $10 million on October 30. Attackers drained Garden Finance across multiple chains through its token bridge feature. The attacker quickly converted the stolen assets, such as Garden’s native SEED token, wETH, WBTC, USDC, and USDT, into Ethereum (ETH) before dispersing them. Cryptopolitan reported that the protocol’s team reached out to the malicious hacker, offering a 10% bounty.

The rollout introduces a self-operated validator that strengthens security, reduces reliance on third-party nodes, and supports predictable returns as market activity cools. Hence, more users searching for stable reward structures now have a self-custodial option with full oversight of performance, uptime, and stake management. Significantly, this development arrives as Solana’s network sees sustained staking participation, with more than 67% of eligible supply locked. Native Staking Launch Gains Momentum According to the press release , the wallet’s new validator framework lets users stake SOL inside the Earn section with a minimum of 0.01 SOL. Rewards compound automatically and follow Solana’s standard epoch cycle, distributing every 2-3 days. Additionally, the wallet charges no fee beyond normal network gas, supporting a simple and transparent process. Bitget Wallet also backs the experience with its $700 million protection fund, giving users a security buffer during increased staking demand. The platform aims to expand this validator model across other networks. Besides strengthening its staking roadmap, Bitget Wallet positions this upgrade as a step toward unifying native yield strategies within a single app. Consequently, users seeking consistent returns during quieter market periods can shift toward long-term accumulation. Solana Price Holds Breakout Despite Pullback Solana trades at $141.92 after a slight daily dip, yet the token remains up more than 12% over the week. According to Captain Faibik, Solana broke above its major descending trendline and successfully retested the $138–$140 area. Source: X He noted that holding this zone keeps bullish structure intact and opens the path toward $150, $158, and $170. Moreover, a breakout above $150 could spark stronger momentum. Tradinator shared a different angle, stating that Solana may remain within a broader $120–$160 range. He identified $145 as the mid-range level but avoids entering trades around that zone. Lights turn off for bulls if Solana loses $120, a level he marked months earlier.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-28 11:45:23
55043540,636301,1764330403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55043540.jpeg,Bitcoin: Segnali On-Chain Rialzisti mentre i Miner Capitolano. $HYPER è la soluzione L2?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-segnali-on-chain-rialzisti-mentre-i-miner-capitolano-hyper-e-la-soluzione-l2/,"Nonostante l’andamento incerto del prezzo, i fondamentali di Bitcoin mostrano segnali rialzisti. La chiave di lettura sono i profitti dei miner, scesi ai minimi storici: questa pressione finanziaria sta obbligando gli operatori meno efficienti a ‘capitolare’ (chiudere l’attività). Di solito, questa pulizia del mercato segna il punto più basso del ciclo prima di una ripresa. Produrre un Bitcoin oggi costa carissimo: secondo Capriole Investments, la spesa totale è di $83.873 , di cui ben $67.099 servono solo a pagare la bolletta elettrica. Cosa significa? Che i margini di guadagno sono quasi azzerati. Spesso questa situazione anticipa un ultimo, brusco crollo del mercato: i miner in difficoltà sono costretti a vendere e chi ha scommesso al rialzo con soldi in prestito viene spazzato via. Solo dopo questa ‘pulizia’ il mercato riparte davvero verso l’alto È in questo contesto di ricerca di efficienza e rendimento che entra in gioco Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Bitcoin Hyper: Il brand di BTC, la velocità di Solana Il progetto sfrutta la sicurezza e il marchio di Bitcoin, ma sposta l’esecuzione delle transazioni in un ambiente simile a Solana, utilizzando un Layer 2 basato su SVM (Solana Virtual Machine). L’obiettivo? Garantire un throughput (capacità di transazioni) più elevato e una latenza inferiore persino a Solana stessa. In parole povere: punta a trasformare la convinzione passiva dei detentori di BTC in liquidità utilizzabile e programmabile. Per gli investitori che si posizionano in vista di una potenziale fase di espansione di BTC, questo è cruciale. Se il capitale dovesse ruotare dai bilanci dei miner e dalle stablecoin ferme verso la DeFi nativa su Bitcoin, un Layer 2 che rende effettivamente BTC veloce, scalabile e componibile potrebbe attrarre flussi di capitale enormi. I segnali di stress di Bitcoin e la corsa alla UX Quando i margini dei miner sono ai minimi mentre il prezzo oscilla in un range ampio, di solito significa che l’hash rate e la difficoltà sono ancora alti, ma i ricavi non tengono il passo. Storicamente, questo si allinea con le fasi finali di un trend ribassista o con i reset di metà ciclo: i più deboli escono dalla scena e i miner più forti consolidano la capacità prima della prossima avanzata guidata dal mercato spot. In breve: questi dati supportano la possibilità di un potenziale tuffo di BTC sotto la soglia degli $80.000. Anche Arthur Hayes sposa questa tesi, suggerendo che il vero mercato rialzista di BTC potrebbe non arrivare prima del 2026. Sul fronte della scalabilità, il livello base (Layer 1) di Bitcoin non ha cambiato priorità: sicurezza e decentralizzazione vengono prima, l’esperienza utente (UX) dopo. Sono emerse soluzioni per colmare questo divario – Lightning Network per i pagamenti, smart contract su Stacks, rollup su sidechain – ma ognuna presenta compromessi in termini di liquidità o sicurezza. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) si posiziona come l’ultimo concorrente in questa corsa agli armamenti dei Layer 2 di Bitcoin, ma con uno stack di esecuzione molto diverso. Come $HYPER vuole trasformare BTC in un asset DeFi ad alta velocità Invece di reinventare una Virtual Machine da zero, Bitcoin Hyper integra la Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) in un Layer 2 modulare per Bitcoin. Sicurezza: Ancorata al Layer 1 di Bitcoin (Settlement). Esecuzione: Avviene in tempo reale sul Layer 2 SVM, puntando a conferme sotto il secondo, ottimizzate per casi d’uso BTC-centrici. L’impatto pratico è diretto: il “Wrapped BTC” può muoversi attraverso i primitivi della DeFi – DEX, mercati di prestito, protocolli di staking – con la reattività che ci si aspetta da Solana, non da una blockchain con blocchi da 10 minuti. NFT, gaming e dApp ad alta interazione possono usare SDK in Rust e API pur commercializzandosi come “Bitcoin-native”. Previsioni e Presale Questa narrativa sembra risuonare forte. La presale di $HYPER ha raccolto oltre 28,5 milioni di dollari, con un prezzo attuale di $0.013335, suggerendo che gli investitori sono disposti a pagare per esporsi a uno stack Bitcoin programmabile e veloce. Il potenziale a lungo termine del token si basa sulla proposta di utilità di Bitcoin Hyper. Le previsioni di prezzo per $HYPER considerano un target potenziale di $0.20 per il 2026 e $1.50 o superiore entro il 2030. Basandosi sul prezzo di presale odierno, questi numeri si tradurrebbero in ROI rispettivamente del 1.399% e dell’11.148%. Il progetto punta a una finestra di rilascio tra il Q4 2025 e il Q1 2026.

The best meme coins aren’t just funny tickers; they’re the ones that channel this new flow: trading, payments, and gaming volume that prefers anonymity and speed. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) fuses 1,000x meme culture with staking, competitions, and a growing presale war chest tailored to degen retail traders. PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) mine‑to‑earn model gamifies yield through virtual nodes and tiered rewards, aligning naturally with privacy-first, game-heavy meme ecosystems. Shibarium’s roadmap for a 2026 privacy upgrade using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is quietly one of the biggest structural shifts in meme coin history. Moving from simple dog-themed speculation to encrypted L2 rails with confidential smart contracts fundamentally changes what can be built on top of Shiba Inu. ‘Lucie,’ a Shiba Inu executive, shared that the end goal of on-chain privacy and confidential smart contracts could arrive before the end of Q2 2026. FHE-secured transactions and privacy-preserving EVM execution open the door for serious DeFi, on-chain gaming, and high-frequency trading strategies that don’t leak alpha on-chain. Meme coins can plug directly into a privacy-focused infrastructure layer designed for scalable, permissionless experimentation. In that world, the best meme coins with the best upside aren’t just funny tickers; they’re the ones that channel this new flow: trading, payments, and gaming volume that prefers anonymity and speed. You’re not just betting on dog pictures; you’re front‑running an architecture shift toward privacy-backed, utility-rich meme ecosystems. Three meme coins are positioned to ride that transition: one built for leverage-obsessed traders, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , one redefining mining culture, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , and one OG dog coin leveling up its own tech stack as privacy and interoperability go mainstream, Dogecoin ($DOGE) . 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Never Skip Leg-Day, Never Skip a Pump Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is built for the kind of trader who treats every bull market like leg day: brutal, focused, and unapologetically heavy. Branded as a canine juggernaut, $MAXI wraps the 1,000x leverage mentality into a meme token that lives and dies by a high-conviction, high-volatility trading culture on Ethereum. It’s the meme coin that never skips a leg-day or a pump, something degens can truly identify with. If that’s got you sold already, we’ve got your way in with our ‘ How to Buy Maxi Doge ’ guide. Under the hood, $MAXI runs as an ERC‑20 with a smart contract–governed supply and a 5% allocation dedicated to staking. Stakers earn dynamic APY currently sitting at 73%, turning idle meme exposure into a yield-generating position while you grind the charts elsewhere. It’s ‘lift, trade, repeat’ encoded directly into token economics. The $MAXI presale has raised $4.2M, with tokens currently priced at $0.0002705, giving you a defined on-ramp before any Shibarium-powered privacy narrative fully ignites. If Shibarium’s FHE upgrade accelerates demand for high-reward trading communities, a leverage-obsessed meme hub like Maxi Doge sits right in that slipstream. Join the $MAXI presale today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): World’s First Mine-to-Earn Memecoin PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) leans into the other side of degen culture: building a pseudo-mining empire. Branded as the world’s first mine‑to‑earn memecoin, it replaces GPU rigs with a virtual mining system and a gamified dashboard that feels closer to a clicker game than a staking page. Instead of simply buying and holding, you use your $PEPENODE to buy and upgrade virtual nodes that earn tiered rewards, simulating the economics of mining without the hardware or power bill. Higher-tier nodes earn more, creating a clear progression loop that keeps you checking in, upgrading, and chasing the next yield threshold rather than passively sitting on a bag. The PEPENODE presale has already raised over $2.2M, signaling strong demand for this gamified mining narrative. Our experts also note a potential 2026 EOY price prediction of $0.0077 , giving you a possible ROI of over 558% if you bought at today’s price. As memecoins get pulled toward DeFi and on-chain gaming, a mine‑to‑earn model with tiered node rewards positions PEPENODE as a natural fit for users who want interactive yield rather than passive speculation. It’s a clear bet on meme culture evolving into persistent, game-like economies. Get your $PEPENODE for $0.0011685 and don’t miss the 584% staking rewards. 3. Dogecoin ($DOGE): OG Payments Meme Readying a Tech Overhaul Dogecoin ($DOGE) remains the original meme asset that accidentally became real money. Launched as a joke, it evolved into a peer‑to‑peer cryptocurrency for fast, low‑fee transactions, widely used for tipping creators and simple payments. That grassroots utility is now getting a serious technical upgrade. Developers are preparing the DogeOS upgrade, which is set to bolt on ZK-proof–based privacy and Ethereum-compatible smart contract support. That combination could finally push $DOGE beyond simple transfers into DeFi, Web3 gaming, and dApp ecosystems. For a meme asset that already ranks among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap and has been cited as the eighth-largest with rising institutional interest , that’s a non-trivial pivot. It means Dogecoin can realistically coexist with privacy-forward L2 environments like Shibarium, serving as both a payments rail and a composable building block. If Shibarium’s FHE roadmap pulls liquidity and users toward private, EVM-compatible meme ecosystems, a technically upgraded DOGE can act as a bridge between legacy meme liquidity and the next wave of privacy-native applications. It’s still the OG dog, but with a much sharper toolset on the way. Buy $DOGE on top exchanges like Binance. Recap: As Shibarium’s 2026 FHE upgrade drags meme coins into a privacy-first, EVM-powered future, Maxi Doge , PEPENODE , and Dogecoin each target a different vector that could help you stay ahead of the pack. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

SUBBD leverages AI and Web3 to give creators lower fees, token-gated content, and crypto payouts, targeting the $85 billion content industry. Solana’s high throughput, low fees, and new US spot ETF support cement its role as a leading institutional-grade Layer‑1 blockchain. Bolivia’s reserve stress and banking pivot to digital assets underscore the growing demand for crypto infrastructure in the real world, rather than purely speculative tokens. A country’s financial stress often shows up in its policy decisions long before it appears in headlines. Bolivia’s reversal of its crypto ban and its move to let banks custody digital assets isn’t a quirky policy pivot. It’s what happens when foreign reserves fall from over $15B to roughly $2B. In such an environment, stablecoins and liquid crypto rails suddenly appear as essential survival tools. When a country with a long history of monetary controls starts legitimizing digital assets, it shows where macro pressure is heading. Capital wants neutral, censorship-resistant settlement layers. It also wants programmable money that can plug into banking pipes without IMF approval. That shift is why narrowing down the best crypto to buy means focusing on projects with real-world utility. Payment rails that can settle in BTC, high-throughput chains institutions can rely on, and creator-economy infrastructure all rise to the top. Against that backdrop, three plays stand out. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as a Bitcoin-native execution layer with near-Solana speeds. SUBBD ($SUBBD) is building AI-driven tools for creators, while a US spot ETF now backs Solana (SOL) and remains the institutional high-performance L1. Each taps into a concrete use case that becomes more valuable as countries like Bolivia rethink their financial plumbing. In markets where traditional tools fail, crypto infrastructure fills the gaps. That’s why these three assets sit at the center of the reshaping underway. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — First SVM-Powered Bitcoin Layer 2 If Bolivia’s banks begin holding BTC, the next logical step is faster, programmable rails that still inherit Bitcoin’s security. Bitcoin Hyper positions itself precisely as the first Bitcoin Layer 2, running the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . The goal is simple: Solana-level execution speed with Bitcoin-level trust. The design is modular. Bitcoin handles settlement, while a real-time SVM execution layer processes smart contracts and high-throughput workloads. A single sequencer currently manages ordering, with periodic state commitments anchoring everything back to Bitcoin. A Decentralized Canonical Bridge moves BTC between layers as wrapped assets. That setup enables high-speed payments, near-instant confirmations, and low fees, all powered by wrapped BTC. Developers can port SPL-style tokens , use Rust SDKs , and deploy Solana-style dApps without leaving Bitcoin’s trust model. On the capital side, the $HYPER presale has already raised over $28.6M, with tokens at $0.013345. That momentum has already fed into broader market modelling, with analysts mapping out where the ecosystem could trade once the network goes live. For a deeper breakdown of potential upside ranges, you can check our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction guide . Two high-net-worth wallets accumulated $396K recently, including a $53K buy . Staking opens right after TGE with high APY and a short seven-day presale vesting model. If you expect banks and emerging markets to route payments through Bitcoin over time, a Bitcoin-native SVM execution layer becomes a clear infrastructure play. You can learn more about Bitcoin Hyper or join the $HYPER presale directly . 2. SUBBD ($SUBBD) — AI + Web3 Stack for Creators Under Pressure Bolivia’s pivot is about financial survival, but creators are facing their own pressure as platform cuts rise and ad cycles tighten. SUBBD ($SUBBD) responds by merging AI and Web3 to give creators more control over distribution and monetization. The platform bundles AI Personal Assistants, AI Voice Cloning, and AI Influencer Creation into one toolkit. Creators can automate interactions and gate premium posts or communities behind token-based access that settles in crypto. This shift matters because programmable monetization lets a YouTuber in La Paz or a musician in Buenos Aires earn in crypto and keep ownership of their catalog. In regions dealing with FX friction and banking limits, that flexibility becomes real economic optionality. On the numbers, the SUBBD presale has raised over $1.3M, with tokens at $0.05705 and 20% first-year staking. That mix of AI tooling and on-chain monetization positions SUBBD as a targeted bet on the $85B creator economy moving into Web3. Explore the SUBBD presale today . 3. Solana ($SOL) — High-Throughput L1 Now Backed By a US Spot ETF You also want exposure to infrastructure that institutions can actually use. Solana ($SOL) has evolved from a ‘fast L1 experiment’ into a high-performance settlement layer with thousands of TPS and sub-cent fees. That performance profile matters as banks and corporates explore routing stablecoin payments or tokenized treasuries across public chains. Solana’s throughput and low fees give it real advantages for scalable payments, order books, and consumer apps. Its ecosystem has matured into one of the strongest in crypto. NFTs, DeFi, and consumer-grade applications now operate at scale without the bottlenecks seen on older networks. The shift became unmistakable when Bitwise launched the first US spot Solana ETF on October 28, 2025. It pulled in roughly $420M in the first week, signaling that institutions now treat SOL as investable infrastructure. For investors watching countries like Bolivia normalize digital assets, Solana offers liquid, battle-tested exposure to high-performance public chains. It also complements higher-beta presale plays by anchoring a broader conviction in scalable blockchain rails. Recap : As Bolivia’s reserves decline and banks adopt digital assets, structural demand shifts toward the real utility of these assets. Bitcoin Hyper , SUBBD , and Solana all align with this trend. Bitcoin Hyper targets BTC-native execution, SUBBD rewires creator monetization, and Solana anchors institutional-grade throughput, together forming a diversified way to front-run the next phase of adoption.

This humanitarian initiative demonstrates how the crypto industry extends beyond digital transactions to make tangible differences in real-world crises. The collective effort highlights blockchain technology’s growing role in global philanthropy and community support. How Are Crypto Firms Pledging Support? The cryptocurrency community has mobilized rapidly following the tragic Hong Kong fire. Leading exchanges including Bitget, Binance, and KuCoin have committed significant resources to aid affected families. These crypto firms pledge immediate financial assistance while establishing transparent donation channels. The coordinated response showcases the industry’s capacity for swift humanitarian action during emergencies. Bitget leads the initiative with a $1.5 million commitment, followed closely by Binance’s $1.28 million contribution. KuCoin adds another $256,000 to the relief fund. Additionally, Animoca Brands has launched a dedicated fundraising campaign using both Ethereum and Solana blockchain networks. This multi-platform approach ensures donors can contribute using various cryptocurrency options. Why Does This Crypto Firms Pledge Matter? This coordinated response represents more than just financial aid – it signals a fundamental shift in how blockchain companies engage with social responsibility. When crypto firms pledge support during humanitarian crises, they demonstrate the technology’s potential beyond trading and speculation. The transparent nature of blockchain donations ensures contributors can track fund distribution, addressing common concerns about charity accountability. The initiative offers several key benefits: Immediate impact – Funds reach victims faster through blockchain efficiency Transparent tracking – Donors can verify fund distribution on public ledgers Industry collaboration – Multiple companies uniting for common cause Global participation – Anyone with cryptocurrency can contribute regardless of location What Challenges Do Crypto Donations Face? Despite the enthusiasm surrounding this crypto firms pledge initiative, several practical challenges remain. Regulatory compliance varies across jurisdictions, requiring careful navigation of financial regulations. Currency volatility could affect the actual value of donations between pledge and distribution dates. Additionally, not all victims may possess the technical knowledge or infrastructure to receive cryptocurrency directly. However, participating companies have addressed these concerns through strategic partnerships with local organizations. By working with established relief agencies in Hong Kong, these crypto firms ensure pledged funds convert to practical assistance efficiently. This collaborative model sets a precedent for future blockchain-based humanitarian efforts. How Can Other Crypto Firms Join This Pledge? The current crypto firms pledge campaign remains open for additional participants. Companies interested in contributing can connect through official channels established by initial organizers. Individual donors can participate through the published Ethereum and Solana wallet addresses. This inclusive approach allows the entire crypto community to support Hong Kong fire victims regardless of contribution size. For smaller contributors, every digital asset donation matters. The blockchain’s borderless nature enables global participation in local relief efforts. This demonstrates how cryptocurrency can bridge geographical divides during times of crisis, creating truly international support networks. What Does This Mean for Crypto’s Future? This substantial crypto firms pledge represents a pivotal moment for industry perception. As blockchain companies increasingly engage in social causes, they build credibility beyond financial applications.

At this point, while this November has been the worst since 2019, there is still hope for an upturn. Accordingly, analysts pointed to $93,000, predicting that a monthly close above $93,000 would reduce the risk of further declines, while a close above $102,000 would be a strong bullish signal. In its analysis conducted through the official X account, on-chain analytics company Glassnode pointed to the $93,000-$96,000 range for Bitcoin, stating that this range must be broken for it to start rising. “Bitcoin’s most important short-term resistance range currently sits at $93,000-$96,000. To gain momentum towards new ATHs, breaking the supply cluster in the $93,000-$96,000 range, formed by the largest buyers, is the key requirement.” Glassnode analysts recently noted that if Bitcoin breaks above $96,000, the next resistance range will be between $100,000 and $108,000, adding, “This range is the area where buyers who have recently entered the market have concentrated.” Aside from Glassnode analysts, pseudonymous analyst CrediBull Crypto also made similar predictions. Accordingly, the analyst stated that the two levels he is eyeing for a monthly close for Bitcoin are $93,401 and $102,437. The analyst stated that a close above $93,000 would be a positive sign for Bitcoin's rise and that there is a high probability of this occurring, while a monthly close above $102,000 would be incredibly bullish. *This is not investment advice.

According to the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of the Republic of Korea (SPO) report, Seoul Police Station Officer “G” reportedly accepted $7,500 (10 million won) in cash and expensive items during that time. The report revealed that Chief “F” allegedly accepted $59,000 (approximately 79 million won) between July 2022 and February 2024 from the proprietors of an illegal private cryptocurrency company. South Korean officers arrested in crypto bribery operation Suwon District Prosecutors’ Office Criminal Division report confirmed that the authorities dismissed both officers from their jobs following their arrest. Prosecutors stated that the two officers allegedly offered investigation information and introduced attorneys. The officers requested the unfreezing of accounts related to illegal activity and established connections with other law enforcement officials in exchange for the money. “Sharing details on wallets can push suspects toward mixers and privacy apps that obfuscate evidence and undermine AML efforts.” -Kadan Stadelmann, CTO at Komodo Platform. Stadelmann supported his comment by noting that communities must make sure their local police uphold the law. Prosecutors claimed that an unknown operator partnered with CEO “B” to plan a well-organized team to operate illegal cryptocurrency-for-cash swaps in busy locations between January and October 24. According to prosecutors, the operation included locations such as Yeoksam-dong, under the guise of gift certificate shops. The gang, according to South Korean authorities, maintained a respectable front by putting up banners warning customers to “Beware of Voice Phishing.” According to the report, the group turned illegal profits, primarily from voice phishing scams , into USDT. SK Law enforcement officials froze about $1.1 million (1.5 billion won) in illegal assets, including $600,000 (800 million won) in USDT. According to prosecutors, the group reportedly squandered or concealed the remaining $8.4 million (11.2 billion won) in illegal proceeds. Cryptocurrencies drive an increase in South Korean crimes The arrest of the two police officers follows a slew of cryptocurrency-related crimes in SK. On August 23, a 33-year-old South Korean national was arrested at Suvarnabhumi Airport on accusations of having ties to a contact center gang that laundered cryptocurrency into gold. The SK authorities estimate the enterprise to be worth more than 1.65 billion baht ($44.55 million) in total. On February 6, the Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of impersonation and money laundering. The court also charged him with entering fraudulent data into a computer system. Additionally, the court alleged that the suspect was a member of a criminal syndicate. Another cryptocurrency-related crime happened on November 13, 2024. SK authorities arrested 215 persons on suspicion of stealing 320 billion won ($228.4 million) in the nation’s largest cryptocurrency investment scam. SK Gyeonggi Nambu provincial police claimed that one of the suspects arrested was the alleged leader of a well-coordinated crime ring that marketed 28 different types of virtual tokens to over 15,000 people, promising large profits. According to SK authorities, the accused leader, referred to as Mr A, had fled to Australia before being arrested. Yonhap news outlet reported that police seized 22 Bitcoins from Mr A’s account and filed to seize an additional $34 million. Jin Sung‑joon, a legislator from the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, stated that there are rising concerns that cryptocurrencies are being utilized more often for illegal foreign exchange (FX) transactions and money laundering. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) received 36,684 reports of suspicious activity from virtual asset service providers between January and August. The number increased sharply from 199 in 2021 to over 10,000 in 2022 and almost 20,000 in 2024. Notably, 9.5 trillion ($7.1 billion) worth of crimes involving cryptocurrency were reported for prosecution over the same period.

I’m long, right? I’m still happy either way. It’s either $200k–$250k or not.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst At the time of recording, the host noted Bitcoin was “back above $90K.” Hayes said ETF flow charts that dominated crypto social media in the spring and summer badly misled retail. He pointed to the largest holders of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – Brevan Howard, Goldman Sachs, Millennium, Avenue, Jane Street – as evidence that the dominant players were not long-only allocators. “These entities are not places where they’re just going to go long Bitcoin,” he said. Instead, they were running a standard basis trade: buying IBIT, pledging it as collateral and shorting CME futures. “They were making, let’s call it 7 to 10% per annum on that trade. They fund Fed funds at four-ish percent and they lever it up.” When the futures basis collapsed following the October 10 liquidation cascade, that trade had to be unwound by selling the ETF and covering futures shorts, flipping net ETF flows from strong inflows to outflows. Retail investors misread that as “institutions turning bearish.” “Retail thinks, ‘Oh no, institutions loved Bitcoin in the summer and now they hate it in the fall, therefore I need to get rid of my exposure as well,’ not understanding what was driving those flows in the first place,” Hayes said. He paired this with a second temporary pillar: listed digital asset treasury (DAT) companies that issue stock or debt to buy Bitcoin. Once those vehicles traded at net asset value or a discount, new issuance became uneconomic and in some cases incentivized selling BTC to buy back shares, removing another marginal buyer. Macro Conditions Are The Key Catalyst Against that micro backdrop, Hayes situates a much larger macro shift. He tracks a proprietary US dollar liquidity index built from Fed balance sheet series and commercial bank data. In his telling, roughly a trillion dollars of liquidity was drained from dollar money markets from July onward due to Treasury General Account (TGA) refilling and Federal Reserve quantitative tightening. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Now Tied To A 2-Year Cycle, Warns Investment Firm CIO In 2023, then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen could offset that drain by issuing huge amounts of high-yielding T-bills that pulled about $2.5 trillion out of the Fed’s reverse repo facility back into the system. In 2025, he argues, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had no such reservoir to tap. Now, Hayes says, both the TGA rebuild and QT have effectively run their course. The TGA has been restored to its target zone, and the Fed has halted balance sheet runoff. “We have essentially bottomed on the liquidity chart and the direction in the future is higher,” he said, adding that markets are still waiting to see how the Trump administration actually delivers on promises of massive credit creation via industrial policy, bank lending and a more dovish Fed. He expects the next leg of liquidity to come more from commercial banks than the central bank, citing early signs of rising bank lending and public commitments from institutions like JPMorgan to finance large industrial programs. Hayes was equally direct on the October 10 wipeout, calling it a harsh lesson for underprepared leveraged traders rather than a coordinated hunt. “People think that I’m going to get off of work and trade leveraged crypto for a few hours and I’m going to somehow make money. No, you’re going to get liquidated,” he said. “If you are a proper trader, you should not get liquidated. Period.” On positioning, Hayes said he used the post-crash environment to buy what he considers fundamentally strong altcoins like Pendle, Ethena and EtherFi at levels last seen months earlier. He expects those to outperform ETH in the short term but still backs the long-term “institutional DeFi” narrative that could take Ethereum to “the $10,000 to $20,000 price by the end of the cycle.” For now, his core thesis is simple: the ETF basis trade is largely gone, the liquidity drain is over, leverage has been flushed – and the macro tide, in his view, is turning back in Bitcoin’s favour. At press time, BTC traded at $91,004.

55044148,635899,1764331241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55044148.jpeg,Challenges Loom For XRP: Expert Predicts Price Decline To $1 By 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-expert-predicts-price-decline-to-1-by-2026/,"XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the market, experienced a notable flash crash on October 10th, plummeting toward $1.25, with a subsequent decline last week bringing it down to $1.82. Fast-forward to the end of the month: The digital currency has reclaimed some ground and surpassed the $2 mark in the past 24 hours. However, obstacles remain that could hinder XRP’s rally, as analyst Sean Williams of The Motley Fool has noted. Major Catalysts Behind XRP’s Price Surge This Year In a recent report , Williams pointed out that while XRP has rallied by 34% over the past year, compared to Bitcoin’s (BTC) 14% retracement, the path ahead is fraught with challenges. However, when examining the token’s price performance, which surpassed that of the other top 10 cryptocurrencies year-to-date, Williams identified one of the most significant catalysts for XRP’s rise as occurring last year when President Donald Trump was re-elected. Additionally, the resolution of the litigation between Ripple— the company behind XRP— and the US government has played a crucial role in boosting the altcoin’s value. The approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US also contributed to its upward momentum, alongside the increasing utility of RippleNet, which is used by over 300 financial institutions globally, some relying on XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions. Looking ahead, Wall Street analysts, including Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered, have set an ambitious XRP price target of $12.50 by 2028, which would imply a major upside of over 500% for the altcoin in the next three years. However, Williams cautions that with a clearer understanding of the factors that have driven the cryptocurrency’s recent successes, several headwinds could derail its potential rally, possibly sending its price back to $1 by 2026. Key Challenges Ahead For The Altcoin A critical challenge for XRP in the coming year is the absence of new catalysts. Williams asserted that with significant cash flows into these ETFs now behind, the leading altcoin may find it difficult to maintain momentum in 2026. Another hurdle is the reality of the altcoin’s adoption rates, which may not be as impressive as some proponents claim. While over 300 institutions are using RippleNet , it pales in comparison to the more than 11,000 institutions utilizing the SWIFT system for cross-border payments. Given this landscape, the token faces an uphill battle in trying to replace SWIFT, particularly as RippleNet does not necessitate the use of XRP for transactions. Additionally, while the altcoin boasts an average settlement time of three to five seconds—a significant improvement over traditional methods, which can take up to a week—alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Stellar (XLM) also offer competitive transaction speeds. Lastly, the token’s price is also influenced by broader equity market trends. While cryptocurrencies and stocks are typically separate trading assets, they have recently moved in tandem with Wall Street. As illustrated by the S&P 500’s Shiller Price-to-Earnings Ratio peaking at 41.20 in late October, the stock market appears historically overpriced. Williams asserts that if the S&P 500 undergoes a correction or bear market, it is likely that cryptocurrencies, including XRP, will follow suit. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.19, recording a nearly 9% price recovery over the past week.

While the market remains fragile and dominated by macro uncertainty, the recent bounce from local lows and the shift in momentum suggest that the token might be gearing up for a short-term trend reversal. XRP Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRPUSDT is moving within a well-defined falling wedge, which began after its failed breakout of $3.20 level. The price has recently bounced from the lower boundary of this descending structure and the $1,80 support zone, reclaiming the $2.00 level, and is now aiming toward the red resistance band near the $2.50 mark. However, major confluence resistance sits slightly higher, as the asset should first break above the higher boundary of the pattern to reach the $2,.50 zone. Even after such a move, the price will have both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages acting as resistance near the $2.60 mark. These moving averages are also on the verge of printing a bearish cross, which is usually a strong signal for more downward pressure. Therefore, a daily close above that area would signal a serious structural break and shift bias back to bullish. The BTC Pair Meanwhile, the XRPBTC daily chart shows a more promising structure. The price has reclaimed both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages around the 2,400 SAT level, after bouncing from the key 2,000 SAT support area. It is currently retesting the 2,400 SAT zone and the moving averages, which are now acting as support. If buyers can hold above the moving averages, there will be room for the price to target the 2,750 SAT level, and even the 3,000 SAT high. The RSI is also above 57, showing strengthening momentum. Yet, the buyers will need to defend the current breakout zone to maintain the edge.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-xrp-huge-reversal-loading-heres-the-significance/,"A quiet consolidation can hide major shifts in market direction. When volatility compresses and price settles into narrow ranges, traders often sense an approaching inflection point. XRP is now in that zone, and several converging signals suggest a significant change may be underway. Momentum around this narrative increased after STEPH IS CRYPTO published a comparative chart highlighting a striking technical resemblance to an earlier accumulation phase. His chart shows XRP trading at $2.1372, with a projected breakout trajectory targeting $3.60–$3.70. This projection has reignited debate about whether the asset is preparing for another decisive upward move. Technical Structure and Reversal Signals Steph’s chart overlays a series of exponential moving averages forming a tight ribbon above the current price. That ribbon now acts as layered dynamic resistance. In previous cycles, XRP broke above a similar structure and triggered an impulsive rally. A repeat of that breakout pattern would require a strong daily close above the ribbon on meaningful volume. Such a move would signal a shift in trend strength and attract momentum traders who thrive on confirmed reversals. $XRP HUGE REVERSAL LOADING! pic.twitter.com/Ey2nq60wIp — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 27, 2025 Liquidity Compression and Institutional Influence Market structure supports this possibility. Recent demand from newly launched spot XRP ETFs has removed substantial supply from exchanges . Large institutional purchases, including multi-million-unit allocations, reduce the amount of XRP available for immediate trading. When supply tightens and demand accelerates, price movements often become sharper. This liquidity compression creates favorable conditions for a breakout toward the projected target. On-Chain Flows and Whale Behavior On-chain metrics reinforce the scenario. Whale activity has intensified near the $2 zone, matching the chart’s displayed price of $2.1372. Large transfers, clustered limit orders, and rising average trade sizes indicate accumulation rather than distribution. When whales absorb sell pressure at key levels, markets often transition from consolidation to expansion. This behavior strengthens the validity of the technical structure Steph highlighted. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Levels and Breakout Conditions The price level shown in the chart—$2.1372—serves as a pivotal support area within the current consolidation. A reclaim of the EMA ribbon remains the foremost trigger for a reversal. If price clears that structure and holds above it, attention will shift toward the projection pointing to $3.60–$3.70. That target reflects the measured move implied by the prior breakout pattern Steph used for comparison. Outlook and Strategic Considerations Steph’s analysis builds a coherent case for a potential trend reversal, but traders should approach with disciplined caution. Liquidity conditions, ETF flows, and on-chain signals strengthen the bullish thesis, yet every breakout setup carries risk. Watching daily closes, monitoring exchange reserves, and tracking whale activity will offer the clearest confirmation of direction. In conclusion, the alignment of technical structure, institutional behavior, and on-chain accumulation makes this an important moment for XRP. Steph’s chart outlines a credible path toward higher levels, including a projected move to $3.60–$3.70. The coming days will reveal whether the current calm is the precursor to the “huge reversal” now gaining widespread attention.

This represents a price increase of about 7.86%. The upward trend was marked by consistent buying pressure, with brief pullbacks before stabilizing near $0.151. Dogecoin is trading around $0.151, down by 0.6%, showing a steady pullback after failing to hold above the $0.153–$0.154 area. This shows a weakening momentum, with sellers keeping pressure as the price forms lower highs. DOGE price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Major DOGE Accumulation Emerges Near the $0.20 Realized Price Level According to recent data by Ali Martinez, the DOGE UTXO Realized Price Distribution chart reveals a dominant accumulation cluster around $0.074, where nearly 27.6 billion DOGE were last moved. This makes it the most critical realized price level in the current market structure. Such a large concentration typically forms a strong support zone, as many holders share the same cost basis and are less likely to sell below it. Additional accumulation also appears near $0.002, representing long-term holders and early adopters who acquired DOGE at extremely low prices and continue to provide underlying market stability. Source: X The chart also highlights meaningful resistance zones forming at higher realized price levels, particularly around $0.20 and $0.29, where more than 12 billion DOGE and a sizable secondary cluster were last transacted. These levels suggest that a large segment of investors entered the market during previous rallies, and they may look to reduce exposure once the price revisits these areas. As analyst Ali Martinez often notes, these realized price concentrations serve as key psychological zones, helping determine where DOGE may face selling pressure or gather new bullish momentum. DOGE Awaits Breakout as the Third Wave Reaches a Critical Turning Point The chart by analyst EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL illustrates Dogecoin’s long-term market structure through a series of expanding trend channels, highlighting three major historical waves. DOGE is currently navigating the third wave, but price action remains confined within a tight consolidation zone inside the upper portion of the channel. This indicates that the market has not yet confirmed a decisive breakout, keeping momentum muted and preventing a clear shift toward a fully established bullish continuation. The structure reflects a period of indecision, where the asset is still respecting the broader upward channel but lacks the strength to push into a new expansion phase. Source: X According to the chart’s cyclical behavior, each completed wave has historically been followed by a significant breakout that defined the next macro trend. The ongoing third-wave deadlock suggests that the market is building pressure, awaiting a catalyst to confirm direction. A breakout above the current consolidation band would signal renewed bullish strength and the potential start of the next surge, while failure to do so could extend the sideways phase or trigger a deeper retest of lower channel boundaries. In essence, the upcoming breakout will determine whether Dogecoin enters its next major growth cycle or remains stalled within its long-term structural pattern.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-28 12:06:37

According to multiple analysts, the cryptocurrency must reclaim the $95,000 mark to confirm a trend reversal and continue its upward trajectory. This Bitcoin price prediction has become the central talking point among market participants as BTC consolidates from recent gains. Why is $95K so important for Bitcoin’s price prediction? Market analysts point to significant on-chain data that makes the $94,000 to $95,000 range particularly crucial. Glassnode’s Cost Basis Heatmap reveals a massive supply wall of 500,000 BTC concentrated between $93,000 and $96,000. This represents a substantial amount of Bitcoin that could potentially be sold if prices reach these levels. Breaking through this resistance zone would signal strong bullish momentum. However, the current Bitcoin price prediction suggests this won’t happen easily. The market needs substantial buying pressure to absorb this potential selling pressure. What happens if Bitcoin breaks above $96,000? If Bitcoin successfully surpasses the $96,000 level, analysts project the next major resistance between $100,000 and $108,000. This Bitcoin price prediction indicates that clearing the current supply wall could open the path to six-figure valuations. Immediate resistance: $94,000-$95,000 Breakout target: $96,000+ Next major resistance: $100,000-$108,000 The current Bitcoin price prediction emphasizes that breaking above $96,000 would confirm the uptrend’s strength. This level represents the gateway to higher price targets that many investors have been anticipating. Where is the critical support for this Bitcoin price prediction? While everyone focuses on resistance levels, support zones are equally important. Swissblock analysts identify the $83,000 to $85,000 range as critical support. Maintaining this level is essential to prevent a more significant downturn. This Bitcoin price prediction highlights two key scenarios: Bullish scenario: Reclaim $95,000 and target $100,000+ Bearish scenario: Break below $83,000 and risk deeper correction The current consolidation provides an opportunity for the market to gather strength for the next move. Traders should watch both support and resistance levels closely. What does this Bitcoin price prediction mean for traders? This specific Bitcoin price prediction offers clear levels for market participants. The $95,000 reclaim would signal a shift back to bullish momentum, while holding $83,000 support maintains the possibility of upward movement. Successful trading according to this Bitcoin price prediction requires: Monitoring the $94,000-$95,000 resistance cluster Watching $83,000-$85,000 support zone Preparing for volatility around these key levels The market’s reaction at these levels will provide valuable information about future price direction. This Bitcoin price prediction gives traders specific parameters to guide their decisions. Final thoughts on this crucial Bitcoin price prediction The current Bitcoin price prediction centers around one simple but powerful concept: reclaim $95,000 or face potential consolidation. The analysis from multiple firms converges on this level as the make-or-break point for the short-term trend. While the path to $100,000 remains open, it requires clearing significant hurdles first. This Bitcoin price prediction provides a roadmap, but market participants should remember that cryptocurrency markets can change rapidly. The key is watching how Bitcoin behaves at these critical technical levels. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main resistance level for Bitcoin according to analysts? Analysts identify the $94,000 to $95,000 range as the primary resistance, with a supply wall of 500,000 BTC needing to be overcome. What happens if Bitcoin breaks above $96,000? Breaking above $96,000 could open the path to $100,000-$108,000 as the next major resistance zone according to current predictions. Where is the critical support level for Bitcoin? The $83,000 to $85,000 range serves as crucial support that must hold to prevent a more significant market downturn. How reliable are these Bitcoin price predictions? While based on on-chain data and technical analysis, all cryptocurrency predictions carry risk and should be considered alongside other market factors. What time frame are analysts using for these predictions? Most analysts are focusing on short to medium-term time frames, watching how Bitcoin behaves around these key levels in the coming weeks. Should I make trading decisions based solely on this prediction? No, always conduct your own research and consider multiple factors before making any trading decisions.

Notably, the token pushed above its 20-day exponential moving average ( EMA ) at $2.18 and is now testing the 50-day EMA at $2.26, marking its strongest technical setup in weeks. Moreover, Binance reserves now stand at 2.7 billion XRP, the lowest level since January 2025, which suggests rising long-term holder accumulation. To put the optimistic narrative to the test, Finbold’s AI prediction agent analyzed the crypto’s technicals more deeply and leveraged three leading large language models (LLMs) to predict the XRP price target by December 31. AI predicts XRP price for end of 2025 At first glance, the prediction agent’s forecast suggests the bullish atmosphere surrounding XRP appears justified. That is to say, the average XRP price target for the end of 2025, based on the joint efforts of ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Flash, sits at $2.43, which implies the token is up for a 9.61% rally over the next month compared to the current price of $2.22. AI XRP price prediction. Source: Finbold’s AI prediction agent However, the situation is slightly more complicated upon closer inspection. Namely, the three LLMs used in the projection provided drastically different numbers. Claude Sonnet 4, for instance, suggested that XRP could explode 28.38%, reaching a price of $2.85 by the end of the year. In comparison, ChatGPT suggested an upside of only 3.6% and a price target of $2.30. On the other hand, Gemini 2.5 was not bullish at all. Rather, Google’s AI assistant thinks that the cryptocurrency is more likely to see a momentum reversal and fall 3.15% to $2.15. Accordingly, the average 9.61% uptick was largely boosted by Claude Sonnet 4’s exceptionally confident take and reveals just how divided AI-driven outlooks remain despite a broadly upbeat market structure. In other words, while the blended forecast leans positive, the dispersion between the individual predictions points to some lingering uncertainty over whether XRP can sustain its recent breakout.

With nearly 41.5% of XRP holders in loss, confidence in near-term upside has waned, driving attention toward emerging opportunities. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining traction as the new crypto coin with enormous potential, attracting early investors with the promise of as much as 6,700% upside. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, MUTM has already secured participation from over 18,250 investors, raising over $19.02 million, and is building a robust DeFi ecosystem centered on decentralized lending and borrowing with interest-bearing tokens. For traders seeking the top crypto to invest in, Mutuum Finance offers a rare combination of early-stage adoption, functional utility, and explosive growth potential that is capturing market attention in the wake of XRP’s weakness. XRP Faces Bearish Pressure Amid Technical Breakdown Ripple (XRP) is currently under intense short-term pressure, trading in the $2.14–$2.18 support range after a steep decline from recent highs, exacerbated by a “Death Cross” formation on the daily chart. Technical analysis indicates that XRP has broken below its critical $2.20–$2.30 support zone, signaling that bears are firmly in control. While long-term catalysts, such as institutional interest highlighted by the launch of the Bitwise XRP ETF, provide some optimism, the immediate focus remains on defending the $2.00 psychological level. Failure to hold this support could push prices toward $1.90 or even $1.25, increasing short-term risk for traders. This heightened uncertainty has naturally shifted investor attention towards Mutuum Finance, the new crypto coin offering real utility and early-stage adoption. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges Ahead of Phase 7 Mutuum Finance is rapidly expanding in the DeFi market, with Phase 6 of its presale nearing full capacity. MUTM tokens are currently priced at $0.035, offering investors a final opportunity to participate before Phase 7 raises the price 20% to $0.04. Following the successful completion of Phase 5, Mutuum Finance has solidified its reputation as one of the most anticipated top crypto to invest in projects of 2025. The presale has raised over $19.02 million from more than 18,250 participants worldwide, demonstrating strong international confidence in the project. With its commitment to transparency, innovation, and sustainable growth, MUTM has emerged as the top crypto to invest in, offering a combination of stability and high growth potential. As global markets approach a new bull cycle, MUTM continues to attract early-stage DeFi investors seeking meaningful exposure. Utility-Driven Tokenomics: Embedding Demand into Every Interaction A core strength of Mutuum Finance lies in its utility-focused tokenomics, which prioritize real platform use over speculative trading. MUTM’s design embeds demand into every protocol interaction, ensuring the token’s value grows organically alongside platform activity. The platform features a dual lending architecture: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled markets handle mainstream assets like ETH and stablecoins, while Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated agreements accommodate riskier or less liquid tokens. This hybrid system enables efficient scalability while containing risk, preventing volatility in niche markets from destabilizing the broader protocol. All loans on Mutuum Finance are overcollateralized and governed by strict Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, with both variable and stable borrowing rates available. For example, a user depositing $1,000 worth of ETH at a 75% LTV could borrow up to $750 in stablecoins, with automated liquidation triggers protecting the system from undercollateralization. On the supply side, liquidity providers earn APY from interest payments, creating clear incentives for ongoing participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a new crypto coin for early investors. Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, has already raised over $19.02 million from more than 18,250 participants, with over 95% of tokens sold. Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.04, offering early adopters significant upside. With a dual lending architecture, overcollateralized loans, interest-bearing tokens, and a utility-driven ecosystem, MUTM combines real DeFi functionality with high growth potential. Investors seeking the next top crypto to invest in should secure tokens before the presale concludes.

Meanwhile, in the US, jobs data and the Federal Reserve signals have strengthened the case for a December rate cut. The crypto market is still cautious, however. In the European Union, the regulators have introduced a set of crypto data-sharing rules that establish strict requirements for how crypto firms collect, store, and report user information to tax authorities. EU’s new crypto data-sharing rules will force exchanges and service providers to share user data and transaction records. #EU #CryptoPrivacy https://t.co/YoIDXmgNvm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 27, 2025 Balancing On a Knife’s Edge Greg Waisman, Chief Operating Officer at payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo , commented that BTC managed to rebounded above the $90,000 mark amid rising expectations of a December Federal Reserve rate cut. “Although volatility has remained elevated in recent weeks, the market is also showing further signs of maturity,” he said. “Retail traders appear less fazed by market noise, and we continue to see stable, consistent buying patterns on the Mercuryo platform.” Sean Dawson, head of research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , wrote in an email that “markets are balancing on a knife’s edge, but sentiment has stabilised meaningfully as expectations of a rate cut continue to recover.” While initially collapsing to 39% a week ago, the probability of a 25 basis point cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting surged back to nearly 87%. “In response, BTC has staged a strong rebound.” BTC skews up, vols down and odds of a rate cut up to 87% from last week's low of 39%. Bearish sentiment still pervades, but there are rays of light shining through the clouds pic.twitter.com/tvCq1FRAuL — Sean | Derive (@SeanNotShorn) November 27, 2025 “This shift in macro expectations has eased some of the intense bearish pressure that dominated the options market through late October and November,” Dawson said. “Traders are still paying a premium for downside protection, but noticeably less than last week, reflecting reduced fear and a partial unwind of defensive hedging as rate-cut odds firm.“ Additionally, Fabian Dori, CIO at digital asset bank Sygnum , argued that the cycle isn’t over yet, and that the crash in Q4 is “excessive, not structural.” “The shift in narrative was triggered less by fundamentals and more by a sudden re-pricing of risks at a time when investors were already debating whether the Four-Year Cycle had peaked,” he said. “These signals reflect sentiment capitulation rather than long-term deterioration in fundamentals. From a cycle perspective, we see a maturing phase rather than an ending one,” Dori concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Friday morning, BTC stood at $91,150. It was quite a chopping trading day. The price would plunge and would subsequently try to recover, before falling and rising again – resulting in a largely unchanged level over 24 hours. Overall, it traded in a tight range between the intraday low of $90,485 and the intraday high of $91,826. The coin has turned green in the 7-day timeframe, having increased by 6.6%. It traded between $82,175 and $91,804. BTC broke the $88,000 resistance and establishing support above $90,000. It’s now facing resistance at the $92,000-$94,000 level. Should it break it, it could move towards the $98,000-$101,972 range. But a drop below $89,000 could lead to $86,500, after which the doors would open further decreases. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,018. Early in the day, the price dropped from $3,039 to the day’s low of $2,986, before recovering to the day’s high of $3,042. It has corrected since. Over the past week, ETH appreciated 11.6%, trading between $2,680 and $3,042 in this timeframe. Investors are now looking to see if the coin will defend the price above $3,000, which would lead to further increases towards the $3,100-3,230 range. At the same time, a decrease below $2,990 may lead to additional pullbacks to $2,900 and $2,850, and possibly below the $2,800 mark. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has moved upwards over the past day, for the second day in a row, finally exiting the extreme fear zone. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 20 today , compared to 18 yesterday, residing in the fear zone. This suggests a slightly higher optimism amongst market participants, but also the perseverance of significant amount of caution. ETFs On Hiatus The US markets were closed on Thursday for the country’s Thanksgiving holiday. On the previous day of trading both US BTC and ETH spot ETFs recorded positive flows. The former saw $21.12 million, and the latter saw $60.82 million in inflows. On the other hand, SOL spot ETFs recorded outflows of $8.1 million on the same day. This marked the first negative session since the launch a month ago. Therefore, it broke a 21-day green streak. Meanwhile, USA’s California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) faced heavy losses following sell-off in Strategy . The stocks slid from more than $144m to about $80m in a matter of months, decreasing about 45% so far this quarter, largely tracking Bitcoin’s swings. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market has posted an increase over the past 24 hours. And while the crypto market never sleeps, the US stock market was closed on Thursday for the country’s Thanksgiving holiday and will have a shortened session on Friday. Is this drop sustainable? The drop is overall quite minor, and the market remains indecisive for now. Further signals will push it to either side, so investors are keeping an eye on the incoming macroeconomic and geopolitical data.

While the price action looks more constructive in the short term, key resistance levels and the broader market mood are keeping traders cautious. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH has bounced cleanly from the $2,600–$2,500 demand zone and is currently trading just above $3K, right at the edge of the previous support-turned-resistance zone. This bounce is pushing the price toward the 200-day moving average, located around the $3,500 mark, which is a key psychological threshold. The daily RSI has also recovered from oversold territory and is now printing 42.91, suggesting some bullish momentum returning to the market, but still not enough to confirm a full reversal. Structurally, the daily chart still shows lower highs and lower lows. So, buyers need to push above the $3,500 range for a real shift in structure. If the current bounce loses steam below this resistance, sellers could step back in aggressively. The support to watch remains the $2,500 demand zone, with the $2,100 macro level acting as a last line of defense. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4H chart, ETH has been trading within a clean rising channel since bouncing from around $2,600, and just tapped into the $3,000 area, which aligns with the mid-term resistance zone. The structure currently resembles a bearish flag, which is often a continuation pattern, but if buyers can break and hold above the $3,200 mark, it could invalidate the bearish setup and lead to a stronger push higher toward the $3,500 region. The asset is now consolidating within the resistance block, and the RSI is at 64.42, nearing overbought levels, which suggests a potential short-term pullback or slowdown. On the other hand, if the flag breaks to the downside, the first level to watch is the $2,800 short-term low. Any failure to hold that zone could trigger another leg down toward the $2,500 demand zone. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve From an on-chain perspective, Ethereum’s exchange reserves have continued to decline at an astonishing rate, hitting a multi-year low of around 16.8M ETH. This consistent outflow from trading platforms is a strong long-term bullish signal, indicating that investors are increasingly moving their coins into cold storage or staking rather than preparing to sell. Historically, such supply contractions on centralized exchanges have preceded major rallies, although the timing can be uncertain. This supply dynamic adds a bullish undertone to Ethereum’s broader outlook, especially if macro risk factors start to ease.

The stagnation of liquidity supply is the primary reason for the bear market. For short-term trading, cash is one of the best risk-mitigation tools; for long-term trading, cash is essential for buying assets at their lowest point. During bear markets, the demand for options steadily increases due to rising hedging and risk protection needs, as well as increased market sensitivity. Cycle Transition: A More Sensitive Market Despite reluctance to admit it, mounting data and signals suggest a bear market may have arrived. However, like every previous bear market, the causes and characteristics of this one differ from the past. The stagnation of liquidity supply is the primary reason for the bear market: In offshore markets, the Eurozone has repeatedly emphasised the necessity of ""pausing interest rate cuts,"" while the Bank of Japan is treading on thin ice, facing high government bond yields and a continuously depreciating yen due to fiscal difficulties. Source: Investing.com The Federal Reserve is one of the largest providers of offshore liquidity. Still, it is facing reflationary pressures and the risk of further intervention by Trump, which could potentially influence Fed policy. Meanwhile, the scale of ""high-quality liquidity"" represented by T-bonds and T-notes has not expanded significantly. As a result, almost all offshore assets have been under pressure since November. Even gold and Bitcoin have entered a consolidation phase after a correction. With a stagnant liquidity supply, investors are reverting to a similar rhythm to 2023, reallocating their limited liquidity. In the asset chain, gold and precious metals have a relatively higher priority, meaning they have a natural advantage in liquidity redistribution. In contrast, BTC has relatively limited liquidity, which limits its price increases and often results in higher leverage rather than more cash flow accompanying price rises. Data from stablecoins supports this claim. Since the end of October, the total supply of stablecoins has remained almost stagnant, indicating that marginal liquidity supply within the crypto market has disappeared. Considering that most assets other than BTC are strongly pegged to the US dollar and stablecoins, and BTC's price performance is usually denominated in US dollars or USDT/USDC, a stagnation in stablecoin supply often signifies a stagnation in asset price increases. Historical data shows that each prolonged stagnation in stablecoin supply is a significant signal of market cycle transitions (e.g., February-April 2022). The derivatives market, particularly the options market, showed stronger foresight. After the 180-day ATM skew for BTC turned bearish in August, traders' long-term bearish sentiment towards BTC remained essentially unchanged and ultimately materialised. A similar situation can be observed with ETH (although in a slightly better light). It's worth noting that, despite the recent market rebound following consecutive declines, the weakening of long-term bullish sentiment and the strengthening of long-term bearish sentiment in both BTC and ETH remain unchanged; this is a typical characteristic of the term structure of derivatives in a bear market cycle. Source: Amberdata Derivatives Source: Amberdata Derivatives Decreased liquidity. Market depth typically decreases by more than 30%, and sometimes by as much as 50%, compared to bull markets. According to CoinDesk Research , BTC's 5% depth has already fallen by more than 30%, while the depth of altcoins is only about half of what it was a few months ago. Source: CoinDesk Research Source: CoinDesk Research Increased potential price volatility. Due to the lack of liquidity, asset prices are more susceptible to significant price fluctuations in response to events and other factors, and the impact of many random factors (such as large orders and block trade executions) on prices becomes significant again. Market makers' hedging behaviour regains dominance in price influence. In bear markets, the demand for tail risk management and portfolio hedging increases significantly, while speculative sentiment weakens substantially, resulting in a substantial relative increase in options open interest. Currently, the ratio of BTC options open interest to Delta 1 open interest has once again exceeded 1, the first time since December 2023, while ETH's options/Delta 1 open interest ratio also increased in November. Since option market makers typically tend to remain delta neutral, large-scale hedging activity could once again dominate price movements in this scenario. Source: Coinglass In short, the crypto market is becoming ""sensitive"" again. In fact, from a volatility perspective, implied volatility pricing in the crypto market has been rising again for some time. Although overall volatility levels remain lower than in 2024, the vol of vol (a metric for the sensitivity of the underlying asset) has been gradually increasing since the end of August. Source: Amberdata Derivatives How to Trade: Neutral in the Short Term, Accumulating in the Long Term In the current situation, the first step is to reduce the leverage level of your portfolio. Higher sensitivity means more volatile prices, and any leverage could potentially hurt the portfolio's performance. Furthermore, be wary of ADL (Auto Deleverage) mechanisms; in times of extreme volatility, even 1x leverage can be detrimental due to ""market-level liquidation."" Spot trading and options are among the best options available at present. Options are not subject to ADL, and option buyers have built-in hard stop-loss orders, which limit losses in illiquid situations. On the other hand, increase your cash holdings. For short-term trading, cash is one of the best risk-mitigation tools; for long-term trading, cash is essential for buying assets at their lowest point. However, holding cash also carries the risk of inflation; therefore, consider ""indirect cash holdings,"" such as TIPS, 2-year T-notes, money market funds, or fixed deposits. Alternatively, consider an ""interest-bearing bottom-fishing"" strategy: hold cash, sell put options for longer-term contracts, accumulate assets at relatively low prices, and earn interest when prices stabilise. Options-based trading strategies may see opportunities at this time. During bear markets, the demand for options steadily increases due to rising hedging and risk protection needs, as well as increased market sensitivity. The probability of ""explosive demand"" at certain moments also increases significantly. Therefore, the ""variance risk premium (the VRP)"" rises with market cycle changes, creating opportunities for volatility strategies (whether for long-term asset management or return objectives). In contrast, carry strategies typically underperform in bear markets (both futures-spot arbitrage and funding rate arbitrage), and CTA strategies also struggle to perform well.

Under the updated framework, cryptocurrency exchanges and virtual asset service providers must verify the identities of anyone sending or receiving transfers of less than 1 million won (approximately $680). Financial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Lee Eun-woon announced the development at the “Anti-Money Laundering Day” event. Under the new directive from the FSC, the so-called “travel rule” (or “crypto real-name system”) will cover all cryptocurrency transactions — including low-value transfers that previously escaped mandatory identity verification. The regulators claim that for years, cryptocurrency users have been exploiting a significant loophole that allows them to make smaller blockchain transactions. The users were well-positioned to split up larger transfers in a way that does not trigger the system’s requirement for users to verify their identities. South Korea is now moving to close that gap with new rules that prevent exchanges from treating transfers of less than 1 million won as anonymous. All transactions, regardless of size, must be traceable, and exchanges will be required to collect and share detailed information about the sender and recipient. The aim is to curb “smurfing,” a tactic that enables illicit funds to slip through the system with minimal oversight. South Korea goes after crime syndicates and rogue platforms According to the FSC, the expanded rules are aimed at combating illicit activity using cryptocurrencies, including money laundering, tax evasion, drug trafficking, and overseas payment schemes The South Korean government will prohibit internet users, domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, and foreign Bitcoin exchanges, to which Korean citizens often turn for anonymity or higher trade leverage, from trading their digital currencies in high-risk overseas markets that could pose as potential money laundering havens. Most have been outside the orbit of national regulatory systems, and many have provided a means for laundering, or passing dirty money around the world without it being traceable to its origin. By blocking its citizens from accessing such sites, the country hopes to prevent South Koreans from trading in unregulated overseas markets, where they are believed to sell their Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency units through so-called “back doors” for won. The government is cracking down on companies operating within its borders, which analysts say will have a positive outcome. New players seeking to register as a virtual asset service provider — effectively, legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges — will be subject to stricter financial health checks, focusing on liquidity, capital adequacy, and the safe handling of client funds. Regulators say that only genuinely fit and proper firms should be entrusted with managing customer assets. South Korea ramps up all-out defense against crypto crime While the announcement marks a strong regulatory intent, the full framework is not yet in force. According to the FSC, they intend to finalize the revised regulations in the first half of 2026, with legislative changes to be brought before the National Assembly. The country is also strengthening its ties with international partners, including the Financial Action Task Force, in an effort to bolster its defences against global money laundering threats . The cordon and search operation comes weeks after the National Tax Service said it would enforce a policy of raiding homes to confiscate cold wallets and hard drives owned by those believed to be holding digital assets offline in an attempt to evade taxes. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:021eab16-33d8-41ee-8e2d-586fb98986fa-9"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-8"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Tax authorities now have advanced analytical tools capable of decoding blockchain activity, and they appear to be actively tracking—and cracking down on—wealth holders who attempt to hide their assets.

The treasury move comes as Ethereum charts flash bullish continuation signals and traders compare its multi-year range to gold’s breakout. Bitmine Buys 14,618 ETH Worth $44.34M From BitGo via BitGo Custody Bitmine has purchased 14,618 ETH worth $44.34 million from BitGo’s hot wallet, Arkham Intelligence on Arkm Explorer confirms. The transfer occurred about three hours ago, according to Arkham’s Ethereum transaction log. Bitmine ETH Transfer. Source: Arkham Intelligence / X The purchase originated from a wallet labeled “BitGo: Hot Wallet” and moved to a Bitmine address marked under the BitGo custody cluster. The transfer’s value corresponds with $44.34 million in U.S. dollar terms, based on ETH pricing at the time of the transaction. First, the movement adds to a series of earlier ETH transfers between BitGo-linked hot wallets and Bitmine clusters, including transactions dated four to six days ago. Next, this marks the largest recent ETH outbound flow to the Bitmine entity shown in the transaction list. Finally, the size of the purchase places Bitmine among corporate treasury buyers increasing exposure to Ethereum in a single on-chain transaction. Ethereum Forms Double Zigzag Pattern With Targets at 3,180 and 3,300 Ethereum’s lower-time-frame chart shows price trading inside a rising parallel channel while a possible double zigzag structure unfolds, according to analyst Hamza from ElliottWavesHub. On the 1-hour ETH/USD chart, wave B appears to be forming a contracting triangle near 3,020 dollars, keeping price action compressed between the channel boundaries. Ethereum Double Zigzag Channel. Source: TradingView/ElliottWavesHub The chart marks two upside objectives if the pattern completes: equality with wave A near 3,180 dollars and equality with the earlier wave W around 3,300 dollars. These levels line up with the upper half of the channel, so they act as key reference zones if Ethereum continues to respect the current structure. At the same time, Hamza places invalidation at about 2,887 dollars, slightly below the 0.236 retracement shown on the chart. A move under that level would break the pattern’s internal wave count and signal that the current double zigzag scenario is no longer in play, even as the broader channel still frames the medium-term trend. Trader Says Ethereum Mirrors Gold’s Four Year Breakout Range Now, trader Tracer argues that Ethereum is tracking a similar four year consolidation pattern to gold’s recent breakout. In a two week chart comparison, he shows gold breaking above a multi year horizontal range and then using the former ceiling as support before trending higher. GOLD ETH Four Year Consolidation Comparison. Source: DeFiTracer The lower panel plots ETH/USDT in a matching sideways band, with current price pulling back toward the same range high that capped rallies in prior years. On the chart, that level acts as potential support, marked with a green circle and the label “we are here,” while a red circle highlights the earlier rejection near the same zone. The trader summarizes the setup as “same range, same breakout, same support,” and claims a “massive pump is coming” if Ethereum repeats gold’s move.

Miner stress and hashrate pullbacks often precede cleaner supply dynamics, setting the stage for capital rotations into higher‑beta narratives like AI and creator tokens. AI‑powered creator platforms are targeting opaque fees, arbitrary bans, and fragmented tooling as Web2 subscription and fan platforms continue to extract oversized revenue shares. SUBBD combines Web3 payments with AI assistants, voice cloning, and token‑gated content to help creators keep more earnings and automate fan engagement. When Bitcoin bleeds this hard, the market’s real opportunities finally show up. A 35% Bitcoin drawdown , from $124K to around $81K, has cleared out a large amount of late-cycle leverage. Yet the rebound toward $90K, with network hashrate still ~15% below its all-time high, sits right in the zone that has historically produced cyclical bottoms. These periods tend to reset excesses without breaking long-term structure. The Hash Ribbon indicator , which measures miner stress across short- and long-term hashrate trends, is now flashing a recovery signal linked to the end of miner capitulation phases. Hashprice remains at five-year lows , pushing miners to shut down older rigs, sell reserves, or merge operations. This is textbook late-stage bottoming behavior. Anyone who’s lived through multiple Bitcoin cycles recognizes this environment: sentiment wobbles, macro headlines turn gloomy, yet the chain itself gets stronger as weak hands exit. It’s also the window when early rotation into emerging narratives, AI, RWAs, and the creator economy historically outperforms. Once Bitcoin stabilizes, these plays often lead the next leg. That’s where SUBBD comes into focus. While Bitcoin rebuilds its base, $SUBBD is aiming to fix a core problem in the $85B creator economy: platforms taking up to 70% of revenue, opaque moderation rules, and fragmented AI tooling. For traders seeking asymmetric upside before risk-on fully returns, SUBBD’s AI-powered, Web3-native creator stack is gaining attention, with independent analysts already circulating early SUBBD price projections. Why Bitcoin Capitulation Is Fueling Rotations Into New Narratives Miner capitulation historically lines up with peak fear, but also with some of Bitcoin’s strongest forward returns. As inefficient rigs shut down and miners sell reserves to survive, that final burst of sell pressure often clears the last major correction of the cycle. Once that reset hits, capital naturally starts hunting for higher-beta plays. This cycle, AI and the creator economy are two of the standout narratives pulling early rotation. AI-assisted creator platforms, decentralized media rails, and token-gated fan ecosystems are all pushing to capture a chunk of a market where platforms like OnlyFans or subscription sites can take 20–70% of creator income. It’s a gap big enough for new Web3 rails to matter. Across Solana, Polygon, and Ethereum, teams are experimenting with NFTs, micro-tipping, decentralized storage, and AI-as-a-service models for creators. SUBBD is among the Ethereum-based entrants, positioning itself as a full-stack AI and payments layer for creators rather than another one-off NFT experiment. How SUBBD Aims To Tokenize and Automate the Creator Economy Where many creator tokens simply bolt crypto onto Web2 business models, SUBBD is built around a clearer premise: merge Web3 settlement with integrated AI so creators keep more and automate more. Instead of 30–70% platform cuts, SUBBD targets transparent, smart-contract-driven revenue splits and crypto-native payouts. At the center of $SUBBD is an AI Personal Assistant that can handle chats, DMs, support, and personalized responses trained on creator-approved data. Additionally, SUBBD incorporates AI voice cloning, AI influencer tools, and object-recognition features, enabling creators to launch new formats without needing to juggle multiple SaaS tools. The token underpins access and incentives across the platform. Users can unlock token-gated content, enter VIP staking tiers, and vote on features.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its highly successful presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has shifted back into bearish territory, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens trading in negative territory. Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00023032 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price rise of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00022944 to $0.00023032. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. The regular price rises during the pre-launch phase aim to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. Husky Inu’s fundraising efforts crossed $900,000 in October. The project has raised $905,406 so far, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2 million.

The listing creates new attention around a meme coin that already enjoys a huge community. ELON holds more than 300,000 followers on X and thousands more on Telegram, so the timing looks perfect for a renewed wave of speculation. Source: X The project’s identity leans heavily on humor, memes, and pop culture. It mixes Dogecoin and Elon Musk references and throws in a Mars theme that hints at explosive upside. That combination draws traders who chase viral coins, but it also sparks questions. Can ELON turn this interest into long-term value ? Understanding Dogelon Mars and Its Origins The founding team remains anonymous, which mirrors the structure of many meme projects. Investors often treat anonymity with caution, yet ELON survived long enough to build trust. The token launched long before the recent meme boom, so many traders consider it one of the more stable meme assets. Its comic-driven universe gives the project a unique look. The Dogelon character travels across galaxies, fights enemies, and reclaims Mars in the year 2420. The story operates as a symbolic roadmap that hints at progress and expansion. The comics give the community something fun to share, which strengthens engagement. Still, ELON operates as a simple meme token without utility. Traders buy it, hold it, and speculate on future market cycles. That simplicity often works in the meme space, so long as the broader market shows strong appetite for risk. Token Supply Structure and Blockchain Security Dogelon Mars carries a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of the supply went to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The team sent the tokens as a burn gesture, similar to Shiba Inu’s early strategy. Vitalik donated his share to charity, which removed many tokens from circulation. The rest of the supply sits in a locked liquidity pool. The network runs on Ethereum and Polygon. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake design secures the chain through validators who stake ETH while Polygon scales the activity with lower fees and smoother throughput. That combination keeps ELON transactions quick and flexible across both chains. Market Behavior and Community Influence Meme coins thrive on narrative cycles. Traders want tokens with strong stories, bold imagery, and viral potential. ELON checks all those boxes. With the new Biconomy listing, more traders now have simple access to the token. Will this push create a short-term rally? The market already shows early signs of interest. ELON trades at $0.00000005761, up 5.41% this week despite a 24.65% monthly drop. That mix signals a possible trend shift. Short-term momentum often starts with small recoveries, so traders watch the chart with fresh curiosity. Technical Outlook: Key Levels in Focus The chart shows a structured range with support and resistance levels close together. A tight structure often creates strong breakout opportunities. But traders must track every zone carefully. Source: X Support levels: $0.00000005071 $0.00000005000 $0.00000004251 Resistance levels: $0.00000006000 $0.00000007090 $0.00000008590 A break above $0.00000006000 can open the way toward $0.00000007090. Traders want volume confirmation at each step. A failure near resistance often sends price back to $0.00000005000, so the reaction near that level matters a lot. Will ELON hold this region and build upward pressure? The chart hints at interest, yet only stronger market conviction can support a full recovery. Dogelon Mars Price Prediction 2025 The prediction model evaluates community strength, meme-coin cycles, liquidity conditions, and market momentum. Month (2025) Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 (full-year) $0.00000005000 $0.00000007000 $0.00000009500 November 2025 $0.00000005500 $0.00000007200 $0.00000009000 December 2025 $0.00000005800 $0.00000007500 $0.00000010000 If volume continues to increase after the Biconomy listing, ELON can reach the upper range.

Here's The Real Risk,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4848514-strategy-margin-call-heres-the-real-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary MicroStrategy faces mounting pressure as Bitcoin's sharp decline undermines its leveraged Bitcoin accumulation strategy. MicroStrategy's NAV premium has fallen below 1, signaling waning investor confidence and a shift away from rewarding leveraged Bitcoin exposure. While bankruptcy risk remains low, concerns over dilution, index exclusion, and liquidity are rising as structural headwinds intensify. Given these challenges and the market's loss of confidence, I downgrade MicroStrategy to a sell rating despite a still-intact long-term Bitcoin thesis. Thesis Summary For months, I argued that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) still had enough macro tailwinds to mount one final push higher. The setup looked good, with a clean bounce from the 200-day EMA, deeply bearish sentiment, supportive liquidity signals, and a steady institutional bid. I still believe the long-term case remains intact. But in the short term, I was wrong . Bitcoin broke through my outlined support level at $97K and quickly plummeted towards the $80K region. As a result, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) fell even harder, down more than 50% from its all-time high. The buying opportunity I highlighted clearly didn't pan out. The real question now is not just what happens to Bitcoin, but whether MicroStrategy’s ( MSTR ) leveraged Bitcoin strategy still works in this environment. Bitcoin Broke the Script Bitcoin’s structure has shifted. What initially looked like a controlled, sentiment-driven flush quickly turned into a genuine trend break. The key support of the 50-week EMA broke at $97K, and we quickly slid down even further. BTC TA (Trendspider) But fundamentally, very little has changed about the long-term macro backdrop. • The Treasury’s funding needs remain high. • Fed has openly discussed the end of QT. • Inflation prints have softened and give the Fed room to cut. • Fiscal policy remains pro-growth and pro-deficit, regardless of the administration. Bitcoin will eventually recover, in my opinion. The problem for MicroStrategy is that if Bitcoin does not recover fast, its current “strategy” begins to look strained. With the NAV now trading below 1, the market is sending a clear warning sign. For years, the bull case for MicroStrategy was simple. Use cheap, favorable financing to accumulate Bitcoin. This model works very well when Bitcoin is rising but becomes far less compelling during periods of weakness or stagnation. MicroStrategy’s Leverage Is Not the Problem Yet MicroStrategy is not on the brink of liquidation. Most of the company’s debt is long-dated, low-coupon, and unsecured. Saylor is not facing margin calls, and there are no imminent forced-sell triggers. Bitcoin held on the balance sheet is not pledged as collateral for most of these obligations. The common idea, especially on social media, that one more severe drop will force MicroStrategy into liquidation is simply inaccurate. However, the market is forward-looking. Even without any mechanical liquidation risk today, the market will start to price in a rising probability of: • future dilution • refinancing at higher rates • reduced ability to raise new debt for additional Bitcoin purchases • slower NAV premium expansion during any recovery This is exactly what we are seeing right now. The NAV Premium Is Telling Us Something MSTR's NAV premium has fallen to historically low levels and has even dipped below 1. This tells us two things. First, investors are no longer rewarding Saylor’s leverage; they are discounting it. Second, this is the largest behavioral shift since MicroStrategy began its Bitcoin strategy in 2020. An NAV below 1 means the market is valuing the company at a discount to its Bitcoin holdings. Investors are no longer willing to pay extra for access to this type of leveraged Bitcoin exposure. Why? There are a few logical reasons for this. Firstly, it signals that investors doubt MSTR’s ability to manage the Bitcoin volatility as it has in the past. Secondly, with increased crypto adoption, MSTR is no longer needed as a corporate Bitcoin proxy. And lastly, the market fears potential dilution if MicroStrategy attempts to raise capital at depressed prices. None of these issues indicates immediate insolvency. They do, however, make the equity far more vulnerable to further declines in Bitcoin. Likelihood of Bankruptcy Or Forced Liquidation While the falling NAV is a warning sign, the risk of imminent bankruptcy or forced Bitcoin liquidation remains quite low in my opinion, given the current conditions. MicroStrategy’s asset base, which is dominated by its Bitcoin holdings, still exceeds its liabilities by a large margin. Analysts estimate that Bitcoin would need to fall roughly 80% from its average purchase price before assets drop below liabilities. The bigger challenge is liquidity. Saylor has been quite clear that he does not intend to sell any Bitcoin. MSTR will therefore have to rely on capital raises to service interest payments and preferred stock dividends. The company has recently raised additional capital, which reduces short-term pressure. There are also no major debt maturities in the near term. The first convertible bond ""put date"", when bondholders can demand repurchase, does not occur for several years. The debt structure was specifically designed to withstand deep drawdowns. The company can survive severe declines in Bitcoin. The question is how long it can function effectively if the NAV remains depressed and dilution becomes the only available tool. The Real Threat The more immediate and mechanical risk is not Bitcoin liquidation; it is the risk of MicroStrategy being removed from major indices such as the MSCI or the Nasdaq 100 if its crypto ratio becomes too high relative to its core business. If this happens, passive funds tracking these indices would be required to sell potentially billions of dollars’ worth of MSTR shares. This would put significant downward pressure on the stock and amplify volatility. Index exclusion would not break the company, but it would break the stock for a period of time. It would also make future capital raises far more difficult. In other words, MicroStrategy is not in danger of blowing up today. But structural pressures around index membership, liquidity, and dilution are building. Final Thoughts I was wrong about the timing of Bitcoin’s next leg higher. The long-term drivers remain intact, but the short-term damage has been real and sharper than expected. Bitcoin will recover. The question is whether it recovers fast enough to keep MicroStrategy’s strategy functioning smoothly. With the NAV now below 1, the market is clearly losing confidence, not in Bitcoin itself, but in leveraged corporate Bitcoin accumulation. If Bitcoin can recover from today's price, MSTR could do quite well, especially given the current short interest. For now, though, I remain cautious and am forced to downgrade MSTR to a sell.",MSTR|MSTR:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-28 13:42:37

The database is part of a comprehensive mechanism for the seizure of illicit digital funds introduced ahead of the country’s next assessment by the FATF. Belarus keeps track of coin wallets used by criminals Belarusian authorities have created and are updating a special register for digital currency wallets used to generate criminal income, according to the head of the country’s main auditing body. Vasily Gerasimov, Chairman of the State Control Committee (SCC), made the announcement during a plenary session of the Eurasian Group (EAG) on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism. Speaking at the meeting in Minsk on Thursday, Gerasimov noted that Belarus is preparing for an upcoming assessment by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global equivalent of the regional EAG. He further revealed that Belarusian regulators are introducing new mechanisms for financial investigation and the swift detection of criminal financial flows. Regulations governing the taxation of transactions involving cryptocurrencies, alongside other measures ensuring transparency in the digital asset space, have already been adopted, Gerasimov pointed out. The capital city is hosting the EAG plenary week, which started on Monday. Over 300 representatives of government institutions, law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, and the private sector in member states are taking part, joined by experts from a dozen other nations. The regional intergovernmental organization currently comprises nine countries – Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, India, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan – and is an associate member of the FATF . Vasily Gerasimov’s SCC is the Belarusian government body overseeing the execution of the national budget, the use of state property, and compliance with existing laws. Its role is similar to that of Russia’s Federal Treasury, and its responsibilities include conducting audits, carrying out investigations and initiating criminal proceedings. Minsk is updating crypto regulations Belarus became a leader in its region in terms of crypto regulation when it legalized transactions with “digital tokens” with the presidential decree “On the Development of the Digital Economy,” which entered into force in 2018. The document regulated crypto-related activities such as mining and trading for the residents of the Belarus Hi-Tech Park ( HTP ). The hub is governed by a special legal regime that provides various benefits to registered companies, initially from the IT sector. In September of this year, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko highlighted the growing importance of cryptocurrencies, particularly in payments, and pushed for updating crypto regulations. In October, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) announced it was creating a working group to combat the illegal circulation of cryptocurrencies, underlining the main objective – preventing unauthorized payment transactions and the transfer of stolen funds abroad. Amid concerns about capital flight, financial authorities in Minsk had already banned private citizens and individual entrepreneurs from buying and selling coins on non-Belarusian exchanges the previous year, in September 2024. In mid-November 2025, the NBRK proposed the establishment of a unified framework for crypto regulation within the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the single market uniting five former Soviet states. The EAEU is led by Russia , which has been lagging behind Belarus in adopting crypto rules.

The launch followed a presale that raised close to $10 million and drew nearly 12,000 early holders, setting the stage for strong liquidity and early demand. ANTIX opened at $0.035 before spiking to $0.14 and later stabilizing around $0.10. The performance reflects growing confidence in the project’s fundamentals: the token powers Antix, an AI platform for creating hyper-realistic, emotionally intelligent digital humans, the relevant content, and featuring an AI agent — a technology already in use across entertainment, gaming and digital media. Source: mexc.com AI + Web3 Momentum Helps Drive Early Demand The ANTIX price surge reflects broader market interest in tokens linked to practical AI applications. Antix launched with a functioning technology stack, including its proprietary AIGE engine (Antix Intelligence Generative Entities), which enables users to produce lifelike digital humans from just a handful of images. Unlike many AI-crypto projects in early development stages, Antix entered the market with a fully operational product and recognizable partners. The Antix technology has already been used by industry names such as HBO, Warner Brothers, and Tencent, signaling that digital humans are moving beyond concept demonstrations and into real-world creative and commercial workflows. Antix recently announced that its AIGE technology will be integrated with the MeWe social media platform, which has over 21 million users. Presale Strength Provided Early Liquidity The project’s presale results played a significant role in its successful launch. The nearly $10 million raised ahead of listing helped ensure liquidity and reduced early volatility, giving traders confidence in the token’s stability during the first hours of price discovery. The presale’s scale also shows strong early interest from the retail community — a factor that historically correlates with healthier post-listing performance. A Bullish Setup Supported by Fundamentals While early listings often attract speculative trading, $ANTIX’s debut stands out because it is backed by technology already in production. The Antix ecosystem integrates AI, digital identity, and creative tooling into a single platform, giving the token plenty of use cases, including access to digital human creation, marketplace features, and future AI-driven workflows. The bullish response on MEXC suggests that investors are positioning $ANTIX as a contender within the emerging category of AI-powered digital identity tokens. As Antix expands its ecosystem, the token’s long-term trajectory may continue to be influenced by user growth, enterprise adoption, and the evolving market narrative around AI-enhanced digital environments. If market conditions remain favorable and Antix sustains its current pace of development, interest in $ANTIX could extend beyond its initial listing spike, making its early performance one of the standout AI-token launches of Q4.

As of November 28, 2025, total AUM across the five currently active ETFs stands at $801.7 million, with 339.16 million XRP locked, representing 0.339% of circulating supply, with an early-stage but tangible shift in institutional positioning toward the asset. Total AUM. Source: XRP Insights Canary Capital remains the ETF leader with 155.8 million XRP held, followed by Bitwise at 80.5 million. Daily combined trading volume currently stands at $42.79 million, with Bitwise leading trading activity at $15.3 million. The figures reflect robust participation from both institutional allocators and professional traders taking advantage of the vehicle’s liquidity and regulated structure. XRP locked in ETF vaults. Source: XRP Insights XRP price as institutional demand accelerates ahead of 21Shares launch Notably, XRP price remains stable at $2.21 at the time of publication, posting a modest 0.69% 24-hour and a massive 14.66% on the week. XRP 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold The growth trajectory is likely to accelerate further with the imminent launch of 21Shares’ TOXR ETF, which received SEC Form 8-A approval on November 20 and is scheduled to begin trading on the Cboe BZX exchange on November 29 with a 0.50% management fee. Industry insiders expect the addition of TOXR to broaden access among both European and U.S. market participants, particularly those already onboarded through existing 21Shares digital asset products. The first-month performance of XRP ETFs is noteworthy when compared to initial Bitcoin ETF flows in previous cycles, which displayed a slower start before scaling into structural demand vehicles. What differentiates XRP’s early reception is a combination of legal clarity following the 2023 court ruling, rising demand for non-Bitcoin settlement networks and growing traction within banking and enterprise blockchain pilots. While current locked supply represents less than half a percent of total XRP circulation, analysts argue that the ratio is meaningful given the comparatively limited availability of institutional-grade vehicles previously supporting the asset. XRP ETFs seeing huge capital inflows The speed at which XRP ETFs have attracted capital suggests that institutional portfolios had been underexposed to the asset class and are now initiating risk-weighted entries. Moreover, the growth aligns with declining exchange reserves observed over recent weeks, a trend that may signal rotation into longer-term, custody-led positioning rather than speculative short-term trading. If net flows remain stable across the next fortnight, the $1 billion threshold could be reached before December end, even without significant price appreciation. With the 21Shares product ready to launch this week and additional applications expected to follow, momentum within the ETF segment may continue to build into the first quarter of 2026. Ultimately, how much capital migrates into structured ETF holdings versus self-custody environments will shape the asset’s liquidity profile going forward.

55048392,636409,1764337805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55048392.jpeg,Bitcoin Sentiment Rebounds as Analysts Predict 2026 Bull Cycle and $HYPER Nears $29M in Presale,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sentiment-recovers-bitcoin-hyper-nears-29m-presale/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin sentiment is transitioning from fear to cautious optimism as price grinds higher, historically the phase when capital rotates into higher‑beta plays. Tom Lee predicts Bitcoin to retake $100K+ by the end of 2025, while analysts expect a 2026 bull cycle. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets Bitcoin’s limitations by pairing an SVM‑based, low‑latency Layer 2 with $BTC settlement, aiming to turn $BTC into high‑speed DeFi collateral. With a release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, $HYPER already raised over $28.6M in presale with a token price of $0.013345. Bitcoin is back grinding higher, and you can feel sentiment shifting from pure fear to something closer to cautious optimism. Funding markets are stabilizing, open interest is creeping up, and even the Fear and Greed Index doesn’t look as fearful anymore, after jumping from 14 to 25 fear points over the last week. Then we have Tom Lee predicting a $100K+ $BTC by the year’s end , possibly up to another ATH if the market stars align. Historically, these early recovery phases have been where capital moves the fastest. Once the worst liquidation risk feels priced in, attention rotates away from majors into smaller caps and presales where upside isn’t capped by already heavy valuations. You see it every cycle: first $BTC, then high‑beta L1s, then the long tail where smart money positions before retail FOMO returns. That rotation is already underway in infrastructure narratives, especially around Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is trying to sit squarely in that lane. Framed as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, it targets sub‑second, low‑fee execution for $BTC‑backed DeFi and dApps. The presale has already raised over $28.6M at a token price of $0.013345, suggesting some traders are willing to front‑run a fuller recovery. Get your $HYPER today while the presale lasts. Why Bitcoin Layer 2s Are Pulling Capital in Early Recoveries If you zoom out, the market keeps circling back to the same core trade: own Bitcoin’s security, without inheriting Bitcoin’s user experience. The narrative suggests long-term price movements, which is why analysts like PlanC expect a bull market in 2026 . That’s why capital is clustering around Bitcoin scaling solutions – sidechains, rollup‑style designs, and scripting layers – each promising cheaper, faster settlement while settling back to $BTC as a base. Competing approaches range from Bitcoin‑secured EVM sidechains to rollups experimenting with fraud proofs and zero‑knowledge validity systems. Some optimize for compatibility with Ethereum tooling; others chase raw throughput with custom virtual machines. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) fits into this second camp, positioning itself as a high‑performance, SVM‑based execution layer that anchors back to Bitcoin L1. Buy your $HYPER today. How Bitcoin Hyper Aims to Turn $BTC Into a High-Speed DeFi Asset Where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) leans in is execution speed and developer familiarity. It uses a modular architecture: Bitcoin L1 is treated as the settlement and security layer, while a real‑time SVM Layer 2 handles high‑frequency transactions. The SVM integration is the headline differentiator. By aligning with the Solana Virtual Machine , Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver smart contracts that can, in theory, outperform Solana itself on certain workloads, while remaining SPL‑compatible. On the user side, the narrative is simple: turn $BTC into a high‑speed collateral asset. A decentralized canonical bridge moves $BTC into wrapped representations on the L2, enabling swaps, lending, staking, and high‑frequency payments with materially lower costs than routing everything via Bitcoin’s base layer. The goal is obvious: a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem, which would turn the network into a more feasible option for institutional investors. The presale is in full expansionist mode after raising over $28.6M so far, with $HYPER valued at $0.013345. The project’s utility, combined with the growing investor participation and market hype, spells good news for post-launch $HYPER. Based on these factors, our price prediction for $HYPER considers a potential target of $0.20 in 2026 and $1.50 by 2030, for a projected 5-year ROI of 11,137% based on today’s price. Hyper targets a release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, so there’s not much time left; read our guide on how to buy $HYPER now. Buy your $HYPER on the official presale page before the public listing. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR before investing.

The fund, developed with CACEIS, offers both traditional and blockchain-based versions. This tokenization increases order processing efficiency, expands investor access, and enables continuous trading. The first transaction was executed on the Ethereum network on November 4th as Amundi selected Ethereum (ETH) for its AMUNDI FUNDS CASH EUR fund. This move signals a trend aligned with similar initiatives like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, which have expanded their tokenized fund offerings. With this move, Ethereum strengthened its leadership in RWA tokenization. Amundi also began preparations for its first Bitcoin-indexed exchange-traded product (ETP) in October.

Dziś nadal dostępny w cenie debiutu na giełdzie,https://bitcoinist.com/best-wallet-token-wchodzi-na-kucoin-28-listopada/,"Rynek altcoinów ponownie żyje debiutami nowych tokenów, szczególnie na topowych giełdach jak KuCoin. Tam pierwszy dzień handlu potrafi wywindować kurs nawet o kilkaset procent. Dla projektów infrastrukturalnych, takich jak portfele, moment debiutu jest często bardzo istotnym punktem, który rzutuje na dalszy rozwój projektu. Czy giełdy zdecentralizowane to przyszłość aktywów cyfrowych W świecie portfeli krypto wciąż dominuje pewien paradoks. Z jednej strony scentralizowane aplikacje z ryzykiem pojedynczego punktu awarii, z drugiej zdecentralizowane, ale mało intuicyjne narzędzia, które zniechęcają zwykłych użytkowników. Do tego dochodzi brak realnych benefitów dla posiadaczy tokenów poza samą możliwością przechowywania środków i podstawowymi swapami. Wspomnianą tendencję dobrze widać na tle większości obecnych rozwiązań i popularnych zdecentralizowanych giełd . Best Wallet Token (BEST) wchodzi dokładnie w tę lukę, łącząc bezpieczeństwo klasy instytucjonalnej z mobilnym doświadczeniem dopasowanym do realnego życia użytkownika. Projekt stawia sprawę jasno: chce zdobyć 40% udziału w rynku portfeli kryptowalut do końca 2026 roku. Proponuje portfel, który ma być jednocześnie najprostszy, najbezpieczniejszy i najbardziej „napakowany” funkcjami. Ten plan ma bardzo konkretny katalizator. Już dziś, 28 listopada o godzinie 15:00 czasu lokalnego, Best Wallet debiutuje na giełdzie KuCoin . Do tego momentu token pozostaje dostępny w przedsprzedaży po cenie zbliżonej do ceny debiutu. New Listing: @BestWalletHQ $BEST is coming soon to #KuCoin !

Jeśli szukasz narzędzia do wygodnych, względnie anonimowych zakupów kryptowalut lub korzystasz aktywnie z DEX-ów, timing jest tutaj kluczowy. Best Wallet Token buduje portfel, którego brakowało Best Wallet Token dostarcza coś więcej niż kolejną aplikację do trzymania kryptowalut. To mobilny, niepowierniczy portfel z pełną integracją technologii Fireblocks MPC-CMP, co w praktyce przekłada się na poziom bezpieczeństwa. Do niedawna kojarzył się raczej z rozwiązaniami dla instytucji niż dla użytkowników detalicznych. Do tego dochodzi możliwość tworzenia kilku odrębnych portfeli w jednej aplikacji, co pozwala wygodnie rozdzielić różne strategie inwestycyjne w jednym, spójnym środowisku. Projekt stawia na konkretne korzyści dla użytkownika, nie na same slogany. Portal Upcoming Tokens upraszcza udział w przedsprzedażach. Zamiast przeglądać dziesiątki stron, w aplikacji masz jeden listę aktualnych ofert ze zweryfikowanymi, wczesnymi okazjami inwestycyjnymi oraz uproszczonym procesem zakupu. Jednocześnie Best DEX Aggregator, oparty na technologii Rubic, obsługuje ponad 50 łańcuchów, 200 DEX-ów i 20 mostów cross-chain,. dzięki czemu Dzięki wspomnianym usprawnieniom możesz znaleźć najlepszą cenę i płynność bez wychodzenia z portfela. Dla posiadaczy tokena $BEST liczą się też liczby. Trwająca przedsprzedaż zebrała już 18 089 514,07 USD , przy cenie tokena na poziomie 0,026015 USD . To sygnał nie tylko zainteresowania, ale i zaufania kapitału do narracji, że „portfel nowej generacji” może stać się jednym z głównych punktów wejścia do Web3 dla masowego użytkownika. W odróżnieniu od wielu konkurentów Best Wallet od początku projektuje doświadczenie jako „mobile-first”, tak aby obsługa DeFi i iGaming była tak prosta, jak zwykła aplikacja płatnicza. KUP BEST WALLET TOKEN Prognozy, staking i ostatnie godziny przedsprzedaży Jeśli Best Wallet Token zdoła przejąć choćby 5% rynku portfeli kryptowalut, $BEST może w średnim terminie celować w okolicę 0,20–0,25 USD , co oznacza potencjalnie nawet dziesięciokrotny wzrost względem obecnej ceny przedsprzedaży 0,026015 USD . To oczywiście scenariusz szacunkowy, ale oparty na założeniu, że portfele staną się główną bramą do DeFi, NFT i gier on-chain. Kluczowy dla tokenomiki jest również staking. Na nagrody stakingowe przeznaczono 8% podaży (800 mln tokenów) , z dynamicznymi, proporcjonalnymi nagrodami zależnymi od udziału osoby stakującej w puli. Co ważne, staking można uruchomić natychmiast już podczas przedsprzedaży. W praktyce liczysz na potencjalny wzrost ceny i jednocześnie budujesz pasywny dochód z opłat generowanych w ekosystemie Best Wallet. Wszystko to składa się na prosty obraz: dziś, do godziny 15:00, masz ostatnią okazję, by kupić $BEST na warunkach zbliżonych do ceny debiutu na KuCoin. Po starcie handlu rynek zrobi swoje. Jeśli popyt z przedsprzedaży przełoży się na wolumen na giełdzie, dyskusja nie będzie już o tym, „czy wejść”, tylko „czy nie jest już za późno”. Ostatecznie Best Wallet ustawia się w roli portfela, który chce pogodzić trzy światy: bezpieczeństwo bankowego poziomu, wygodę codziennej aplikacji mobilnej i pełne wykorzystanie możliwości DeFi oraz iGamingu. Dodaj do tego presję czasową związaną z natychmiastowym listingiem na KuCoin i masz rzadką kombinację technologii, narracji i momentu rynkowego.

What's Different About UChain?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/new-ath-during-the-market-crash-whats-different-about-uchain,"Bitcoin dropped 30%+. The crypto market lost over $500 billion in November alone. Yet $UCN , UChain's native coin, kept climbing — and still hits new highs while major assets hunt for a bottom. What's behind this demand, and what sets $UCN apart from today's crypto market? ETF-Driven vs. Product-Driven This crypto cycle was built on institutional adoption from the start. Capital flowed through crypto ETPs. BlackRock, Fidelity and a wave of traditional finance players brought legitimacy — and liquidity. But institutional money cuts both ways. When macro conditions shift and risk appetite fades, the same players who drove prices up become sellers. November saw a record $3.8 billion in crypto ETP outflows. The institutional bid that pushed BTC above $120,000 turned into an institutional exit, triggering cascading liquidations of leveraged positions. $UCN tells a different story. Demand for the coin doesn't depend on Wall Street flows — it's built on grassroots adoption—users who trade, stake, and spend through UChain's ecosystem. The Full-Stack Toolkit That demand comes from an ecosystem of working products—tools for everyday use. UChain's toolkit includes: UTrading — a user-friendly algorithmic trading platform. Bots run 24/7 on BTC/USDT and UCN/USDT pairs across MEXC, BingX and HTX. They're built to profit from the same volatility that hurts retail traders. UWallet — a non-custodial multi-currency wallet with deep ecosystem integration and cold storage support. UDefender — a physical NFC wallet for secure cold storage. Private keys never leave the device, protecting assets even if your main device gets compromised. UCard — a crypto debit card for everyday payments. Works in 100+ countries with automatic crypto-to-fiat conversion at competitive rates. Add $UCN staking, and these products form a complete financial loop: store assets in UWallet, trade through UTrading, stake for passive income, secure larger holdings with UDefender, spend through UCard. Each layer feeds the others. This is utility-driven growth. Users don't just hold $UCN hoping for a pump — they use it for network fees, staking and ecosystem access. That creates a demand floor pure speculation can't match. The Scarcity Factor When speculative interest fades, tokenomics come into focus. Most crypto projects run on billions of tokens with periodic burns. $UCN works differently: max supply is just 100,000 coins — 210 times less than Bitcoin. This hyper-deflationary model creates structural scarcity, closer to collectibles than typical utility tokens. As adoption grows and more $UCN gets locked in staking or used across the ecosystem, circulating supply shrinks. The opposite of inflationary tokens that need constant new demand just to hold price. Conviction Over Momentum New all-time highs during a market-wide capitulation signal something specific: this demand isn't coming from momentum traders chasing pumps. This points to conviction buying — demand from users and investors who see value in UChain's infrastructure regardless of market sentiment. The team's behavior tells the same story. They kept building and shipping through the volatility. New trading pairs on MEXC and BingX. Growing international community. Steady development pace. Under the hood, the blockchain handles 2,000+ transactions per second (comparable to Solana) with 3-second blocks and near-zero fees — infrastructure built for real use, not whitepaper promises. When Speculation Leaves The autumn correction exposed a vulnerability in crypto's new institutional era: when the same big players and insiders drive both the rally and the selloff, retail investors get caught in between. Projects with real utility offer something different. Their demand doesn't vanish when ETF flows reverse. Their users don't disappear the moment Fear & Greed drops to extreme fear. $UCN's performance during the crash isn't a guarantee—but it shows something increasingly rare in crypto: a coin whose value doesn't depend entirely on the next buyer paying more than the last. When speculation leaves the market, utility stays. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

US Session Turns Net Buyer as Asia Extends Bitcoin Selling Bitcoin session data from Velo shows U.S. trading hours have flipped back into positive territory, with cumulative returns now sitting above zero for the week. The blue U.S. line on the chart drops early but then climbs steadily, jumping sharply around Nov. 24–25 and holding near a roughly 2 percent gain by Nov. 26. BTC Cumulative Return by Session. Source: Velo / X By contrast, European hours remain negative even after a mid-week recovery. The purple line sinks deeply on Nov. 21, then edges higher but still ends the period several percentage points below the flat line. This suggests Europe is no longer leading the sell-side pressure, yet buyers there have not fully reversed the earlier drawdown. Asia continues to show the weakest profile. The yellow APAC line slides soon after Nov. 20 and spends most of the week between roughly minus 5 and minus 7 percent. Ted Pillows, who shared the chart, noted that Asian hours have again been the dominant selling window for Bitcoin this year, while U.S. traders are once more providing net demand. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Returns to Extreme Fear at 20 Meanwhile, crypto sentiment has dropped back into “extreme fear” even as Bitcoin trades far below its prior peak. The latest Crypto Fear and Greed Index reading stands at 20, double last week’s score of 10 when Bitcoin briefly touched 80,000 dollars, according to data shared by Coin Bureau. The outlet added that today’s mood mirrors the atmosphere when BTC hovered near 100,000 dollars. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Chart. Source: CoinMarketCap / Coin Bureau The 30-day chart shows the index sliding from higher levels earlier in November toward the red “extreme fear” band as prices trended lower. Bitcoin’ s line on the graphic falls from above 110,000 dollars to below 90,000 dollars over the period, while volume bars remain relatively steady in the background. Together, the curves illustrate how risk appetite has eroded during the pullback. Now, with the index pinned near 20, traders once again display the same risk-off posture seen around Bitcoin’s former highs. The combination of lower prices and depressed sentiment underscores how sharply attitudes have reset, even though on-chain and derivatives metrics may point to different positioning across the market. Bitcoin On-Chain Data Marks 84,570 Dollars as Key Support, 112,340 Dollars as Top Band On-chain data from Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution shows dense Bitcoin supply around 84,570 dollars.

The transaction was routed through Figment.io, an institutional staking provider. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows At the time of the move, the Ether was valued at about $970,000. The transfer is being watched in both crypto and policy circles because it links a sovereign treasury to active participation in a public blockchain. Details Of The Staking Move Onchain Lens say the 320 ETH created 10 new validators, matching the network rule that each validator requires 32 ETH. The payment and validator setup were recorded onchain and were visible to blockchain trackers shortly after the move. This is Bhutan’s largest ETH action since May 2025, when the nation moved 570 ETH to a Binance wallet, based on earlier disclosures. The Royal Government of Bhutan sent 320 $ETH, worth $920.8K, for staking into #ETH2.0 @Figment_io.https://t.co/q4dW3qJBT5 pic.twitter.com/qo0evHxthf — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) November 27, 2025 Beyond Treasury Management Observers note Bhutan is not only holding crypto as an asset. By staking ETH, the country is helping to secure the Ethereum network and earning rewards that come from validator participation. Reports have disclosed the move also ties into national plans to shift parts of its digital identity project from Polygon to Ethereum. That plan would make the chain more than a place to park funds; it could become part of public infrastructure. What It Means For Bhutan Bhutan is already known to hold a sizeable amount of Bitcoin. Public data and media reporting put the country’s Bitcoin reserves at about 6,154 BTC, making Bitcoin the primary reserve asset. Staking ETH, even at a smaller scale compared with those holdings, signals that Bhutan is experimenting with using crypto not just for investment but as a tool for state services and network involvement. The action was described by some analysts as an example of a small state testing new financial and technical models. On Liquidity And Rewards When ETH is staked it becomes illiquid for a period tied to network rules. That means the staked tokens cannot be used for immediate spending or trading. At the same time, validators earn rewards that may add modest income to a state treasury. The trade-offs are clear: more participation in protocol security, less short-term flexibility in asset use. Several commentators asked whether sovereign staking will affect how other small nations treat crypto reserves. Related Reading: Crypto Wins Big: Thailand Moves To A 0% Tax On Local Exchange Gains Broader Crypto Context On the world stage the amount is modest, but the move is symbolic. Sovereign actors rarely operate validators on major smart-contract chains. This step was noticed because it ties public services and reserve management to one blockchain. Regulators, market watchers, and blockchain developers have been monitoring the transaction and related policy moves to see whether similar steps might follow elsewhere.

While the price has picked up pace, the ETH derivatives market is heating up, with futures demand rising sharply compared to the spot market. Futures Appetite Surges Ahead Of Spot Buying With the price of Ethereum displaying renewed upward strength , the altcoin appears to be changing its tempo, and this change is not coming from where most traders typically look. A recent report from CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain data analytics platform, has revealed a notable divergence between the futures and spot markets. In the quick-take post, market expert and author with the pseudonym Crazzyblockk highlighted that the futures markets have accelerated significantly while spot activity continues to lag behind. Simply put, demand for futures is surging ahead of spot buying, indicating a shift among ETH investors or traders. When this key trend emerges, it often serves as an early tremor that frequently precedes more significant developments in Ethereum’s narrative . It suggests that individuals betting on tomorrow may write the next chapter of ETH price action instead of accumulating today. Over the last several days, ETH’s futures-to-spot ratio has steadily moved higher from the mid-5 range to nearly 6.9 on the most recent reading. Crazzyblockk stated that the rising multiple shows there is a fast increase in speculative interest around Ethereum than spot market participation. What this means is that traders positioning through leveraged markets are expanding rather than acquiring through spot. In comparison to other major digital assets in the dataset, ETH currently holds the most robust futures demand relative to its spot volume. While Bitcoin and Solana maintain stable ratios in the 3.5–4.5 zone, the altcoin remains the leader and is widening the gap. ETH Traders Are Choosing Directional Exposure The divergence points to an environment where traders are opting for directional exposure in ETH more aggressively than in other large assets. Meanwhile, the increase in futures participation could be a sign of impending catalysts or growing expectations for volatility unique to the Ethereum ecosystem. According to the market expert, the consistency of this upward trajectory is important to the market. When market players expect greater short-term price movement, a rising futures multiple usually arises. Currently, the data indicates that Ethereum traders are sharply positioning ahead of potential trend acceleration. However, whether this development leads to a persistent upward momentum or short-term volatility, the path remains clear. The behavior reflects heightened conviction and a noticeable change in Ethereum’s trading dynamics toward those driven by derivatives. At the time of writing, the ETH price was trading at $3,007, demonstrating a 0.73% decline in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has sharply dropped in the past day by more than 33%, indicating waning sentiment among ETH investors.",Ethereum|bitcoin|Crazzyblockk|CryptoQuant|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum ecosystem|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum’s Futures-to-Spot Ratio|ethusd|ETHUSDT|solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-28 14:00:55

Key Takeaways: South Korea will extend its crypto Travel Rule to cover sub-$700 transactions, closing a loophole used to evade identity checks. Exchanges will be forced to apply full KYC to small transfers and face stricter financial and compliance reviews. High-risk offshore platforms will be blocked, and criminals barred from owning stakes in licensed crypto firms. The new threshold covers transactions under 1 million won ($680), which until now allowed users to bypass identity checks by breaking transfers into smaller amounts, according to Yonhap News . South Korea’s FSC Chief Vows Crypto AML Push With Expanded Travel Rule Financial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Lee Eok-won confirmed the plan Wednesday during a briefing to the National Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, saying authorities would tighten oversight on crypto rails increasingly used for money laundering and tax evasion. “We will crack down on crypto money laundering expanding the Travel Rule to transactions under 1 million won,” Lee said. Currently, South Korea’s travel rule largely applies to higher-value transfers, requiring exchanges to collect and exchange identifying information about senders and recipients. The new proposal would eliminate that loophole, forcing crypto platforms to apply the same disclosure standards to smaller transactions that were often used to evade reporting. Once the change is implemented, exchanges operating in South Korea will be required to gather full identity data on crypto users even for low-value trades and transfers. Regulators believe this will significantly reduce the use of digital assets for overseas remittances tied to illegal activities and unreported income.

According to the regulator, these platforms will be blocked outright if they are deemed to pose heightened risks of fraud or money laundering. In addition, crypto exchanges will face more intense reviews of their financial stability. The government plans to widen the criteria for Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration, evaluating whether platforms have adequate reserves, internal controls and compliance systems in place. New rules will also bar individuals with prior convictions for tax crimes or drug offenses from becoming major shareholders in licensed crypto firms, a move aimed at preventing criminal networks from gaining influence over regulated platforms. South Korea to Grant FIU Pre-Emptive Freezing Powers The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will also introduce pre-emptive account-freezing powers in serious cases, allowing investigators to lock suspicious accounts before funds can be moved beyond recovery. Officials said legislative amendments are expected to be submitted to the National Assembly in the first half of 2026, with South Korea also expanding coordination with global regulators such as the Financial Action Task Force to align with international standards. As reported, South Korea faces mounting concerns that its virtual asset taxation, scheduled to begin in January 2027 , could face a fourth postponement due to persistent infrastructure gaps and unclear regulatory guidelines. Despite five years since the tax law’s initial approval in 2020 and three previous delays , authorities have failed to establish critical systems for transaction monitoring, income classification, and cross-border enforcement.

Recently, new data surfaced that alters how we view who qualifies as a “top holder.” RISKTAKE shared a post on X with a new, detailed table showing XRP wallet balances broken down by percentile. That data provides updated thresholds — from the ultra‑elite 0.01 % down to the broader top 10 % — offering an unusually detailed snapshot of ownership tiers. According to RISKTAKE’s data, only a small number of wallets sit at the very top. The top 0.01 % — just 734 wallets — reportedly hold at least 4,000,286.848379 XRP each. Meanwhile, the bar for inclusion among the top 10 % of all wallets is around 2,311.973432 XRP. That means holders with just over two thousand tokens now reach a threshold many assumed required far more. They asked for an XRP Richlist update and here it is. Values keep changing https://t.co/LUSZlJnUDN pic.twitter.com/E7VV2AP5Lu — RISKTAKE. (@RiskTake) November 27, 2025 Comparison with Other Rich‑List Trackers These figures diverge somewhat from those reported by other rich‑list trackers . For example, recent analyses show the top 10 % threshold was 2,486 XRP, while the top 1 % requires around 50,637 XRP. Such differences highlight persistent variation across data sources. Some platforms rely on partial snapshots of ledger data; others may exclude dormant or exchange‑controlled wallets. That may explain the discrepancy between RISKTAKE’s snapshot and other trackers. What the Shift Suggests About Wallet Distribution The lowered threshold for top‑10 % status likely reflects growing wallet proliferation and retail accumulation. As more wallets enter the ecosystem — even with modest XRP amounts — rankings shift downward. Data from a major analytics platform shows over 7.16 million wallets in total, with a mean balance of 9,100 XRP, and a median balance of just 20 XRP. Thus, while entry into the top decile has become easier, the concentration at higher ranks remains steep. A small number of wallets — many likely belonging to exchanges or institutions — still hold disproportionately large shares. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Means for Everyday XRP Holders For everyday holders, the new numbers provide context. Owning a few thousand XRP — easily within reach for many early or long‑term HODLers — now qualifies one among the top 10 % of wallets. That evokes a sense of relative belonging. Yet for real influence over supply or market moves, far larger holdings remain critical. The whales — those holding tens of thousands to millions of XRP — still command the lion’s share of power. Final Thoughts The RISKTAKE update offers a sharp reminder: rankings are not static. They shift with wallet growth , inflows, and concentration dynamics. As more retail wallets accumulate XRP, the entry points into top tiers will continue to evolve. For analysts and investors alike, watching these thresholds helps illuminate distribution trends and possible supply pressure from major holders.

In an absolutely spectacular market movement, Bitcoin has shattered expectations by breaking through the $92,000 barrier! The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at $92,000.74 on Binance’s USDT market, marking one of the most significant BTC price achievements in recent history. This monumental surge has sent shockwaves through the entire crypto ecosystem, leaving both investors and analysts buzzing with excitement. What’s Fueling This Remarkable BTC Price Surge? The current BTC price explosion isn’t happening in isolation. Several key factors are contributing to this impressive rally. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate as major financial players increase their Bitcoin exposure. Second, macroeconomic conditions are creating the perfect environment for digital assets to thrive. Moreover, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event is generating substantial market anticipation. Market sentiment has turned overwhelmingly positive, with trading volumes spiking across all major exchanges. The $92,000 BTC price level represents a crucial psychological barrier that many analysts had been watching closely. Breaking through this resistance so decisively suggests strong underlying momentum that could propel prices even higher. How Does This BTC Price Compare to Historical Performance? When we examine the historical BTC price trajectory, the current $92,000 milestone stands out as particularly significant. Consider these key comparisons: The current BTC price represents a 150% increase from the same period last year This marks the highest BTC price level since the 2021 bull market peak Trading volume has increased by 45% compared to last month’s average Institutional inflows have reached their highest level in three years This sustained upward movement in BTC price demonstrates growing confidence among both retail and institutional investors. The market appears to be pricing in several positive developments simultaneously, creating a perfect storm for continued growth. What Should Investors Watch For Next? As the BTC price continues its impressive run, smart investors are keeping a close eye on several key indicators. Technical analysis suggests that maintaining above $90,000 could open the path toward $100,000. However, market participants should remain cautious and watch for potential resistance levels. The current BTC price movement shows strong support at multiple levels, which is encouraging for long-term holders. Market depth analysis indicates substantial buying interest even at these elevated price points. This suggests that the current BTC price level might have solid foundations rather than being driven purely by speculation. Key Takeaways from the $92,000 BTC Price Breakthrough This historic BTC price achievement offers several important lessons for market participants. First, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its resilience and capacity for growth despite economic uncertainties. Second, the maturation of cryptocurrency markets is evident in the sustained nature of this rally. Finally, the global adoption narrative appears to be strengthening with each new price milestone. The journey to the current BTC price has been anything but smooth, yet Bitcoin continues to prove its critics wrong. This latest surge above $92,000 reinforces Bitcoin’s position as the dominant digital asset and store of value in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $92,000? The BTC price surge is driven by multiple factors including increased institutional adoption, positive macroeconomic conditions, and anticipation around the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. Is $92,000 a good time to buy Bitcoin? While the current BTC price represents a significant high, many analysts believe Bitcoin still has room for growth. However, investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. How does this BTC price compare to previous highs? The current $92,000 BTC price marks the highest level since the 2021 bull market peak and represents a 150% increase from the same period last year. What’s the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? Analysts are watching the $95,000 and $100,000 levels as the next major psychological barriers for the BTC price. Could the BTC price drop significantly from current levels? While cryptocurrency markets are volatile, the current BTC price appears to have strong support levels. However, investors should always be prepared for market corrections. How does institutional investment affect BTC price? Institutional investment provides substantial liquidity and stability to the BTC price, making large price movements more sustainable and reducing extreme volatility. Found this analysis helpful?

From major U.S. institutions to global players, banks are recognizing that stablecoins—blockchain-based tokens pegged to fiat currency —offer efficiency gains that legacy systems can’t match. The GENIUS Act in the United States and the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation in Europe have further accelerated this trend. These regulatory frameworks define stablecoins and outline who may issue them, including insured depository institutions like banks and credit unions, as well as qualified nonbanks. The GENIUS Act is getting signed today, bringing clear rules of the road for stablecoins. Here's why stablecoins are better money, how they're better for people and businesses, and the mental models you can use to understand them. My master thread on stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/qIV5DHpkJE — Sam Broner (@SamBroner) July 18, 2025 Why Banks Are Exploring Stablecoin Adoption in 2025 “Payments are a huge part of banks’ business,” said Paul Brody, global blockchain lead at EY, in an interview with Cryptonews. “Now that banks are authorized to enter the market, they can serve the consumer and enterprise users that are looking for much lower costs on their payments, especially cross-border payments,” Brody added. According to EY’s survey of over 250 financial services companies, reducing costs on cross-border transactions with partners and suppliers is the top priority. McKinsey & Company reports that stablecoin transactions can offer near-instant settlement, which has major implications for corporate treasury and global payments. “Just over 50% of large financial institutions say they plan to be doing or testing this in some manner in the coming 12 months, which is an extraordinarily high rate of uptake,” Brody mentioned. Source: McKinsey & Company Banks Currently Looking at Stablecoin Implementation Several banks are moving from exploration to action . On November 25, 2025, U.S. Bank announced a pilot issuing a custom stablecoin on the Stellar network in collaboration with PwC and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF). José Fernández da Ponte, president and chief growth officer at SDF, told Cryptonews that blockchain technology makes business sense for institutions like U.S. Bank. He explained that transactions that cost thousands of dollars on legacy rails cost just a fraction of that on Stellar. “Settlement times are also cut from days to approximately five seconds, reducing counterparty risk and intermediary fees financial institutions have to pay to move money across the globe,” he added. The Stellar network is already partnering with enterprise financial institutions like WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, PayPal, and MoneyGram. Fernández da Ponte shared that next year, Stellar expects to see more growth in the ecosystem as institutions explore moving on-chain. Other major banks, including Citi, Barclays, Bank of America, and more, have also announced plans to explore and potentially adopt their own stablecoins moving forward. Beyond banks, Ripple announced that its USD-backed stablecoin RLUSD is now recognized as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token by Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority, allowing licensed companies to use it for permitted activities. Compliance and trust are non-negotiables for institutional finance. That's why $RLUSD has been greenlisted by Abu Dhabi’s FSRA, enabling its use as collateral on exchanges, for lending, and on prime brokerage platforms within @ADGlobalMarket —the international financial centre of… — Ripple (@Ripple) November 27, 2025 Financial services giant Visa recently announced that it is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities across Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (CEMEA) through a new partnership with digital assets platform Aquanow. According to Visa, the integration of Aquanow’s digital asset infrastructure with Visa’s technology stack will allow issuers and acquirers across the CEMEA region to quickly settle transactions using approved stablecoins like USDC. Adoption Takes Off, But Real Use Cases Years Away Despite growing institutional interest, experts caution that mainstream adoption is still a few years away. Brody believes that it will take at least one to two years of network effects before banks and stablecoin usage increase. “The benefits of stablecoins include speed, low cost, and full programmability,” he said. “But the biggest challenges are that there are still too few companies and countries connected to this expanding network and far too few foreign exchange currencies as well.” Mike Villano, senior vice president of enterprise innovation at U.S. Bank, further noted that privacy remains a primary concern. “One issue we hope to continue to work on with Stellar in future phases is privacy. One of the things a US Bank would expect when we deliver a product to market will be to maintain the privacy of some of the balances on a blockchain.” November also marked a turning point for the overall stablecoin sector. A report from CoinDesk published on Nov. 26 found that the total market capitalization of stablecoins contracted 1.48% to $303 billion. The report notes that this $4.54 billion contraction marks the steepest monthly decline since the collapse of FTX in November 2022. This demonstrates a combination of stablecoin outflows and weakening digital asset prices, suggesting a broader withdrawal of liquidity and capital from the crypto markets. The Long-term Outlook Industry leaders remain optimistic, though. Danny Lim, co-founder of Pundi X and Pundi AI, believes that stablecoin outflows will not impact real-world use cases. Lim told Cryptonews that bank-issued stablecoins are not meant to replace USDT or USDC, but rather to change who is willing to come on board. “If banks issue stablecoins on public or permissioned chains, merchants get the same 24/7 settlement speed and on-chain finality as today’s public stablecoins, but with a known regulated counterparty, deposit protection, full AML/KYC, and clear domestic rules behind the token,” he said. Lim added that in regions like Turkey and South Africa, where Pundi X has been active for years, consumers are using stablecoins like USDT and USDC for everyday remittances, savings, and protection against currency swings. He explained that a bank-issued stablecoin will likely push this further by adding regulated on and off ramps, local Know Your Customer (KYC,) and a sense of safety that appeals to more traditional families and small businesses.

The 60-page report titled “ Trump, Crypto, and a New Age of Corruption ” alleges the President transformed his office into what Ranking Member Jamie Raskin described as “ the world’s most corrupt crypto startup operation. ” According to the document, Trump family crypto holdings could reach $11.6 billion, though precise valuations remain difficult to determine given market volatility. Source: The Report Report Details Foreign Investment Concerns Democrats highlight what they describe as questionable foreign investments in World Liberty Financial’s $WLFI governance token. According to the report, Chinese-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun invested $75 million in WLFI while facing SEC scrutiny. The agency later requested to stay its enforcement action, citing “ public interest. “ Another investor, Aqua 1 Foundation , reportedly purchased $100 million in WLFI tokens. Congressional investigators say they found no Emirati public records confirming the fund’s corporate existence. The report identifies the fund’s leadership as including Guren “ Bobby ” Zhou, allegedly under investigation in Britain for money laundering, and Dave Lee, who the report suggests may be connected to China National Petroleum Corporation. The allegations also touched on the timing of state-backed Emirati firm MGX’s announcement that it would invest $2 billion in Binance using World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin. They note that this deal emerged as the UAE negotiated for American AI chips, and that Trump subsequently dismissed six National Security Council officials who opposed the arrangement. Enforcement Changes Follow Industry Donations The report claims the administration dismantled crypto enforcement mechanisms while ending investigations against companies that donated to Trump’s campaign. According to Democrats, the Justice Department dissolved its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, which had handled major crypto crime cases. Source: The Report The SEC closed investigations into Coinbase, Gemini, Robinhood, Ripple, Crypto.com, Uniswap, Yuga Labs, and Kraken, companies the report identifies as Trump donors or business partners. Source: The Report When Ripple and Solana were included in Trump’s proposed crypto reserve, their token prices rose by 33% and 25%, respectively, according to market data. In October, Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , who pleaded guilty to money laundering in 2023 as part of Binance’s $4.3 billion settlement with the DOJ. The report alleges the pardon came after Zhao and Binance supported World Liberty Financial. Token Performance Shows Mixed Results According to the report, WLFI initially raised only $2.7 million from 348 investors at launch. Following Trump’s election victory, the token reportedly surged over 2000%, generating $550 million from approximately 85,000 investors. The report states that trading debut on major exchanges in September valued the Trump family’s WLFI stake at over $6 billion. The $TRUMP memecoin , launched days before the inauguration, allegedly generated $350 million in trading fees. Market data shows the token peaked at $75 before losing nearly two-thirds of its value over the next week. According to the report, while 45 crypto wallets cleared $1.2 billion in profits, over 712,000 wallets collectively lost $4.3 billion. Trump hosted a dinner for the top 220 WLFI holders , with the report estimating the average cost at over $1 million. Democrats claim more than half the attendees were likely foreign individuals, including He Tianying, identified as a member of China’s Political Consultative Conference. According to Financial Times estimates cited in the report, World Liberty earned around $42 million from its USD1 stablecoin, which grew from $128 million to nearly $2.7 billion in market capitalization. The report alleges Binance helped develop USD1’s underlying technology. Democratic lawmakers warn in the report that Trump’s reported ability to accumulate billions through cryptocurrency exposes weaknesses in campaign finance and anti-bribery laws. They cite polling suggesting that 60% of Americans haven’t heard that the President’s family runs a crypto business. The Trump family’s wealth ballooned by $6B after $WLFI , their flagship crypto token, made its debut on major exchanges and opened for trading. #TrumpFamily #WLFI https://t.co/IcK4AYdI4D — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 Cryptonews previously reported in September that the Trump family’s paper fortune surged by as much as $6 billion when WLFI began trading on major exchanges, with early investors seeing 15x gains. Financial Times estimated in October that the Trump family’s crypto ventures generated around $1 billion in pre-tax gains over the past year.

Many firms overpromise, underdeliver, and leave founders without the tangible results they were expecting. To cut through the noise, we dug deeper to understand which crypto and Web3 marketing agencies actually have the expertise, proven track record, and the ability to bring measurable impact to blockchain projects. Our goal was to identify the teams that deliver real value, not just flashy presentations. To ensure this ranking reflects real performance rather than marketing claims, we evaluated each agency using three key criteria: Verified client reviews — assessing communication, reliability, and overall satisfaction. Web3 specialization — focusing on agencies with proven experience in crypto, blockchain, and token launches. Verifiable outcomes — prioritizing teams that show clear, quantifiable campaign results. Below is a ranking of seven agencies that stand out for their performance, credibility, and results-driven approach in 2025. 1. Outset PR — A Data-Led Approach to Crypto Communications Outset PR is known in the Web3 space for taking an analytical approach to crypto PR and media planning. Unlike many agencies that rely primarily on traditional press distribution, Outset PR evaluates the performance of crypto media outlets through the lens of Outset Data Pulse and uses this data to guide campaign decisions. This helps clients focus on visibility that can translate into measurable outcomes rather than simply accumulating mentions. The agency provides PR, media planning, and content services for blockchain companies, supporting product launches, announcements, and long-term communication. Their work combines content creation with traffic acquisition strategies. Outset PR Ensures LLM Visibility for Web3 Brands One of Outset PR’s goals today is ensuring that projects become visible to LLMs and AI-driven discovery systems, securing placements on the site where AI models source, verify, and index information. Unlike traditional PR workflows where analytics appear at the end, Outset PR starts with data. Before a story is published, the team models how it will travel across search engines, syndication networks, and AI ecosystems. Their approach centers on three pillars: Data-led strategyCampaigns begin with goals tied to visibility signals — coverage weight, citation depth, and factual recall accuracy. AI-aware storytellingContent is written in clear, structured, fact-driven language to be easily interpreted by both readers and machine-learning models. Continuous LLM monitoringThe agency regularly checks how major models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) describe their clients, adjusting narratives and content strategy to maintain accurate representation. The approach of Outset PR is particularly effective for campaigns that require measurable traffic impact, strong search visibility, and consistent representation across AI-driven discovery systems. 2. Proleo.io — PR & Marketing for Crypto Startups Proleo.io is a boutique agency that focuses on PR, press outreach, and marketing services for crypto and blockchain projects. Unlike larger firms that rely on broad, generic distribution, Proleo.io tends to work with smaller, more targeted campaigns designed for early-stage Web3 companies. Their services include PR, content creation, influencer outreach, social media support, and strategic marketing for token launches and project announcements. Working Approach Proleo.io’s work is generally shaped around: Creating clear, accessible narratives for early-stage projects Pitching to crypto outlets and partners with relevant audiences Supporting token launches, presales, and ongoing promotional cycles Helping projects build visibility through a mix of PR and social amplification Example Use Case Proleo.io is commonly chosen by small-to-medium crypto startups that need straightforward PR support without the budget of a large-scale agency. Their boutique model is often suitable for ICO/IDO campaigns, exchange listings, or ecosystem announcements. 3. Solus Agency — Regional Marketing Partner With a Balanced Service Mix Solus Agency , based in Eastern Europe, works across blockchain marketing, digital strategy, and PR support. Their approach blends traditional marketing with blockchain-specific communication, making them a potential fit for mid-sized Web3 projects. They provide content writing, social media marketing, branding, and general marketing strategy—often serving clients that need both technical understanding and marketing execution. Working Approach Solus Agency typically focuses on: Creating marketing strategies tailored to Web3 narratives Producing written content for project announcements and updates Supporting community growth through social and digital channels Providing a structured, agency-style workflow with predictable deliverables Example Use Case Projects often choose Solus Agency when they need a stable mid-size team capable of handling multi-week marketing tasks rather than one-off PR blasts. 4. Crynet Marketing Solutions — Social & Digital Growth for Crypto Brands Crynet Marketing Solutions operates primarily in social media marketing, community growth, and digital advertising for crypto companies. Their focus tends to be on increasing brand visibility rather than offering deep technical PR. The agency works with clients across exchanges, DeFi platforms, NFT brands, and Web3 startups that require help with community traction or exposure. Working Approach Crynet's campaigns often include: Social media management and growth attempts Paid marketing or promotional support Basic PR outreach to crypto outlets Branding and communication materials Example Use Case Crynet is typically selected by projects looking to improve social reach, run promotional campaigns, or strengthen presence on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, or Discord. 5.

FAQ: Choosing a Crypto PR & Marketing Agency 1. How do I choose the right Web3 marketing agency for my project? The choice depends on your stage and priorities. Early-stage startups often benefit from smaller agencies like Proleo.io, CTRL ART D, or Morris Digital, where budgets are tighter and the focus is on basic PR, messaging, and community traction. Mid-sized projects that need structured marketing workflows may find Solus Agency more suitable. Projects needing data-driven visibility — especially around launches or presales — may prefer performance-focused teams like Outset PR. Define your goals (PR, SEO traffic, influencers, community, or ads) and choose the agency whose strengths align with them. 2. What’s the difference between crypto PR and traditional digital PR? Traditional PR focuses on broad industry publications and brand visibility.Crypto PR requires: understanding token economies, presales, and compliance relationships with niche crypto outlets navigating fast-moving narratives producing content that works specifically in Google Discover, Top Stories, and crypto media feeds Agencies like Outset PR focus on measurable visibility across crypto-specific channels, while smaller agencies often concentrate on community reach and regular announcements. 3. What should blockchain projects expect to budget for marketing? Budgets can vary widely: Small projects: $3,000–$10,000/month for boutique agencies (Proleo.io, CTRL ART D, Morris Digital) Mid-sized projects: $10,000–$25,000/month for more structured marketing programs (Solus Agency) Launch-focused campaigns: $25,000+ for performance-based visibility and broader PR reach (Outset PR or similar) Blockchain marketing tends to be more expensive than traditional marketing because of paid placements, influencer fees, and high competition during token launches. 4. Which type of agency is best for a token presale or product launch? For launches, agencies with PR + traffic acquisition capabilities typically deliver the strongest results. Outset PR is suited for presales that require measurable visibility, Google Discover reach, and performance analytics. Boutique agencies like Proleo.io can be a fit for smaller presales that need straightforward PR and influencer support. Agencies such as Solus Agency work well for launches that require structured marketing + community support rather than heavy media buying. Bottom Line The Web3 marketing landscape is crowded, but effectiveness varies widely from agency to agency. Some teams specialize in data-driven PR and measurable visibility, while others focus on community growth, content production, or early-stage support. The right choice ultimately depends on your project’s size, goals, and launch timeline. By understanding each agency’s strengths, blockchain founders can select partners that not only fit their budget, but also help them achieve sustainable traction in a competitive industry.

Instead, its price has plummeted by approximately 27% within that timeframe, and several analysts now predict it is poised for a much more substantial collapse. Is the Bull Run Over? Currently, ZEC trades at roughly $470, representing a solid retreat from the local high above $730 reached earlier this month. Recall that the asset was at the forefront of gains in October and most of November, but the bears seem to have regained control recently. ZEC Price, Source: CoinGecko While the native token of Zcash was the subject of very bullish price predictions during its bull run, the landscape has changed the analysts’ tone. X user Tryrex noted that ZEC has formed a triple top on its chart, claiming it “doesn’t look strong” and forecasting a plunge to around $350 in the following days. Just a few hours ago, X user Altcoin Sherpa predicted that the asset’s valuation could plunge below $200 in the coming weeks or months, claiming some bounces might accompany the downtrend. Max Keiser, the American broadcaster and financial commentator who is known as a devoted fan of Bitcoin, also chipped in. He believes the ZEC “pump and dump” is over, arguing that a crash to $55 “looks inevitable.” True to himself he concluded his post with the following: “Bitcoin Only. Everything else is just gambling.” The Bulls Haven’t Capitulated Yet Despite the price pullback, some analysts still think ZEC isn’t done for this cycle. X user Altcoin Miyagi claimed the asset could soar to $1,000: a prediction that aligns with the one made by Arthur Hayes. Initially, the co-founder of BitMEX envisioned a price explosion to $10,000, but later revised the target to the aforementioned $1K. Interestingly, Hayes recently offloaded some of his altcoin bags, but ZEC was not included in the sell-off. Grayscale’s intention to convert its Zcash Trust into an ETF supports the bullish thesis. The launch of such a product will allow investors to gain exposure to the asset without having to worry about safeguarding it, and could boost interest. Meanwhile, ZEC’s Relative Strength Index has dropped to almost 30, thus nearing overbought zone and suggesting the valuation might rebound in the near future. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to give traders an idea of what comes next. It ranges from 0 to 100, and readings above 70 are considered bearish territory.

This mysterious incident, reported by user Doomer on social media platform X, has left many wondering what really happened with the Coinbase OpenSea SEA token announcement and why it disappeared so abruptly. What Exactly Happened with the Coinbase OpenSea SEA Token Announcement? The situation unfolded when Coinbase’s official social media account shared details about a token sale for SEA, which serves as the native token for leading NFT marketplace OpenSea. However, within hours, the post vanished without explanation. This rapid removal has sparked numerous questions about the legitimacy of the information and the reasons behind its deletion. The incident highlights how quickly cryptocurrency news can change and the importance of verifying information from multiple sources. Why Would Coinbase Delete the OpenSea Token Information?

The chain reached a peak of 99% in October, signaling a decisive shift in market preference toward faster settlement and cheaper execution. Besides this dominance, new on-chain data shows rising investor confidence as activity strengthens across spot markets, derivatives flows, and long-term structural patterns. Market Share Expands as Tokenized Equities Gain Adoption Solana’s rise reflects increased demand for tokenized assets on platforms such as xStocks and Dinari. These platforms continue to scale activity due to rapid settlement and low network fees, which remain crucial for high-volume equity products. Moreover, the broader RWA sector is expected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, placing Solana’s position in a favorable long-term trajectory. Demand also shows in market performance. Solana trades near $142 as of press time, posting weekly gains above 12%. Additionally, liquidity stays deep as daily volume remains above $4 billion. This strength keeps investors engaged during broader market rotations. Short Pressure Builds as Solana Reclaims Key Levels JohnnyB, a crypto analyst, noted that Solana reclaimed the $140 range low while funding rates stayed negative. This combination signals aggressive short exposure during a recovery. Hence, traders monitor the $143–$145 range for signs of continuation. A break above this zone may send price toward $148. Open interest also holds at elevated levels, showing strong positioning from both sides. However, sustained negative funding increases the chances of a short squeeze. Buyers only need to defend $139 on pullbacks to maintain control. Momentum then shifts higher as traders unwind short positions. Long-Term Structure Points Toward Higher Expansion Source: X Another analyst moonbag tracks a larger multi-year cup-and-handle structure forming on higher time frames. Price continues to turn upward from the $120 to $135 accumulation area. A reclaim of $160 strengthens momentum toward $200. Meanwhile, the wider breakout level sits near $240. Clearing this region may unlock targets around $320, $380, and $450.

The cryptocurrency firm confirmed the suspension on Friday while maintaining its dedication to other projects across Latin America. The decision affects approximately 30 workers who received formal dismissal notices through Uruguay's Ministry of Labor this week. Reports from local news outlet El Observador indicate the company notified government officials of the operational halt on Tuesday. Financial Disputes Lead to Operational Pause The shutdown follows a disputed debt of $4.8 million with UTE, Uruguay's state-owned electricity provider. The amount includes $2 million in unpaid electricity bills and an additional $2.8 million related to other local ventures. Tether acknowledged the debt in September and stated it was working with government officials to resolve the matter. The company had previously denied reports suggesting a complete withdrawal from the country. ”We can confirm that we have paused operations in Uruguay,” a Tether representative told Cointelegraph. The spokesperson emphasized continued interest in long-term regional initiatives. The stablecoin issuer, known for USDT , had positioned Uruguay as a strategic location for sustainable cryptocurrency mining. The South American nation offered abundant renewable energy resources that aligned with Tether's environmental objectives. Tether announced its Uruguayan mining venture in May 2023. The company partnered with an unnamed licensed local firm to establish what it described as environmentally responsible Bitcoin mining facilities. Paolo Ardoino, who served as chief technology officer at launch and now leads Tether as CEO, promoted the project as a model for sustainable crypto operations. He highlighted Uruguay's renewable energy capabilities as ideal for large-scale mining activities. The initial investment commitment reached $500 million, according to industry reports. Local sources suggest that Tether has deployed at least $100 million on mining equipment and operations, plus an additional $50 million on supporting infrastructure. Tether declined to verify these figures when contacted for comment. The company stated it continues evaluating the optimal path forward in Uruguay and neighboring markets. Partnership Network Remains Unclear While Tether has not officially named its operational partners, industry analysts have connected the venture to UTE and Microfin, a local commercial operator. These relationships apparently soured as financial obligations went unmet. The September debt revelation sparked initial reports that Tether planned a complete exit. The company disputed those claims at the time but acknowledged outstanding payments required resolution. Energy costs in Uruguay have increased significantly over the past year, creating pressure on power-intensive operations, such as cryptocurrency mining . These increases likely contributed to the financial strain between Tether and its utility provider. Despite the Uruguayan setback, Tether remains focused on Latin American opportunities. The company views the region as promising for the adoption of blockchain technology and the integration of renewable energy. ”Tether is committed to building long-term initiatives in Latin America, especially projects that harness renewable energy,” the spokesperson said. The firm indicated that it is conducting an ongoing assessment of regional possibilities.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TECHNOLOGY|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-28 15:29:54

As Washington inches closer to establishing meaningful AI regulation standards, a critical battle is emerging—not about the technology itself, but about who gets to call the shots in this high-stakes game of technological governance. Why AI Regulation Has Become a Political Battleground In the absence of comprehensive federal AI legislation, states have taken matters into their own hands. California’s AI safety bill SB-53 and Texas’s Responsible AI Governance Act represent just two of dozens of state-level initiatives designed to protect consumers from AI-related harms. These measures range from prohibiting intentional AI misuse to establishing safety frameworks for large AI laboratories. The Federal Push for AI Legislation Supremacy Tech giants and Silicon Valley startups argue that this patchwork of state regulations creates an unworkable system that threatens American innovation. “It’s going to slow us in the race against China,” warns Josh Vlasto, co-founder of pro-AI PAC Leading the Future. The industry is pushing hard for a single national standard—or none at all. Recent developments show the federal government’s aggressive approach: House lawmakers attempting to use the National Defense Authorization Act to block state AI laws A leaked White House executive order draft supporting preemption of state regulations Creation of an “AI Litigation Task Force” to challenge state laws in court State AI Laws: Laboratories of Democracy or Innovation Killers? As of November 2025, 38 states have adopted more than 100 AI-related laws, primarily targeting: Area Number of Laws Key Focus Deepfakes 42 Election integrity and personal protection Transparency 35 Disclosure requirements for AI systems Government AI Use 28 Public sector implementation standards The Industry’s Stance on AI Governance Pro-AI super PACs have emerged as powerful political forces, with Leading the Future raising over $100 million from backers including Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI president Greg Brockman, and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale. These groups advocate for industry self-regulation and minimal federal oversight to “maximize growth.” Nathan Leamer, executive director of Build American AI, argues that existing laws covering fraud and product liability are sufficient to handle AI harms. “When you’re trying to drive innovation in the tech sector, you can’t have a situation where all these laws keep popping up from people who don’t necessarily have the technical expertise,” Vlasto told Bitcoin World. Congressional Efforts Toward Federal AI Policy Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and the bipartisan House AI Task Force are preparing a comprehensive federal AI package covering: Fraud protection and penalties Healthcare AI standards Transparency requirements Child safety provisions Catastrophic risk mitigation Lieu’s 200-page megabill, expected in December, would require AI labs to test their models and publish results—something most companies do voluntarily now. However, he acknowledges the political reality: “I’m not writing a bill that I’d have if I were king. I’m trying to write a bill that could pass a Republican-controlled House, a Republican-controlled Senate, and a Republican-controlled White House.” The Preemption Debate: States Rights vs National Standards More than 200 lawmakers have signed an open letter opposing preemption in the NDAA, arguing that “states serve as laboratories of democracies” that must “retain the flexibility to confront new digital challenges as they arise.” Nearly 40 state attorneys general have similarly opposed a state AI regulation ban. New York Assembly member Alex Bores, sponsor of the RAISE Act, supports national AI policy but argues states can move faster to address emerging risks. “I believe in the power of AI, and that is why it is so important to have reasonable regulations,” Bores told Bitcoin World. “Ultimately, the AI that’s going to win in the marketplace is going to be trustworthy AI.” What’s Really at Stake in the AI Legislation Fight? Cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier and data scientist Nathan E. Sanders argue that the “patchwork” complaint is overblown. They note that AI companies already comply with tougher EU regulations, and most industries successfully navigate varying state laws. The real issue, they suggest, is accountability avoidance rather than regulatory complexity. The congressional track record underscores the speed difference between state and federal action. Since 2015, Rep. Lieu has introduced 67 bills to the House Science Committee, with only one becoming law. Meanwhile, states have demonstrated they can respond to emerging AI risks within single legislative sessions. FAQs: Understanding the AI Regulation Landscape What are the key state AI laws currently in effect? California’s SB-53 focuses on AI safety, while Texas’s Responsible AI Governance Act prohibits intentional misuse of AI systems. Over 100 AI-related laws have been adopted across 38 states. Which organizations are leading the push against state AI regulation? Leading the Future PAC, backed by Andreessen Horowitz , OpenAI president Greg Brockman , and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale , has raised over $100 million to oppose state-level AI regulation. What federal AI legislation is currently being developed? Rep. Ted Lieu is preparing a comprehensive 200-page AI bill covering consumer protections, while the White House is considering an executive order that would create an AI Litigation Task Force. How does the tech industry view current AI governance efforts? Industry leaders like Craft Ventures co-founder David Sacks advocate for minimal regulation, favoring industry self-regulation to maximize growth and maintain competitiveness with China. What’s the timeline for federal AI legislation? While Rep. Lieu hopes to pass legislation this term, the political divide suggests comprehensive federal AI regulation could take years, leaving states to fill the regulatory gap in the meantime. The Bottom Line: An Unavoidable Confrontation The federal vs state AI regulation battle represents more than just a political dispute—it’s a fundamental question about how America will govern transformative technologies. With billions in economic value and global technological leadership at stake, the outcome of this showdown will determine whether the United States approaches AI governance with cautious oversight or rapid innovation as its guiding principle. The decisions made in the coming months will echo through decades of technological development, making this one of the most critical policy battles of our time.

Dogecoin Faces Price Fluctuation, Eyes Fresh Rally Source: tradingview Dogecoin's price is currently between 13 and 16 cents. It's close to a resistance level at 17 cents, hinting at potential upward movement. However, it has strong support at 11 cents, which could keep it from dropping further. Over the past week, Dogecoin has nudged up by about 2.5%. But the past month was rough, with a dip of over 20%. If Dogecoin breaks past resistance, it might aim for 20 cents, which would mean a potential rise of about 25% from its current level. The market remains watchful to see if Dogecoin can find its momentum once more. Pepe (PEPE) Eyes Potential Gains Amid Volatile Market Moves Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is swinging through a slightly upbeat trend, trading between $0.000003727 and $0.000004822. Despite a rocky month with a drop of over thirty percent, it has managed to climb over seven percent in the past week. This recovery signals hope for some investors. If momentum continues, Pepe could break the nearest resistance around $0.000005485, aiming for even the second level at $0.000006580 - nearly a thirty-three percent jump from its current high. However, if it falters, support at $0.000003295 could catch it. The optimistic Relative Strength Index and current rise suggest that Pepe may have room to grow, but its future remains closely watched. Shiba Inu Eyes Resistance as Bulls Watch for a Breakout Source: tradingview Shiba Inu has been on a rollercoaster, currently trading between seven-thousandths and nine-thousandths of a cent. The coin is seeing upward pressure, with recent gains over the past week. It aims to break through the nearest resistance at almost a hundredth of a cent, which could mark a new upward trend. If it surpasses this resistance, it may target another level around one and a half hundredths of a cent, implying potential growth of over 25% from the current peak price range. However, the price is still down compared to six months ago, showing room for recovery. The markets are watching closely as interest in the coin remains high.

55053263,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=869666,1764344117,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55053263.jpeg,Apple says its Ads and Maps services are too small to be gatekeepers under EU rules,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-resists-eu-gatekeeper-move/,"Apple has formally contested moves by the European Commission, which is considering classifying its Apple Ads and Apple Maps services as “gatekeepers” under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This designation would subject them to far stricter regulation. The Commission will review the tech firm’s own filings for up to 45 working days before deciding whether either service will be designated a gatekeeper. If so, the firm would have six months to bring the services into compliance. The EU is checking Apple’s Ads and Maps services for gatekeeper rules The European Union utilizes the Digital Markets Act to identify companies that act as gatekeepers, controlling essential digital services and potentially blocking smaller businesses or limiting user options. A company must have over 45 million active users each month in the EU and be worth over €75 billion for the DMA to classify it as a gatekeeper. The DMA requires gatekeepers to follow strict rules that make it easier for users to switch between services, protect and use people’s data fairly, and give smaller companies fair access to digital tools. The Act ensures that some of the biggest tech companies cannot dictate the apps, services, or tools people use simply because they are dominant. The European Commission stated that Apple’s own filings indicate that its Ads and Maps services are large and influential enough to impact competition and limit user and business choices, thus making them gatekeepers. The Commission will review Apple’s own filings for up to 45 days to determine whether the two services could unfairly control access to important tools or limit the ability of other companies to reach customers. Apple’s App Store, iOS, and Safari already have gatekeeper status under the DMA, so adding its Ads and Maps services to the list will force the company to make big changes to its services. The changes will also affect developers who build apps for Apple’s platforms, as well as competitors who rely on its advertising or mapping services, and users who depend on these services for their daily tasks. Apple says Ads and Maps are too small and should not follow gatekeeper rules Despite meeting the numeric thresholds, Apple argues that neither service is dominant enough to justify the gatekeeper label. The tech firm stated that the EU had misinterpreted the numbers and was giving an incorrect impression about the significance and importance of these services. The company explained that Apple Ads occupies a very small share of the advertising market compared with bigger companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, TikTok, and X. The tech company stated that the market is dominated by large competitors with greater control, so simply examining the total number of users or impressions will not reveal the full picture. The tech giant argued that treating Apple Ads as a gatekeeper will make it really difficult for the company to improve its services and offer tools that work best for everyone. Apple also said Apple Maps has fewer users than Google Maps and Waze, which people use every day for directions, navigation, travelling, and finding local businesses. Many people in Europe prefer to choose other mapping apps, so the firm said the DMA is intended for services with a broader impact, a significant market share, and the ability to block other companies. The iPhone maker said it will continue to defend itself while the European Commission reviews Ads and Maps over the coming weeks. The company will provide additional evidence, explanations, and context to demonstrate why its services don’t meet the requirements set by the DMA. The situation highlights how the law is now targeting the goods and services of tech companies that have a significant influence on the market, but were previously overlooked. This debate over Ads and Maps will also influence how the EU applies the DMA to other services in the future.

Large-scale accumulation often sparks speculation about potential price reactions, especially when it comes from an active player in the mining sector. While the purchase signals confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects, it also raises a practical question for traders: can a single acquisition of this size influence short-term market dynamics? This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto-native PR agency that uses data, current trends, and market timing to help Web3 projects make the most of every moment. Ethereum Eyes Growth Potential Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Ethereum is showing signs of growth after a dip, with its current price sitting between the mid-two thousands and just over three thousand dollars. The price has risen by about eight percent over the past week, suggesting potential for further upward movement. If it rises beyond the current resistance level of nearly thirty-five hundred, it might climb towards the second resistance level of just over four thousand dollars. This could mean a significant jump of around 30% from its current position. While Ethereum’s price has fallen over twenty percent in the past month, it has grown by over twenty percent in the last six months, hinting at a possible rebound.

The ACH could reach a maximum of $0.1023 and an average of $0.0867 by the end of 2029. Alchemy Pay price prediction for 2031 projects a maximum price of $0.2675.

Can Alchemy Pay (ACH) get to $0.1? Will Alchemy Pay hit $1? Let’s find out in this ACH price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Alchemy Pay Token ACH Price $0.01006 Market Cap $97.34M Trading Volume (24-hour) $13.07M Circulating Supply 10 Billion ACH All-time High $0.1975 Aug 06, 2021 All-time Low $0.001338 Jul 20, 2021 24-h High $0.01015 24-h Low $0.009481 Alchemy Pay price prediction: Technical analysis Price Prediction $ 0.009397 (-5.05%) Price Volatility 8.27% (High) 50-Day SMA $ 0.01358 14-Day RSI 35.65 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 11 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $ 0.02022 Alchemy Pay price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Alchemy Pay remains in a clear downtrend with price staying below key moving averages and momentum indicators showing persistent weakness Support near $0.009 continues to be tested while sellers dominate and volatility remains elevated A recovery requires stronger volume and a break above the mid-Bollinger levels to confirm any shift in trend ACH/USD 1-day chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView The 1-day chart for Alchemy Pay on November 20 shows a long-term downward trend. The price is trading close to $0.0099 and keeps rejecting the mid-Bollinger band. The candles are still below the 50-day moving average, which adds to the bearish momentum. The lower Bollinger band is getting flatter, which means that sellers are losing strength but still controlling the direction. RSI at 33 shows that the market is oversold, which means that a bounce could happen, but it is not certain. If bulls protect the $0.0094–$0.0090 support zone, ACH may try to bounce back up to $0.0110 in the short term. If support isn’t held, though, the price could keep going down to new monthly lows. The overall trend is still bearish until a strong breakout happens. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView ACH continues to trend downward on the 4-hour chart, with price respecting the descending Bollinger midline as dynamic resistance. The candles sit near the lower band, showing persistent selling pressure and weak demand. MACD remains bearish and below the signal line, indicating momentum favors further downside. The Balance of Power is negative, reinforcing seller dominance. Unless ACH reclaims the mid-band around $0.0105 and confirms support, the trend is likely to continue drifting lower. Immediate support lies near $0.0097–$0.0094. A short-term bounce is possible, but the overall structure remains bearish until stronger volume returns. Alchemy Pay technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.01369 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.01256 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.01226 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.01201 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.01358 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.01680 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.02022 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.01205 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.01327 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.01542 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.01768 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.01961 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.02082 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.02220 SELL Alchemy Pay price analysis conclusion Alchemy Pay is still clearly bearish, as both the 1-day and 4-hour charts show lower lows that keep happening, weak momentum, and a failure to reclaim key moving averages. The price is still below the middle of the Bollinger band, which means that sellers are in charge. The RSI is close to the oversold level, which means that demand is weakening but that short-term relief bounces may also happen. The MACD momentum is still negative on both timeframes, which means that there hasn’t been a significant trend change yet. ACH needs to get back above the $0.011–$0.012 resistance zone with a lot of volume; otherwise, the risk of going down to $0.009 and maybe even $0.008 stays. To change the trend, bulls need a breakout and higher lows that last. Is Alchemy Pay a good investment? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows mixed signals as an investment. While the current bearish trend and volatility indicate short-term challenges, the solid market capitalization and consistent support levels suggest long-term potential. However, risk-averse investors may prefer to wait for clearer bullish signs or reduced volatility before considering investing in ACH. Why is ACH down today? ACH is down today mainly because the charts show persistent bearish momentum and weak buying pressure. On both the 1-day and 4-hour timeframes, price continues drifting below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, confirming a sustained downtrend. The Bollinger Bands are sloping downward, and ACH is repeatedly testing the lower band without strong rebounds, indicating sellers remain in control. The RSI stays in the low-mid 30s, reflecting weak demand and no clear bullish reversal signals. The MACD remains below the signal line on both charts, showing negative momentum. Overall, ACH’s decline is driven by technical weakness, low volume, and continued downward pressure. Will ACH recover? ACH may recover if bulls regain control and maintain support above critical levels. While the current outlook remains bearish, a breakout above short-term resistance levels and consistent buying activity could reverse the negative momentum and lead to a potential recovery in the market. Will ACH reach $0.05? ACH is expected to trade above the $0.0497 range throughout 2027, suggesting potential for significant price appreciation compared to earlier years. Will ACH reach $0.1? The price forecasts indicate that ACH could reach a maximum of $0.1023 by 2029. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend. Will ACH reach $1? The predictions for 2034 show an ACH maximum price of $1. While this indicates significant growth potential, ACH is likely to reach $1 soon. Does ACH have a good long-term future? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows a generally positive long-term outlook, with projected steady price growth over the years. By 2030, ACH’s market cap is expected to increase substantially, indicating a good long-term future with moderate to strong growth potential.

At this point, the weekly RLUSD transfer volume of Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin released by Ripple, on the Ethereum (ETH) network has exceeded $1 billion. According to data from on-chain analytics firm Token Terminal, RLUSD's volume on Ethereum (ETH) has surpassed $1 billion as of today. This comes a year after Ripple launched RLUSD at the end of last year. “The fact that a stablecoin has maintained its supply less than a year after its launch suggests that RLUSD is providing stable usage.” The analytics firm, which noted that the number of RLUSD holders is approximately 6,000, has increased eightfold since the beginning of the year. “The fact that the increase in the number of holders is keeping pace with the increase in supply means that the supply is not concentrated in a few addresses but is distributed,” Token Terminal said. As you may recall, Ripple USD (RLUSD) reached a significant milestone by surpassing the $1 billion market capitalization less than a year after its launch in early November.

This substantial Bitmain wallet transaction represents one of the largest institutional moves in recent months and could signal significant market shifts ahead. What Does This Massive Bitmain Wallet Transaction Mean? The reported transaction involves 20,532 ETH transferred from BitGo to the suspected Bitmain wallet. This substantial movement caught the attention of blockchain analytics firm Onchain-Lenz, who identified the pattern. The timing and scale of this Bitmain wallet activity suggest strategic positioning in the Ethereum market. Such large-scale acquisitions typically indicate institutional confidence in Ethereum’s future. When major players like Bitmain make moves of this magnitude, it often precedes broader market trends. The Bitmain wallet transaction represents not just a financial investment but a vote of confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Bitmain Wallet Move? This Bitmain wallet activity matters for several key reasons: Market sentiment indicator – Large acquisitions often signal institutional bullishness Price impact potential – Such volumes can influence Ethereum’s market price Industry trends – Bitmain’s moves often reflect broader mining industry strategies Adoption signals – Major players accumulating ETH suggests growing utility acceptance The Bitmain wallet transaction timing is particularly interesting given current market conditions. With Ethereum undergoing significant upgrades and institutional adoption increasing, this move could indicate strategic positioning for future developments. How Does This Bitmain Wallet Activity Affect Ethereum’s Future? When a company of Bitmain’s stature makes such a substantial Ethereum acquisition, it typically validates the asset’s long-term potential. This Bitmain wallet movement suggests several possible scenarios: First, it could indicate Bitmain’s expanding beyond Bitcoin mining operations. Second, it might signal preparation for Ethereum’s continued ecosystem growth. Third, this Bitmain wallet activity could represent diversification of corporate treasury assets. The transaction’s sheer size – $62.8 million – demonstrates serious commitment. Unlike retail investors, institutional moves of this scale involve extensive due diligence and strategic planning. This Bitmain wallet acquisition therefore carries significant weight in market analysis. What Can We Learn From This Bitmain Wallet Transaction? This development offers valuable insights for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. The Bitmain wallet activity reminds us that major industry players continue to accumulate substantial positions in leading cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the choice of Ethereum specifically suggests confidence in its technological roadmap and adoption trajectory.

This development underscores the continuing institutional interest in Ethereum and suggests potential market direction. As one of the cryptocurrency industry’s most established companies, Bitmain’s moves warrant close attention from all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions How was the Bitmain wallet identified? Blockchain analytics firm Onchain-Lenz identified the transaction patterns and wallet characteristics that suggested Bitmain ownership, though wallet ownership cannot be definitively proven without official confirmation. Why would Bitmain acquire so much Ethereum? Bitmain might be diversifying its assets, preparing for Ethereum-based services, or making a strategic investment based on positive market outlook. Does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large acquisitions can influence market sentiment and potentially impact price, though multiple factors determine cryptocurrency valuations. How common are transactions of this size? While large institutional transactions occur regularly, $62.8 million moves from identified industry leaders are significant and relatively uncommon. What does this mean for Bitcoin given Bitmain’s mining focus? This suggests Bitmain may be diversifying beyond Bitcoin-focused operations, acknowledging Ethereum’s growing importance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Should individual investors follow this strategy? While institutional moves provide valuable market insights, individual investment decisions should align with personal risk tolerance and financial goals. Found this analysis insightful?

Despite the mixer’s checks, the hacker addresses were not flagged, and the transactions were allowed to continue. On-chain analysis showed addresses linked to the Upbit hack used the Railgun mixer. The mixer performs a zero-knowledge check for the origin of funds. This time, however, the check did not prevent the funds from being mixed. Upbit was hacked for over $36M , with over $30M in Solana assets. The multi-chain attack led to immediate swaps and movements of funds between wallets. The hacker sold most assets almost immediately, especially Solana-based tokens. On-chain investigator @dethective noted the selling had an effect on decentralized market volumes. The day after the hack, the exploiter’s wallets swapped Solana tokens into SOL. After that, the SOL was traded for USDC, and the stablecoins were bridged to Ethereum for mixing. In total, the hacker held over 533 ETH after fees, valued at around $1.6M. The shift to Ethereum and subsequent mixing is a pattern usually ascribed to North Korean hackers. Upbit also added new information on its hack. According to a statement from the exchange, the exploit may be due to a flaw in the exchange’s internal system, which has been patched. Upbit stated that the hacker may have inferred private keys from publicly available hot wallets due to predictable key hashing and weak cryptography. Railgun lacked the latest information on the hackers’ wallets Railgun’s approach is to test each user’s wallets against constantly updated databases for bad actors. In this case, the hacker’s full list of addresses was very recent. Additionally, the exploit went through multiple direct DEX swaps and some of the funds were shifted to new wallets. The data available to Railgun was therefore outdated, and the hacker’s latest wallet passed the test. The last intercepted wallet laundered a total of 410 ETH . The new address was created just hours after the hack, and briefly used as an intermediary. The rapid change in wallets additionally avoided Railgun’s filters. Railgun used for DeFi activity Railgun gained popularity during the recent revival of the privacy narrative. Railgun grew its asset pool, with $95M in value locked as of November 2025. The increased value signals a growing interest, as the mixer achieved $1.31M in fees for Q3. The usage of mixers grew in the past year. Tornado Cash, previously seeing only baseline activity, increased its value locked to a new peak. The mixer holds over 32K ETH, following multiple high-profile exploits. Tornado Cash posted a record number of ETH in its reserves after an increased demand for privacy. | Source: Dune Analytics The native RAIL token also rose by over 200% for the past three months, trading at $3.26 . Railgun reflected the success of ZCash and other privacy tokens, while also being promoted by Vitalik Buterin. Railgun is not a go-to tool for hackers and exploiters. Rather, it has been a general privacy tool for regular transactions. Crypto influencers and high-profile individuals aim for privacy, as even transaction data can lead to tracking or even price swings. However, Railgun usage can also be tracked. Additionally, hacker addresses can use tools to test which wallets would be flagged by Railgun. This would allow hackers to keep hiding the proceeds of exploits, most of which are untraceable.

According to the CME FedWatch indicator, the probability of a rate cut by 25 bps now exceeds 67%. As the stability of Bitcoin improves, market participants are eagerly scouring the cryptocurrency news headlines for the promising opportunities for high growth. Such developments have resulted in the flow of investment resources towards the DeFi projects that are in the nascent stage but possess immense utility like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Powell & the Rate Cut According to Barclays Research, despite the obvious split within the Federal Reserve ranks, Powell is expected to guide the body towards cutting rates in December. Federal Reserve members Bowman & Waller seem to favor the cut, while some members like St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem think the body should maintain its steady approach. Of course, the whole uncertainty has been damped by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s dismissal of recession fears & observation that inflation on imported goods is also flat. Such macrotrend developments have been big tailwind contributors for the crypto market. Analysts suggest that the recent recovery from the low levels of $81,000 in Bitcoin indicates the confidence of the buyers. There are also expectations for some sort of market consolidation before reaching the $90,000-$96,000 mark. Smart money is also entering projects that maintain good fundamentals in the market in search of the next big crypto breakout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Experiences Enormous Presale Rise Amid the mergers of major assets, one of the notable candidates for the best crypto to buy at present is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This project has cultivated considerable momentum by securing a cumulative amount of $19,020,000 from the presale that began. Present data indicate that Phase 6 is already 95% sold out. This presents a soon-to-fade opportunity for participants to accumulate the tokens during the reduced rate of $0.035 per token. Later on in Phase 7, the rate will increase by 20% to $0.040 per token. Early adopters are already experiencing a 250%+ increase in value from the initial offering. Not only that, considering the publicly verified listing price of $0.06, new buyers are poised for an immediate potential return of 300% to 500% on their investment. Additionally, the cumulative holder numbers now stand at 18,250. Accessibility & Community Rewards Additionally, the project is rewarding its loyal members. To mark the presale achievements, the project is awarding a total of $100,000 in the form of MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners, with each winner receiving $10,000. Notably, the project’s team has recently improved its purchase system in order to boost the adoption rate. The team allows customers to buy the MUTM token directly using their cards. To increase engagement, the platform also supports the 24-Hour Leaderboard system. Each daily accumulation will be tracked. Additionally, the top-ranking user will earn a $500 MUTM reward each day. However, the individual must make at least one transaction. The leaderboard also resets every 00:00 UTC. Of course, the project values security. It is undergoing an independent audit by Halborn Security concerning its lending contracts. Positioning for Future Gains While the broader market looks forward to the expected infusion of liquidity through impending rate cuts by the Fed, Mutuum Finance presents a very attractive entry mechanism for those seeking high-return investments. Not only is the presale phase nearing sell-out levels, but the impending price hikes too make the crypto’s projection for the future very positive. Trading players seeking the best cryptocurrency to buy today are very aggressively locking in their positions for the supply in Phase 6.

What began as a strong opening for the new GDOG fund quickly faded as inflows collapsed in dramatic fashion. The launch was expected to give Dogecoin a meaningful boost by opening the door for fresh institutional participation. Instead, the opposite has happened, and the Dogecoin ETF has seen its inflows collapse by 80%. Spot Dogecoin ETF Just Suffered An 80% Crash In Inflows The launch of Grayscale Investments’ first-ever spot Dogecoin ETF under the ticker GDOG was hailed as a monumental moment, the first time Dogecoin would be accessible to everyday investors through a traditional brokerage. On November 24, 2025, the product went live on the NYSE Arca, converting Grayscale’s existing DOGE trust into a publicly traded ETF. Related Reading: Pundit Shares XRP Fact That Will ‘Blow Your Mind’ However, just 48 hours after launch, the excitement appears to have cooled down. Although the first day reportedly pulled in roughly $1.8 million in inflows, the second day saw only about $365,420, a collapse of about 80% in early momentum. This has pushed the cumulative net inflows to around $2.16 million, but this is a modest figure for what many expected would be a major catalyst for Dogecoin. Expectations for GDOG were high. Observers pointed to prior early inflow successes with crypto ETFs, notably those for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more recently Solana, which collectively helped push capital inflows at a large scale. To put this into comparison, Spot Solana ETFs, which first went live on October 18, raked in $117.39 million in inflows in the first two days of trading. The recently launched Spot XRP ETFs also saw inflows of $243.05 million on their first day of trading. According to data from SoSoValue, Dogecoin ETF trading volume for the first day was just $1.41 million, far below many projections. The momentum faded even faster on day two, with volume falling by roughly 78% to $397,620. What It Means for DOGE And The Meme-Coin Space The soft start of GDOG raises questions about whether meme coins like DOGE can truly thrive under traditional financial frameworks. On one hand, the ETF listing is a milestone: a token born as a joke is now trading alongside traditional assets on major exchanges. On the other, the weak capital flows hint at limits to demand among institutional investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dead Cat Bounce: Analyst Reveals What To Expect As Price Recovers However, it is still too early to conclude. The long-term relevance of DOGE ETFs can only be judged once the market has had time to digest these new products. A successful DOGE ETF could open the door to other meme-coin funds (some suggest even an ETF for Shiba Inu may follow). In addition to Grayscale, other asset managers have Spot Dogecoin ETFs lined up and ready to hit the market. Bitwise launched its Dogecoin ETF on Wednesday following Grayscale’s debut, but early inflow numbers are yet to come in.

55053485,635957,1764345634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55053485.jpeg,Silent XRP Run Hits Binance Just As US Spot ETFs Ignite New Demand,https://bitcoinist.com/silent-xrp-run-hits-binance-new-demand/,"XRP reserves on Binance have quietly fallen to near-record lows just as the first US spot ETFs begin trading, on-chain data from CryptoQuant and analysis by Darkfost show. Binance’s XRP Exchange Reserves Drop Sharply A CryptoQuant chart of “Exchange Reserve – Binance” plots the exchange’s holdings sliding from a little above 3 billion XRP in early October to roughly 2.7 billion tokens by November 24. The line starts around 2.925 billion tokens in mid-August, climbs toward 3 billion through September and early October, then reverses into a near-continuous downtrend. Darkfost distills the move bluntly: “XRP Reserves on Binance are plummeting.” Since October 6, “roughly 300 million XRP have left Binance,” the analyst notes, describing the setup as “BULLISH.” The timing overlaps with a structural shift in market access. “The XRP ecosystem has been particularly active in recent weeks, especially with the arrival of the first spot ETFs (US),” Darkfost writes. “ Canary Capital paved the way on November 13, quickly followed by Franklin Templeton, Bitwise or Grayscale.” In their view, “in just a few days, XRP moved from a standard crypto asset to a product now accessible through multiple institutional vehicles, which could clearly shifts its dynamic.” What makes the Binance data notable is the persistence of the outflows. The CryptoQuant series shows no single spike dominating the pattern; instead, reserves step down week after week from slightly above 3 billion tokens to the 2.7 billion area. According to Darkfost, “since October, the exchange’s reserves have been steadily decreasing.” The analyst acknowledges that some of the movements might be operational rather than investor-driven. “Even if a small portion of these movements may be linked to internal reorganizations, the overall trend is far too consistent to ignore,” Darkfost writes. In other words, while exchange wallet reshuffling can distort short-term readings, the multi-week decline suggests a more fundamental repositioning. What This Means For XRP Price Darkfost interprets the behavior as a sign of growing, conviction-driven demand: “Day after day, the decline continues and this is generally seen as a positive signal. It indicates that real demand is building, with investors withdrawing their XRP from Binance to hold them in private wallets. And this behavior is never insignificant.” The implication is that coins are moving from readily tradable balances into longer-term storage. “When an asset is withdrawn from exchanges on a large scale, it often reflects a long term holding intention,” Darkfost adds. With fewer tokens parked on trading platforms, any increase in demand can have a more pronounced impact on market depth and order books. That matters precisely because the token’s investor base is no longer limited to direct spot buyers on exchanges. Darkfost argues that “fewer tokens available on trading platforms combined with growing institutional demand create a potentially powerful setup.” In their conclusion, the current trajectory could mark the start of a different market regime: “If this trend continues, XRP could move into a more structured phase with an expanding institutional interest.” For now, the numbers are straightforward. Binance’s reserves, as tracked by CryptoQuant, have fallen by about 300 million tokens since October 6 to roughly 2.7 billion. The outflows have been steady rather than spectacular, but in the context of newly launched US spot ETFs, they could amount to a silent run on exchange balances that will reshape how the token trades in the months ahead.

November was rough for Cardano’s open interest. It hit around 580 million dollars on November 5, marking its worst period since 2024 when ADA was trading under 0.33. Even with prices drifting downward, open interest has been rising, which typically indicates that traders are positioning aggressively despite the decline. Source: Cardano Futures Open Interest / Coinglass The steady decline over the past few weeks has triggered constant liquidations, forcing traders to either double down or reset their strategies. Still, several analysts point out that ADA has been holding the 0.40 support extremely well. They see that zone as a strong base that could fuel a sharp move upward if sentiment flips. Cardano Price Prediction: Holding $0.40 Could Be The Key For Doubling Your Money Source: ADAUSD / TradingView Market watcher MMB Trader pointed out that Cardano is finally showing some real strength around the 0.40 support. Despite trading under a multi-year descending trendline and getting rejected near the 1.02 level back in August, ADA has managed to hold that 0.40 zone, which he sees as a solid accumulation area if the market flips bullish. He expects that if momentum picks up from here, the first major target would be a move back toward the descending trendline around 0.819. Earlier, that target meant a full 100% rally, but with the recent bounce, it now sits closer to an 88% upside. Crypto analyst Eilert is backing the bullish case too. He pointed out that Cardano just printed its second monthly Wyckoff Spring ever, which is a big accumulation signal. The last time this pattern appeared, ADA faked a breakdown and then exploded from $0.0177 to $3.10, a wild 175x move. Obviously, it will not repeat that kind of run now, but the setup looks very similar. On top of that, Charles Hoskinson seems more energized than ever. He said , “Cardano is going to enter 2026 with a game plan to not only be a great chain, an exceptional chain, but the most reliable distributed system humanity has ever built.” He has also said before that 2026 will be a big year for crypto and even predicted that Bitcoin could hit $250,000. If he ends up being right about the market, there is a chance he can deliver something strong for Cardano, too. If Cardano Might 2x, Bitcoin Hyper Might Have Room for a 10x With Cardano fighting to hold the 0.40 support and the entire market chopping traders to pieces, investors are starting to rotate into projects that can still grow while major layer 1s struggle. Bitcoin Hyper is quickly becoming one of the clearest standouts in that category. Bitcoin Hyper is building a fast Bitcoin Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine, giving it Solana-level speed and near-zero fees while still settling back to Bitcoin for real security. ‘ It is the exact hybrid setup people want right now as the market shifts toward efficiency and safer long-term ecosystems. And the numbers make the story even stronger. The presale has already raised more than $28.6 million, which is impressive during a volatile market where most projects struggle to attract investments. Early whales keep stacking positions, and staking rewards sit at a stable 40% APY , making it one of the strongest yield opportunities in the Bitcoin ecosystem right now.

Avail , a modular blockchain infrastructure provider building the foundations for the next generation of applications and appchains, announces the launch of Avail Nexus Mainnet , its breakthrough crosschain solution that unifies liquidity and user flows across major ecosystems, including Ethereum, TRON, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, HyperEVM, BNB, Scroll, Monad, Kaia, Solana (coming soon), and others. The launch marks the first time Web3 has access to a coordinated, liquidity-aware crosschain network, bringing Avail’s long-stated vision of a connected onchain world into production. For users and developers, this unlocks something the industry has attempted for years but never achieved at scale: a single operational universe where applications and assets work across chains without fragmentation, friction, or duplicated effort. A Major Shift in How the Onchain Economy Works “The current blockchain fragmentation and siloed interactions across ecosystems have limited both the builder and user experience,” said Anurag Arjun, Co-Founder of Avail. “At Avail, we are transforming how blockchains interact. They can no longer be separate networks passing messages to each other; rather should function as integral parts of a unified, verifiable system where assets, users, and intended actions move freely. This fundamental shift, in how apps scale and modular stacks connect to the broader multichain world, is the future.” Until now, crosschain has meant risky bridges, limited access, and fragmented liquidity across chains. Avail Nexus takes a different approach: An Intent–solver architecture allows users to express what they want to do; Avail Nexus determines how to do it, automatically finding the optimal route, liquidity source, and execution path. Multi-source liquidity allows a single transaction to draw funds from multiple chains simultaneously. Exact-Out execution ensures predictable outcomes regardless of where liquidity lives. Unified verification, coming soon, powered by Avail DA, for cross-chain actions backed by verifiable data. This moves the blockchain environment from its current “moving messages between chains” to shared execution and shared liquidity; a fundamental upgrade in how the onchain economy functions. User Experience Changes with Avail Nexus Users gain for the first time A single experience across ecosystems (no bridging UX, no gas token hassles). Better prices and deeper liquidity through cross-chain aggregation. Faster, predictable execution coordinated across chains. Access to apps regardless of where they are deployed. “This is a usability shift toward making Web3 for the real users of the next generation of consumer apps”, highlights Anurag Arjun, Co-founder of Avail. Updates for Developers Developers can integrate Nexus through SDKs , APIs, or lightweight Elements , enabling: One-time integration to unlock a multichain userbase Unified collateral pools that update across chains in real time Intent-based trading and strategy execution Cross-chain actions without managing bridges, routers, or complex infra. This reduces the cost, time, and complexity of building multichain applications by an order of magnitude. And bolstered by Avail’s proven data availability expertise, the overall operational and functional experience remains robust, verifiable, and scalable. Avail DA, with its industry-defining Infinity Blocks roadmap targeting 10-GB block capacity , is soon set to enable builders to spin up independent appchains with massive throughput and finality while remaining connected to the broader ecosystem with verifiable cross-chain data. The $AVAIL token serves as the coordination asset and economic backbone for this unified onchain world. “For builders, the complexity of cross-chain execution at scale has always been a major challenge. With Avail, that complexity disappears. Builders can focus on application logic while the infrastructure handles liquidity routing, verification, and execution under the hood, enabling truly composable and highly scalable apps and appchains. The overall result will be a smoother, more capital-efficient user experience where liquidity and execution no longer belong to individual blockchain environments; rather, they become network-wide resources”, explains Prabal Banerjee, Co-Founder of Avail. Current Ecosystem Growth Avail Nexus is launching with integrations live or underway across DeFi, infrastructure, SocialFi, AI, and cross-chain tooling. Ecosystem partners and projects, including Lens Protocol, Sophon, TRON, Space & Time, Lumia, Validium Network, Vanna Finance, Mace, Clober, Station X, Nexus AI, Bitte.ai, Neova, Gummee, Symbiotic, and more, are enabling powerful new use cases. Many integrations unlock use cases that were previously impossible or highly fragmented across chains, including unified collateral management for DeFi protocols, intent-based trading with execution across multiple liquidity venues, intelligent coordination layers for cross-chain data-driven actions, and multi-chain liquidity aggregation that allows assets on one chain to power opportunities on another. Availability and Next Steps With Nexus Mainnet now live: Developers can integrate through the Nexus SDK . Users will soon explore the first wave of Liquid Apps , applications going live on Avail Nexus, showcasing unified liquidity and opportunities at scale. Additional chain integrations and ecosystem expansions will roll out progressively.

Together, the on-chain fund launch and bullish ETH/BTC structure show both institutions and charts leaning toward Ethereum at the same time. Amundi Puts Euro Cash Fund Shares on Ethereum Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, has launched its first tokenized share class of a euro money-market fund on the Ethereum blockchain, marking one of the highest-profile on-chain fund moves so far in the region. The product uses the AMUNDI FUNDS CASH EUR money-market fund and went live with its first on-chain transaction on Nov. 4, 2025. The new “J28 EUR DLT” share class records fund units and transactions directly on Ethereum while the underlying UCITS fund structure, euro-denominated assets and NAV calculations stay inside Amundi’s existing regulated framework. Subscriptions, redemptions and ownership records run through smart contracts and a tokenization stack built with European asset-servicing group CACEIS, which also provides investor wallets and digital order routing. Ethereum serves as the settlement and registry layer for this share class, giving distributors and institutional clients a blockchain-based option alongside traditional channels. Amundi and CACEIS say the hybrid setup is designed to streamline order processing, improve traceability of units on-chain and support around-the-clock execution as rules and market plumbing catch up with tokenized fund operations. The launch places Amundi in a growing field of global managers bringing money-market and cash products onto public networks such as Ethereum, after earlier tokenized fund initiatives from Franklin Templeton, UBS Asset Management and BlackRock. Industry data shows tokenized money-market and treasury products have climbed into the multi-billion-dollar range in 2025, underscoring how Ethereum is becoming a key venue for institutional fund tokenization. Ethereum Builds Range as Break Hints Higher Meanwhile, Ethereum trades inside a falling channel after a 144% historical swing highlighted on the chart, followed by a long correction from March 2025 highs. The 3-day candles compress near multi-month horizontal support between 0.03237 BTC and 0.02601 BTC, showing a defined institutional band viewed as downside exhaustion areas. ETH/BTC 3-Day Chart. Source: CryptoMichNL On the chart, the indicator panel above shows RSI sliding from the 60-plus zone into lower levels, reflecting weaker momentum during the downtrend. Because price recently bounced, ETH holds above the rising 50-period EMA, which curves upward near 0.027 on the vertical axis, acting as dynamic short-term support. Then, analyst CryptoMichNL posted that “ETH looks primed for the next leg upwards.” After that, the 3-day chart showed higher lows forming during consolidation. It also captured a break above the falling resistance line that capped earlier rallies. As a result, the pattern signals potential continuation on higher timeframes. However, resistance remains near the upper boundary of the recent channel around 0.03315 BTC. If ETH fully clears that zone, the next liquidity pockets on the chart align toward prior swing highs, where sellers previously stepped in.

A prominent voice in the scene, Oscar Ramos, recently declared that while Bitcoin’s bull market is unfolding, the real surge for altcoins is yet to begin. This statement, spotlighted by Angry Crypto Show on X, has reignited hopes for a major broad‑market crypto breakout. Shifting Market Dynamics Recent data from November 2025 shows a drop in Bitcoin’s market dominance (BTC.D) from over 61% to about 58.8%. Historically, such declines often precede periods when capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins. Investors and analysts view this rotation as a foundational condition for a sustained altcoin rally. Supporting that view, research from Q3 2025 by major crypto‑market trackers indicates that altcoins began capturing a larger share of overall market capitalization. A rising share of altcoins suggests renewed investor appetite—not just for Bitcoin, but for high‑potential tokens like XRP, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and Cardano (ADA). JUST IN: XRP Enthusiast Oscar Ramos, with over 165,000 Subscribers on YouTube, says ""I have seen the bull market for Bitcoin, but altcoins? XRP, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Cardano—altcoins haven't even started."" pic.twitter.com/w5fmTGtie1 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 27, 2025 At the same time, many altcoins remain significantly below their cycle highs. That leaves room for upside if the market turns bullish. For tokens like XRP that already enjoy strong community backing and real‑world adoption narratives, the potential rewards could be substantial. What Must Happen for the Altcoin Rally to Materialize Still, the path ahead is not guaranteed. For a full‑scale altcoin bull market, several factors must align. First, capital must continue rotating away from Bitcoin — sustained dominance decline is a key signal. Second, macroeconomic conditions must stay favorable. Institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and liquidity inflows are crucial drivers for broader crypto adoption. Without those, even promising altcoins may struggle to break out. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Third, within the altcoin space, performance could remain uneven. While large‑caps tend to lead any rally, smaller or under‑capitalized tokens often suffer from higher volatility and risk. Investors will need to be selective and maintain risk discipline. Why Oscar Ramos’s Call Is Resonating Now Oscar Ramos’s bold message echoes a sentiment growing among crypto analysts: the “easy money” may still lie ahead. Given the current rotation in dominance, rising altcoin market share, and still‑favorable valuation levels, his forecast has a credible foundation. The fact that this view comes from an influencer with a large, engaged audience helps amplify its impact across the community. His thesis also provides a counterpoint to narratives that suggest Bitcoin’s rally is the climax of the cycle. Instead, Ramos frames the Bitcoin run as just the beginning — the first act of a broader performance that has yet to unfold. A Cautious but Bullish Outlook If market conditions remain supportive, 2026 could open a new chapter for altcoins. For investors in XRP, ETH, SOL, BNB, ADA, and others, this could be the time to position for gains. Still, risk remains: volatility, macro headwinds, and selective performance among altcoins all pose potential obstacles. Ramos’s view does not guarantee a smooth ride, but it offers a compelling roadmap: Bitcoin leads the way — and altcoins may still be getting ready for their breakout.

Avail , a modular blockchain infrastructure provider building the foundations for the next generation of applications and appchains, announces the launch of Avail Nexus Mainnet , its breakthrough crosschain solution that unifies liquidity and user flows across major ecosystems, including Ethereum, TRON, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, HyperEVM, BNB, Scroll, Monad, Kaia, Solana (coming soon), and others. The launch marks the first time Web3 has access to a coordinated, liquidity-aware crosschain network, bringing Avail’s long-stated vision of a connected onchain world into production. For users and developers, this unlocks something the industry has attempted for years but never achieved at scale: a single operational universe where applications and assets work across chains without fragmentation, friction, or duplicated effort. A Major Shift in How the Onchain Economy Works “The current blockchain fragmentation and siloed interactions across ecosystems have limited both the builder and user experience,” said Anurag Arjun, Co-Founder of Avail. “At Avail, we are transforming how blockchains interact. They can no longer be separate networks passing messages to each other; rather should function as integral parts of a unified, verifiable system where assets, users, and intended actions move freely. This fundamental shift, in how apps scale and modular stacks connect to the broader multichain world, is the future.” Until now, crosschain has meant risky bridges, limited access, and fragmented liquidity across chains. Avail Nexus takes a different approach: An Intent–solver architecture allows users to express what they want to do; Avail Nexus determines how to do it, automatically finding the optimal route, liquidity source, and execution path. Multi-source liquidity allows a single transaction to draw funds from multiple chains simultaneously. Exact-Out execution ensures predictable outcomes regardless of where liquidity lives. Unified verification, coming soon, powered by Avail DA, for cross-chain actions backed by verifiable data. This moves the blockchain environment from its current “moving messages between chains” to shared execution and shared liquidity; a fundamental upgrade in how the onchain economy functions. User Experience Changes with Avail Nexus Users gain for the first time A single experience across ecosystems (no bridging UX, no gas token hassles). Better prices and deeper liquidity through cross-chain aggregation. Faster, predictable execution coordinated across chains. Access to apps regardless of where they are deployed. “This is a usability shift toward making Web3 for the real users of the next generation of consumer apps”, highlights Anurag Arjun, Co-founder of Avail. Updates for Developers Developers can integrate Nexus through SDKs , APIs, or lightweight Elements , enabling: One-time integration to unlock a multichain userbase Unified collateral pools that update across chains in real time Intent-based trading and strategy execution Cross-chain actions without managing bridges, routers, or complex infra. This reduces the cost, time, and complexity of building multichain applications by an order of magnitude. And bolstered by Avail’s proven data availability expertise, the overall operational and functional experience remains robust, verifiable, and scalable. Avail DA, with its industry-defining Infinity Blocks roadmap targeting 10-GB block capacity , is soon set to enable builders to spin up independent appchains with massive throughput and finality while remaining connected to the broader ecosystem with verifiable cross-chain data. The $AVAIL token serves as the coordination asset and economic backbone for this unified onchain world. “For builders, the complexity of cross-chain execution at scale has always been a major challenge. With Avail, that complexity disappears. Builders can focus on application logic while the infrastructure handles liquidity routing, verification, and execution under the hood, enabling truly composable and highly scalable apps and appchains. The overall result will be a smoother, more capital-efficient user experience where liquidity and execution no longer belong to individual blockchain environments; rather, they become network-wide resources”, explains Prabal Banerjee, Co-Founder of Avail. Current Ecosystem Growth Avail Nexus is launching with integrations live or underway across DeFi, infrastructure, SocialFi, AI, and cross-chain tooling. Ecosystem partners and projects, including Lens Protocol, Sophon, TRON, Space & Time, Lumia, Validium Network, Vanna Finance, Mace, Clober, Station X, Nexus AI, Bitte.ai, Neova, Gummee, Symbiotic, and more, are enabling powerful new use cases. Many integrations unlock use cases that were previously impossible or highly fragmented across chains, including unified collateral management for DeFi protocols, intent-based trading with execution across multiple liquidity venues, intelligent coordination layers for cross-chain data-driven actions, and multi-chain liquidity aggregation that allows assets on one chain to power opportunities on another. Availability and Next Steps With Nexus Mainnet now live: Developers can integrate through the Nexus SDK . Users will soon explore the first wave of Liquid Apps , applications going live on Avail Nexus, showcasing unified liquidity and opportunities at scale. Additional chain integrations and ecosystem expansions will roll out progressively. About Avail Avail shapes a new era for the onchain economy by transforming how users, apps, and liquidity move across chains. With Avail, both users and developers can access the entire onchain economy from anywhere, without worrying which chain assets or apps live on. Simply plug-in Avail to scale and instantly reach any asset on any chain. Founded by early members of Polygon and backed by Founders Fund, Dragonfly, Cyber Fund, and more, Avail is empowering users and builders to overcome the limitations of legacy blockchain infrastructure.

A shocking revelation from blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps exposes how a single entity managed to claim a staggering 20% of the entire IRYS airdrop supply. This massive IRYS airdrop grab involved 900 separate wallets that were strategically funded right before the token launch, raising serious questions about airdrop fairness and decentralization. How Did This IRYS Airdrop Exploitation Happen? The investigation reveals a sophisticated operation where one entity coordinated hundreds of wallets to maximize their IRYS airdrop rewards. According to Bubblemaps, these 900 wallets received funding immediately before the IRYS airdrop launch, suggesting careful planning and timing. This approach allowed the entity to bypass intended distribution limits and accumulate an unprecedented portion of the total supply. The immediate selling pressure began almost as soon as the tokens were claimed. The entity quickly moved $4 million worth of IRYS tokens to Bitget exchange, creating significant downward pressure on the token’s price. This rapid dump affected other legitimate participants who received the IRYS airdrop through proper channels. What Does This Mean for Future Airdrops? This IRYS airdrop incident highlights several critical issues in cryptocurrency distribution models: Airdrop farming has become increasingly sophisticated Current anti-sybil measures may be insufficient Legitimate users suffer from immediate price impacts Trust in fair distribution mechanisms is compromised The situation demonstrates how determined actors can game the system, even in supposedly decentralized environments. The IRYS airdrop case serves as a wake-up call for projects planning token distributions. Moreover, it shows why blockchain analytics tools have become essential for detecting such patterns. Can We Prevent Future IRYS Airdrop Manipulation? Projects can implement several strategies to protect against similar exploitation in future airdrops. First, they can use more sophisticated wallet analysis to detect coordinated behavior. Second, implementing longer vesting periods could discourage immediate dumping. Third, gradual claim periods might help identify suspicious patterns before full distribution. The IRYS airdrop incident particularly concerns because of the scale involved. Claiming 20% of any airdrop supply represents a significant concentration that goes against decentralization principles. Therefore, the crypto community must develop better standards for fair distribution. Key Takeaways from the IRYS Airdrop Incident This case provides valuable lessons for both projects and participants. For projects, it emphasizes the need for robust anti-sybil mechanisms. For users, it shows the importance of understanding airdrop dynamics before participating. The IRYS airdrop situation also highlights why due diligence matters in every aspect of cryptocurrency participation. Ultimately, the IRYS airdrop exploitation serves as a crucial case study in cryptocurrency distribution challenges. It demonstrates how economic incentives can lead to sophisticated gaming of systems designed to be fair and inclusive. The community must learn from this IRYS airdrop experience to build better systems for the future. Frequently Asked Questions What is an IRYS airdrop? An IRYS airdrop is a distribution of IRYS tokens to cryptocurrency wallet addresses, typically used to reward early supporters or promote adoption. How did one entity claim 20% of the IRYS airdrop? The entity used 900 separate wallets that were funded immediately before the airdrop snapshot, allowing them to meet eligibility criteria across multiple addresses. What is airdrop farming? Airdrop farming involves creating multiple wallets or accounts to maximize rewards from token distributions, often against the spirit of fair distribution. How much did the entity sell from the IRYS airdrop? The entity sold $4 million worth of IRYS tokens shortly after claiming them, depositing the funds to Bitget exchange. Can this happen with other airdrops? Yes, similar exploitation can occur with any airdrop that doesn’t have robust anti-sybil measures and wallet analysis systems in place. What can projects do to prevent this? Projects can implement wallet clustering analysis, longer vesting periods, gradual claim processes, and more sophisticated eligibility criteria.
