He pointed to Session and SimpleX as two projects working on these areas and disclosed that he has donated 128 ETH to each of them. Major ETH Donations In a post on X this week, Buterin said both applications are attempting to strengthen decentralization and enhance user protections without relying on phone numbers, while also addressing challenges such as multi-device support and resistance to Sybil or denial-of-service attacks. Buterin said the donation addresses are publicly available on the projects’ websites and added that, although the platforms are not yet perfect, they represent active efforts to advance privacy-preserving communication. He also called for more developers to help tackle the technical problems that still remain, and added that these issues “need more eyes on them.” It is important to note that while Signal has emerged as a widely used encrypted messaging app, it faced renewed scrutiny following a March incident in which senior US national security officials accidentally included a reporter in a Signal group discussing strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Days later, a Pentagon-wide advisory warned against using the app for any non-public information, citing a vulnerability tied to its linked-devices feature. The memo said Russian hacking groups were targeting the users of the app through phishing tactics. Signal later attributed the issue to user-targeted attacks rather than problems with its encryption, and that the company had already implemented safeguards and warnings. Buterin’s Privacy Push The Ethereum co-founder has repeatedly spoken this year about treating privacy as a basic necessity for digital systems. Following a recent data breach involving major US banks, where client information from institutions including JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley may have been exposed after a cyberattack on mortgage technology vendor SitusAMC, Buterin responded by describing privacy as a form of “hygiene.” In an essay published in April, he argued that “privacy is an important guarantor of decentralization” and outlined a path for Ethereum to support stealth addresses, selective disclosure, and application-level zero-knowledge tools to help reduce unnecessary data exposure. More recently, he warned that X’s new geo-inference system, which assigns country labels to user accounts, poses privacy risks. He said such systems can still reveal sensitive location information and may endanger vulnerable users, even when only broad regions are disclosed.

While the Shiba Inu price prediction is still taking shape, a powerful buy signal just lit up the charts. On the hourly timeframe, the 50-period simple moving average has surged above the 200-period. This is a classic golden cross pattern that often marks the beginning of a strong upward move. As a result of the latest downturn, SHIB has booked a 60% year-to-date loss. Wall Street seems to have focused on getting a Dogecoin ETF out there first before aiming for other tokens. However, as the regulatory landscape becomes much more supportive, it should be a matter of time for a Shiba Inu ETF to hit the market. Paired with the buy signal mentioned earlier, meme coins could be getting ready to make a comeback in 2026. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal After Key Support Bounce The daily chart indicates that the price has bounced off a key trendline support in the past few days and could begin its ascent from $0.0000080 to $0.000012 in the next few days. This would mean a 50% upside potential in the near term for SHIB, without necessarily pushing the envelope too much. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just popped up the signal line, which also favors a bullish outlook. This indicates that positive momentum is accelerating as macroeconomic conditions improve. Trading volumes need to rise to confirm the relevance of this support bounce, as they are currently a bit low at around 3% of the token’s circulating market cap. ChatGPT said: If the Federal Reserve cuts rates in December, it could trigger a surge in trading volume, setting the stage for meme coins to rally. One project gaining serious traction is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , a mine-to-earn game that makes crypto mining simple, fun, and fully virtual with no hardware needed. With over $2.2 million raised so far, investor interest is building quickly as the presale gains momentum.

All three altcoins could experience an unusually volatile December, either surging or sliding sharply depending on macroeconomic sentiment and industry catalysts. Over the past month, the crypto market has been in a steep correction triggered by a major Bitcoin selloff, with steep pullbacks across most major assets. Bitcoin briefly dipped to an eight-month low around $82,000 last Friday. Even so, the bigger picture remains constructive. Blockchain innovation continues to advance, and high-durability altcoins like XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are still viewed as strong long-term contenders. Once market conditions stabilize, each project could regain upward momentum. Below is how Claude AI breaks down the bullish and bearish paths for December. XRP (XRP): Claude AI Predicts a Possible Swing Toward Either $10 or $1 Based on December Market Conditions Claude AI’s downside projection suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could retreat to around $1.80 by Christmas if market sentiment deteriorates, representing a 17% drop from today’s price near $2.18. Source: Claude Such a reversal would contrast sharply with XRP’s powerful run earlier this year, when it rallied to a seven-year peak of $3.65 in July after Ripple secured a major legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For months, XRP has consolidated within multiple bullish flag formations that failed to resolve. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits near 53, and the token climbed 1.5% during the past 24 hours as the rest of the market collectively climbed 4% to a combined market cap of $3.2 trillion. Under ideal conditions, Claude’s upper-bound target reaches $10. The SEC’s recent approval of nine XRP spot ETFs could steady institutional demand, if the prior Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches are an accurate precedent. Additionally, more high-profile ETF launches could arrive soon. Further regulatory clarity or major institutional partnerships could help propel XRP toward the double-digit range by 2026. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Claude AI Highlights the Potential for a 15× Rally Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , which debuted in 2020 as a playful challenger to Dogecoin, now commands a market capitalization above $5 billion. Trading near $0.0000085, SHIB climbed 2% in the past day, roughly matching Dogecoin’s gains. A move toward the key $0.000025 resistance as November wraps up could pave the way for Claude AI’s projected year-end price window of $0.00005 to $0.00009, representing potential gains of up to 11×. Claude’s bearish outlook for SHIB is notably less severe than its predictions for XRP and Pepe. In a downside scenario, SHIB could rise a little into the $0.00001 support zone and then trade sideways, indicating minimal gains of 18% from its current price. The Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded significantly, with Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling network, offering faster transactions, lower fees, broader developer support, and enhanced privacy tools. These features place SHIB in a more advanced category than typical meme tokens. Pepe ($PEPE): Claude AI Predicts 420% Surge! Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, has grown into the leading non-doge-themed meme coin, with a heady market cap of over $2 billion. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series, Pepe’s cultural influence and meme legacy have helped solidify its ubiquitous presence across social media. Despite fierce competition, Pepe maintains deep liquidity and an active fan base, occasionally boosted by cryptic nods from Elon Musk on X, prompting speculation that he has a Pepe position alongside his known positions in DOGE and BTC. The token trades near $0.0000046 today, still about 84% below its December 2024 high of $0.00002803. Claude AI’s models suggest PEPE could challenge ATH with a 420% rise to reach $0.000024. In the short term, however, the token must break through the stubborn $0.000018 resistance area to confirm a larger trend shift. However, a bear market could see a collapse of 35% to $0.000003. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rising Meme Coin Not Factored Into Claude’s Forecasts While Claude AI anticipates potential pressure on major altcoins, presale projects continue attracting heavy interest. One standout is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has raised $4.2 million and markets itself as the “next Dogecoin.” MAXI’s humorous origin story centers on a character named Maxi Doge, depicted as plotting a comedic takeover after years of watching Dogecoin dominate. The project leans heavily into viral content, community contests, and an active social presence to build momentum. As an ERC-20 token, MAXI benefits from Ethereum’s stronger security, scalability, lower environmental impact, and larger developer ecosystem, advantages that Dogecoin’s older proof-of-work model lacks. The project currently advertises staking rewards of up to 73% APY, though these rates will naturally decrease as staking participation grows. MAXI is priced at $0.00027 in its presale, with scheduled increases in later phases. Purchases can be made via MetaMask or Best Wallet . Dogecoin stands no chance!

The cryptocurrency slid to a recent bottom near $82,000 last Friday, a zone many traders hope will be the bottom. Today, as BTC punches above $91,000, things appear to be fine. Crypto old hands aren’t panicking. Long-term bulls frame the downturn as a healthy cooldown after months of relentless accumulation, a phase designed to shake out excessive leverage, curb overheated speculation, and reset the market to prepare it for the next leg higher. Given that Bitcoin dominance no longer has a complete hold on crypto’s narrative, it’s likely that the next bull phase will be oriented around altcoins. That makes today the best opportunity to load up on XRP, Solana, and Ethereum. XRP (XRP): A Leading Contender for the Future of Global Money Movement Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) leads crypto’s international payments sector with rapid settlement times and ultra-low fees, features that position the XRP Ledger as a more efficient replacement to SWIFT. Ripple’s solution has been spotlighted in research from both the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House. Additionally, Ripple’s expanding roster of banking partners has kept XRP among the three top projects, maintaining a market cap of over $132 billion. Ripple’s introduction of U.S. dollar–pegged stablecoin RLUSD further signals its commitment to cornering the on-chain future of digital payments. Every RLUSD transaction on the XRPLedger removes a small amount of XRP from circulation, tying XRP’s value directly to the expanding popularity of Ripple’s solutions. XRP has risen 53% over the past year, breaking a six-year stagnation period with a new record high of $3.65 in July. Over the same timeframe, Bitcoin fell 2%. With its Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering near 55 and the current price of $2.19 sitting slightly above the 30-day moving average, XRP demand is visibly growing, lifting it 5% thanks to the recent rollout of nine XRP ETFs. More ETFs will follow, which will draw significant institutional capital. If the U.S. finally delivers long-promised crypto regulation, XRP could realistically approach $10 or more by 2026. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Challenger Sets Its Sights on $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has cemented its reputation as one of the fastest and most cost-efficient smart-contract networks in the industry. With a market cap approaching $80 billion and over $9 billion in TVL in its DeFi ecosystem, it is Ethereum’s most formidable rival. Last month’s launch of Solana spot ETFs from Grayscale and Bitwise grants large institutions direct access, a catalyst that historically triggered explosive growth for both Bitcoin and Ethereum during prior cycles. SOL bottomed near $100 earlier in the year, and at around $142 today, it’s hovering in a support zone. A bullish flag pattern has been forming since mid-September, suggesting a potential breakout, with strong psychological support up at the next leg, $200, and significant resistance around $250. A decisive move above those ranges could send SOL past its record high of $293.31, with optimistic projections targeting $750 during a robust Q4 rally. Meanwhile, Solana’s ultra-low fees and high-speed transactions continue drawing Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization projects, with major financial firms, such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, issuing tokenized real-world assets on Solana. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart-Contract Titan Gears Up for Major Expansion Ethereum ($ETH) retains its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and the wider Web3 economy, supported by a market cap of over $366 billion. With nearly $70 billion in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols, Ethereum remains the dominant force in smart contracts and decentralized applications, underscoring its foundational importance across the blockchain landscape. In a bull market, ETH could hit $10,000 by year-end, a dramatic leap from today’s $3,000 price and nearly twice its previous peak of $4,946 set in August. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, expected in early December, aims to significantly boost data availability for Layer-2 networks while improving security, sustainability, and scalability. These enhancements could help drive ETH closer to the $5,000 level by month’s end. However, ETH’s path toward $10,000 will depend on clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks and a favourable macro-environment, both of which could unlock major institutional entry. Earlier this year, Ethereum broke out of a bullish flag formation, rallying from $1,800 to its all-time high. Stronger momentum will be required to propel it into five-figure territory. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Culture Meets High-Speed Bitcoin Layer-2 Innovation An emerging candidate for 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling solution cosplaying as a meme coin. Despite its playful branding, the project supercharges Bitcoin with fast throughput, extremely low fees, and full smart-contract functionality. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables fluid Bitcoin transfers across different blockchains. The HYPER presale has already surpassed $28.5 million in funding, and popular crypto analyst Borch Crypto has suggested the token could see gains up to 100×. A recent audit by Coinsult confirmed no smart-contract vulnerabilities, highlighting the project’s credibility. The HYPER token powers network fees, governance, and staking, with early presale investors receiving yields of up to 40% APY. Next year, Bitcoin is going HYPER!

Source: AVAXUSD on Tradingview Securitize Wins EU Approval and Selects Avalanche for Settlement System Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. AVAX Price Holds Key Support as Technical Signals Improve While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Institutional Accumulation Strengthens Bullish Outlook Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over?

According to reports, about 54 billion Korean won — roughly $36–37 million — was taken in what the company called an “abnormal withdrawal” detected at 04:42 KST. Upbit Suspends Solana Services According to the exchange, deposits and withdrawals for assets on the Solana chain were halted immediately after the breach was found. Company engineers moved remaining Solana holdings into cold storage to limit further access. Some tokens were later frozen on-chain while investigators traced transfers. Reports have disclosed that about 12 billion won (around $8–9 million) in LAYER tokens has been frozen so far. NEW: UPBIT DISCLOSES ~$37M HACK ON SOLANA NETWORK – “TO PREVENT ANY DAMAGE TO MEMBER ASSETS, THE ENTIRE AMOUNT WILL BE COVERED BY UPBIT’S HOLDINGS.

Stolen tickers reportedly include ACS, BONK, RAY, JUP, PYTH, ORCA, JTO, LAYER, RENDER, MOODENG, and TRUMP, among others. The list is long, and tracking continues as some tokens move through multiple wallets. At this stage, several of the addresses holding the funds are under active monitoring. Upbit( @Official_Upbit ) has been hacked — 54B KRW (~36.8M USD) in assets on #Solana have been transferred to unknown wallets. https://t.co/plbmBz2G4N https://t.co/YOHoqDVfqa pic.twitter.com/DM5BxSTtXA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 27, 2025 Exchange Operator Pledges Coverage Dunamu , Upbit’s parent company, has said the exchange will cover the full loss from its own reserves so that customer balances will not be reduced. According to the company, this decision was made to protect users while the technical and forensic reviews are under way. A security review of the deposit and withdrawal systems has been launched, and outside experts are reported to be assisting with the investigation. Past Incidents And Timing Raise Questions Reports note the timing was awkward: the breach came just after a high-profile corporate announcement involving Naver Financial on November 26, 2025. Upbit is not new to major hacks; a 2019 attack cost the platform a large amount of ETH. Hot wallets, which are connected to the internet, remain a known weak point for centralized exchanges. That risk was exposed again here. On-Chain Tracking And Recovery Hopes Blockchain analysts are following the trail of transfers and identifying the wallets that received funds. Some tokens can be frozen if their issuers or governing authorities cooperate, which is how the reported LAYER freeze was achieved. Still, many assets may be hard to recover, and legal routes can be slow. It was reported that the exchange attempted to freeze what it could while moving other assets offline. What This Means For Users And Market Confidence For now, Upbit users have been assured their funds are safe because the operator pledged to absorb the loss. Market reaction could include temporary liquidity issues for certain Solana tokens listed on the platform while services remain limited.

Over six XRP-linked ETFs have debuted in recent days, with combined assets nearing $800 million — yet XRP has posted just a 3% gain in the past week. Wall Street’s crypto appetite shows no signs of slowing, but the market’s muted response is raising eyebrows. One possible reason for XRP’s muted reaction could be the lack of retail participation, as much of the recent demand appears to be coming from institutional flows. Open interest in XRP futures currently sits at $4 billion, which is the same level it reached in June, just days before XRP surged to its 2025 high of around $3.65. This parallel is now fueling speculation that a breakout could still be on the table if retail traders begin to re-enter. XRP Price Prediction: Historical Patterns Suggest That XRP Could Soon Explode Looking at the daily chart, a confirmed breakout out of the token’s descending price channel could set in motion a trend reversal for XRP. The price would have to climb to $2.40 at least to achieve that. In that case, the first target could be the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2.60. Then, we could expect a much more pronounced move to $3.10 if positive momentum accelerates. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just sent a buy signal after rising above the 14-day moving average. Hence, it seems that XRP is already on the move. As the market shows early signs of recovery, top presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are quickly gaining momentum. This Dogecoin-themed meme coin has already raised over $4 million, giving traders a rare early-day chance to join a high-energy project before it hits the market. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Tapping Into the Spirit of Early Dogecoin Maxi Doge ($MAXI) brings back the feel of Dogecoin’s early days, when meme coins were fun, fast-moving, and full of potential. Built on Ethereum, it’s designed for traders who want to get in early and ride the momentum as the community grows.

They also get access to an exclusive idea hub through which they can share insights , trading setups , their biggest Ws and Ls, and more. Finally, the project plans to invest up to 25% of the presale funds into a handful of YOLO trades and use the money to pay for marketing. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, simply head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

Prices have responded positively after U.S. stock markets rose yesterday, as increased expectations of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month buoyed sentiment. BTC is up by 5% today, while Ethereum and Solana have risen by 4% and 3.5%, although many major tokens remain down in the past week and month. Yet today’s bounce may signal a sustained turnaround, so we’ve picked the best altcoin to buy now, in order to take advantage of a surge in bullishness. This token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that’s aiming to make mining much more accessible. Crypto Price Prediction: Best Altcoin to Buy During the Crypto Crash PEPENODE kicked off its increasingly popular presale at the end of September, and now it has raised more than $2.2 million from enthusiastic investors. As noted above, its unique selling point is that it offers a unique mining system, one that removes the massive cost that comes with traditional crypto mining. Namely, it enables users to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow simply by spending PEPENODE on more nodes. Excitingly, more nodes equal greater rewards, implying that there may be a big demand for PEPENODE tokens. PEPENODE pays out mining rewards in the form of external coins, such as Pepe and Fartcoin, while it will add additional coins at later dates. On top of this, holders of PEPENODE can stake the token for a passive income , and at the moment, the coin is paying a very attractive yield of 586% APY. We could therefore see the token shoot up in price steadily over time, given the bullishness of its tokenomics. Mapping your next move in Pepenode isn’t flavor. It’s core gameplay that determines how fast you climb upgrade those Nodes! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/vY69IDm3C1 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 27, 2025 And what’s also interesting is that miners can sell on their virtual nodes once they’re finished with them, providing them with an exit and another source of income. PEPENODE Could Be One of the Biggest New Coins of 2026 Such features make PEPENODE one of the most exciting presale tokens in the market right now, and it has every chance of surging once it lists in the coming weeks. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, which its team has allocated between marketing, development, listings, mining rewards, and its treasury. Investors can join its sale by going to the PEPENODE website , where they can connect a suitable wallet and buy as much of the token as they like. It’s currently selling at a price of $0.0011685, although this will rise again in two days. In fact, it will rise every few days until the sale ends, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later. Given that the market looks ready to recover, now could be a perfect time to buy.

55013426,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90839,1764286232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Reveals The Fastest Road To XRP Price Growth,https://timestabloid.com/expert-reveals-the-fastest-road-to-xrp-price-growth/,"Market analyst Chad Steingraber has reiterated his view that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now represent the most influential and fastest-acting force capable of driving XRP price growth. In a series of recent comments, he emphasized that ETF inflows are expanding at a pace that surpasses every other potential catalyst, including increasing network activity and broader market sentiment. Rapid Expansion of XRP ETF Holdings Steingraber’s assessment is anchored in the surge of institutional accumulation taking place through newly launched XRP ETFs. Among the most prominent examples is Bitwise , which now manages more than 80.5 million XRP, valued at roughly $178.8 million. This position increased following a single-day inflow of $7.46 million, marking the largest increase among all XRP ETF issuers for that session. This is the fastest road to a higher price. All other options are much longer. — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 27, 2025 Other managers are seeing similar results. Canary Capital added $5.21 million in inflows, pushing its total XRP assets to $336.98 million. Grayscale and Franklin Templeton also recorded steady increases of $4.32 million and $4.83 million, raising their respective totals to $84.68 million and $76 million. Across all providers, XRP ETFs collectively oversee $676.49 million in assets, an amount accumulated within just nine trading days of the ETFs becoming available. Steingraber expects this figure to grow substantially as more firms begin trading XRP products. Projected Increase in ETF Trading Activity Three additional funds are set to join the group, which Steingraber believes will significantly expand daily trading activity. Once the new ETFs become active, he predicts the average daily trading volume across all issuers could rise by an additional $35 million. Under these conditions, overall daily ETF trading could fall within the $75 million to $80 million range. Higher volume directly translates to greater XRP acquisition requirements from issuers, a factor that he sees as central to near-term market dynamics. Based on the projected trading range, Steingraber calculates that the combined ETFs may eventually need between 20 million and 30 million XRP each day. Even at the lower end of that estimate, accumulation would occur at a substantial pace. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If seven ETFs collectively purchased 20 million XRP in a single session, that would equal 100 million XRP across a standard trading week. Over one month, this could rise to 400 million XRP, and over a full year, the total could reach approximately 4.8 billion XRP. He stresses that the market may not require a full year to feel the impact. According to him, if prices do not adjust upward quickly, the decrease in available supply could become noticeable within a matter of months. Why ETF Demand Is the Most Immediate Catalyst Steingraber argues that no other factor, including corporate integrations, cross-border payment expansion, or broader crypto-market optimism, currently matches the immediate effect of ETF-related buying. ETF inflows draw directly from the circulating supply, and issuers must secure XRP to create new shares when investor demand increases. This link between capital inflow and actual XRP acquisition makes ETFs a direct mechanism for tightening supply, unlike developments that may influence price more gradually. Despite the rapid accumulation, XRP continues to trade around the $2 mark. Analysts note that this is partly because early ETF demand is often routed through over-the-counter desks, delaying its influence on public order books. As more ETFs begin operations and daily accumulation reaches the levels Steingraber projects, he expects the market to respond more quickly. He concludes that ETF-driven demand represents the most immediate path to notable XRP price appreciation, arguing that all other potential catalysts, while valuable, operate on much slower timelines and therefore cannot generate comparable short-term impact.

After falling nearly 45% this month, the meme coin may still have room to drop — with top analyst Ali Martinez suggesting a further 60% decline could be on the table. Martinez points to a clear head-and-shoulders breakdown, with Pepe slipping below its neckline on November 3 and still tracking toward a potential target of $0.0000015. Keep an eye on $PEPE ! pic.twitter.com/YGIsHu6u1A — Ali (@ali_charts) November 26, 2025 Derivatives markets appear to be trailing the setup. Speculative demand has plunged, with Open Interest down 65% since the breakdown, now sitting at $238 million. Pepe Open Interest (OI). Source: Coinglass . Traders have disengaged with price movements, but a $46 million pickup in OI this week and a Long Short Ratio of 1.03 show bullishness creeping back in. The majority of traders are betting on further price increases, showing potential for an early bailout from the head-and-shoulders pattern. Pepe Price Prediction: Will Pepe Vanish? Not all marker commentators share Martinez’s view. Analyst GalaxyBTC cites historical support as grounds for the meme coin still “ looks good ” at its current position. This support stands to be confirmed as a launchpad level yet again with a 6-week descending channel approaching a breakout as momentum indicators flip bullish. PEPE / USD 12-hour chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView. The RSI teeters on a cross back above the 50 neutral line, while the MACD maintains a wide lead above the signal line. Both of these metrics point to this week’s pickup as the early stages of a lasting uptrend as buyers step back in. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout sits around $0.0000047, with a bounce likely to rule out a false breakout. Fully realised, the pattern targets the $0.000009 demand zone for a 95% gain. And as the bull market matures with anticipated U.S. interest rate cuts to fuel risk appetite, this push could go even further, eying a 5x move to all-time highs at $0.000028. PepeNode: Earn Meme Coins with a Virtual Miner Tired of trying to time meme coin pumps? PepeNode ($PEPENODE) makes it easy to earn from the market without trading, guessing entries, or buying hardware. Just build virtual mining rigs, upgrade your setup, and start collecting rewards in top tokens like $PEPE , $FARTCOIN , and more. The more rigs you launch, the more you earn — and top miners also unlock exclusive airdrops. It’s fun, fast to set up, and already gaining serious traction. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.2 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 585% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside, all without having to worry about timing the perfect entry.

Adding to the uncertainty, new data from Arkham reveals that SpaceX transferred out another 1,163 BTC—worth approximately $105.23 million—just a few hours ago. The transfer appears to have been routed to Coinbase Prime, suggesting a potential custody shift by the company. Such large movements often spark concern in the market, as they may signal repositioning, selling preparation, or treasury adjustments by major corporate holders. While Bitcoin’s push above $90K provides temporary relief, it does little to change the broader narrative: the market remains under pressure, liquidity is thinning, and macro-driven uncertainty continues to shape price action. The coming sessions will determine whether BTC can build momentum or slip back into deeper correction territory. SpaceX’s Bitcoin Movements Add New Layer of Market Uncertainty According to data from Arkham, SpaceX currently holds 6,095.45 BTC, valued at roughly $550 million at today’s prices. This substantial treasury position places the company among the larger corporate Bitcoin holders, and its recent on-chain activity has quickly drawn attention across the market. The latest transfer—1,163 BTC moved just hours ago—marks a meaningful shift in activity for SpaceX, especially considering the company has been largely inactive in terms of BTC movements for months. Arkham reports that this is SpaceX’s first notable transaction since October 29, when the company transferred 281 BTC to a new wallet address. While the motives behind these transfers remain unknown, traders typically monitor such moves closely, as large corporate holders can influence market sentiment. Transfers to Coinbase Prime—as suspected in the latest movement—often suggest custody adjustments, treasury restructuring, or preparations for strategic repositioning. For now, there is no clear indication that SpaceX is reducing its Bitcoin exposure. However, the renewed on-chain activity comes at a sensitive moment for the market, which is struggling with selling pressure, fear, and broad speculation about an emerging bear phase. As long as major smart-money entities remain active, Bitcoin’s short-term direction may continue to experience heightened volatility. Attempted Recovery but Still Under Pressure Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after plunging to new local lows last week, with the price now pushing back above $91,000. The chart shows a sharp bounce from the sub-$82,000 zone, which acted as a temporary support during the capitulation phase. However, despite this rebound, BTC remains below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—which reinforces the broader bearish structure. The recent upswing reflects short-term relief rather than a confirmed trend reversal. Volume spiked heavily during the sell-off, indicating forced liquidations and panic selling. But the current bounce is happening on lighter volume, suggesting that buyers are cautious and not yet committing with strong conviction. Structurally, Bitcoin must reclaim the $95,000–$98,000 zone, where the 50-day and 100-day moving averages converge. This area represents the first major resistance cluster and will determine whether the market is transitioning into a recovery or simply forming a lower high before another leg down. Failure to break above this band could invite renewed selling pressure.

Banks will be allowed to offer accounts, custody and payment services tied to stablecoins such as USDT, government statements and local reports disclosed. The move follows a sharp rise in crypto use as people seek ways to hold dollar-pegged value amid currency pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Banks To Offer USDT Accounts Reports have disclosed that Economy Minister Jose Gabriel Espinoza announced the change, and at least one lender, Banco Bisa, has already begun offering custody and transfer services for USDT. Based on reports, crypto transactions in Bolivia jumped dramatically last year, with some counts showing growth of more than 500% and figures putting crypto activity at $294 million in the first half of 2025. Those numbers have pushed regulators and banks to respond more directly. 💥 BREAKING: 🇧🇴 Bolivia to integrate Bitcoin and crypto into its financial system, starting with stablecoins pic.twitter.com/Qb0Tj7pern — Bitcoin Archive (@BitcoinArchive) November 26, 2025 Everyday Payments And Savings People and businesses are reportedly testing USDT for real payments. Some shops and service providers have shown prices in USDT, and certain sectors — such as car dealers and firms handling imports — are said to be accepting stablecoin payments for some transactions. According to market observers, the change is partly a response to shortages of physical US dollars and to rising costs that make the local currency less stable for saving. Banks will be able to create savings products denominated in stablecoins, and may offer loans or payment options tied to them. Cross-Border Transfers And Remittances Based on reports, one obvious use will be cross-border transfers. Stablecoins can offer a dollar-pegged option when access to actual US dollars is limited. That could help businesses that buy fuel or other imports and families that receive money from abroad. Still, practical hurdles remain: many people are unbanked or lack easy internet access, and broad adoption will take infrastructure, training and clear consumer protections. Regulatory Limits And Risks According to analysts, the government’s plan does not make stablecoins legal tender in place of the boliviano. Rather, it lets regulated banks provide crypto-linked services under the financial system. That means accepting USDT will likely stay voluntary for merchants. There are also risks to watch: stablecoin liquidity, custody safety, and how well banks manage anti-money-laundering rules. Consumer education and stronger oversight will be needed to protect ordinary users. What Comes Next Several months of rollout and pilot programs are expected, and observers will be watching transaction volumes and how many banks and businesses sign on. If the system grows, Bolivia could become an example for neighboring countries facing similar currency stress. But the deeper economic problems that pushed people to crypto — inflation and limited dollar access — will still need government solutions beyond new payment rails.

His comments were made during a recent shareholder briefing, where he underscored SBI’s involvement in a developing XRP treasury project managed by Evernorth. Although the presentation was originally delivered in Japanese, an English-language version was later circulated by community commentator Crypto Eri. Overview of Evernorth Treasury Project Evernorth recently announced plans to join forces with Armada Acquisition Corp II through a merger that would create what the company describes as a large-scale XRP treasury entity. As part of this plan, Evernorth has launched a fundraising effort valued at $1 billion. SBI Group is one of the major contributors to this initiative and has allocated $200 million specifically to the acquisition of XRP on the open market. XRP | Ripple @evernorthxrp ""This will be very interesting."" pic.twitter.com/i0KMgEIJCK — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) November 26, 2025 The fundraising round also includes a substantial contribution from Ripple, which is providing a mix of XRP and cash exceeding $500 million. Participation extends further to individual and institutional investors. Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has already supplied 50 million XRP personally, while other companies, such as Kraken, Pantera Capital, and Arrington Capital, have collectively added more than $600 million. SBI’s Position and Expectations The merger is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2026. Once finalized, the combined entity plans to begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol XRPN. Kitao referred to the project as noteworthy due to the expectations around its market performance and strategic value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As one of the investors backing the treasury, SBI Group may benefit from any gains that arise once the shares become publicly traded. The arrangement allows SBI to hold a direct stake in an entity built around long-term XRP accumulation and management. Current Holdings and Status As of early November, Evernorth reported holding approximately 473.27 million XRP, valued at around $1.03 billion based on prevailing market prices at the time. These assets are spread across a series of wallets operating on the XRP Ledger. According to available data, two of the primary wallets hold roughly 45 million XRP and 42 million XRP each, while the remainder is distributed across several other custodial accounts. Kitao’s remarks signal SBI Group’s continued interest in the broader XRP ecosystem and reaffirm its ongoing collaboration with Ripple. The upcoming merger and public listing represent the next phase of this involvement, positioning SBI to play a prominent role in the development of the new treasury-focused enterprise.

This bold proposal aims to reduce the tax burden on American workers while leveraging an unconventional funding source: tariff revenue. What Does Trump’s Income Tax Cut Plan Actually Mean? President Trump’s proposal centers on using revenue generated from tariffs to fund reductions in income taxes. This approach represents a fundamental shift in how the government might collect and redistribute funds. The income tax cut would potentially put more money back into the pockets of American taxpayers. According to multiple media reports, the President believes tariff collections could cover a substantial portion of the proposed income tax reduction. This strategy connects international trade policy directly with domestic tax relief, creating an innovative economic model. How Would This Income Tax Cut Actually Work? The mechanics behind this income tax cut proposal involve several key components. First, tariffs collected on imported goods would flow into government coffers. Then, these funds would offset the revenue loss from lowering income tax rates. Key aspects of the plan include: Reduced income tax rates across multiple brackets Increased reliance on tariff revenue Potential changes to international trade relationships Possible impacts on consumer prices What Are the Potential Benefits of This Income Tax Cut Strategy? This innovative approach to funding an income tax cut offers several potential advantages. American workers could see immediate benefits through higher take-home pay. Moreover, businesses might experience reduced payroll costs and increased consumer spending power. The income tax cut could stimulate economic growth by putting more disposable income in circulation. However, the success of this strategy depends heavily on maintaining sufficient tariff revenue streams while managing potential trade relationship impacts. Could This Income Tax Cut Face Implementation Challenges? While the income tax cut proposal sounds promising, several hurdles could emerge. Congress must approve any significant tax changes, and political opposition might complicate passage. Additionally, fluctuating tariff revenues could create budget uncertainty. International trade partners might respond with their own tariffs, potentially affecting American exports. The income tax cut’s sustainability also depends on maintaining consistent trade flows and tariff collections over time. What Makes This Income Tax Cut Different From Previous Proposals? This income tax cut stands apart because of its unique funding mechanism. Unlike traditional tax cuts funded through spending reductions or increased borrowing, this plan uses tariff revenue as the primary offset. This creates a direct link between trade policy and domestic tax relief. The income tax cut proposal represents a departure from conventional fiscal thinking. It suggests that protectionist trade policies could finance domestic economic benefits, potentially reshaping how governments approach revenue generation. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Approach to Tax Policy President Trump’s income tax cut proposal marks a significant departure from traditional economic thinking. By linking tariff revenue to domestic tax relief, this plan could redefine how governments balance international trade and domestic fiscal policy. The success of this income tax cut will depend on careful implementation and ongoing evaluation of its economic impacts. Frequently Asked Questions How would tariff revenue fund the income tax cut? Money collected from tariffs on imported goods would be used to replace revenue lost from lowering income tax rates, creating a new funding stream for tax relief. When might this income tax cut take effect? The timeline depends on congressional approval and implementation details. The process could take several months or longer if political negotiations become complex. Would all taxpayers benefit from this income tax cut? While details are still emerging, the proposal appears aimed at providing broad-based tax relief, though specific impacts might vary across income brackets. How might this affect international trade relationships? Increased reliance on tariff revenue could strain trade partnerships, potentially leading to retaliatory measures from other countries. What are the risks of funding tax cuts through tariffs? Primary risks include trade disruption, potential consumer price increases, and revenue volatility if trade patterns change significantly. How does this compare to previous tax cut proposals? This approach is unique in its direct linkage between tariff collections and income tax reductions, representing an innovative funding mechanism.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.33 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $3.79. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.3847 Market cap $382.73M Trading volume $114.29M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.393 24-hour low $0.3759 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 14.11% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.4983 14-Day RSI 42.80 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.6970 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is stabilizing but still needs to reclaim $0.407 for real upside. The coin’s short-term trend is up, but momentum is cooling. The resistance at $0.395 and $0.407 remains the barrier to expansion. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As of November 27, WIF is stabilizing after the sharp drop seen around Nov 21–22. The price has recovered from the lower Bollinger Band but remains below the middle band near $0.407, which continues to act as resistance. WIF’s momentum is improving, as shown by a positive MACD histogram, though both MACD lines remain below zero, indicating the broader trend is still in a recovery phase. Also, PVT has begun rising again but remains subdued. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart shows a clearer short-term uptrend, with price trading above the Alligator lines and the structure sloping upward. However, the candles show repeated hesitation around $0.39–$0.395, where rejection wicks appear. The MACD remains positive but is losing strength as the histogram contracts, indicating a cooling momentum.

WIF is in recovery mode but not yet in a full bullish trend. Traders can expect continued grinding upward with pullbacks, and watch for a decisive break above $0.407, which would confirm strength and open higher targets. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $1 by the end of 2025 and between $3.4 and $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

This massive expiration event represents one of the largest in crypto history and could significantly influence Bitcoin price action in the coming days. What Does This Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean for Traders? According to data from Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange, these Bitcoin options contracts will expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC on November 28. The sheer scale of this expiration demands attention from every serious crypto investor. The put/call ratio of 0.56 indicates more call options than put options, suggesting overall bullish sentiment among traders. The max pain price sits at $100,000, representing the strike price where the maximum number of options would expire worthless. This level often acts as a gravitational pull on the underlying asset’s price as expiration approaches. Understanding these Bitcoin options dynamics helps traders anticipate potential market movements. How Do Options Expirations Affect Bitcoin Price? Options expirations create significant market pressure as traders adjust their positions. Here’s what typically happens: Gamma exposure forces market makers to hedge their positions Large expirations can lead to increased volatility Price often gravitates toward the max pain level Post-expiration frequently brings relief rallies or sell-offs The current Bitcoin options landscape shows substantial open interest that must be resolved. Market participants should prepare for potential price swings as these contracts reach their expiration date. The $100,000 max pain price becomes particularly relevant for short-term price predictions. Ethereum Options Join the Expiration Party Meanwhile, Ethereum options worth $1.7 billion will expire simultaneously. These Ethereum contracts feature a put/call ratio of 0.48 and a max pain price of $3,400. The coordinated expiration of both major cryptocurrency options creates a compounded market event that could amplify volatility across the entire crypto space. The lower put/call ratio for Ethereum options indicates even stronger bullish sentiment compared to Bitcoin. This divergence between the two largest cryptocurrencies provides interesting insights into trader positioning and market expectations. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? Following this massive Bitcoin options expiration, traders should monitor several key factors: Immediate price reaction after 8:00 a.m. UTC Volume and liquidity changes in derivatives markets Open interest reset for new options contracts Spot market correlation with derivatives activity Historical patterns suggest that large Bitcoin options expirations often precede significant price movements. However, market conditions and external factors can always override typical expiration effects. The current macroeconomic environment adds another layer of complexity to this already dramatic Bitcoin options event. Navigating Post-Expiration Market Conditions Once these Bitcoin options contracts settle, the market typically experiences a period of recalibration. Market makers reduce their hedging activities, and traders establish new positions based on updated market outlooks. This transition period often creates trading opportunities for alert investors. The resolution of $13.4 billion in Bitcoin options exposure will undoubtedly leave its mark on market structure. Whether this leads to sustained trends or temporary disruptions remains to be seen, but the magnitude guarantees market impact. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin Markets Today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration represents a critical inflection point for cryptocurrency markets. The $13.4 billion notional value underscores the growing maturity and sophistication of crypto derivatives. While short-term volatility seems inevitable, the long-term implications for market development are profoundly positive as institutional participation continues to grow. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin options expiration? Bitcoin options expiration is when options contracts reach their expiry date and are either exercised or expire worthless based on the underlying asset’s price. How does the put/call ratio affect market sentiment? A put/call ratio below 1 indicates more call options than puts, suggesting bullish sentiment among traders expecting price increases. What is max pain price in options trading? Max pain price is the strike price where the maximum number of options contracts expire worthless, causing the most financial pain to option holders. Can options expirations predict Bitcoin price movement? While not perfectly predictive, large options expirations often influence short-term price action as market makers adjust their hedging strategies. How often do Bitcoin options expire? Major crypto exchanges typically have monthly options expirations, with some offering weekly contracts for more frequent trading opportunities. Should retail traders worry about options expirations? Retail traders should be aware of expiration dates but focus more on their overall investment strategy rather than timing markets around single events. Found this analysis helpful?

Interpol just dropped a bombshell revelation that will make you think twice about online opportunities. The international police organization has officially designated crypto-based scam compounds as a serious transnational criminal threat, exposing a dark underworld that spans multiple countries and exploits thousands of victims. What Are Crypto-Based Scam Compounds? Interpol’s investigation reveals these crypto-based scam compounds operate like modern-day criminal enterprises. They lure unsuspecting victims with fake job postings, promising legitimate employment opportunities. However, once recruits arrive at compounds in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, they find themselves trapped in nightmare scenarios. Victims face forced labor conditions where they must execute various fraudulent schemes including: Voice phishing operations Romance scams targeting lonely individuals Sophisticated investment frauds Direct cryptocurrency scams How Do These Criminal Networks Operate? The sophistication of these crypto-based scam compounds demonstrates why Interpol considers them a transnational threat. These organizations use cryptocurrency for several key reasons that make them particularly dangerous. Cryptocurrency provides these criminals with: Borderless transaction capabilities Enhanced anonymity features Quick money movement across jurisdictions Difficulty in tracing funds Why Is This Designation So Important? Interpol’s classification of crypto-based scam compounds as a transnational criminal threat marks a significant shift in global law enforcement priorities. This designation triggers enhanced cooperation between member countries and allocates additional resources to combat these networks. The international police organization emphasizes that no single country can tackle this problem alone. The cross-border nature of these crypto-based scam compounds requires coordinated efforts across multiple jurisdictions to effectively dismantle the networks and rescue victims. What Can You Do to Stay Protected? While authorities work to dismantle these crypto-based scam compounds , individuals need to remain vigilant. Understanding the warning signs can help you avoid falling victim to these sophisticated operations. Watch for these red flags in job offers: Unusually high salaries for minimal qualifications Vague job descriptions Requests for upfront payments Pressure to relocate quickly Companies with limited online presence The Global Response to Crypto-Based Scam Compounds Interpol’s announcement signals a new era in fighting crypto-based scam compounds . The organization calls for improved information sharing between national police forces and enhanced training for identifying cryptocurrency-related crimes. Moreover, financial intelligence units worldwide are developing better tools to track transactions involving crypto-based scam compounds . This coordinated approach aims to disrupt the financial flows that keep these criminal enterprises operating. Frequently Asked Questions What makes crypto-based scam compounds different from regular scams? These compounds operate as organized criminal enterprises with physical locations where victims are held against their will and forced to commit fraud, making them far more dangerous than typical online scams. Which countries have the highest concentration of these compounds? Interpol specifically identified Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos as primary locations, though the networks operate across multiple Southeast Asian countries. How do victims typically get recruited? Most victims respond to fraudulent job postings that promise high salaries and good working conditions, only to discover the reality once they arrive at the compounds. What types of cryptocurrency scams do they run? These compounds typically execute investment frauds, romance scams, fake exchange platforms, and phishing operations targeting cryptocurrency holders. How can I verify if a job offer is legitimate? Always research companies thoroughly, verify contact information through official channels, and be wary of offers that seem too good to be true. What should I do if I suspect someone is trapped in such a compound? Contact local authorities immediately and provide any available information about the location and circumstances. You can also reach out to international organizations that specialize in human trafficking cases. Help spread awareness about this critical issue – share this article on social media to ensure more people understand the dangers of crypto-based scam compounds and can protect themselves and their loved ones from falling victim to these transnational criminal operations.

This movement signals important changes in market sentiment that could impact your investment decisions. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency market dynamics. This important metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. However, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clear picture of genuine market movements.

The current reading of 21 suggests we’re firmly in Bitcoin season territory.

When the index remains low, it might indicate better opportunities in Bitcoin or established projects.

Dogecoin (DOGE), the first meme currency, however, has been encountering strong technological challenges since it fell below its vital support level of $0.14, which triggered a prediction of the currencies falling to $0.07. In this environment of uncertainty, the presale scheme of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has managed to attract capital through the provision of utility and growth trends. In the emerging environment of investing in the best crypto to buy today and achieve significant gains, there’s a clear shift towards initiatives that exhibit proper foundations. Dogecoin’s Tough Spot The market trend of Dogecoin has shifted to the bear side, and its recent break below the support level of $0.14 indicates its possibility of dropping even further. According to various analysts, the break below this crucial support level makes the downward movement of Dogecoin to levels of $0.13, $0.12, and even $0.10 possible, along with the structural support level of $0.07. Although the meme coin community engagement of 19,000 posts and 2.2 million reactions in a day leads the chart, this level of community engagement has not been enough to halt the fall. The bearish signals from the MACD indicator continue, although the RSI indicator has yet to reach the oversold levels before turning the tide. The disparity from the levels of hype and price performance makes this particular option less attractive as a platform that identifies the best cryptocurrencies to invest in safely. Dominant Presale to Near Completion of Phase 6 In contrast to Dogecoin’s challenges, there lies a tempting and urgent opportunity in the almost presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The platform has shown great support because it has managed to raise over $19,020,000 and has attracted a community of 18,250 holders. The sixth phase of the fundraising has been reached: the platform has sold 95% of the tokens at the current price of $0.035, which has shown a 250% jump from the first phase. This phase will be sold out at a rapid pace and will be the last opportunity to obtain MUTM without its price rising to $0.040 in the next phase. The intended progression towards hitting the $0.06 launch price will allow existing investors to generate substantial growth possibilities and will continue to remain a prime option to consider when investing in the cryptocurrencies available to buy at the current time. Competitive Leaderboard Incentive And adding a level of engagement to its fundraising activities, the Mutuum Finance platform has also improved its presales through the installation of a 24-hour leaderboard. This will create a level of competition to encourage the most active participants. The participant who makes the highest transaction in the 24-hour period will win the bonus of MUTM $500 daily. The leaderboard system also automatically reinitializes at the start of each day at UTC 00:00. This helps to ignite the already existing community and also form the agenda of bringing in new investors who will be interested in the best possible option of investing in the best-crypto available in the market because of the instant benefit provided above its value appreciation in the presale. Sustainable Buy-and-Distribute Strategy Apart from the presale model, the Mutuum Finance platform has been built to retain the value of its tokens through the novel “Buy and Distribute” model. The platform utilizes its fee income to automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. The bought tokens are then distributed to the users who stake their mtTokens. The mtTokens are the interest-bearing receipts received as liquidity. This leads to a virtuous cycle because the usage of the protocol and the generation of fees will be directly proportional to the pressure exerted on the MUTM token from the buy side. This directly relates the success of the platform to the demand for the token. The basic utility of this approach plays a crucial role in making choices about what to buy in the world of cryptocurrencies today when it comes to the mostly non-performing nature of meme coins. Comparing Dogecoin And Mutuum Finance’s Performance Paths DOGE’s failed support levels and bearish outlook point to the dangers of hype coins. MUTM’s close to sold-out presale phase, engaging rewards programs, and sound tokenomics provide a tangible prospect of immense growth. The limited duration of the opportunity to participate at the price of $0.035 is noted. The data-driven momentum presented at Mutuum Finance makes it an attractive option for the type of investor who prioritizes the identification of the best available option in the world of crypto to invest in.

55016474,635467,1764291603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55016474.jpeg,Australia Signals Big Crypto Ambitions With $24B Framework and Tighter Custody Standards,https://bitcoinist.com/australia-signals-crypto-ambitions-24b-framework/,"Australia is accelerating its push into digital finance with the introduction of the Corporations Amendment (Digital Assets Framework) Bill 2025, a comprehensive regulatory overhaul designed to strengthen crypto custody standards, improve investor protection, and unlock an estimated $24 billion in annual economic value. The bill establishes the country’s first comprehensive framework for digital asset platforms and crypto custodians, positioning Australia as one of the most proactive jurisdictions in the global race for crypto regulation. A New Licensing Regime to Protect Consumers The cornerstone of the legislation is a requirement for crypto exchanges and custody providers to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL). This brings them under the supervision of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) , a major structural shift for an industry that previously operated in a fragmented regulatory space. Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino emphasized that Australia must “keep pace” with financial innovation. The bill specifically targets firms holding customer crypto, rather than blockchain technology itself, addressing a widespread concern that companies can currently store unlimited digital assets for clients without adequate safeguards. To close this gap, the bill introduces two new regulated categories: Digital asset platforms Tokenized custody platforms Both will be subject to strict standards for transactions, settlements, asset storage, and mandatory disclosure of risks and fees. Balancing Innovation With Oversight While the legislation imposes tough standards, it also aims to support responsible growth in the digital asset sector. Companies handling less than A$10 million in annual transactions or participating in crypto only as an incidental activity will be exempt from licensing. Industry response has been broadly positive, with firms like Crypto.com and DECA calling the bill a long-awaited step that provides regulatory clarity without stifling innovation. A phased rollout, a 12-month preparation period followed by a six-month transition window, gives platforms time to meet the new requirements. ASIC’s recent crackdown on scams underscores the urgency. Since mid-2023, the regulator has removed over 14,000 phishing and scam sites, approximately 20% of which were related to cryptocurrency. A Transformational Step for Australia’s Digital Finance Future Treasurer Jim Chalmers noted that digital assets, from cryptocurrencies to tokenized real-world assets, represent a significant economic opportunity. Research cited by the government suggests that the reforms could help unlock up to $24 billion annually in productivity and efficiencies across the financial sector. However, industry experts warn that coordination across ASIC, AUSTRAC, and the ATO will be essential. The bill’s success will depend on whether the final regulatory framework is both enforceable and flexible enough to adapt to rapid innovation in tokenization and blockchain services. As the bill moves through Parliament, with easy passage expected in the House, the key question is whether crossbench support in the Senate will solidify Australia’s position as a global leader in secure, innovation-friendly crypto regulation.

Got zeroed.” Scaramucci framed the last 20 trading days as another brutal reminder of crypto’s structural volatility. “I know I have a trap door on my portfolio,” he said. “Once in a while I’ll be walking across the living room feeling beautiful about myself. And then, boom, a trap door opens and I have fallen into the basement of the house.” Related Reading: Will Crypto Explode If Kevin Hassett Takes Over The Fed In 2026? According to Novogratz, this particular trap door opened at Binance. “It started really by, you know, at Binance, they had an oracle which set price misfunction,” he said. That error hit a synthetic stablecoin and “created a cascade where people were getting stopped out because there was the wrong price.” The dislocation then bled into levered perpetual markets “like Hyperliquid, like Uniswap,” where “as prices went down, people started getting liquidated.” He argued that the way crypto participants use leverage turned a technical glitch into a systemic event. “What people don’t understand about crypto is that the crypto investor doesn’t play for 10, 11, 12 percent returns,” he said. “Crypto investor call themselves degens with pride. They want to turn one into 15. And so they trade a very volatile asset with a lot of leverage.” Perpetual futures make that leverage particularly dangerous for liquidity providers. “Perpetual futures are not normal futures,” Novogratz said, crediting “the genius that Arthur Hayes and his group of people” for a design where “as longs get liquidated, they’re paired off against shorts.” In a fast collapse, “you could be short and you lose your short position. Well, if you’re long on another exchange against that short position, you’re shit out of luck. And that happened to a lot of market makers.” Will The Crypto Market Recover? The result, he said, was a sharp loss of liquidity and retail capital. “We lost a lot of liquidity in the market. We lost a lot of retail punters who lost their stack,” he noted, adding that after such a wipeout “it takes a while for Humpty Dumpty to get put back together again.” Novogratz said he initially expected higher levels to hold. “I actually, to be fair, thought we were going to hold at higher levels at $90,000,” he admitted. “And we went all the way to $80,000. $80,000 was a maximum pain point… Got to $1.80 on XRP. We got to $125 on Solana. Real pain points.” He links the subsequent rebound to macro tailwinds, not healed sentiment. “Now we bounce up. We bounce because of the Fed. But we’re not out of the woods,” he said. “I do think Bitcoin will climb back towards $100,000 by the end of the year, but there’ll be sellers waiting there. We’ve done some medium-term damage to the psychology of the market.” Related Reading: Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran On the spot side, he highlighted massive profit-taking by early holders against ETF-driven inflows. “We had one $9 billion seller,” he said. “That’s one-third of all of IBIT’s flows of the year.” As US wealth channels move “from a zero weighting to a 3 to 4 percent weighting” in Bitcoin, that “was met with OG sellers.” “In the long run, that’s healthy,” he said. “In the short run, that’s painful.” Novogratz also argued that crypto is being repriced as a real business ecosystem rather than a pure story. “It’s a transition from just being a story — ‘we’re the most important industry… we’re going to decentralize the world’ — to ‘show me what crypto actually does,’” he said. “Some businesses are making money. Some businesses aren’t. There are some token ecosystems that make common sense to an investor and there’s some that all feel like they’re just an association.” Overlaying it all is a macro backdrop he views as increasingly supportive. He called the Fed’s recent signals and plans to ease bank cash requirements in repo “a monstrous liquidity boom that’s coming,” adding that “they’re going to bring rates down to 2 percent in the next 16 months” and that inflation will “creep higher,” implying negative real rates. For crypto, the message is double-edged: structurally de-levered, with fewer market makers and wounded sentiment, but still tied to a global liquidity cycle that Novogratz believes is turning in its favor — once Humpty Dumpty gets put back together again. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,115.
