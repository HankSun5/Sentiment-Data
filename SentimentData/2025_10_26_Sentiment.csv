The Solana network contributor’s latest disapproval came as a vocal reaction to Changpeng Zhao’s support for a Kyrgyzstan government CBDC pilot. Several hours ago, CZ took to X to reveal what he called “updates from Kyrgyzstan.” In the post, he listed updates such as how the country’s national stablecoin has launched on BNB Chain, how the CBDC is ready for rollout , and how the national cryptocurrency reserve has been set up with BNB included. He also expressed pride in bringing Sign, a platform that describes itself as the blockchain stack built for sovereign nations, to work with Kyrgyzstan. Mert kicks against the idea of CBDCs In his response to CZ, Mert claimed CBDCs are “*entirely* antithetical to what crypto is.” He continued , “We are trading sovereignty for surveillance, everyone must be united in saying NO to this, crypto without privacy is not crypto.” Then in another tweet, he implied that CZ, with all his experience and know-how, should not be one of those “helping nations” develop CBDCs” and called it “incredible to brag about.” “It is insane to me that the most influential person in crypto is not only promoting this, but making it happen, unbelievable, CBDCs are entirely dystopian,” Mert’s statement reads. Quite a number of commenters seemed to agree with Mert’s opinions with a considerable number claiming CZ does not actually care about the industry and will do anything “to pump his bags.” CZ’s progress update comes after his two-day trip to Kyrgyzstan CZ’s ties to Kyrgyzstan have grown since he made his first visit to Kyrgyzstan in May, when he was introduced to President Sadyr Japarov, became a member of the inaugural National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies, and signed a memorandum for crypto and blockchain collaboration. His latest comment about the country came after a second visit, which lasted for two days, and saw him in another meeting with President Sadyr Japarov, where they discussed opportunities in blockchain technology and digital economy expansion. CZ has spoken positively about the visit on X, stating he “had a great time in Kyrgyzstan” over those two days. Aside from his informal meeting with the president, CZ also joined him on a visit to Ala-Archa National Park, an excursion shared by Presidential press secretary Askat Alagozov on Facebook. With its new legislation, which includes a regulatory sandbox for testing financial solutions and a legal framework for virtual assets, stablecoins, and mining, Kyrgyzstan hopes to advance its digital asset strategy, and CZ seems committed to helping, as he has been appointed to the National Council on blockchain development in Kyrgyzstan. The former Binance CEO, who just received a pardon from Trump, has encouraged other crypto companies to explore opportunities in Kyrgyzstan, highlighting the country’s potential for digital innovation and international investment.

The community is divided about how many new NEAR tokens should be printed every year. For months, people in the community have been talking about cutting the network’s inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%. The goal was to balance NEAR token emissions with generated fees. Near is operating at a loss At the moment , the NEAR Protocol pays around $140 million worth of tokens annually to the network validators. But this amount does not make sense compared to NEAR’s total value locked ( TVL ) and generated revenue. The protocol has around $162 million in total value locked (TVL). To make things worse, NEAR Protocol has a lifetime revenue of only $17 million since its inception in 2020. The protocol generated $259,116 in revenue in the last 30 days based on DeFiLlama data . Securing the network is expensive compared to the generated revenue . That’s why the community is trying to fix this issue. They voted on reducing the inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%. More than 50% of voters said yes, but that’s not enough. The voting result should hit a supermajority, which is 66.67% or more. This is part of the protocol’s required rules to count the proposal as an official change. The vote has technically failed to reduce NEAR’s inflation. Devs might cut NEAR emission Some of NEAR’s core developers are hinting that they might still include the emission cut in the next software update anyway. A validator group called Chorus One called that out, saying it’s basically breaking the rules. They wrote on X, “We believe this sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the integrity of NEAR. It gives the impression that decisions can be unilaterally enforced by the core team .” To prevent this scenario, Chorus One believes that NEAR validators must be careful about the changes implemented before installing the next software upgrade. Meanwhile, Louis Thomazeau from L1D Fund defended the idea. He says cutting NEAR’s inflation is just “common sense” and that the token shouldn’t stick to rules so hard it hurts the project. Now the whole community is split. Some people say NEAR has to follow its own governance system because if it doesn’t, the rules stop meaning anything . Others say the protocol should just do what’s best for survival, even if it bends the rules a little. In the past, other well-known projects experienced similar situations that caused a split between the community, validators, and devs . Such scenarios could end up in a hard fork, like Ethereum’s split in 2016 after the infamous DAO hack that exploited millions of ETH tokens. Sometimes, enforcing a manual change could help a protocol survive. In March, a Hyperliquid trader exploited JELLY perpetuals. He basically squeezed the market and caused huge losses for the platform’s HLP vault. The Hyperliquid team delisted the JELLY perps and manually changed the oracle price to close open positions and contain losses. NEAR is currently up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours and trades at $2.29. The token ranks #52 on CoinGecko and is up by 6.5% in the past seven days. NEAR has a market cap of $2.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $101 million. The Layer 1 network token is down by 88.8% from its all-time high of $20.44, which was recorded in mid-2022.

He added that more healthy bullish candles are needed to confirm a shift in momentum. For now, his attention is on the lower timeframes, where he plans to look for the next long opportunity once the current position is secured. Indecisive Daily Close Reflects Market Uncertainty After CPI Data Crypto analyst CryptoWzrd began his analysis by noting the ambiguity in recent price action, stating that the daily Bitcoin candle closed indecisively, although it was green. The primary focus of the past week was the traditional weekly candle close following the release of the US CPI data. Meanwhile, the weekly candle also closed without a clear direction, leaving the overall market structure ambiguous. Related Reading: Analyst Says 55% Chance Bitcoin Bull Run Isn’t Over Yet – Here’s Why The analyst defined a clear condition for the rally to continue. BTC’s ability to push higher is entirely dependent upon holding above the $110,500 resistance level. Maintaining this key floor should generate enough positive momentum to boost the market further upside, targeting the major resistance at $120,000 and potentially higher if conviction remains strong. However, if the price fails to hold $110,500, the market is at risk of declining further. In this scenario, the analyst targets the key technical support level located at $100,000 as the likely floor for the ensuing correction. Regardless of whether Bitcoin executes a bullish or bearish move, the analyst issued a warning regarding the broader market. During the weekend, most altcoins will not forge their own paths but will instead simply mirror the outcome of Bitcoin’s price action. The health of the altcoin market is directly linked to Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD), which the analyst observes as neutral on the daily chart. For altcoins to break free of Bitcoin’s gravitational pull and remain positive, the market requires more structural weakness in BTC.D. On Choppy Price Action & Ongoing Uncertainty CryptoWzrd concluded the analysis by noting that the intraday chart activity had been “somewhat choppy” throughout the day, suggesting a lack of clear directional momentum in the short term. Despite this recent consolidation, the underlying expectation remains bullish.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-sends-strong-warning-to-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"A new scam targeting cryptocurrency users has surfaced, disguised as an official communication from Ledger, one of the world’s leading hardware wallet providers. Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp), a well-known figure in the XRP community and a prominent crypto content creator, was among the first to raise the alarm after sharing an image of the fake letter on X. Warning: a friend just received a letter in the mail from hackers pretending to be from Ledger. You scan the QR code and give them access to your device. Be careful!!! Ledger will not send you something like this. pic.twitter.com/PBRuZgb7Yl — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) October 23, 2025 The Scammer’s Approach The letter, which appears professional and includes Ledger’s logo, a Paris address, and a formal sign-off from a supposed company executive, claims to introduce a new mandatory feature called “Transaction Check.” It instructs users to scan a QR code to activate the feature by October 31, 2025. At first glance, the letter looks legitimate, listing known devices and referencing security updates and compliance requirements. However, scanning the QR code redirects users to a fraudulent website designed to steal sensitive information and compromise wallet security . The scam’s sophistication has caught the attention of the wider crypto community. By copying Ledger’s official style and incorporating detailed text about “global cryptocurrency regulations” and “enhanced transaction verification,” the perpetrators made the letter difficult to distinguish from genuine correspondence. Malicious actors often target hardware wallet users due to the significant assets they store offline. This attempt was designed to exploit user trust in Ledger’s reputation for safety, preying on those who might rush to comply with what appears to be an official security update.

One XRP holder recently lost $3 million from a cold wallet , and the fake notice’s professional tone and specific deadlines were clearly designed to pressure recipients into taking immediate action and causing a similar loss of funds. Incidents like this highlight that even the best hardware security cannot defend against human error. Scams relying on deception remain among the most effective methods for stealing digital assets. Staying Secure in a Targeted Environment Ledger has consistently stated that it does not send physical letters or require QR code scans for any form of activation. Official communications are always conducted through Ledger Live or verified digital channels. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, scams have become more polished and convincing . Jungle Inc’s post serves as a timely reminder that caution remains essential, especially for those managing high-value assets such as XRP.

The call came while Trump was aboard Air Force One, traveling toward Malaysia before heading to Japan and South Korea. Takaichi said she appreciated the congratulations and described the talk as “good and candid.” It was clear from her tone and her own words that she wanted no confusion about her stance on the Japan-U.S. alliance. Takaichi said she intends to place the alliance at the center of her foreign and security policy. She also said she wants to work directly with regional partners toward what she called a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. Takaichi later expanded on the conversation. She said, “I just finished a phone call with President Trump. First of all, he warmly congratulated me on my appointment as Prime Minister, and I was very grateful for his kind words. I conveyed to him that strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance is the top priority for my administration’s foreign and security policy. We confirmed our shared commitment to further elevating the Alliance to new heights.” She also said she expressed respect for Trump’s handling of the recent situation in the Middle East. She added that Japan sees itself as indispensable to the United States in both China strategy and the Indo-Pacific framework. Takaichi also thanked Trump for his previous support on the abduction issue and said she asked for continued cooperation on that matter. She ended the statement by saying she looked forward to welcoming him in Tokyo soon. Takaichi signals direction of Japan’s policy Takaichi’s political path has long been shaped by her late mentor, Shinzo Abe, who stepped down in 2020 and was assassinated in 2022. Abe’s approach, known as Abenomics, involved government spending and cash handouts, even with Japan’s national debt standing near three times the size of the economy. Takaichi has shown no intention of distancing herself from his political direction. Her rise has already had market effects, as shares of military-related companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Yaskawa Electric, and Japan Steel Works saw heavy buying. Investors are betting that her government will put more weight on national defense and industrial capacity tied to security. Her approach to defense lines up with Abe’s. She has made it clear that Japan will not sit lightly on regional security. And with Trump expected to arrive in Japan soon for direct talks, analysts are showing interest in how both leaders frame the next phase of the alliance. Takaichi has described Trump as “cheerful and engaging” after speaking with him. She said he knew details about her political history and even recalled memories of Abe. She said she thanked him for the friendship he has shown to Akie Abe. Alliance priorities and economic commitments Takaichi has already touched on one sensitive topic: Japan’s pledge of $550 billion to the Trump administration under an earlier deal tied to U.S. tariff reductions on Japanese imports . She previously suggested Japan might want to revisit the pledge, given public concern about sending Japanese taxpayer funds abroad, though she later said she would honor the agreement. She did not dwell on public dissatisfaction but pointed out that commitments already made will be kept. The call also shows that both sides intend to keep close coordination. Takaichi said she aims to work side by side with the U.S. and partners in Asia to maintain the Indo-Pacific vision. She reiterated that the alliance stands as the core of her diplomacy. Trump is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with her when he arrives in Japan later in his tour. That meeting will likely touch on military cooperation, regional posture, and economic agreements. With regional tensions running high, neither side appears interested in guesswork or distance.

This figure accounts for nearly one-third of the country’s total foreign currency income in 2024. Bybit Exploit Was the Largest Contributor The MSMT, a coalition of 11 countries formed in October 2024, was created to track how North Korea evades international sanctions through cybercrime. Its latest findings reveal that the scale of crypto theft rose in 2025, with hackers stealing $1.64 billion in the first nine months alone, marking a 50% increase from the $1.19 billion stolen last year. Most of this year’s total came from a February attack on Bybit, which was linked to the TraderTraitor group, also known as Jade Sleet or UNC4899. The hackers targeted SafeWallet, a multi-signature wallet provider for Bybit, using phishing emails and malware to gain access to internal systems. They then disguised external transfers to appear as internal ones, allowing them to take control of the cold wallet’s smart contract and move the funds undetected. According to the MSMT, North Korean hackers often avoid attacking exchanges directly, instead targeting third-party service providers. Groups such as TraderTraitor, CryptoCore, and Citrine Sleet have used fake developer profiles, stolen identities, and detailed knowledge of software supply chains to carry out their attacks. In one notable case, the Web3 project Munchables lost $63 million in a hack, although the funds were later returned after they reportedly faced problems during laundering. How the Laundering Works The analysis reveals a nine-step process used to clean and convert stolen crypto into cash. Hackers begin by swapping stolen assets for Ethereum (ETH) on decentralized exchanges, then use mixing services such as Tornado Cash and Wasabi Wallet to hide transaction trails. The ETH is then converted to Bitcoin (BTC) through bridge platforms, mixed again, stored in cold wallets, and then traded for Tron (TRX) before being converted to USDT. The final step involves sending USDT to over-the-counter brokers who exchange it for cash. Brokers and companies in China, Russia, and Cambodia were identified as key players in this process. In China, nationals Ye Dinrong and Tan Yongzhi of Shenzhen Chain Element Network Technology, along with trader Wang Yicong, helped move funds and create fake IDs. Russian intermediaries converted about $60 million from the Bybit hack through OTC brokers, while Cambodia’s Huione Pay was used to transfer stolen funds despite its license not being renewed by the central bank. The MSMT also said that North Korean hackers have worked with Russian-speaking cybercriminals since the 2010s. In 2025, actors linked to Moonstone Sleet leased ransomware tools from the Russia-based group Qilin. In response, the 11 jurisdictions making up the MSMT issued a joint statement urging UN member countries to raise awareness on these cyber activities and called on the UN Security Council to restore its Panel of Experts “in the same strength and structure it had prior to its disbandment.” The post North Korea’s Crypto Theft Reaches $2.83B Since 2024 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Hacking|North Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|ETH|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-25 21:28:56

According to the analysis, the address in question purchased 249,500 SOL (approximately $46.78 million) through the FalconX and Wintermute platforms in the last 4 days alone. This address reportedly purchased a total of 827,000 SOL (approximately $146 million) since the end of April, staking all of these assets. The average purchase price was calculated at $177.

But even as investors analyze Solana’s price forecast, traders are quietly focusing on what may be the best cheap crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at only $0.035 and in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM is fast becoming the next big crypto in decentralized finance (DeFi). Its novel dual-lending model, which combines Peer-to-Peer and liquidity pool mechanisms, has the potential to revolutionize on-chain lending efficiency to a degree of practical innovation that Solana’s network innovations are yet to maximally leverage. With increasing hype, solid tokenomics, and presale momentum building, Mutuum Finance takes center stage as the low-cap altcoin pacing the field in 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Bulls Eye a Rebound After Key Rejection Solana (SOL) is also experiencing near-term bearish pressure after rejection from the 20-day EMA at approximately $198, an indication that bears continue to control the trend. Price now trades close to the key channel support area of $170 to $165, a must-hold spot for buyers. A bounce off this support and successful retake of the $198–$205 resistance can trigger a short-term rally into the $220+ area, restoring confidence in Solana’s upside momentum. Breakdown below the channel, however, can open the doors for a deeper correction into $155–$145, where buyers can start to re-enter for value plays. Although near-term market sentiment remains bearish, analysts comment that a powerful bounce would be enough to reverse momentum at speed, a scenario that is seeing many traders also looking at high-upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project increasingly coming into view as the most compelling next big crypto opportunities of 2025. Mutuum Finance Breaks New Presale Record Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently the best cheap crypto to buy now in the DeFi sector. Its presale continues to explode, with more than 17,400 investors presently investing in excess of $17.85 million. The token is currently at its lowest potential level of $0.035 in Stage 6, providing a limited-time discount for early participants to join the next big crypto before the upcoming bull market explosion. Mutuum Finance allows holders to generate passive income by lending cryptocurrency assets like USDT to the liquidity pool and receiving returns in the form of annual percentage yield ( APY ), based on market demand. At the same time, lenders can lend without relinquishing holdings by collateralizing assets like ETH to lend USDT, with the interest rate on APY by markets and without a repayment plan, to cover initial stakes but allow flexibility. The platform will reach a key milestone later this year as its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol , Version 1 (V1), will launch live on the Sepolia Testnet. V1 will bring in fundamental DeFi building blocks like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and Liquidator bot, all automated with native ETH and USDT lending, borrowing, and collateralization, offering users a fast, scalable, and secure multi-asset trading experience while freeing their crypto to achieve its highest potential without restrictions. Already raising more than $17.85 million with more than 17,400 investors already signed up, Mutuum Finance’s Phase 6 presale is selling out at a record-breaking speed, with more than 75% of tokens sold. For only $0.035, this is as cheap as MUTM will be before the $0.04 explosion in Phase 7. Early movers are scooping up for what many consider the best cheap crypto to buy now, with actual DeFi functionality and breakthrough potential. While Solana stumbles in momentum, Mutuum Finance is leading buy charts and ruling investor focus as the next big crypto of 2025.

The firm ties Bitcoin’s long-run gains to broad money growth and futures market flows, and it lays out a path that reaches as high as $180,000 before the current bull market ends. Related Reading: XRP Sparks Bullish Frenzy As Top Software Dev Says It Beats ETF Hype VanEck Links Bitcoin To Global Money Supply Reports have disclosed a roughly 0.5 correlation between Bitcoin and total global M2 growth since 2014. Over that span, global liquidity across the top five currencies rose from about $50 trillion to nearly $100 trillion. Bitcoin’s price jumped roughly 700x during the same years. VanEck frames Bitcoin’s current size at about 2% of global money supply and argues that owning less than that share is, in effect, a bet against the asset class. This is a simple, numeric way to link money printing and asset demand. It does not claim perfect prediction, but it does say the connection is meaningful. Futures Flows And Market Fragility Based on reports, futures markets have been a major driver of short-term price moves. VanEck cites that about 73% of Bitcoin’s price variance since October 2020 can be traced to shifts in futures open interest, with a t-statistic of 71 supporting the relationship. Cash collateral backing those contracts sits near $145 billion. Open interest peaked at $52B on Oct. 6 and then fell to $39 billion by Oct. 10 after an eight-hour, 20% plunge in BTC. Borrowed positions have climbed near the 95th percentile at times, though positions above 30% have not held for more than 75 days historically. That pattern shows how crowded bets can unwind fast, and it helps explain sudden swings. Rotation Between Safe Havens And Risk Assets Meanwhile, analysts said that gold’s recent $2.5 trillion market cap correction should be read as a cooling off rather than a loss of faith. They said investors could shift between protection and growth exposure depending on macro prints. Based on reports, a soft US CPI print or easing trade tensions could redirect capital into Bitcoin, supporting scenarios where BTC moves to around $130,000–$132,000 in Q1 2026. Shorter-term targets in VanEck’s work include $129,200 and $141,000, while a clear rise above $125,000 would be taken as a sign of renewed buying strength.

Bearish Indicator Suggests Possible 70% Decline",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-going-to-30000-bearish-macd-indicator/,"The Bitcoin price had another rollercoaster performance in the past week, surging to over $113,000 by mid-week before crashing back down to around $107,000. While the premier cryptocurrency’s price action has steadied in the past few days, market uncertainty still seems to be the order of the day. However, the Bitcoin price seems to be leaning more toward a bearish setup, as suggested by the negative shift of a relevant technical indicator on a longer timeframe. Below is what happened to the price of BTC the last four times this indicator flipped bearish. BTC Price At Risk Of 70% Correction: Analyst In an October 24 post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward a bearish outlook for the price of Bitcoin. The online pundit revealed that the market leader might have returned to a familiar position that has often led to significant losses (approximately 70%) in the past. This bearish prediction is based on the changes in the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator, which shows the relationship between moving averages of an asset’s price (the Bitcoin price, in this context). Typically, a cross of the MACD line above the signal line is a bullish sign for the asset’s price. Meanwhile, when the MACD line crosses beneath the signal line, it indicates that the asset might be taking a bearish structure. As seen in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin MACD line just crossed below the signal line on the monthly timeframe, which means that the flagship cryptocurrency could be gearing up for an extended period of downward price movement. What’s more striking is the historical performance of the Bitcoin price whenever this MACD crossover occurs. According to Martinez, the price of BTC has seen an average drop of 70% in the last four occasions this indicator flipped to negative. The last time the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator turned bearish was in September 2021, starting the eventual descent of the market leader to around $16,000 mark in November 2022. As shown in the chart, the Bitcoin price fell by more than 70% in this period. If history is to go by, this means that the price of BTC is at risk of a 70% decline over the next few months, putting the target at around $33,000 from the current price point.

Here’s What We Know So Far,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trump-to-install-new-pro-crypto-cftc-chair-heres-what-we-know-so-far/,"New reports reveal that United States President Donald Trump has picked pro-crypto Michael Selig as the new chair nominee for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC’s role involves overseeing the futures, options, and crypto markets, ensuring these industries operate fairly and transparently while protecting participants from fraud and manipulation. With Selig being a widely recognized crypto supporter, this move by Trump could significantly impact the regulatory landscape of digital assets. Related Reading: 16,000 Ancient Bitcoins Just Moved—And It’s Costing Whales Billions Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Selig As CFTC Chair According to a Bloomberg report on October 24, Trump selected Selig to chair the CFTC, sending his nominations to the Senate for confirmation hearings. Selig currently serves as the Chief Counsel for the Crypto Task Force and Senior Advisor to the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul S. Atkins. Notably, Selig had also worked as a partner specializing in crypto at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. His career has been closely aligned with the cryptocurrency industry, while harmonizing regulatory strategies for the SEC and the CFTC across both traditional and digital finance sectors. If his nomination is confirmed, Selig would lead the CFTC at a crucial moment, as Congress considers bills that could significantly expand the agency’s oversight and authority of the crypto and digital asset markets. Interestingly, this is not the first time Trump has nominated a candidate for the chair position of the CFTC. Selig’s nomination marks the second attempt to fill the role. Trump previously chose Brian Quintenz, the former commissioner of the CFTC and a previous Head of Policy at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). However, Quintenz was withdrawn from consideration after concerns over potential conflicts of interest were raised by prominent industry figures, including Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Crypto Community Reacts To Selig’s Nomination The crypto community has largely welcomed Selig’s nomination as the CFTC Chair, viewing it as a potential turning point for regulatory clarity in the crypto sector. Chris Dixon, a managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, emphasized the timing of the nomination as crucial for the passage of market structure legislation, noting that Selig’s leadership could provide clear, actionable rules for developers and consumers alike. Kristin Smith, the President of the Solana Institute, praised Selig as an “outstanding choice” whose expertise in the cryptocurrency and regulatory sectors could strengthen coordination between the US SEC and the CFTC. Moreover, she believes that as the next chair of the CFTC, Selig could foster a pro-crypto innovation-friendly environment in the US.

Many expect his tenure to coincide with a more streamlined and supportive regulatory framework, which could potentially accelerate adoption and innovation within the digital asset industry.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-outlook-analyst-says-9-90-is-up-next-heres-why/,"Technical analyst Javon Marks has identified a recurring price structure in XRP’s long-term chart that he believes could lead to a new all-time high. His latest assessment suggests that XRP may be preparing for a breakout that could push its price toward the $9.90 region, marking a substantial increase from its current levels. At the time of his review, XRP was trading around $2.39, facing continued resistance and limited upward momentum. Despite the prevailing weakness, Marks noted that the asset’s broader chart pattern continues to align with the structure of a past bullish cycle that produced a significant price expansion. Historical Reference: XRP’s 2014–2018 Market Cycle Marks based his analysis on XRP’s multi-year price behavior, highlighting that the digital asset is following a nearly identical formation to the one observed between 2014 and 2018. According to his three-day chart data, the structure seen in that earlier cycle preceded one of XRP’s largest historical rallies. Due to the extreme similarities in $XRP 's price structure to a previous bull run, $9.90 looks to be up next for prices to push and they may not stop there. That's an over 309% increase from here. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/0dA4jdaNYt — JAVONMARKS (@JavonTM1) October 24, 2025 During that period, XRP fell to a cycle low of $0.0028 in mid-2014. The asset then rebounded to $0.028 before encountering resistance and retreating to $0.0042 by late 2015. Marks emphasized that even with this decline, XRP maintained a pattern of higher lows, a signal of underlying strength that eventually paved the way for a sustained bullish reversal. By early 2017, XRP had completed its consolidation phase and began accelerating upward. The token climbed to $0.0695 in March of that year before entering a brief cooling phase. This was followed by an extended rally to its historic high of $3.31 in January 2018, marking the culmination of that cycle. Current Cycle Mirrors Historical Pattern According to Marks, the subsequent market cycle appears to be repeating many of the same structural characteristics. After reaching the 2018 peak, XRP dropped to a low of $0.1103 in March 2020, later recovering to a high of $1.96 in April 2021. Following this rise, another correction brought prices down to $0.2910 by mid-2022. Since then, Marks observed that XRP has once again been forming higher lows, mirroring its behavior during the 2014–2016 consolidation period. The asset broke out of this range in late 2024 and surged to $3.4 by early 2025. The current pullback, he explained, may represent a temporary phase before another upward leg begins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Based on his Fibonacci analysis, Marks identified $9.90 as the initial upside target once XRP resumes its rally, corresponding with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. This projection represents a potential gain of 281% from the token’s present value of $2.60. However, he added that further targets at $26.24 and $127 are possible under more extended bullish conditions. Other Analysts Support the Bullish Outlook Marks’ findings align with similar projections from other technical experts. Analyst DustyBC recently highlighted that XRP continues to move within a descending wedge, a pattern that often precedes bullish reversals. According to him, the asset has likely completed its bearish phase, and a breakout from the current wedge formation could propel prices to approximately $3.60 in the near term. Although XRP remains under short-term selling pressure, the consensus among several analysts is that the broader market structure continues to support the potential for another significant rally. If the historical pattern identified by Marks holds, XRP may be entering the early stages of a long-term price expansion phase.

This projection comes amid a favorable crypto regulatory environment in the United States, driving interest in stablecoins and other digital assets. Tether In Funding Talks With Prospective TradFi Investors In a recent post on Friday, Bloomberg shared key developments on Tether Holdings Ltd, operator of the largest stablecoin in the market. Notably, the company’s CEO and popular crypto figure Paolo Ardoino outlined positive profit predictions of $15 billion by 2025’s end, while speaking in an interview at the recent Plan B Forum in Lugano, Switzerland. Bloomberg’s report indicates this projection can be linked to a rapid stablecoin adoption combined with surging investors’ interest in an equity stake in the market’s biggest player. In July, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, thereby creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin operations. The legislation addresses several aspects, such as licensing, reserve requirements, consumer and investor protection, and market structure, thereby helping demystify and provide the needed guardrails for a nascent financial industry. According to Bloomberg, Tether entered discussions with prospective investors last month to raise $20 billion in exchange for a 3% stake in its company. Among these companies reportedly include Japanese firm SoftBank Group Corp. and London-based Ark Investment Management. Paolo Ardoino spoke about these potential investments, explaining Tether’s approach and openness to such partnerships. Ardoino said: We have been contacted by an enormous amount of companies that want to invest in us. We have to draw a line in the sand on a valuation that we think is very cheap. He further added: There are many funds and tech funds that have in their portfolio many companies that could use part of our technology and other offerings that we have. It’s about synergy and creating bigger impact. Tether’s USDT currently boasts a market cap value of $182.92 billion, showcasing a 57.5% dominance in the stablecoin market. The company is reportedly set to launch a new USAT token in December, designed to be a US-focused product in compliance with federal regulations, as indicated by the GENIUS Act. Tether-Backed Rumble Introduces Bitcoin Tip Creators In other news, video-sharing platform Rumble is now set to introduce Bitcoin tipping for its creators, according to its CEO Chris Paglovski, while speaking onstage also at the Plan B Forum in Switzerland. Notably, the company is teaming up with Tether on this feature, with projections of a full rollout in the next five to seven weeks. This development follows the stablecoin issuer’s notable investment of $775 million into Rumble in December 2024.",Tether (USDT)|GENIUS Act|Paolo Ardoino|President Donald Trump|Rumble|Tether|USAT|USDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 23:30:23
53638808,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87551,1761436847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected XRP Price if 80% of XRP Supply Becomes Locked in Staking by 2030,https://timestabloid.com/projected-xrp-price-if-80-of-xrp-supply-becomes-locked-in-staking-by-2030/,"The introduction of staking mechanisms on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could dramatically alter the token’s long-term market dynamics. While XRP has existed for more than a decade without native staking capabilities, several new projects are now filling that gap, raising questions about how large-scale token lockups might affect future prices. Growing Interest in XRP Staking Over the past year, developers have launched multiple initiatives aimed at allowing XRP holders to earn passive yields through staking and decentralized finance applications. Two of the most prominent examples are mXRP and FXRP , both of which were designed to extend the utility of XRP across blockchain networks that support smart contracts. mXRP, which went live in September 2025, operates on the XRP Ledger’s EVM-compatible sidechain. The project was created by Midas, in partnership with Axelar and Interop Labs, and allows participants to earn annual returns of approximately 6% to 10%. Yields are generated through tokenized investment strategies such as liquidity provision and market-making. The developers behind mXRP aim to lock around $10 billion worth of XRP, equivalent to about 3.9 billion tokens based on the current market price of $2.60. This represents roughly 6.5% of the total circulating supply of 60 billion XRP. Meanwhile, FXRP , launched on the Flare Network , offers another avenue for XRP holders to participate in staking-like activities. FXRP acts as a wrapped, overcollateralized version of XRP in ERC-20 format, enabling its use within Flare’s decentralized finance ecosystem. Through this system, holders can lend, trade, and provide liquidity on applications such as SparkDEX. Flare’s roadmap targets securing approximately 5 billion XRP by mid-2026, or 8.3% of the circulating supply. Together, mXRP and FXRP could collectively lock up about 14.8% of XRP in circulation, signaling a growing appetite for yield-based XRP products. Modeling a Scenario Where 80% of XRP Is Locked To understand the potential implications of large-scale token lockups, analysts modeled a scenario in which 80% of all XRP, roughly 48 billion tokens, becomes staked or otherwise locked. At the current price level, this equates to about $122 billion worth of XRP being removed from active circulation, leaving only 12 billion tokens available for trading. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For comparison, Ethereum, which has one of the most developed staking markets, currently has around 29.6% of its total supply staked, demonstrating how staking can meaningfully impact liquidity. When asked to model the potential price effects, Google Gemini described this scenario as a significant supply constraint and simulated several possible outcomes. If the total market capitalization of XRP remained constant, the reduced liquid supply could lift prices to approximately $10.17 per token. However, Gemini also considered a more optimistic case where institutional participation and broader adoption increase XRP’s overall market valuation. Under that assumption, if the market cap expanded to between $500 billion and $1 trillion, XRP’s value could range from $41.67 to $83.33 per token by 2030. Implications for the XRP Ecosystem If staking adoption on XRPL continues to grow, XRP could transition toward a more yield-driven economic model similar to other proof-of-stake ecosystems. This shift would not only affect price dynamics but also alter liquidity conditions and market behavior. While these projections remain speculative, they underscore how staking could play a key role in XRP’s future valuation, particularly as more institutional investors and DeFi platforms integrate the token into their ecosystems.

As AI systems increasingly rely on publicly available online content to train and generate answers, companies like Reddit are trying to draw firm lines over what is considered “public” and “proprietary” data. Reddit’s trap exposes alleged data theft Reddit has filed a lawsuit against Perplexity, a $20 billion AI company, accusing it of illegally collecting data through its platform. According to court documents filed Wednesday in a Manhattan federal court, Reddit said Perplexity ignored instructions not to scrape its content and continued to use Reddit data to generate AI answers. The complaint says Reddit had explicitly blocked Perplexity from collecting its data, but the AI company’s “answer engine” still produced results containing Reddit content. “The increase was so dramatic that an outside observer hypothesized that the increase was due to Perplexity entering a licensing deal with Reddit,” the lawsuit said. “In truth, there is no license between Perplexity and Reddit.” To prove its suspicion, Reddit designed a clever digital test. It created a “trap” post that could only be found by Google’s search engine. Google has a legitimate content-licensing deal with Reddit, and so any company without such a deal should have been unable to access the post. The company described it as the online equivalent of a “marked bill.” If Perplexity’s system reproduced the contents of that hidden post, Reddit would know it had gone around its safeguards possibly by pulling data through Google’s search results, known as SERPs. Within hours, the supposedly private test post began showing up in responses generated by Perplexity’s AI tool. “The only way that Perplexity could have obtained that Reddit content and then used it in its ‘answer engine’ is if it and/or its co-defendants scraped Google SERPs,” the lawsuit stated. Reddit named three data-scraping companies in the suit, Oxylabs UAB, AWM Proxy, and SerpApi. It accused them of helping Perplexity gain unauthorized access to Reddit’s posts, or of selling Reddit’s data to Perplexity. Reddit’s allegations denied Perplexity has rejected Reddit’s allegations . The company’s spokesperson Jesse Dwyer stated that Perplexity “will not tolerate threats against openness and the public interest.” The company also said in a Reddit post after the lawsuit was filed that it “does not train AI models on content.” Representatives of the other companies named in the lawsuit also issued statements. A spokesperson for SerpApi said it plans to “vigorously defend” itself in court. Oxylabs’ chief governance and strategy officer, Denas Grybauskas, said his company was “shocked and disappointed,” adding that Oxylabs “has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection.” In August, Cloudflare, an internet infrastructure company, revealed it had conducted a similar test to see if Perplexity was following web-crawling rules. Cloudflare said it created pages marked with code telling Perplexity’s bots not to access them, but it still found the AI company’s crawlers visiting the restricted pages. Cloudflare’s CEO, Matthew Prince, made headlines by comparing Perplexity’s behavior to that of “North Korean hackers.” Some supposedly “reputable” AI companies act more like North Korean hackers. Time to name, shame, and hard block them. https://t.co/vqMzGRHZPf — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) August 4, 2025 “Some supposedly ‘reputable’ AI companies act more like North Korean hackers,” Prince wrote on X. “Time to name, shame, and hard block them.” Reddit’s lawsuit quoted Prince’s remarks as part of its case.

According to Rubio, the administration is not considering any trade deal with China that would require abandoning support for Taiwan. Rubio told reporters traveling on his plane between Israel and Qatar en route to Asia. “No one is contemplating that.”He was traveling to join President Trump in Doha for a regional meeting in the Asia-Pacific region. The development follows the first day of talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, as the Treasury spokesperson described them as “very constructive”. The world’s two largest economies are seeking to avert an escalation of their trade war and ensure a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping takes place next week. The talks on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit will chart a course forward after Trump threatened new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade restrictions beginning November 1, in response to China’s vastly expanded export controls on rare earth magnets and minerals. Trump and Xi set for high-stakes meeting as trade tensions mount Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly called on the United States to reconsider its longstanding opposition to Taiwan’s independence . China has pushed the Trump administration to officially declare that it “opposes” independence, a move that would represent a significant diplomatic victory for Beijing. Trump is expected to see Xi next week at a regional conference in South Korea, their first in-person meeting since Trump took office in January. Taiwan is a major flashpoint in China’s relationship with the United States, which is already strained over trade, technological transfers, and human rights. Washington remains Taipei’s largest military backer, despite President Trump’s suggestion that the island pay for its own US security. Trump gave a less definitive response when asked earlier about U.S. policy toward Taiwan on Air Force One. “I don’t want to talk about that now. I don’t want to create any complexity. The trip is already complex enough,” Trump said. China doubles down on manufacturing, dimming hopes for a grand bargain The Trump administration has long envisioned what it calls “a big, beautiful rebalancing” between the world’s two largest economies — one in which the United States revives its manufacturing base. At the same time, China boosts domestic consumption to narrow America’s trade deficit and reduce Beijing’s corresponding surpluses. But not China’s Communist Party, it seems. Its most recent five-year economic plan indicates that the vision Trump is offering Beijing remains a low priority. Rather than promoting consumer spending, China is doubling down on its production-driven growth model, prioritizing the establishment of a “modernized industrial system” to number one, up from number two in the old plan, according to a draft unveiled on Thursday. Ranging from 2026 to 2030, the plan prioritizes “seizing the higher ground of scientific-technological development” as its second priority, and stimulating domestic demand as its third. And they will “continue to remain secondary to manufacturing” under the new program, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase who have argued that China must push services-sector growth faster as a source of demand, employment, and income. All signs point to the unlikelihood of a grand bargain as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping prepare for their first face-to-face meeting of the U.S. leader’s second term, set to take place in South Korea on Thursday. According to consultancy Trivium China, “China will double down on driving growth” through manufacturing — a stance that all but guarantees “more trade and investment restrictions from the U.S., Europe, and other major economies as they seek to protect domestic industries.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The bounce signals a possible shift in momentum, but the real test now lies ahead. With the price approaching the crucial golden pocket resistance, a breakthrough is likely to confirm a sustained bullish phase. ETH Bounces Back From Weekly Bull Market Support Band In his recent update on ETH, Luca, a crypto analyst on X, noted that the asset has once again found solid footing at a familiar support area. According to Luca, the price has successfully bounced off the Weekly Bull Market Support Band. This rebound also aligns perfectly with the high-timeframe support range highlighted in his previous PAT updates, reaffirming the technical strength of this level. Related Reading: Ethereum Gathers Strength — Upside Breakout Could Confirm Recovery Phase He emphasized that this move was largely anticipated, as the support zone has repeatedly proven to be a reliable area for bullish reactions whenever ETH enters a corrective phase. The recent bounce signals that buyers are still active and willing to defend key levels, which could set the stage for renewed momentum if sustained. However, Luca urged caution in the short term, pointing out that ETH is now approaching a major resistance zone. This zone corresponds with the golden pocket area between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels, where Ethereum previously encountered selling pressure. A failure to break above this region could result in sideways movement or a minor pullback before any decisive trend shift occurs. ETH Eyes High-Timeframe Resistance Range For Next Leg Up The analyst further explained that if Ethereum manages to break above the current resistance range, it would signal a decisive shift in market structure. Such a move would confirm renewed bullish momentum, paving the way for a mid-term uptrend toward the high-timeframe resistance zone marked in red. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Technical Reset: $3,800 Support May Ignite The Next Wave Upward He added that as long as ETH holds above the “golden pocket” zone after a breakout, the most likely outcome remains further upward. Sustaining momentum above this key area would reinforce the bullish narrative, suggesting that Ethereum could continue climbing toward higher resistance levels without facing major corrections. However, until that breakout occurs, the analyst expects a period of consolidation around the current support band. According to the analyst, this phase would likely serve as a base for a more durable upside reversal in the future. At this time, patience remains essential, as the ongoing structure hints that Ethereum is preparing for a stronger, more sustained rally once the market confirms direction.

His remarks followed an interview with El Diario, in which he pointed out that, just as it is their tradition for the European Central Bank to share its views in statements after each meeting, Escrivá hinted that they would have one soon. According to him, since inflation reached its 2% target, they believe “it is a good time to look ahead and consider that the current interest rates are suitable.” These developments follow remarks by ECB Governing Council member Edward Scicluna, who stated that the central bank should take its time before adjusting interest rates, as the global economy is still grappling with the full impact of the new U.S. trade tariffs . According to him, inflation in Europe may go up if the tariffs raise the prices of imported goods. However, at the same time, prices might also fall if the tariffs slow down global trade and reduce demand for goods and services. Scicluna noted that it would be a mistake to make any rash decisions, as no one can tell for sure which way this will go. Individuals express eagerness for the ECB’s upcoming meeting Individuals have expressed their eagerness to know the ECB’s conclusions on interest rates after sources revealed that the central bank will announce its next rate decision on October 30. Experts have also weighed in, anticipating that the bank will maintain the deposit rate at 2%. Notably, this percentage has been unchanged since June this year. Therefore, with inflation now comfortably within the ECB’s 2% target, economists and markets highlighted that they do not expect any adjustments at the bank’s final meeting in December. Regarding the situation, Escrivá pointed out Spain’s economic success, stating that apart from the country’s strong growth, the positive growth difference compared to Europe is at an all-time high. “This is even more surprising because Spain’s economy has become more connected with the rest of Europe,” the governor of Banco de España, the Bank of Spain, added. On the other hand, reliable sources have indicated that Spain will release its new output data next Wednesday. Following this announcement, some analysts shared their expectations that the country’s economy will grow by 0.6% in the three months leading up to September. This contrasts with the 0.1% growth in the euro zone, where information will be released on Thursday. Europe faces significant challenges in its economy According to a survey of economists from a trusted source, the European Central Bank is expected to maintain borrowing costs in the euro zone at 2% until 2027. This outlook assumes that the deposit rate will be maintained at its current level during next week’s monetary-policy meeting. However, some experts anticipated that there could be additional changes: one-third of those surveyed are looking for at least one more cut, beyond the eight already made, and 17% expect there will be at least one or more increases by the end of next year. The December meeting is important because it will feature new projections that stretch to 2028 for the first time. Meanwhile, under the leadership of their president, Christine Lagarde, analysts have noted that ECB officials do not appear to be adjusting interest rates anytime soon, expressing satisfaction with the rise in consumer prices and Europe’s robust economy. Additionally, they believed that their policy is flexible enough to respond to new challenges. Like any other continent, Europe faces economic challenges. To illustrate, the continent is facing escalating trade friction between the US and China, particularly over semiconductors and rare earth materials. Credit downgrades are also making it a tougher financial situation for France, and there are growing fears about ambitious plans for infrastructure and defense spending in Germany. Additionally, a potential postponement of the continent’s new emissions-trading system could put downward pressure on inflation in the years to come. At the same time, high asset valuations fuel fears of a potential market crash.

Whereas ETH remains the default for the cryptocurrency world, investors searching for what’s the best crypto to buy right now are targeting smaller, growth-high plays. Among the top plays here is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an innovative penny token in Phase 6 presale at $0.035 and over 75% already sold out. MUTM’s innovative dual-lending DeFi platform has the potential to be the next crypto to explode, with predictions of potential 45x returns when it’s listed on major exchanges. As consolidation starts to happen with Ethereum, the focus is turning towards Mutuum Finance with low entry points combined with legitimate long-term growth stories. Ethereum (ETH) Breakout Potential As Investors Become Increasingly Interested Ethereum (ETH) is gaining momentum as funds are exiting traditional safe-haven assets such as gold, indicating the risk-on sentiment returning to crypto. Following a healthy correction, ETH is now trading in a bullish wedge pattern, indicating smart money accumulation before a breakout. A confirmed breakout above the top trendline will trigger a rally to the $4,013 level of resistance, about a 6% increase from the current $3,778 price. Caution prevails, though, as price action still awaits confirmation by volume and overall market stability. As ETH suggests this crucial technical configuration, investors are also looking around for new prospects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fast-evolving project gaining traction as the next crypto to explode in the next bull cycle.

Analyzing the Odds and Requirements,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-to-0-0001-analyzing-the-odds-and-requirements/,"Shiba Inu’s prospects for reaching $0.0001 have become materially more difficult after recent declines in price and activity metrics. Several analysts and community figures previously projected that SHIB could attain the $0.0001 milestone within the current cycle; however, the token’s performance and underlying fundamentals have reduced the likelihood of a near-term achievement. Current price and historical reference At present, SHIB is trading around $0.00001019. Its prior all-time high was $0.00008845. When SHIB reached approximately $0.00003329 in December, closing the gap to $0.0001 required a smaller percentage advance than it does today. On a year-to-date basis, the token has declined by roughly 52.1 percent, underscoring the scale of regained momentum that would be necessary for a renewed run toward $0.0001. Notable forecasts A number of public figures and analysts have offered bullish forecasts in recent months. An anonymous market commentator projected that SHIB could surpass $0.0001 and potentially reach a range between $0.00017 and $0.00032 by the end of 2025. Analyst Eunice Wong published a view that SHIB could trade near $0.000125 during this bull phase. Prominent stakeholder Himanshu Maradiya also stated expectations that the $0.0001 level could materialize within the year. These estimates remain speculative and contingent on several market and project-specific developments. Supply and market capitalization implications A major structural constraint on achieving a $0.0001 price is SHIB’s current circulating supply, which stands at approximately 589.24 trillion tokens. At that price point, the implied market capitalization would be in the vicinity of $58.92 billion. If the effective circulating supply were reduced to roughly 100 trillion through burns or other mechanisms, the market capitalization required to reach $0.0001 would fall to about $10 billion. Under current conditions, producing such a dramatic and sustained reduction in freely tradable supply would require large, ongoing burning activity or concentrated off-exchange accumulation. On-chain activity and developer communications On-chain metrics have softened, total value locked on Shibarium has remained below $1 million since October 8, and daily transaction counts have decreased to under 20,000, a sharp contraction from the multi-million transaction volumes recorded earlier this year. Developer engagement has also drawn scrutiny. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has adopted a more private posture for public communications, including setting a social account to private, which has contributed to uncertainty among some investors and observers regarding the project’s roadmap and operational cadence. Competitive landscape and shifting capital flows The meme coin sector has expanded, and several new tokens have captured investor attention and capital. The launch of themed projects such as the Official Trump token has intensified competition for retail allocations and social media attention. As capital rotates toward newly issued meme assets, SHIB faces increasing difficulty in regaining the dominant community momentum it previously enjoyed. Required catalysts A realistic pathway to $0.0001 would require several concurrent developments, demonstrable increases in ecosystem usage and utility, a substantial and verifiable program of token burns that meaningfully reduces circulating supply, renewed and measurable community engagement, and clearer, more consistent public communication from core contributors. Isolated improvements in a single area are unlikely to generate the sustained demand necessary to support the valuation implied by $0.0001. Given current on-chain indicators, supply dynamics, and market composition, the probability of SHIB reaching $0.0001 in the near term is diminished relative to earlier projections. The target remains possible only if multiple structural and market conditions change in a coordinated manner. Until such shifts occur, achieving $0.0001 appears to require a prolonged period of favorable developments rather than an imminent market move.

53642709,614048,1761440455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53642709.jpeg,Is Ripple Tapping Into A $12 Trillion Industry? Pundit Breaks Down US Repo Market,https://bitcoinist.com/is-ripple-tapping-into-a-12-trillion-industry-pundit-breaks-down-us-repo-market/,"The discussions surrounding Ripple’s strategic expansion have reached a fever pitch, with analysts suggesting that the crypto payments company may be positioning itself to tap into a new $12 trillion United States (US) repo market. Recent reports and acquisitions hint that Ripple’s growing ambition to bridge digital assets with Wall Street’s largest liquidity systems could significantly influence XRP’s utility beyond cross-border payments . Ripple Eyes Entry Into $12 Trillion Repo Market A recent X post by a crypto analyst known as ‘X Finance Bull’ has ignited discussions in the crypto community, claiming that Ripple’s latest acquisitions signal a direct entry into the US repo market . Contrary to the previously cited $6 trillion valuation, the expert disclosed that the repo market’s actual value may be nearly twice as high, approaching $12 trillion and making it one of the largest liquidity pools in the world. The repo market, which X Finance Bull calls the “real liquidity backbone of the global finance system,” plays a vital role in facilitating short-term funding and liquidity throughout international economies. Ripple’s strategic entrance into this domain could mark a new chapter in how capital moves across borders and institutions. Moreover, the analyst mentioned that Ripple’s recent acquisition of cloud-based SaaS platform, GTreasury and prime brokerage Hidden Road appears to be pivotal in its strategy to tap into the $12 trillion repo market. According to the analyst, these moves extend Ripple’s reach beyond traditional remittance and cross-border payment solutions, unlocking idle capital that resides within some of the world’s most powerful financial markets. GTreasury, for one, provides Ripple access to sophisticated capital management infrastructures. Combined with Hidden Road, the crypto company now sits at the intersection of traditional finance and digital asset liquidity. X Finance Bull stressed that Ripple is building “the foundation of modern monetary plumbing,” and now it is paired with 24/7, 365-day real-time settlement powered by a decentralized ledger . He urged market observers not to focus solely on the XRP price but on Ripple’s strategic positioning. Ripple CEO Announces Complete Acquisition Of Hidden Road Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on October 24 that the company has officially finalized the acquisition of Hidden Road , which will now operate under the name “Ripple Prime.” This development marks the crypto firm’s fifth major acquisition in roughly two years, joining GTreasury last week, Rail in August 2025 , Standard Custody in 2024, and Metaco in 2023. With these acquisitions, Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple is building solutions toward enabling an “internet of value.” The CEO reminded the community that XRP remains central to every aspect of Ripple’s expanding network. The launch of Ripple Prime also marks a significant milestone, making Ripple the first-ever cryptocurrency firm to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime brokerage.

Recent data from an on-chain analysis sheds light on one of the underlying factors behind the market struggle. Related Reading: Binance Stablecoin Supply Surges To Record $42B: Liquidity Flows Back Into Markets Stablecoin Netflow In Downtrend — Analyst In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, a market analyst with the username CryptoOnchain reported an interesting change in stablecoin activity on the Binance exchange. This analysis is based on readings from the ‘Total Stablecoin Netflow On Binance (Last 60 Days) & 7-Day MA ‘ and shows potentially compelling implications for the general market. According to CryptoOnchain, the 7-day moving average of the combined stablecoin netflow (purple line) has decisively dipped beneath the ‘zero’ mark, marking a shift from sustained inflows to accelerating outflows. Crypto Onchain further explained that the downward trend seen in the stablecoin netflow chart has been reinforced by significant spikes in outflows occurring over the past two days. With neither of the two major categories excluded, this ‘capital flight’ involves stablecoins both on the TRC20 network (one of which is USDT), and those operating under the ERC20 network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Hits Seven-Year Low As Accumulators Stack 373,700 BTC In A Month Market Outlook In The Short Term Generally, an increase in stablecoin netflow to exchange platforms reflects an increasing demand for cryptocurrencies, as stablecoins are mostly exchanged for other online assets. Therefore, the decrease in stablecoin netflow presently seen signals reduced interest in other risky assets and a growing inclination among market participants to exclude themselves from participating in a risky market environment. This pattern of capital exiting exchanges, especially after a major price correction, typically points to what the analyst termed “a weakening ‘buy the dip’ appetite.” If history is anything to go by, this could be an early sign that the crypto market is about to see an even more intense amount of bearish pressure, especially in the short term. As of this writing, Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, stands at a valuation of approximately $111,400, showing a slight price growth of 0.54% over the past day. Also showing a similarly minute appreciation over the past 24 hours is Ethereum, which is worth about $3,936. Meanwhile, the total stablecoin market cap remains valued at $319 billion following a 0.14% gain in the past day.

The meeting was purposed to address key issues, including China’s export controls on rare earths and semiconductors, which German officials believe pose risks to fair trade and supply-chain security. Wadephul, a member of Merz’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), decided to delay his visit on Friday, October 24, when Beijing confirmed only one of the meetings he had requested. The delay underscores growing uncertainty in global trade relations, particularly concerning access to critical materials essential for Germany’s manufacturing and technology sectors. German officials stress the need to rethink the country’s approach to China Officials in Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s government called for a change in the country’s approach towards China. This was after Wadephul postponed his trip to Beijing. In a statement, Adis Ahmetovic, a representative for the Social Democrats on foreign policy, mentioned that the Foreign Minister’s last-minute cancellation of his visit to China was a bad sign for improving the strained China-Germany relationship . “We must reconsider Germany’s strategy toward China. Now more than ever, we need an active and strategic foreign policy emphasizing dialogue, transparency, and long-term goals,” he added. Meanwhile, according to European economic rankings, Germany is the largest economy. This outstanding achievement is credited to the country’s involvement with China in trade. Notably, China, being Germany’s leading trading partner, is the biggest economy in Asia. Regarding Wadephul’s decision to postpone his trip to Beijing, Wang Yi, the spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry, stated that the only meeting Beijing had agreed to during Wadephul’s scheduled visit was with his direct counterpart. This situation sparked heated debates among individuals who expressed concerns about the limitations on rare earth exports. When reports reached out to Wadephul to comment on the topic of discussion, the Foreign Minister mentioned that he intends to encourage China to relax its export restrictions on rare earths and semiconductors in his upcoming trip, which is scheduled to commence on Sunday, October 26. He also emphasized that fair trade is crucial for successful relations. China-Germany relationship faces uncertainties amid global trade tensions In a China strategy agreed upon in 2023, Berlin identified the need to lower risks in the China-Germany economic relationship and characterized Beijing as a partner, competitor, and systemic rival. Regarding their trade ties, China supplies Germany with critical components, including rare earths and semiconductors, which have faced significant shortages amid increasing global trade tensions. Analysts responded to the situation, urging the country to develop a solution before it is too late. To address this, Ahmetovic suggested that they should talk directly to China, emphasizing the importance of direct talks during times of global tension. He also believed that discussions must be broadened, especially on topics such as peace, security, the economy, trade, and human rights. Jürgen Hardt, the foreign policy representative for the CDU, also commented on the topic of discussion. Based on Hardt’s argument, China aimed to use trade policies to exert pressure and supported Wadephul’s decision to delay the trip. He noted that the German government is not participating in this approach but still values strong and fair relations with Beijing. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.
