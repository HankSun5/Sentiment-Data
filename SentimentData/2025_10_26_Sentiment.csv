The Solana network contributor’s latest disapproval came as a vocal reaction to Changpeng Zhao’s support for a Kyrgyzstan government CBDC pilot. Several hours ago, CZ took to X to reveal what he called “updates from Kyrgyzstan.” In the post, he listed updates such as how the country’s national stablecoin has launched on BNB Chain, how the CBDC is ready for rollout , and how the national cryptocurrency reserve has been set up with BNB included. He also expressed pride in bringing Sign, a platform that describes itself as the blockchain stack built for sovereign nations, to work with Kyrgyzstan. Mert kicks against the idea of CBDCs In his response to CZ, Mert claimed CBDCs are “*entirely* antithetical to what crypto is.” He continued , “We are trading sovereignty for surveillance, everyone must be united in saying NO to this, crypto without privacy is not crypto.” Then in another tweet, he implied that CZ, with all his experience and know-how, should not be one of those “helping nations” develop CBDCs” and called it “incredible to brag about.” “It is insane to me that the most influential person in crypto is not only promoting this, but making it happen, unbelievable, CBDCs are entirely dystopian,” Mert’s statement reads. Quite a number of commenters seemed to agree with Mert’s opinions with a considerable number claiming CZ does not actually care about the industry and will do anything “to pump his bags.” CZ’s progress update comes after his two-day trip to Kyrgyzstan CZ’s ties to Kyrgyzstan have grown since he made his first visit to Kyrgyzstan in May, when he was introduced to President Sadyr Japarov, became a member of the inaugural National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies, and signed a memorandum for crypto and blockchain collaboration. His latest comment about the country came after a second visit, which lasted for two days, and saw him in another meeting with President Sadyr Japarov, where they discussed opportunities in blockchain technology and digital economy expansion. CZ has spoken positively about the visit on X, stating he “had a great time in Kyrgyzstan” over those two days. Aside from his informal meeting with the president, CZ also joined him on a visit to Ala-Archa National Park, an excursion shared by Presidential press secretary Askat Alagozov on Facebook. With its new legislation, which includes a regulatory sandbox for testing financial solutions and a legal framework for virtual assets, stablecoins, and mining, Kyrgyzstan hopes to advance its digital asset strategy, and CZ seems committed to helping, as he has been appointed to the National Council on blockchain development in Kyrgyzstan. The former Binance CEO, who just received a pardon from Trump, has encouraged other crypto companies to explore opportunities in Kyrgyzstan, highlighting the country’s potential for digital innovation and international investment.

The community is divided about how many new NEAR tokens should be printed every year. For months, people in the community have been talking about cutting the network’s inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%. The goal was to balance NEAR token emissions with generated fees. Near is operating at a loss At the moment , the NEAR Protocol pays around $140 million worth of tokens annually to the network validators. But this amount does not make sense compared to NEAR’s total value locked ( TVL ) and generated revenue. The protocol has around $162 million in total value locked (TVL). To make things worse, NEAR Protocol has a lifetime revenue of only $17 million since its inception in 2020. The protocol generated $259,116 in revenue in the last 30 days based on DeFiLlama data . Securing the network is expensive compared to the generated revenue . That’s why the community is trying to fix this issue. They voted on reducing the inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%. More than 50% of voters said yes, but that’s not enough. The voting result should hit a supermajority, which is 66.67% or more. This is part of the protocol’s required rules to count the proposal as an official change. The vote has technically failed to reduce NEAR’s inflation. Devs might cut NEAR emission Some of NEAR’s core developers are hinting that they might still include the emission cut in the next software update anyway. A validator group called Chorus One called that out, saying it’s basically breaking the rules. They wrote on X, “We believe this sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the integrity of NEAR. It gives the impression that decisions can be unilaterally enforced by the core team .” To prevent this scenario, Chorus One believes that NEAR validators must be careful about the changes implemented before installing the next software upgrade. Meanwhile, Louis Thomazeau from L1D Fund defended the idea. He says cutting NEAR’s inflation is just “common sense” and that the token shouldn’t stick to rules so hard it hurts the project. Now the whole community is split. Some people say NEAR has to follow its own governance system because if it doesn’t, the rules stop meaning anything . Others say the protocol should just do what’s best for survival, even if it bends the rules a little. In the past, other well-known projects experienced similar situations that caused a split between the community, validators, and devs . Such scenarios could end up in a hard fork, like Ethereum’s split in 2016 after the infamous DAO hack that exploited millions of ETH tokens. Sometimes, enforcing a manual change could help a protocol survive. In March, a Hyperliquid trader exploited JELLY perpetuals. He basically squeezed the market and caused huge losses for the platform’s HLP vault. The Hyperliquid team delisted the JELLY perps and manually changed the oracle price to close open positions and contain losses. NEAR is currently up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours and trades at $2.29. The token ranks #52 on CoinGecko and is up by 6.5% in the past seven days. NEAR has a market cap of $2.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $101 million. The Layer 1 network token is down by 88.8% from its all-time high of $20.44, which was recorded in mid-2022.

He added that more healthy bullish candles are needed to confirm a shift in momentum. For now, his attention is on the lower timeframes, where he plans to look for the next long opportunity once the current position is secured. Indecisive Daily Close Reflects Market Uncertainty After CPI Data Crypto analyst CryptoWzrd began his analysis by noting the ambiguity in recent price action, stating that the daily Bitcoin candle closed indecisively, although it was green. The primary focus of the past week was the traditional weekly candle close following the release of the US CPI data. Meanwhile, the weekly candle also closed without a clear direction, leaving the overall market structure ambiguous. Related Reading: Analyst Says 55% Chance Bitcoin Bull Run Isn’t Over Yet – Here’s Why The analyst defined a clear condition for the rally to continue. BTC’s ability to push higher is entirely dependent upon holding above the $110,500 resistance level. Maintaining this key floor should generate enough positive momentum to boost the market further upside, targeting the major resistance at $120,000 and potentially higher if conviction remains strong. However, if the price fails to hold $110,500, the market is at risk of declining further. In this scenario, the analyst targets the key technical support level located at $100,000 as the likely floor for the ensuing correction. Regardless of whether Bitcoin executes a bullish or bearish move, the analyst issued a warning regarding the broader market. During the weekend, most altcoins will not forge their own paths but will instead simply mirror the outcome of Bitcoin’s price action. The health of the altcoin market is directly linked to Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD), which the analyst observes as neutral on the daily chart. For altcoins to break free of Bitcoin’s gravitational pull and remain positive, the market requires more structural weakness in BTC.D. On Choppy Price Action & Ongoing Uncertainty CryptoWzrd concluded the analysis by noting that the intraday chart activity had been “somewhat choppy” throughout the day, suggesting a lack of clear directional momentum in the short term. Despite this recent consolidation, the underlying expectation remains bullish.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-sends-strong-warning-to-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"A new scam targeting cryptocurrency users has surfaced, disguised as an official communication from Ledger, one of the world’s leading hardware wallet providers. Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp), a well-known figure in the XRP community and a prominent crypto content creator, was among the first to raise the alarm after sharing an image of the fake letter on X. Warning: a friend just received a letter in the mail from hackers pretending to be from Ledger. You scan the QR code and give them access to your device. Be careful!!! Ledger will not send you something like this. pic.twitter.com/PBRuZgb7Yl — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) October 23, 2025 The Scammer’s Approach The letter, which appears professional and includes Ledger’s logo, a Paris address, and a formal sign-off from a supposed company executive, claims to introduce a new mandatory feature called “Transaction Check.” It instructs users to scan a QR code to activate the feature by October 31, 2025. At first glance, the letter looks legitimate, listing known devices and referencing security updates and compliance requirements. However, scanning the QR code redirects users to a fraudulent website designed to steal sensitive information and compromise wallet security . The scam’s sophistication has caught the attention of the wider crypto community. By copying Ledger’s official style and incorporating detailed text about “global cryptocurrency regulations” and “enhanced transaction verification,” the perpetrators made the letter difficult to distinguish from genuine correspondence. Malicious actors often target hardware wallet users due to the significant assets they store offline. This attempt was designed to exploit user trust in Ledger’s reputation for safety, preying on those who might rush to comply with what appears to be an official security update.

One XRP holder recently lost $3 million from a cold wallet , and the fake notice’s professional tone and specific deadlines were clearly designed to pressure recipients into taking immediate action and causing a similar loss of funds. Incidents like this highlight that even the best hardware security cannot defend against human error. Scams relying on deception remain among the most effective methods for stealing digital assets. Staying Secure in a Targeted Environment Ledger has consistently stated that it does not send physical letters or require QR code scans for any form of activation. Official communications are always conducted through Ledger Live or verified digital channels. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, scams have become more polished and convincing . Jungle Inc’s post serves as a timely reminder that caution remains essential, especially for those managing high-value assets such as XRP.

The call came while Trump was aboard Air Force One, traveling toward Malaysia before heading to Japan and South Korea. Takaichi said she appreciated the congratulations and described the talk as “good and candid.” It was clear from her tone and her own words that she wanted no confusion about her stance on the Japan-U.S. alliance. Takaichi said she intends to place the alliance at the center of her foreign and security policy. She also said she wants to work directly with regional partners toward what she called a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. Takaichi later expanded on the conversation. She said, “I just finished a phone call with President Trump. First of all, he warmly congratulated me on my appointment as Prime Minister, and I was very grateful for his kind words. I conveyed to him that strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance is the top priority for my administration’s foreign and security policy. We confirmed our shared commitment to further elevating the Alliance to new heights.” She also said she expressed respect for Trump’s handling of the recent situation in the Middle East. She added that Japan sees itself as indispensable to the United States in both China strategy and the Indo-Pacific framework. Takaichi also thanked Trump for his previous support on the abduction issue and said she asked for continued cooperation on that matter. She ended the statement by saying she looked forward to welcoming him in Tokyo soon. Takaichi signals direction of Japan’s policy Takaichi’s political path has long been shaped by her late mentor, Shinzo Abe, who stepped down in 2020 and was assassinated in 2022. Abe’s approach, known as Abenomics, involved government spending and cash handouts, even with Japan’s national debt standing near three times the size of the economy. Takaichi has shown no intention of distancing herself from his political direction. Her rise has already had market effects, as shares of military-related companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Yaskawa Electric, and Japan Steel Works saw heavy buying. Investors are betting that her government will put more weight on national defense and industrial capacity tied to security. Her approach to defense lines up with Abe’s. She has made it clear that Japan will not sit lightly on regional security. And with Trump expected to arrive in Japan soon for direct talks, analysts are showing interest in how both leaders frame the next phase of the alliance. Takaichi has described Trump as “cheerful and engaging” after speaking with him. She said he knew details about her political history and even recalled memories of Abe. She said she thanked him for the friendship he has shown to Akie Abe. Alliance priorities and economic commitments Takaichi has already touched on one sensitive topic: Japan’s pledge of $550 billion to the Trump administration under an earlier deal tied to U.S. tariff reductions on Japanese imports . She previously suggested Japan might want to revisit the pledge, given public concern about sending Japanese taxpayer funds abroad, though she later said she would honor the agreement. She did not dwell on public dissatisfaction but pointed out that commitments already made will be kept. The call also shows that both sides intend to keep close coordination. Takaichi said she aims to work side by side with the U.S. and partners in Asia to maintain the Indo-Pacific vision. She reiterated that the alliance stands as the core of her diplomacy. Trump is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with her when he arrives in Japan later in his tour. That meeting will likely touch on military cooperation, regional posture, and economic agreements. With regional tensions running high, neither side appears interested in guesswork or distance.

This figure accounts for nearly one-third of the country’s total foreign currency income in 2024. Bybit Exploit Was the Largest Contributor The MSMT, a coalition of 11 countries formed in October 2024, was created to track how North Korea evades international sanctions through cybercrime. Its latest findings reveal that the scale of crypto theft rose in 2025, with hackers stealing $1.64 billion in the first nine months alone, marking a 50% increase from the $1.19 billion stolen last year. Most of this year’s total came from a February attack on Bybit, which was linked to the TraderTraitor group, also known as Jade Sleet or UNC4899. The hackers targeted SafeWallet, a multi-signature wallet provider for Bybit, using phishing emails and malware to gain access to internal systems. They then disguised external transfers to appear as internal ones, allowing them to take control of the cold wallet’s smart contract and move the funds undetected. According to the MSMT, North Korean hackers often avoid attacking exchanges directly, instead targeting third-party service providers. Groups such as TraderTraitor, CryptoCore, and Citrine Sleet have used fake developer profiles, stolen identities, and detailed knowledge of software supply chains to carry out their attacks. In one notable case, the Web3 project Munchables lost $63 million in a hack, although the funds were later returned after they reportedly faced problems during laundering. How the Laundering Works The analysis reveals a nine-step process used to clean and convert stolen crypto into cash. Hackers begin by swapping stolen assets for Ethereum (ETH) on decentralized exchanges, then use mixing services such as Tornado Cash and Wasabi Wallet to hide transaction trails. The ETH is then converted to Bitcoin (BTC) through bridge platforms, mixed again, stored in cold wallets, and then traded for Tron (TRX) before being converted to USDT. The final step involves sending USDT to over-the-counter brokers who exchange it for cash. Brokers and companies in China, Russia, and Cambodia were identified as key players in this process. In China, nationals Ye Dinrong and Tan Yongzhi of Shenzhen Chain Element Network Technology, along with trader Wang Yicong, helped move funds and create fake IDs. Russian intermediaries converted about $60 million from the Bybit hack through OTC brokers, while Cambodia’s Huione Pay was used to transfer stolen funds despite its license not being renewed by the central bank. The MSMT also said that North Korean hackers have worked with Russian-speaking cybercriminals since the 2010s. In 2025, actors linked to Moonstone Sleet leased ransomware tools from the Russia-based group Qilin. In response, the 11 jurisdictions making up the MSMT issued a joint statement urging UN member countries to raise awareness on these cyber activities and called on the UN Security Council to restore its Panel of Experts “in the same strength and structure it had prior to its disbandment.” The post North Korea’s Crypto Theft Reaches $2.83B Since 2024 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Hacking|North Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|ETH|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-25 21:28:56

According to the analysis, the address in question purchased 249,500 SOL (approximately $46.78 million) through the FalconX and Wintermute platforms in the last 4 days alone. This address reportedly purchased a total of 827,000 SOL (approximately $146 million) since the end of April, staking all of these assets. The average purchase price was calculated at $177.

But even as investors analyze Solana’s price forecast, traders are quietly focusing on what may be the best cheap crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at only $0.035 and in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM is fast becoming the next big crypto in decentralized finance (DeFi). Its novel dual-lending model, which combines Peer-to-Peer and liquidity pool mechanisms, has the potential to revolutionize on-chain lending efficiency to a degree of practical innovation that Solana’s network innovations are yet to maximally leverage. With increasing hype, solid tokenomics, and presale momentum building, Mutuum Finance takes center stage as the low-cap altcoin pacing the field in 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Bulls Eye a Rebound After Key Rejection Solana (SOL) is also experiencing near-term bearish pressure after rejection from the 20-day EMA at approximately $198, an indication that bears continue to control the trend. Price now trades close to the key channel support area of $170 to $165, a must-hold spot for buyers. A bounce off this support and successful retake of the $198–$205 resistance can trigger a short-term rally into the $220+ area, restoring confidence in Solana’s upside momentum. Breakdown below the channel, however, can open the doors for a deeper correction into $155–$145, where buyers can start to re-enter for value plays. Although near-term market sentiment remains bearish, analysts comment that a powerful bounce would be enough to reverse momentum at speed, a scenario that is seeing many traders also looking at high-upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project increasingly coming into view as the most compelling next big crypto opportunities of 2025. Mutuum Finance Breaks New Presale Record Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently the best cheap crypto to buy now in the DeFi sector. Its presale continues to explode, with more than 17,400 investors presently investing in excess of $17.85 million. The token is currently at its lowest potential level of $0.035 in Stage 6, providing a limited-time discount for early participants to join the next big crypto before the upcoming bull market explosion. Mutuum Finance allows holders to generate passive income by lending cryptocurrency assets like USDT to the liquidity pool and receiving returns in the form of annual percentage yield ( APY ), based on market demand. At the same time, lenders can lend without relinquishing holdings by collateralizing assets like ETH to lend USDT, with the interest rate on APY by markets and without a repayment plan, to cover initial stakes but allow flexibility. The platform will reach a key milestone later this year as its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol , Version 1 (V1), will launch live on the Sepolia Testnet. V1 will bring in fundamental DeFi building blocks like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and Liquidator bot, all automated with native ETH and USDT lending, borrowing, and collateralization, offering users a fast, scalable, and secure multi-asset trading experience while freeing their crypto to achieve its highest potential without restrictions. Already raising more than $17.85 million with more than 17,400 investors already signed up, Mutuum Finance’s Phase 6 presale is selling out at a record-breaking speed, with more than 75% of tokens sold. For only $0.035, this is as cheap as MUTM will be before the $0.04 explosion in Phase 7. Early movers are scooping up for what many consider the best cheap crypto to buy now, with actual DeFi functionality and breakthrough potential. While Solana stumbles in momentum, Mutuum Finance is leading buy charts and ruling investor focus as the next big crypto of 2025.

The firm ties Bitcoin’s long-run gains to broad money growth and futures market flows, and it lays out a path that reaches as high as $180,000 before the current bull market ends. Related Reading: XRP Sparks Bullish Frenzy As Top Software Dev Says It Beats ETF Hype VanEck Links Bitcoin To Global Money Supply Reports have disclosed a roughly 0.5 correlation between Bitcoin and total global M2 growth since 2014. Over that span, global liquidity across the top five currencies rose from about $50 trillion to nearly $100 trillion. Bitcoin’s price jumped roughly 700x during the same years. VanEck frames Bitcoin’s current size at about 2% of global money supply and argues that owning less than that share is, in effect, a bet against the asset class. This is a simple, numeric way to link money printing and asset demand. It does not claim perfect prediction, but it does say the connection is meaningful. Futures Flows And Market Fragility Based on reports, futures markets have been a major driver of short-term price moves. VanEck cites that about 73% of Bitcoin’s price variance since October 2020 can be traced to shifts in futures open interest, with a t-statistic of 71 supporting the relationship. Cash collateral backing those contracts sits near $145 billion. Open interest peaked at $52B on Oct. 6 and then fell to $39 billion by Oct. 10 after an eight-hour, 20% plunge in BTC. Borrowed positions have climbed near the 95th percentile at times, though positions above 30% have not held for more than 75 days historically. That pattern shows how crowded bets can unwind fast, and it helps explain sudden swings. Rotation Between Safe Havens And Risk Assets Meanwhile, analysts said that gold’s recent $2.5 trillion market cap correction should be read as a cooling off rather than a loss of faith. They said investors could shift between protection and growth exposure depending on macro prints. Based on reports, a soft US CPI print or easing trade tensions could redirect capital into Bitcoin, supporting scenarios where BTC moves to around $130,000–$132,000 in Q1 2026. Shorter-term targets in VanEck’s work include $129,200 and $141,000, while a clear rise above $125,000 would be taken as a sign of renewed buying strength.

Bearish Indicator Suggests Possible 70% Decline",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-going-to-30000-bearish-macd-indicator/,"The Bitcoin price had another rollercoaster performance in the past week, surging to over $113,000 by mid-week before crashing back down to around $107,000. While the premier cryptocurrency’s price action has steadied in the past few days, market uncertainty still seems to be the order of the day. However, the Bitcoin price seems to be leaning more toward a bearish setup, as suggested by the negative shift of a relevant technical indicator on a longer timeframe. Below is what happened to the price of BTC the last four times this indicator flipped bearish. BTC Price At Risk Of 70% Correction: Analyst In an October 24 post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward a bearish outlook for the price of Bitcoin. The online pundit revealed that the market leader might have returned to a familiar position that has often led to significant losses (approximately 70%) in the past. This bearish prediction is based on the changes in the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator, which shows the relationship between moving averages of an asset’s price (the Bitcoin price, in this context). Typically, a cross of the MACD line above the signal line is a bullish sign for the asset’s price. Meanwhile, when the MACD line crosses beneath the signal line, it indicates that the asset might be taking a bearish structure. As seen in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin MACD line just crossed below the signal line on the monthly timeframe, which means that the flagship cryptocurrency could be gearing up for an extended period of downward price movement. What’s more striking is the historical performance of the Bitcoin price whenever this MACD crossover occurs. According to Martinez, the price of BTC has seen an average drop of 70% in the last four occasions this indicator flipped to negative. The last time the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator turned bearish was in September 2021, starting the eventual descent of the market leader to around $16,000 mark in November 2022. As shown in the chart, the Bitcoin price fell by more than 70% in this period. If history is to go by, this means that the price of BTC is at risk of a 70% decline over the next few months, putting the target at around $33,000 from the current price point.

Here’s What We Know So Far,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trump-to-install-new-pro-crypto-cftc-chair-heres-what-we-know-so-far/,"New reports reveal that United States President Donald Trump has picked pro-crypto Michael Selig as the new chair nominee for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC’s role involves overseeing the futures, options, and crypto markets, ensuring these industries operate fairly and transparently while protecting participants from fraud and manipulation. With Selig being a widely recognized crypto supporter, this move by Trump could significantly impact the regulatory landscape of digital assets. Related Reading: 16,000 Ancient Bitcoins Just Moved—And It’s Costing Whales Billions Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Selig As CFTC Chair According to a Bloomberg report on October 24, Trump selected Selig to chair the CFTC, sending his nominations to the Senate for confirmation hearings. Selig currently serves as the Chief Counsel for the Crypto Task Force and Senior Advisor to the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul S. Atkins. Notably, Selig had also worked as a partner specializing in crypto at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. His career has been closely aligned with the cryptocurrency industry, while harmonizing regulatory strategies for the SEC and the CFTC across both traditional and digital finance sectors. If his nomination is confirmed, Selig would lead the CFTC at a crucial moment, as Congress considers bills that could significantly expand the agency’s oversight and authority of the crypto and digital asset markets. Interestingly, this is not the first time Trump has nominated a candidate for the chair position of the CFTC. Selig’s nomination marks the second attempt to fill the role. Trump previously chose Brian Quintenz, the former commissioner of the CFTC and a previous Head of Policy at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). However, Quintenz was withdrawn from consideration after concerns over potential conflicts of interest were raised by prominent industry figures, including Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Crypto Community Reacts To Selig’s Nomination The crypto community has largely welcomed Selig’s nomination as the CFTC Chair, viewing it as a potential turning point for regulatory clarity in the crypto sector. Chris Dixon, a managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, emphasized the timing of the nomination as crucial for the passage of market structure legislation, noting that Selig’s leadership could provide clear, actionable rules for developers and consumers alike. Kristin Smith, the President of the Solana Institute, praised Selig as an “outstanding choice” whose expertise in the cryptocurrency and regulatory sectors could strengthen coordination between the US SEC and the CFTC. Moreover, she believes that as the next chair of the CFTC, Selig could foster a pro-crypto innovation-friendly environment in the US.

Many expect his tenure to coincide with a more streamlined and supportive regulatory framework, which could potentially accelerate adoption and innovation within the digital asset industry.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-outlook-analyst-says-9-90-is-up-next-heres-why/,"Technical analyst Javon Marks has identified a recurring price structure in XRP’s long-term chart that he believes could lead to a new all-time high. His latest assessment suggests that XRP may be preparing for a breakout that could push its price toward the $9.90 region, marking a substantial increase from its current levels. At the time of his review, XRP was trading around $2.39, facing continued resistance and limited upward momentum. Despite the prevailing weakness, Marks noted that the asset’s broader chart pattern continues to align with the structure of a past bullish cycle that produced a significant price expansion. Historical Reference: XRP’s 2014–2018 Market Cycle Marks based his analysis on XRP’s multi-year price behavior, highlighting that the digital asset is following a nearly identical formation to the one observed between 2014 and 2018. According to his three-day chart data, the structure seen in that earlier cycle preceded one of XRP’s largest historical rallies. Due to the extreme similarities in $XRP 's price structure to a previous bull run, $9.90 looks to be up next for prices to push and they may not stop there. That's an over 309% increase from here. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/0dA4jdaNYt — JAVONMARKS (@JavonTM1) October 24, 2025 During that period, XRP fell to a cycle low of $0.0028 in mid-2014. The asset then rebounded to $0.028 before encountering resistance and retreating to $0.0042 by late 2015. Marks emphasized that even with this decline, XRP maintained a pattern of higher lows, a signal of underlying strength that eventually paved the way for a sustained bullish reversal. By early 2017, XRP had completed its consolidation phase and began accelerating upward. The token climbed to $0.0695 in March of that year before entering a brief cooling phase. This was followed by an extended rally to its historic high of $3.31 in January 2018, marking the culmination of that cycle. Current Cycle Mirrors Historical Pattern According to Marks, the subsequent market cycle appears to be repeating many of the same structural characteristics. After reaching the 2018 peak, XRP dropped to a low of $0.1103 in March 2020, later recovering to a high of $1.96 in April 2021. Following this rise, another correction brought prices down to $0.2910 by mid-2022. Since then, Marks observed that XRP has once again been forming higher lows, mirroring its behavior during the 2014–2016 consolidation period. The asset broke out of this range in late 2024 and surged to $3.4 by early 2025. The current pullback, he explained, may represent a temporary phase before another upward leg begins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Based on his Fibonacci analysis, Marks identified $9.90 as the initial upside target once XRP resumes its rally, corresponding with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. This projection represents a potential gain of 281% from the token’s present value of $2.60. However, he added that further targets at $26.24 and $127 are possible under more extended bullish conditions. Other Analysts Support the Bullish Outlook Marks’ findings align with similar projections from other technical experts. Analyst DustyBC recently highlighted that XRP continues to move within a descending wedge, a pattern that often precedes bullish reversals. According to him, the asset has likely completed its bearish phase, and a breakout from the current wedge formation could propel prices to approximately $3.60 in the near term. Although XRP remains under short-term selling pressure, the consensus among several analysts is that the broader market structure continues to support the potential for another significant rally. If the historical pattern identified by Marks holds, XRP may be entering the early stages of a long-term price expansion phase.

This projection comes amid a favorable crypto regulatory environment in the United States, driving interest in stablecoins and other digital assets. Tether In Funding Talks With Prospective TradFi Investors In a recent post on Friday, Bloomberg shared key developments on Tether Holdings Ltd, operator of the largest stablecoin in the market. Notably, the company’s CEO and popular crypto figure Paolo Ardoino outlined positive profit predictions of $15 billion by 2025’s end, while speaking in an interview at the recent Plan B Forum in Lugano, Switzerland. Bloomberg’s report indicates this projection can be linked to a rapid stablecoin adoption combined with surging investors’ interest in an equity stake in the market’s biggest player. In July, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, thereby creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin operations. The legislation addresses several aspects, such as licensing, reserve requirements, consumer and investor protection, and market structure, thereby helping demystify and provide the needed guardrails for a nascent financial industry. According to Bloomberg, Tether entered discussions with prospective investors last month to raise $20 billion in exchange for a 3% stake in its company. Among these companies reportedly include Japanese firm SoftBank Group Corp. and London-based Ark Investment Management. Paolo Ardoino spoke about these potential investments, explaining Tether’s approach and openness to such partnerships. Ardoino said: We have been contacted by an enormous amount of companies that want to invest in us. We have to draw a line in the sand on a valuation that we think is very cheap. He further added: There are many funds and tech funds that have in their portfolio many companies that could use part of our technology and other offerings that we have. It’s about synergy and creating bigger impact. Tether’s USDT currently boasts a market cap value of $182.92 billion, showcasing a 57.5% dominance in the stablecoin market. The company is reportedly set to launch a new USAT token in December, designed to be a US-focused product in compliance with federal regulations, as indicated by the GENIUS Act. Tether-Backed Rumble Introduces Bitcoin Tip Creators In other news, video-sharing platform Rumble is now set to introduce Bitcoin tipping for its creators, according to its CEO Chris Paglovski, while speaking onstage also at the Plan B Forum in Switzerland. Notably, the company is teaming up with Tether on this feature, with projections of a full rollout in the next five to seven weeks. This development follows the stablecoin issuer’s notable investment of $775 million into Rumble in December 2024.",Tether (USDT)|GENIUS Act|Paolo Ardoino|President Donald Trump|Rumble|Tether|USAT|USDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-25 23:30:23
53638808,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87551,1761436847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected XRP Price if 80% of XRP Supply Becomes Locked in Staking by 2030,https://timestabloid.com/projected-xrp-price-if-80-of-xrp-supply-becomes-locked-in-staking-by-2030/,"The introduction of staking mechanisms on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could dramatically alter the token’s long-term market dynamics. While XRP has existed for more than a decade without native staking capabilities, several new projects are now filling that gap, raising questions about how large-scale token lockups might affect future prices. Growing Interest in XRP Staking Over the past year, developers have launched multiple initiatives aimed at allowing XRP holders to earn passive yields through staking and decentralized finance applications. Two of the most prominent examples are mXRP and FXRP , both of which were designed to extend the utility of XRP across blockchain networks that support smart contracts. mXRP, which went live in September 2025, operates on the XRP Ledger’s EVM-compatible sidechain. The project was created by Midas, in partnership with Axelar and Interop Labs, and allows participants to earn annual returns of approximately 6% to 10%. Yields are generated through tokenized investment strategies such as liquidity provision and market-making. The developers behind mXRP aim to lock around $10 billion worth of XRP, equivalent to about 3.9 billion tokens based on the current market price of $2.60. This represents roughly 6.5% of the total circulating supply of 60 billion XRP. Meanwhile, FXRP , launched on the Flare Network , offers another avenue for XRP holders to participate in staking-like activities. FXRP acts as a wrapped, overcollateralized version of XRP in ERC-20 format, enabling its use within Flare’s decentralized finance ecosystem. Through this system, holders can lend, trade, and provide liquidity on applications such as SparkDEX. Flare’s roadmap targets securing approximately 5 billion XRP by mid-2026, or 8.3% of the circulating supply. Together, mXRP and FXRP could collectively lock up about 14.8% of XRP in circulation, signaling a growing appetite for yield-based XRP products. Modeling a Scenario Where 80% of XRP Is Locked To understand the potential implications of large-scale token lockups, analysts modeled a scenario in which 80% of all XRP, roughly 48 billion tokens, becomes staked or otherwise locked. At the current price level, this equates to about $122 billion worth of XRP being removed from active circulation, leaving only 12 billion tokens available for trading. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For comparison, Ethereum, which has one of the most developed staking markets, currently has around 29.6% of its total supply staked, demonstrating how staking can meaningfully impact liquidity. When asked to model the potential price effects, Google Gemini described this scenario as a significant supply constraint and simulated several possible outcomes. If the total market capitalization of XRP remained constant, the reduced liquid supply could lift prices to approximately $10.17 per token. However, Gemini also considered a more optimistic case where institutional participation and broader adoption increase XRP’s overall market valuation. Under that assumption, if the market cap expanded to between $500 billion and $1 trillion, XRP’s value could range from $41.67 to $83.33 per token by 2030. Implications for the XRP Ecosystem If staking adoption on XRPL continues to grow, XRP could transition toward a more yield-driven economic model similar to other proof-of-stake ecosystems. This shift would not only affect price dynamics but also alter liquidity conditions and market behavior. While these projections remain speculative, they underscore how staking could play a key role in XRP’s future valuation, particularly as more institutional investors and DeFi platforms integrate the token into their ecosystems.

As AI systems increasingly rely on publicly available online content to train and generate answers, companies like Reddit are trying to draw firm lines over what is considered “public” and “proprietary” data. Reddit’s trap exposes alleged data theft Reddit has filed a lawsuit against Perplexity, a $20 billion AI company, accusing it of illegally collecting data through its platform. According to court documents filed Wednesday in a Manhattan federal court, Reddit said Perplexity ignored instructions not to scrape its content and continued to use Reddit data to generate AI answers. The complaint says Reddit had explicitly blocked Perplexity from collecting its data, but the AI company’s “answer engine” still produced results containing Reddit content. “The increase was so dramatic that an outside observer hypothesized that the increase was due to Perplexity entering a licensing deal with Reddit,” the lawsuit said. “In truth, there is no license between Perplexity and Reddit.” To prove its suspicion, Reddit designed a clever digital test. It created a “trap” post that could only be found by Google’s search engine. Google has a legitimate content-licensing deal with Reddit, and so any company without such a deal should have been unable to access the post. The company described it as the online equivalent of a “marked bill.” If Perplexity’s system reproduced the contents of that hidden post, Reddit would know it had gone around its safeguards possibly by pulling data through Google’s search results, known as SERPs. Within hours, the supposedly private test post began showing up in responses generated by Perplexity’s AI tool. “The only way that Perplexity could have obtained that Reddit content and then used it in its ‘answer engine’ is if it and/or its co-defendants scraped Google SERPs,” the lawsuit stated. Reddit named three data-scraping companies in the suit, Oxylabs UAB, AWM Proxy, and SerpApi. It accused them of helping Perplexity gain unauthorized access to Reddit’s posts, or of selling Reddit’s data to Perplexity. Reddit’s allegations denied Perplexity has rejected Reddit’s allegations . The company’s spokesperson Jesse Dwyer stated that Perplexity “will not tolerate threats against openness and the public interest.” The company also said in a Reddit post after the lawsuit was filed that it “does not train AI models on content.” Representatives of the other companies named in the lawsuit also issued statements. A spokesperson for SerpApi said it plans to “vigorously defend” itself in court. Oxylabs’ chief governance and strategy officer, Denas Grybauskas, said his company was “shocked and disappointed,” adding that Oxylabs “has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection.” In August, Cloudflare, an internet infrastructure company, revealed it had conducted a similar test to see if Perplexity was following web-crawling rules. Cloudflare said it created pages marked with code telling Perplexity’s bots not to access them, but it still found the AI company’s crawlers visiting the restricted pages. Cloudflare’s CEO, Matthew Prince, made headlines by comparing Perplexity’s behavior to that of “North Korean hackers.” Some supposedly “reputable” AI companies act more like North Korean hackers. Time to name, shame, and hard block them. https://t.co/vqMzGRHZPf — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) August 4, 2025 “Some supposedly ‘reputable’ AI companies act more like North Korean hackers,” Prince wrote on X. “Time to name, shame, and hard block them.” Reddit’s lawsuit quoted Prince’s remarks as part of its case.

53639569,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=845575,1761438029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53639569.jpeg,Rubio says Taiwan stays off the table in China talks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/taiwan-stays-off-the-table-in-china-talks/,"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday that the Trump administration will maintain its long-standing support for Taiwan in trade negotiations with China. According to Rubio, the administration is not considering any trade deal with China that would require abandoning support for Taiwan. Rubio told reporters traveling on his plane between Israel and Qatar en route to Asia. “No one is contemplating that.”He was traveling to join President Trump in Doha for a regional meeting in the Asia-Pacific region. The development follows the first day of talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, as the Treasury spokesperson described them as “very constructive”. The world’s two largest economies are seeking to avert an escalation of their trade war and ensure a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping takes place next week. The talks on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit will chart a course forward after Trump threatened new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade restrictions beginning November 1, in response to China’s vastly expanded export controls on rare earth magnets and minerals. Trump and Xi set for high-stakes meeting as trade tensions mount Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly called on the United States to reconsider its longstanding opposition to Taiwan’s independence . China has pushed the Trump administration to officially declare that it “opposes” independence, a move that would represent a significant diplomatic victory for Beijing. Trump is expected to see Xi next week at a regional conference in South Korea, their first in-person meeting since Trump took office in January. Taiwan is a major flashpoint in China’s relationship with the United States, which is already strained over trade, technological transfers, and human rights. Washington remains Taipei’s largest military backer, despite President Trump’s suggestion that the island pay for its own US security. Trump gave a less definitive response when asked earlier about U.S. policy toward Taiwan on Air Force One. “I don’t want to talk about that now. I don’t want to create any complexity. The trip is already complex enough,” Trump said. China doubles down on manufacturing, dimming hopes for a grand bargain The Trump administration has long envisioned what it calls “a big, beautiful rebalancing” between the world’s two largest economies — one in which the United States revives its manufacturing base. At the same time, China boosts domestic consumption to narrow America’s trade deficit and reduce Beijing’s corresponding surpluses. But not China’s Communist Party, it seems. Its most recent five-year economic plan indicates that the vision Trump is offering Beijing remains a low priority. Rather than promoting consumer spending, China is doubling down on its production-driven growth model, prioritizing the establishment of a “modernized industrial system” to number one, up from number two in the old plan, according to a draft unveiled on Thursday. Ranging from 2026 to 2030, the plan prioritizes “seizing the higher ground of scientific-technological development” as its second priority, and stimulating domestic demand as its third. And they will “continue to remain secondary to manufacturing” under the new program, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase who have argued that China must push services-sector growth faster as a source of demand, employment, and income. All signs point to the unlikelihood of a grand bargain as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping prepare for their first face-to-face meeting of the U.S. leader’s second term, set to take place in South Korea on Thursday. According to consultancy Trivium China, “China will double down on driving growth” through manufacturing — a stance that all but guarantees “more trade and investment restrictions from the U.S., Europe, and other major economies as they seek to protect domestic industries.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|China|Taiwan|USA,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-26 00:20:29

The bounce signals a possible shift in momentum, but the real test now lies ahead. With the price approaching the crucial golden pocket resistance, a breakthrough is likely to confirm a sustained bullish phase. ETH Bounces Back From Weekly Bull Market Support Band In his recent update on ETH, Luca, a crypto analyst on X, noted that the asset has once again found solid footing at a familiar support area. According to Luca, the price has successfully bounced off the Weekly Bull Market Support Band. This rebound also aligns perfectly with the high-timeframe support range highlighted in his previous PAT updates, reaffirming the technical strength of this level. Related Reading: Ethereum Gathers Strength — Upside Breakout Could Confirm Recovery Phase He emphasized that this move was largely anticipated, as the support zone has repeatedly proven to be a reliable area for bullish reactions whenever ETH enters a corrective phase. The recent bounce signals that buyers are still active and willing to defend key levels, which could set the stage for renewed momentum if sustained. However, Luca urged caution in the short term, pointing out that ETH is now approaching a major resistance zone. This zone corresponds with the golden pocket area between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels, where Ethereum previously encountered selling pressure. A failure to break above this region could result in sideways movement or a minor pullback before any decisive trend shift occurs. ETH Eyes High-Timeframe Resistance Range For Next Leg Up The analyst further explained that if Ethereum manages to break above the current resistance range, it would signal a decisive shift in market structure. Such a move would confirm renewed bullish momentum, paving the way for a mid-term uptrend toward the high-timeframe resistance zone marked in red. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Technical Reset: $3,800 Support May Ignite The Next Wave Upward He added that as long as ETH holds above the “golden pocket” zone after a breakout, the most likely outcome remains further upward. Sustaining momentum above this key area would reinforce the bullish narrative, suggesting that Ethereum could continue climbing toward higher resistance levels without facing major corrections. However, until that breakout occurs, the analyst expects a period of consolidation around the current support band. According to the analyst, this phase would likely serve as a base for a more durable upside reversal in the future. At this time, patience remains essential, as the ongoing structure hints that Ethereum is preparing for a stronger, more sustained rally once the market confirms direction.

His remarks followed an interview with El Diario, in which he pointed out that, just as it is their tradition for the European Central Bank to share its views in statements after each meeting, Escrivá hinted that they would have one soon. According to him, since inflation reached its 2% target, they believe “it is a good time to look ahead and consider that the current interest rates are suitable.” These developments follow remarks by ECB Governing Council member Edward Scicluna, who stated that the central bank should take its time before adjusting interest rates, as the global economy is still grappling with the full impact of the new U.S. trade tariffs . According to him, inflation in Europe may go up if the tariffs raise the prices of imported goods. However, at the same time, prices might also fall if the tariffs slow down global trade and reduce demand for goods and services. Scicluna noted that it would be a mistake to make any rash decisions, as no one can tell for sure which way this will go. Individuals express eagerness for the ECB’s upcoming meeting Individuals have expressed their eagerness to know the ECB’s conclusions on interest rates after sources revealed that the central bank will announce its next rate decision on October 30. Experts have also weighed in, anticipating that the bank will maintain the deposit rate at 2%. Notably, this percentage has been unchanged since June this year. Therefore, with inflation now comfortably within the ECB’s 2% target, economists and markets highlighted that they do not expect any adjustments at the bank’s final meeting in December. Regarding the situation, Escrivá pointed out Spain’s economic success, stating that apart from the country’s strong growth, the positive growth difference compared to Europe is at an all-time high. “This is even more surprising because Spain’s economy has become more connected with the rest of Europe,” the governor of Banco de España, the Bank of Spain, added. On the other hand, reliable sources have indicated that Spain will release its new output data next Wednesday. Following this announcement, some analysts shared their expectations that the country’s economy will grow by 0.6% in the three months leading up to September. This contrasts with the 0.1% growth in the euro zone, where information will be released on Thursday. Europe faces significant challenges in its economy According to a survey of economists from a trusted source, the European Central Bank is expected to maintain borrowing costs in the euro zone at 2% until 2027. This outlook assumes that the deposit rate will be maintained at its current level during next week’s monetary-policy meeting. However, some experts anticipated that there could be additional changes: one-third of those surveyed are looking for at least one more cut, beyond the eight already made, and 17% expect there will be at least one or more increases by the end of next year. The December meeting is important because it will feature new projections that stretch to 2028 for the first time. Meanwhile, under the leadership of their president, Christine Lagarde, analysts have noted that ECB officials do not appear to be adjusting interest rates anytime soon, expressing satisfaction with the rise in consumer prices and Europe’s robust economy. Additionally, they believed that their policy is flexible enough to respond to new challenges. Like any other continent, Europe faces economic challenges. To illustrate, the continent is facing escalating trade friction between the US and China, particularly over semiconductors and rare earth materials. Credit downgrades are also making it a tougher financial situation for France, and there are growing fears about ambitious plans for infrastructure and defense spending in Germany. Additionally, a potential postponement of the continent’s new emissions-trading system could put downward pressure on inflation in the years to come. At the same time, high asset valuations fuel fears of a potential market crash.

Whereas ETH remains the default for the cryptocurrency world, investors searching for what’s the best crypto to buy right now are targeting smaller, growth-high plays. Among the top plays here is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an innovative penny token in Phase 6 presale at $0.035 and over 75% already sold out. MUTM’s innovative dual-lending DeFi platform has the potential to be the next crypto to explode, with predictions of potential 45x returns when it’s listed on major exchanges. As consolidation starts to happen with Ethereum, the focus is turning towards Mutuum Finance with low entry points combined with legitimate long-term growth stories. Ethereum (ETH) Breakout Potential As Investors Become Increasingly Interested Ethereum (ETH) is gaining momentum as funds are exiting traditional safe-haven assets such as gold, indicating the risk-on sentiment returning to crypto. Following a healthy correction, ETH is now trading in a bullish wedge pattern, indicating smart money accumulation before a breakout. A confirmed breakout above the top trendline will trigger a rally to the $4,013 level of resistance, about a 6% increase from the current $3,778 price. Caution prevails, though, as price action still awaits confirmation by volume and overall market stability. As ETH suggests this crucial technical configuration, investors are also looking around for new prospects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fast-evolving project gaining traction as the next crypto to explode in the next bull cycle.

Analyzing the Odds and Requirements,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-to-0-0001-analyzing-the-odds-and-requirements/,"Shiba Inu’s prospects for reaching $0.0001 have become materially more difficult after recent declines in price and activity metrics. Several analysts and community figures previously projected that SHIB could attain the $0.0001 milestone within the current cycle; however, the token’s performance and underlying fundamentals have reduced the likelihood of a near-term achievement. Current price and historical reference At present, SHIB is trading around $0.00001019. Its prior all-time high was $0.00008845. When SHIB reached approximately $0.00003329 in December, closing the gap to $0.0001 required a smaller percentage advance than it does today. On a year-to-date basis, the token has declined by roughly 52.1 percent, underscoring the scale of regained momentum that would be necessary for a renewed run toward $0.0001. Notable forecasts A number of public figures and analysts have offered bullish forecasts in recent months. An anonymous market commentator projected that SHIB could surpass $0.0001 and potentially reach a range between $0.00017 and $0.00032 by the end of 2025. Analyst Eunice Wong published a view that SHIB could trade near $0.000125 during this bull phase. Prominent stakeholder Himanshu Maradiya also stated expectations that the $0.0001 level could materialize within the year. These estimates remain speculative and contingent on several market and project-specific developments. Supply and market capitalization implications A major structural constraint on achieving a $0.0001 price is SHIB’s current circulating supply, which stands at approximately 589.24 trillion tokens. At that price point, the implied market capitalization would be in the vicinity of $58.92 billion. If the effective circulating supply were reduced to roughly 100 trillion through burns or other mechanisms, the market capitalization required to reach $0.0001 would fall to about $10 billion. Under current conditions, producing such a dramatic and sustained reduction in freely tradable supply would require large, ongoing burning activity or concentrated off-exchange accumulation. On-chain activity and developer communications On-chain metrics have softened, total value locked on Shibarium has remained below $1 million since October 8, and daily transaction counts have decreased to under 20,000, a sharp contraction from the multi-million transaction volumes recorded earlier this year. Developer engagement has also drawn scrutiny. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has adopted a more private posture for public communications, including setting a social account to private, which has contributed to uncertainty among some investors and observers regarding the project’s roadmap and operational cadence. Competitive landscape and shifting capital flows The meme coin sector has expanded, and several new tokens have captured investor attention and capital. The launch of themed projects such as the Official Trump token has intensified competition for retail allocations and social media attention. As capital rotates toward newly issued meme assets, SHIB faces increasing difficulty in regaining the dominant community momentum it previously enjoyed. Required catalysts A realistic pathway to $0.0001 would require several concurrent developments, demonstrable increases in ecosystem usage and utility, a substantial and verifiable program of token burns that meaningfully reduces circulating supply, renewed and measurable community engagement, and clearer, more consistent public communication from core contributors. Isolated improvements in a single area are unlikely to generate the sustained demand necessary to support the valuation implied by $0.0001. Given current on-chain indicators, supply dynamics, and market composition, the probability of SHIB reaching $0.0001 in the near term is diminished relative to earlier projections. The target remains possible only if multiple structural and market conditions change in a coordinated manner. Until such shifts occur, achieving $0.0001 appears to require a prolonged period of favorable developments rather than an imminent market move.

Pundit Breaks Down US Repo Market,https://bitcoinist.com/is-ripple-tapping-into-a-12-trillion-industry-pundit-breaks-down-us-repo-market/,"The discussions surrounding Ripple’s strategic expansion have reached a fever pitch, with analysts suggesting that the crypto payments company may be positioning itself to tap into a new $12 trillion United States (US) repo market. Recent reports and acquisitions hint that Ripple’s growing ambition to bridge digital assets with Wall Street’s largest liquidity systems could significantly influence XRP’s utility beyond cross-border payments . Ripple Eyes Entry Into $12 Trillion Repo Market A recent X post by a crypto analyst known as ‘X Finance Bull’ has ignited discussions in the crypto community, claiming that Ripple’s latest acquisitions signal a direct entry into the US repo market . Contrary to the previously cited $6 trillion valuation, the expert disclosed that the repo market’s actual value may be nearly twice as high, approaching $12 trillion and making it one of the largest liquidity pools in the world. The repo market, which X Finance Bull calls the “real liquidity backbone of the global finance system,” plays a vital role in facilitating short-term funding and liquidity throughout international economies. Ripple’s strategic entrance into this domain could mark a new chapter in how capital moves across borders and institutions. Moreover, the analyst mentioned that Ripple’s recent acquisition of cloud-based SaaS platform, GTreasury and prime brokerage Hidden Road appears to be pivotal in its strategy to tap into the $12 trillion repo market. According to the analyst, these moves extend Ripple’s reach beyond traditional remittance and cross-border payment solutions, unlocking idle capital that resides within some of the world’s most powerful financial markets. GTreasury, for one, provides Ripple access to sophisticated capital management infrastructures. Combined with Hidden Road, the crypto company now sits at the intersection of traditional finance and digital asset liquidity. X Finance Bull stressed that Ripple is building “the foundation of modern monetary plumbing,” and now it is paired with 24/7, 365-day real-time settlement powered by a decentralized ledger . He urged market observers not to focus solely on the XRP price but on Ripple’s strategic positioning. Ripple CEO Announces Complete Acquisition Of Hidden Road Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on October 24 that the company has officially finalized the acquisition of Hidden Road , which will now operate under the name “Ripple Prime.” This development marks the crypto firm’s fifth major acquisition in roughly two years, joining GTreasury last week, Rail in August 2025 , Standard Custody in 2024, and Metaco in 2023. With these acquisitions, Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple is building solutions toward enabling an “internet of value.” The CEO reminded the community that XRP remains central to every aspect of Ripple’s expanding network. The launch of Ripple Prime also marks a significant milestone, making Ripple the first-ever cryptocurrency firm to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime brokerage.

Recent data from an on-chain analysis sheds light on one of the underlying factors behind the market struggle. Related Reading: Binance Stablecoin Supply Surges To Record $42B: Liquidity Flows Back Into Markets Stablecoin Netflow In Downtrend — Analyst In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, a market analyst with the username CryptoOnchain reported an interesting change in stablecoin activity on the Binance exchange. This analysis is based on readings from the ‘Total Stablecoin Netflow On Binance (Last 60 Days) & 7-Day MA ‘ and shows potentially compelling implications for the general market. According to CryptoOnchain, the 7-day moving average of the combined stablecoin netflow (purple line) has decisively dipped beneath the ‘zero’ mark, marking a shift from sustained inflows to accelerating outflows. Crypto Onchain further explained that the downward trend seen in the stablecoin netflow chart has been reinforced by significant spikes in outflows occurring over the past two days. With neither of the two major categories excluded, this ‘capital flight’ involves stablecoins both on the TRC20 network (one of which is USDT), and those operating under the ERC20 network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Hits Seven-Year Low As Accumulators Stack 373,700 BTC In A Month Market Outlook In The Short Term Generally, an increase in stablecoin netflow to exchange platforms reflects an increasing demand for cryptocurrencies, as stablecoins are mostly exchanged for other online assets. Therefore, the decrease in stablecoin netflow presently seen signals reduced interest in other risky assets and a growing inclination among market participants to exclude themselves from participating in a risky market environment. This pattern of capital exiting exchanges, especially after a major price correction, typically points to what the analyst termed “a weakening ‘buy the dip’ appetite.” If history is anything to go by, this could be an early sign that the crypto market is about to see an even more intense amount of bearish pressure, especially in the short term. As of this writing, Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, stands at a valuation of approximately $111,400, showing a slight price growth of 0.54% over the past day. Also showing a similarly minute appreciation over the past 24 hours is Ethereum, which is worth about $3,936. Meanwhile, the total stablecoin market cap remains valued at $319 billion following a 0.14% gain in the past day.

The meeting was purposed to address key issues, including China’s export controls on rare earths and semiconductors, which German officials believe pose risks to fair trade and supply-chain security. Wadephul, a member of Merz’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), decided to delay his visit on Friday, October 24, when Beijing confirmed only one of the meetings he had requested. The delay underscores growing uncertainty in global trade relations, particularly concerning access to critical materials essential for Germany’s manufacturing and technology sectors. German officials stress the need to rethink the country’s approach to China Officials in Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s government called for a change in the country’s approach towards China. This was after Wadephul postponed his trip to Beijing. In a statement, Adis Ahmetovic, a representative for the Social Democrats on foreign policy, mentioned that the Foreign Minister’s last-minute cancellation of his visit to China was a bad sign for improving the strained China-Germany relationship . “We must reconsider Germany’s strategy toward China. Now more than ever, we need an active and strategic foreign policy emphasizing dialogue, transparency, and long-term goals,” he added. Meanwhile, according to European economic rankings, Germany is the largest economy. This outstanding achievement is credited to the country’s involvement with China in trade. Notably, China, being Germany’s leading trading partner, is the biggest economy in Asia. Regarding Wadephul’s decision to postpone his trip to Beijing, Wang Yi, the spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry, stated that the only meeting Beijing had agreed to during Wadephul’s scheduled visit was with his direct counterpart. This situation sparked heated debates among individuals who expressed concerns about the limitations on rare earth exports. When reports reached out to Wadephul to comment on the topic of discussion, the Foreign Minister mentioned that he intends to encourage China to relax its export restrictions on rare earths and semiconductors in his upcoming trip, which is scheduled to commence on Sunday, October 26. He also emphasized that fair trade is crucial for successful relations. China-Germany relationship faces uncertainties amid global trade tensions In a China strategy agreed upon in 2023, Berlin identified the need to lower risks in the China-Germany economic relationship and characterized Beijing as a partner, competitor, and systemic rival. Regarding their trade ties, China supplies Germany with critical components, including rare earths and semiconductors, which have faced significant shortages amid increasing global trade tensions. Analysts responded to the situation, urging the country to develop a solution before it is too late. To address this, Ahmetovic suggested that they should talk directly to China, emphasizing the importance of direct talks during times of global tension. He also believed that discussions must be broadened, especially on topics such as peace, security, the economy, trade, and human rights. Jürgen Hardt, the foreign policy representative for the CDU, also commented on the topic of discussion. Based on Hardt’s argument, China aimed to use trade policies to exert pressure and supported Wadephul’s decision to delay the trip. He noted that the German government is not participating in this approach but still values strong and fair relations with Beijing.

This move adds to the long list of positive actions by the Trump administration targeted at providing regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. Pro-Crypto Selig Gets Nod For CFTC Leadership On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the White House is set to name Michael Selig the new Chairman of the CFTC. Selig is expected to take leadership from Caroline D. Pharm, who has been serving as acting Chairman since January 2025. Selig is a lawyer by profession and gained prominence working as a partner specializing in crypto at Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP. The incoming CFTC boss has also previously worked as a clerk for former CFTC commissioner and chairman Chris Giancarlo. Presently, Selig serves as chief counsel to the crypto task force of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and also a Senior Adviser to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. Apparently, Trump had previously settled on Brian Quintez , a former CFTC commissioner and present policy head at a16z crypto. However, opposition from Gemini’s Tyler Winklevoss, who cited a conflict of interest, resulted in a change of direction. Selig’s nomination has now been submitted to the US Senate. If approved, he will assume leadership of the CFTC at a pivotal moment, as regulators and legislators work to shape a federal regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Selig’s tenure must maintain focus on the challenge of bridging regulatory approaches between the SEC and CFTC, aiming to establish clearer oversight for both traditional financial markets and digital assets. Trump Keeps Up The Pressure On Crypto Reform With Selig’s appointment as the new CFTC Chairman, Trump takes another step in demonstrating his commitment to the crypto industry, fulfilling one of his key campaign promises in making America the crypto capital of the world. The ongoing regulatory shake-up, which includes Selig’s nomination and the earlier appointment of SEC Chair Paul Atkins, has ushered in initiatives such as the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint , both aligned with the White House’s broader digital asset agenda. Meanwhile, legislative progress continues with the recent approval of the GENIUS Act , aimed at regulating the stablecoin sector, while other pivotal proposals, including the CLARITY Act, remain under congressional consideration. At press time, the total crypto market cap is valued at $3.74 trillion after a 0.15% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, total trading volume is down by 15.06% and valued at $130.06 billion.",Crypto regulation|CFTC|CFTC chairman|Michael Selig|Paul Atkins|president trump|SEC,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-26 02:30:48

53646816,613989,1761451226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53646816.jpeg,The First Ever Spot XRP ETF To Be Approved In The US Just Hit A Major Milestone,https://bitcoinist.com/the-first-ever-spot-xrp-etf-to-be-approved-in-the-us-just-hit-a-major-milestone/,"The REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) has achieved a major milestone. The product, launched on September 18, 2025, by REX Shares in partnership with Osprey Funds, has now surpassed $100 million in assets under management (AUM). The announcement, which was made on X by REX Shares, is a defining moment for XRP investment products, as XRPR becomes the first ETF in the United States to provide investors with regulated exposure to the digital asset’s market price. XRPR Reaches Major Milestone The fund’s rapid growth to over $100 million in AUM in just over a month shows the intense interest in XRP-related products among crypto investors, who have been fervently waiting for a Spot XRP ETF. According to its structure, XRPR is tracking the performance of XRP’s spot market while complying with existing US regulations. As shown on the XRPR website, it does this by investing at least 80% of its assets in XRP and related instruments through the REX-Osprey XRP subsidiary, rather than holding the token directly. Under normal market conditions, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in XRP and other assets that provide exposure to XRP’s price movements. However, although it seeks returns that correspond closely to XRP’s performance, its results will not fully replicate the token’s market price. This setup allows XRPR to operate within the framework of the US Investment Company Act of 1940, similar to traditional equity or commodity ETFs. Although it provides spot exposure to XRP’s price movements, it differs from something like BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which holds the cryptocurrency itself in custody. Still, the structure gives investors regulated access to XRP’s price performance without relying on futures or derivatives. Spot XRP ETF Applications Still Await SEC Decision As it stands, XRPR is currently the only XRP ETF available in the US. However, several major asset managers, including WisdomTree and CoinShares, have filed applications for pure spot XRP ETFs that would have the structure of spot Bitcoin ETFs. These proposed funds would directly hold XRP in custody and offer complete one-to-one exposure to its market price. The final deadline on most of these Spot XRP ETF applications was set between October 19 and October 25. However, progress has stalled due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which has effectively frozen the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) review process. Just weeks before the shutdown, the SEC introduced a new set of generic listing standards for commodity-based exchange-traded products to fast-track their launch. However, until the government reopens, no new ETF approvals, crypto or otherwise, can move forward. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.54, up by 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

Crypto influencer Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) stated, “XRP just got access to 1.5 BILLION devices ecosystem worldwide with EPIC x APPLE!” The post quickly attracted interest from the digital asset community, highlighting the scale of Apple’s global user base and how a connection through Epic could advance XRP’s utility. BREAKING: $XRP just got access to 1.5 BILLION devices ecosystem worldwide with EPIC x APPLE! In the near future, Apple Pay will support $XRP . XRP is going to be everywhere… from Apple Pay, X Payments, Merchants, all the way to Repo Markets, Institutions and the FED pic.twitter.com/OIyENkB4CN — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) October 24, 2025 XRP Targeting a New Market While the details of any formal collaboration have not been officially confirmed by Ripple, Apple, or Epic, the idea of integrating XRP into Apple’s infrastructure has been discussed in light of Epic’s ongoing development of XRP-native infrastructure. Epic, a blockchain initiative building on the XRP Ledger, has focused on creating products that support digital payments and tokenized assets . Its entry into the Apple developer program suggests an effort to extend XRP’s accessibility through consumer technology already used worldwide. Ripple’s Past Work with Apple Ripple had worked with Apple, specifically when Apple introduced its Tap to Pay feature for the iPhone . That integration used Ripple’s payment technology to support secure and seamless transactions between users. The connection demonstrated Apple’s interest in leveraging blockchain-related solutions to enhance financial functionality within its devices. If Epic is now developing XRP-native programs that can function across iOS, Epic’s reported participation in Apple’s developer environment could enable XRP-based payments or features through applications integrated with Apple Pay. Stellar Rippler predicted that “Apple Pay will support XRP.” Although not yet an announced feature, the possibility aligns with Apple’s history of adapting to new financial technologies and Ripple’s consistent push to expand the utility of XRP beyond cryptocurrency exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expanding XRP’s Reach Across Financial Channels Stellar Rippler’s post added that XRP could reach “Apple Pay, X Payments , Merchants, all the way to Repo Markets, Institutions, and the FED.” Each of these environments represents a different layer of the financial system, from retail payments to interbank liquidity and government-level financial operations. Ripple has been pursuing partnerships in cross-border settlement and liquidity management , and an Apple connection through Epic could add a consumer-facing dimension to that effort, opening up XRP to 1.5 billion devices worldwide. If the digital asset becomes usable within Apple Pay or similar systems, it could provide Apple’s large user base with a direct link to blockchain-based value transfer. Integration into X Payments, the payment feature being developed for Elon Musk’s X platform, would further extend XRP’s accessibility in digital commerce.

As institutional adoption continues its march, Capital B is emerging as BTC’s most overlooked institutional treasury, prompting a critical re-evaluation of who the true quiet accumulators in the BTC space really are. Capital B Influence On Bitcoin Supply Dynamics Bitcoin treasury strategy is often characterized by big names and loud announcements, but the most compelling strategy is executed in silence. According to an analyst known as Zynx on X, Capital B is the most underrated BTC treasury in the market today. Despite being super volatile and heavily shorted, the company continues to add BTC per share. He also stated that Capital B raised €58 million at a 2.35 mNAV during a collapsing market. However, the involvement of backers like TOBAM and the infiltration of the life insurance market in France are extremely promising. Meanwhile, the innovation of the Bitcoin-denominated convertible bond is arguably one of the best pieces of financial engineering developed in the space, aside from Strategy’s pioneering work. Zynx believed that the wider BTC treasury space is neglecting Capital B. Since a proper US OTC listing is not happening anytime soon, the immense liquidity and attention of the American retail and institutional market have not fully flowed over to the stock. Also, during one of Alexandre Laizet’s French-language livestreams, over 1,400 listeners tuned in concurrently. “Every few weeks, I like to make a post like this just to make it known that I might not talk about Capital B every day, but it’s certainly one of my favourite stocks that I’ve been adding all the way down. I’m backing them to be the best-performing European equity over the next 5 years.” Zynx mentioned. Is Bitcoin Becoming The Digital Gold Investors Hope For? A market analyst and investor who is known for his focus on Bitcoin, Davide, has revealed that BTC is starting to act less like a volatile tech stock and increasingly like a true macro hedge. Despite the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) uptick in inflation, BTC held firm near $110,000, showing resilience, while gold has also stayed steady during this period. Presently, it appears that the markets across the board are signaling a shared understanding that inflation isn’t re-accelerating, the prospect of rate cuts remains on the table, and liquidity is still very much alive within the financial system. According to the expert, BTC’s calm reaction reflects growing maturity and confidence in long-term holders.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Capital B|Consumer Price Index|cpi|OTC|Strategy|TOBAM|Zynx,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-26 05:30:02

The European agency, which had earlier cautioned of the risks of a spending impasse, has assigned the US an AA- rating, three rungs down from its top score. Scope commented, “Sustained deterioration in public finances and a weakening of governance standards drive the downgrade.” Scope first changed its outlook on the US to negative in 2023 The Berlin-based company noted that the falling governance standards are only reducing the consistency of US policymaking and making it harder for Congress to confront long-term debt problems. Its grade is two notches lower than those assigned by the biggest peers, Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P Global. It’s one of the handful of five agencies that the European Central Bank uses as collateral valuation points and is the only one based in Europe. Even before the government shutdown, the US had been struggling to maintain its high credit rating. Moody’s downgrade in May this year meant the country lost its last remaining top credit score among the big three rating firms. Moody lowered the US credit assessment to Aa1 from Aaa, matching Fitch and S&P Global in placing it below the top-tier triple-A category. At the time, Moody attributed the change to its deepening concern over the nation’s ballooning debt and deficits. It explained: “While we recognize the US’s significant economic and financial strengths, we believe these no longer fully counterbalance the decline in fiscal metrics.” In its latest outlook, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the US gross debt will reach 140% of GDP by 2029, up from 125% in 2025, exceeding the levels of even Europe’s most indebted nations, including Italy and Greece. Scope first flagged potential pressure on the US rating in 2023, maintaining a negative outlook since. Eiko Sievert, the assessor’s lead analyst for the US, at the start of October, had cautioned that the fiscal standoff was hurting credit sentiment and that the likelihood of a politically induced default, though small, was creeping up. The White House has yet to speak on Scope’s recent evaluation change The decision by Scope has so far won approval from Moritz Kraemer, who was once S&P Global’s top sovereign ratings officer and led the agency’s 2011 downgrade of the US. He said it reflected courage and fairness in highlighting the erosion of US governance. The White House has yet to issue a direct formal response to the rating assessment. Though with Moody’s cut in May, the Trump administration had suggested the move was politically motivated. Steven Cheung, speaking for the White House, particularly aimed at Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics on X, saying he had been a long-standing critic of Trump’s policies. Cheung had argued that Zandi’s work was widely dismissed since he had been proven wrong repeatedly in the past. That’s even though US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier acknowledged that the US debt numbers were approaching perilous levels, warning that a crisis would halt the economy and lead to a loss of credit. There’s no telling how the administration will respond to Scope’s recent assessment, though, judging from past actions, it may choose to reassure the public about the country’s economy, pointing to positive economic data.

Here’s the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-preparing-for-final-expansion-phase-this-cycle-heres-the-price-target/,"Crypto market analyst Mikybull (@MikybullCrypto) has suggested that XRP may be preparing for its final expansion phase in the current market cycle. In a recent post accompanied by a detailed chart, he outlined a long-term structure showing XRP consolidating before potentially breaking into a significant upward move. $XRP is in preparation for the final expansion phase this cycle The red band target stands at $7 and if it extends that should be $11-$15. pic.twitter.com/KeKYfrktp4 — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) October 24, 2025 Chart Structure and Technical Context The chart shared by Mikybull covers XRP’s price action from its early trading years to 2025, plotted on a three-month time frame. It illustrates a clear pattern of cyclical accumulation followed by steep expansions, a structure that appears to be repeating. Each cycle begins with a prolonged period of price compression under a horizontal support level and above a rising trendline, followed by a strong breakout that leads to new highs. This forms an ascending triangle with a massive rally once the asset overcomes the upper resistance. The first pattern, visible between 2014 and 2017, indicates a series of ascending lows that led to a breakout in late 2017. The second structure, beginning around 2020, displays a similar ascending triangle formation , again building upward pressure along a diagonal support line. The current position of the chart suggests that XRP has broken above the same horizontal resistance level that preceded the earlier breakout, indicating a potential continuation of this cyclical behavior. Repeating Market Formation Mikybull’s chart highlights how XRP’s price movement appears to mirror its historical breakout pattern . The first major expansion occurred after an extended consolidation phase and a steady climb above a key resistance zone. A similar setup can be seen in the current cycle, where the price is once again testing a comparable resistance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to the analysis, XRP is testing this zone with momentum indicators aligning closely with past pre-breakout conditions. The long-term structure, therefore, suggests that the asset could be approaching another period of accelerated price movement if it maintains upward support and surpasses the established resistance band. Price Targets and Market Outlook Mikybull marked a “red band target” on his chart near the $7 range, representing the initial level of potential expansion. He further noted that if the move extends beyond that level, XRP could reach between $11 and $15. These targets correspond with Fibonacci projection levels and previous zones of exponential growth identified in earlier cycles. The digital asset is currently trading around $2.40, and these targets suggest rapid and massive growth in its immediate future.

Further consolidation is likely before a clear directional move takes shape. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Ethereum’s consolidation phase has extended, with volatility and momentum both fading. Price action remains trapped within a crucial range defined by the 100-day moving average and the flag pattern’s upper boundary near $4.1K. This region represents a key supply zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts. On the downside, the flag’s lower boundary, aligning with the $3.5K demand zone, acts as the primary support where buyers have consistently defended. Until a breakout occurs, Ethereum is expected to continue consolidating within this structure, absorbing order flow and building liquidity. A confirmed bullish breakout above $4.1K could likely trigger an impulsive rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour timeframe reveals Ethereum fluctuating inside a symmetrical triangle, reflecting ongoing market indecision and equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The asset is currently trading just below the triangle’s upper boundary near $4K, with momentum still insufficient for a confirmed breakout. This compression pattern signals a liquidity buildup phase, where traders are positioning ahead of a potential volatility expansion. If bulls manage to push above the upper trendline, a rally toward $4.1K and potentially $4.6K could follow. Conversely, a breakdown below $3.7K would expose the $3.4K demand zone once again. Until confirmation, Ethereum is likely to continue oscillating within this narrowing range — a setup that typically precedes a sharp directional breakout. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan The 1-month liquidation heatmap for Ethereum reveals a dense liquidity pocket forming above the $4.8K swing high, situated directly beyond the current symmetrical consolidation structure. This area corresponds to a significant cluster of resting short liquidations, implying that if Ethereum reclaims the mid-range near $4.1K–$4.3K, a rapid move to absorb this overhead liquidity could follow. Below the current price, the $3.5K range displays relatively weaker liquidation density, indicating that much of the downside liquidity was already cleared during last week’s sell-off, though a smaller residual cluster remains. This configuration reinforces the idea that Ethereum is likely to continue oscillating within its present consolidation range until one of these liquidity pockets is decisively tested. Overall, the heatmap confirms that short-term volatility will remain concentrated within the $3.4K–$4.8K corridor, with the upper range carrying a slightly higher probability of being targeted first due to the larger liquidity concentration above current levels.

Bloomberg first reported the development, citing an unnamed official within the Trump administration. An official announcement has not yet been made. Selig’s Crypto Background and Role at SEC Michael Selig currently serves as chief counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crypto task force and senior adviser to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. He has earned a reputation as a “pro-crypto” regulator, a label welcomed by many in the digital asset community. Selig’s potential appointment is being viewed by industry participants as a sign of continuity in Trump’s growing focus on cryptocurrency regulation. Analysts believe that his experience bridging financial regulation and crypto innovation could help define the next phase of U.S. digital asset policy. Nomination Shift After Quintenz Withdrawal The CFTC nomination process has faced delays since September. Brian Quintenz, Trump’s initial pick, withdrew his name following reported pressure from the Gemini crypto exchange co-founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz later confirmed he would return to the private sector, ending speculation about his role in the administration. Trump has considered transferring greater responsibility for cryptocurrency oversight to the CFTC since early 2024. Under his administration’s “Working Group on Digital Assets,” the CFTC and SEC are expected to share joint responsibility for regulating various types of crypto assets. Policy Framework for Digital Assets The Working Group’s July report recommended assigning oversight of spot crypto markets to the CFTC, recognizing most cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities. In contrast, digital assets categorized as securities — such as tokenized bonds or stock-like instruments — will remain under SEC jurisdiction. This split aims to clarify how different types of tokens are regulated and prevent overlapping mandates. Joint SEC–CFTC Cooperation Intensifies In September, the two agencies issued a joint statement pledging to “harmonize” their crypto regulatory frameworks. Legal experts described the move as a major step toward reducing uncertainty and building a more cohesive approach to U.S. crypto oversight. The CFTC also launched a “crypto sprint” in August to fast-track policy actions based on the White House Working Group’s recommendations. These initiatives have fueled speculation that the SEC and CFTC could eventually merge into a single body. However, SEC Chair Paul Atkins dismissed that notion, clarifying that only Congress or the U.S. president has the authority to merge the agencies.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-26 06:19:52

A revised version of a class-action lawsuit that was first filed in a New York federal court on April 21, 2025, says that Chow, Meteora, and Kelsier Ventures, a firm run by Hayden Davis and some of his family members, used the names of famous people like U.S. First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei to give credibility to coordinated scams meant to milk money from unwitting crypto investors. Mechanics of the Alleged Scheme The initial complaint accused Chow, Meteora, and members of the Davis family of lying to crypto investors. It said they made money at the expense of the public by manipulating the price of a Solana-based token called M3M3, which had as much as 95% of its supply controlled by a group of insiders. The amended document now claims that fraud may have happened with as many as 15 cryptocurrencies, including the controversial MELANIA and LIBRA meme coins, which were promoted by Mrs. Trump and President Milei, respectively. This information is said to have come from private messages shared by a whistleblower, in which Davis allegedly admitted to carrying out “at least fifteen token launches at Chow’s direction.” Those suing say that Chow and the other defendants “borrowed credibility” from public figures and used them as “window dressing” to make their plans seem more legitimate. For this reason, they are not holding Melania or Milei responsible; instead, they are focusing on Meteora, its co-founder, and the Kelsier management. The new filing claims that the alleged plot was carried out in a highly organized way, with each participant having a clear role. Chow was supposedly in charge of the technical side because of his “unique knowledge of the code and the ability to manipulate liquidity, fee routing, and supply controls.” As such, the complainants say it was possible for him to control the supply and prices of the new tokens, creating situations where their values could be artificially pushed up and then collapsed without the knowledge of ordinary traders. For the marketing side, the lawsuit points to Kelsier Ventures, where Hayden, Charles, and Gideon Davis used paid influencers and social media campaigns to make it look like there was real public demand for meme coins like MELANIA and LIBRA. The group reportedly used the same formula for all 15 tokens: they created artificial scarcity, flooded the internet with paid promotions, and then, when prices went up, the insiders sold all their holdings at once, which made the asset’s value drop and left other investors with huge losses. A Pattern of Denial and Mounting Evidence According to the lawsuit, after the LIBRA token crashed in February 2025, Meteora pretended to blacklist Kelsier, a move the plaintiffs called “performative.” Chow and members of the Meteora leadership are said to have made sworn declarations describing themselves as “passive developers of autonomous software,” suggesting they had nothing to do with the price behaviors of the crypto assets in question. The programmer quit Meteora in February, still insisting on his innocence, but data from blockchain analysis companies like Bubblemaps tell a different story. Their report from February 17, 2025, followed wallet addresses that clearly showed financial ties between those who made MELANIA and LIBRA, while revealing that insiders made more than $100 million in profits.

The conversation, which was shared on X by prominent crypto commentator HighVibeAssets (@HighVibeAssets), revealed Garlinghouse’s perspective on how Ripple has differentiated itself from early, unregulated corners of the digital asset industry. Garlinghouse noted that Ripple maintains active engagement with authorities. “We do work with law enforcement at Ripple and we do file suspicious activity reports,” he said. He emphasized that the company only partners with regulated endpoints, describing this as a core distinction in how Ripple operates. His comments reflect a consistent theme for the company of integrating blockchain technology within established financial frameworks rather than existing outside them, and HighVibeAssets believes this integration will send XRP to $1,000.

Our customers are regulated institutions. You can’t have a non-KYC know your customer transaction.” By focusing on compliance and transparency, Ripple positions its XRP-powered payment solutions as viable tools for traditional finance. He contrasted Ripple’s enterprise use cases with the industry’s early associations. He highlighted that billions of dollars already move through Ripple’s technology, describing the company’s platform as a key part of global financial infrastructure rather than a speculative experiment.

While Ripple does not currently hold a VARA license, Garlinghouse acknowledged the UAE’s progress, saying it has “done the work to codify what the regulations are.” He added that most participants in the crypto space “want to be good actors,” but that clarity about what responsible behavior entails remains essential. Ripple’s approach to clarity is in its highly regulated RLUSD stablecoin, and HighVibeAssets suggests that increased adoption of RLUSD could bring unlimited utility to the XRP Ledger. Positive Outlook for XRP’s Institutional Role Garlinghouse’s comments offer reassurance that Ripple continues to build credibility with regulators and financial institutions worldwide. His statements suggest that the company’s commitment to compliance and structured use of blockchain technology supports XRP’s integration into legitimate, large-scale payment systems . As Ripple strengthens its institutional partnerships and regulatory relationships, XRP’s utility will rapidly increase, and HighVibeAssets’ $1,000 target will become more realistic.

Every cycle, investors hunt for the best 100x crypto to buy before it breaks out, hoping to catch the next big mover before the masses arrive. It’s like showing up to a concert before the crowd floods in; you get the best view and the biggest payoff. While established players like Cardano and BNB continue to perform strongly, MoonBull’s presale is generating serious excitement thanks to its transparent design, real rewards, and clear growth potential. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Underdog Aiming to Be the Best 100x Crypto to Buy MoonBull ($MOBU) is designed to give everyday traders a fair shot. Built on Ethereum, it’s a meme-driven project with real mechanics. Each transaction is split into three parts: one portion goes into liquidity to stabilize price movements, another rewards holders, and a final slice gets burned permanently, tightening supply. This best 100x crypto to buy model rewards long-term holders and helps create sustainable growth. Trust is one of MoonBull’s strongest selling points. The project has passed its audit and locked liquidity, ensuring investor protection and transparency. What really sets it apart is community voting, which starts mid-presale at Stage 12. Each token equals one vote, giving holders control over key decisions like token burns and campaign pushes. That level of transparency and inclusion makes it more than just another meme coin; it’s a community-powered movement that could easily become one of the best 100x crypto to buy. MoonBull Presale Stage 5: Massive Numbers and Rising Hype MoonBull’s presale is currently in its 5th stage, with the token priced at $0.00006584 and more than $450,000 already raised. The project has attracted over 1,500 holders, showing strong early traction. At this stage, the return on investment (ROI) stands at an impressive 9,256% from the current price to the expected listing price of $0.00616. Early joiners have already seen gains of around 163.36%, and the next price increase of 27.40% is approaching quickly. If someone invests $20,000 now, they would receive approximately 303,766,707 $MOBU, which could grow to around $1.87 million at the listing price. It’s like catching a viral trend before it even hits the feed, fast, exciting, and potentially very rewarding. Add in the 95% APY staking coming at Stage 10, and MoonBull’s setup looks like rocket fuel for early believers. Cardano (ADA): The Academic Giant with Steady Growth Cardano is one of the most respected proof-of-stake blockchains in the market. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, it was built to solve scalability and sustainability issues through a research-based approach. Its peer-reviewed updates and methodical roadmap make it one of the most stable and reliable blockchains for developers and investors alike. In 2025, Cardano continues to evolve with new DeFi integrations, governance features, and a growing ecosystem of dApps. While its movement may not match smaller tokens, its consistent progress and community support make it an important player for long-term portfolios. For investors seeking a balance between security and innovation, ADA remains a solid option among the best 100x crypto to buy. BNB (Binance Coin): The Utility Powerhouse Still Dominating the Market BNB, the native token of Binance, continues to prove its strength as one of the most used and valuable coins in the world. Launched initially to pay trading fees, it now powers the Binance Smart Chain, supports DeFi projects, and fuels countless ecosystem applications. Its real-world utility and strong demand make it one of the few large-cap cryptos still expanding in use and relevance. BNB may not deliver explosive 100x returns due to its established size, but it offers unmatched stability, consistent performance, and a trusted ecosystem. It’s a foundation coin that remains central to many Web3 and exchange operations. For investors who like combining safety with growth, BNB earns its place among the best 100x crypto to buy as a cornerstone asset.

53650872,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=845389,1761463800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53650872.jpeg,"Skip DOGE, Here’s a Cheap Crypto That Could Skyrocket 50x",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/skip-doge-heres-a-cheap-crypto-that-could-skyrocket-50x/,"As Dogecoin (DOGE) takes center stage as a meme token, its growth path has come down, and the token is available at around $0.193. That is different from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which offers a better chance for investors seeking to make huge profits. Mutuum Finance has already received more than $17.95 million from more than 17,450 investors and has already sold out more than 75% of Phase 6. The MUTM token at $0.035 has increased by 250% from Phase 1 launch price of $0.01. At the end of the ongoing stage, the token will further increase by another 14.29% to $0.04 as a representation of the project’s recurring growth trend aimed at rewarding the early birds. This fast presale pace speaks volumes about investor appetite and makes MUTM the best crypto to buy now. For investors seeking portfolio diversification with a project that unites innovation, solid market appetite, and significant growth opportunities, Mutuum Finance is the top crypto in the current market cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades at $0.1946, oscillating in a well-defined channel as speculators wager on the next move. The tightening price action suggests an area of indecision where a sincere breakout above $0.2025 could open the way to $0.232, or a breakdown below $0.1758 could lead to a larger retracement. While DOGE is fighting this technical tug-of-war, investors are looking for increasingly alternative projects with better growth opportunities and greater utility, and so putting the focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), widely considered the best crypto to buy now by early-stage DeFi participants. The Mutuum Finance Ecosystem: Borrowing, LTV, and Return on Yield Every borrowing on Mutuum Finance is over-collateralized for the security of lenders and the protocol. As an example, a depositor of $8,000 of ETH can borrow $6,000 on an LTV basis of 75%. Deposited assets still earn interest in the form of mtTokens, 1:1 receipt tokens with compounded yield over time. Analogously, the storing of $5,000 in stablecoins enables borrowing an additional stable asset at fixed rates. It facilitates yield farming strategies in a well-ordered manner without the necessity to liquidate underlying positions. With lending built up, APYs increase naturally, rewarding the early liquidity providers for bootstrapping the system, making MUTM the top crypto for high-upside short-term gains. Presale Structure Fuels Strong Early Demand So far, the MUTM token costs $0.035 in Phase 6, an increase from $0.01 in Phase 1, almost three times what it costs early investors. The presale has gained $17.95 million so far, drawn more than 17,450 holders, and sold around 75% of Phase 6. Once it is sold out, the price will go up by almost 15%, just a fraction away from the intended listing price of $0.06. Of the 4 billion total MUTM tokens, 1.76 billion will be for presale and over 760 million have already been sold in prior rounds. Sudden allocation indicates heavy buying power from retail and institutional investors, with some six-figure donations, as investors race to lock in positions ahead of the next price increase, reinforcing that MUTM is the best crypto to buy now and also the top crypto for serious early investors. Lending & Borrowing Protocol Launch Timeline Mutuum Finance team announced on X that V1 of the project’s lending and borrowing protocol will be released on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The initial launch will encompass major components like liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation logic. ETH and USDT will be supported on day one for an acceptable liquidity base. Further, Mutuum Finance has also established a lively investor base via a day-to-day leaderboard challenge that offers extremely rewarding incentives to leaderboard leaders. Leaders of the day bought $2,241, $1,944, and $559 in MUTM tokens within the last 24 hours, indicating increasing activity and high investor demand. The daily top depositor that makes at least one transaction is rewarded with a $500 MUTM incentive. Daily leaderboard reinitialization occurs at 00:00 UTC that stimulates active participation during the presale. Mutuum Finance has raised $17.95M from more than 17,450 investors, 75% of Phase 6 presold at $0.035. Lock your tokens today, earn passive income, and enjoy flexible borrowing prior to Phase 7 starting at a higher price. It is clear that Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to buy now and stands out as the top crypto for long-term DeFi growth.

Investors are no longer chasing hype — they’re looking for projects with proven traction, consistent development, and token models that actually work. Here are seven of the best cryptocurrencies to consider this November, spanning sectors from artificial intelligence and infrastructure to next-generation gaming. 1. TRUE World ($TRUE) — Real Revenue Meets Web3 Gaming TRUE World by TRUE LABS has emerged as the standout project of late 2025, uniting gaming profitability with tokenized economics. It’s the first-ever GameFi token backed by a functioning business with millions of players and verified multi-million-euro revenues. Unlike most speculative gaming tokens, $TRUE token operates in a closed economic loop where player engagement feeds directly into the ecosystem: Game fees, NFT upgrades, and rewards generate real revenue. Buyback and burn mechanics sustain long-term deflation. The token powers staking, governance, and tournament access. TRUE represents the mature evolution of GameFi — where value comes from a working business, not speculation. With major exchange listings expected soon, TRUE is a clear leader in sustainable Web3 growth. Watch for official announcements of $TRUE listing details at x.com/TRUExWorld 2. Bittensor (TAO) — The AI Network That Keeps Scaling Bittensor (TAO) continues to dominate the intersection of AI and blockchain. It’s the most advanced decentralized machine learning network, where contributors train AI models and earn TAO tokens for computational value. The growing appetite for open-source AI ecosystems has made TAO one of the most consistently performing assets of 2025. Its deflationary design, high developer activity, and increasing partnerships with AI startups ensure it remains central to the AI-token narrative. TAO’s value proposition — AI compute for tokenized reward — remains unmatched. 3. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) — Simplifying Web3 for the Masses NEAR Protocol (NEAR) continues its steady march toward mainstream adoption with its Chain Abstraction Framework, allowing users to interact across multiple chains without managing wallets or bridges. Its UX-first approach makes it one of the most user-friendly Layer-1s in the market. Developer retention remains high, and NEAR’s partnerships in gaming and AI tooling give it broad sector exposure. With strong fundamentals and scalable tech, NEAR is shaping up as a long-term Layer-1 survivor. 4. Internet Computer (ICP) — Building the Decentralized Internet Despite cyclical corrections, Internet Computer (ICP) remains one of the most technically ambitious projects in the industry. Its on-chain smart contracts operate at web speed, enabling decentralized applications that run natively on the blockchain. ICP’s focus on autonomous AI agents and storage decentralization puts it at the intersection of two powerful narratives: cloud-free computing and on-chain AI. If sentiment shifts toward infrastructure plays, ICP could outperform many peers with weaker fundamentals. 5. Chainlink (LINK) — The Indispensable Oracle Layer Chainlink (LINK) continues to be the backbone of data security in DeFi, connecting off-chain data with on-chain smart contracts. As tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) gain adoption, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is becoming the standard for secure interoperability. With increasing partnerships across financial institutions and stablecoin projects, LINK remains a low-risk, high-utility hold for investors seeking exposure to the real infrastructure of blockchain finance. 6. Avalanche (AVAX) — Fast, Modular, and Growing Again Avalanche (AVAX) is regaining developer momentum after its mid-year consolidation. Its subnet architecture enables custom blockchains for institutions, games, and DeFi applications. The network’s rapid settlement times and low fees continue to attract projects migrating from congested chains. With several institutional subnet launches scheduled for Q4, AVAX could re-enter the spotlight as enterprise adoption meets scalability. 7. VeChain (VET) — The Quiet Winner in Real-World Utility Often overlooked by retail investors, VeChain (VET) remains one of the few blockchains consistently delivering enterprise-grade use cases. Its partnerships in supply chain, logistics, and sustainability — including with Fortune 500 firms — make it a pillar of blockchain’s practical adoption. As ESG-driven transparency becomes a global standard, VeChain’s blockchain-backed traceability tools place it in a strong position to benefit from regulatory tailwinds. Best Cryptos to Watch in November 2025 Token Sector Focus Area Outlook Strength TRUE (TRUE) GameFi / Web3 Revenue-backed gaming economy 🔵 Bullish Real business model, sustainable tokenomics Bittensor (TAO) AI / Decentralized Compute Machine learning network 🟢 Positive AI infrastructure leadership NEAR (NEAR) Layer-1 / Web3 UX Simplified chain abstraction 🟢 Positive Scalable, developer-focused Internet Computer (ICP) Infrastructure / AI Agents Decentralized web & storage ⚪ Neutral-Positive Unique tech, low awareness Chainlink (LINK) Oracle / Data Layer Cross-chain interoperability 🟢 Positive Core DeFi infrastructure Avalanche (AVAX) Layer-1 / Enterprise Institutional subnets 🟢 Positive Speed, modularity, partnerships VeChain (VET) Supply Chain / ESG Corporate adoption & traceability 🟢 Positive Real-world enterprise utility Final Take November 2025 is less about speculation and more about substance. The market is finally rewarding projects that: Generate real value (TRUE, VeChain) Power the next generation of infrastructure (Chainlink, Avalanche, ICP) Build toward intelligent decentralization (TAO, NEAR) Among them, TRUE stands out — not only for its innovation but for anchoring token value in actual, measurable business revenue. It’s a glimpse of the next phase of crypto: from hype cycles to working economies.

Sources close to the situation noted that the board of the Japanese conglomerate approved the payment on the condition that OpenAI complete a company reorganization, which will enable it to become a publicly traded company. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son had earlier said, “I think that OpenAI will be listed eventually and, in my belief, will become the most valuable company in the world,” Son said. Still, he noted that it “takes bravery to invest” in such a firm. It appears Son has held this conviction for a while. In a recent shareholders’ meeting, he stated that before 2019, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had approached him with a proposal for SoftBank to invest in the company. He noted that he said yes because he had financial resources, thanks to the Vision Fund’s performance. However, Son said that Sam had spoken to other potential investors, and eventually, they chose Microsoft. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:2596fdb9-570b-46d3-a733-5f8b50714f39-15"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-6"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Microsoft eventually secured the deal, becoming the exclusive provider of computing infrastructure for OpenAI’s research, products, and developer APIs. However, the company lost its exclusive cloud provider status at the beginning of this year. SoftBank continues to say that the relationship now appears to be on shaky ground. According to SoftBank, restructuring aims to simplify OpenAI’s governance model and align its operations with investor expectations for profitability and transparency. SoftBank intensifies its investment amid global AI surge *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:2596fdb9-570b-46d3-a733-5f8b50714f39-16"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-8"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> The recent funds will fill out a $41 billion financing round that was announced earlier this year. SoftBank had initially agreed to invest in OpenAI with around $10 billion in mid-April and an additional $30 billion in December. However, for the company to successfully invest in OpenAI, the tech giant needed to switch to a for-profit model by the end of the year. Still, SoftBank cautioned that if OpenAI’s restructuring does not succeed, the total amount to be invested would drop to approximately $20 billion. Reports this month have also revealed that the Japanese company was involved in discussions about a $5 billion loan with international banks to boost its financial resources. This negotiation occurs when SoftBank’s CEO Masayoshi Son intensifies the company’s investment in AI. According to sources with knowledge of the situation, SoftBank is close to finalizing an agreement with several lenders for a margin loan backed by its shares in Arm Holdings Plc., its chip division. This funding will support increased investment in OpenAI this year, according to sources who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the talks. Meanwhile, following these reports, SoftBank’s shares drastically declined by as much as 4.1% to 22,020 yen. This marked the largest decline since September 26, before gradually rebounding to finish down 3.1%, according to data from sources. Additionally, following its maturity in 2032, its dollar bond declined by around 1 cent on the dollar to a value of 102.7, experiencing its biggest drop since it was issued in July. SoftBank aims to establish a second appearance on the overseas bond market SoftBank is set to return to the overseas bond market for the second time this year, as it ramps up fundraising in artificial intelligence, with a primary focus on its investment in OpenAI. To embrace this plan, the Japanese tech investment giant reportedly began selling $2 billion in dollar notes in two portions and €750 million (approximately $871 million) in euro-denominated notes, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Since the source is prohibited from publicly speaking about the sales, remaining anonymous, the source hinted that the dollar notes will offer an 8.25% yield, and the euro bonds are expected to yield 6.5%. This report has led to the analysis that Japanese firms have sold a record amount of overseas bonds this year, exceeding $100 billion, as they step up acquisitions, and higher yields on yen-denominated debt prompt caution in the local market.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-gearing-up-for-liftoff-to-7-heres-why/,"A recent analysis by XRP_Cro (@stedas) has renewed interest in XRP’s long-term price outlook. The analyst shared a chart highlighting what appears to be a decisive breakout from a long-term consolidation pattern. The chart illustrates a clear bullish setup formed over several years of compression, with the potential to send XRP to double-digit prices. The weekly timeframe shows the digital asset breaking through a descending resistance trendline that has constrained price action since its previous major cycle high. The structure resembles a descending triangle , bounded by converging support and resistance lines marked in yellow. #XRP is gearing up for liftoff. Targets on the radar: $7, $12… maybe even $25 pic.twitter.com/EPrmNrn4KD — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) October 24, 2025 Technical Patterns and Fibonacci Projections The chart presents a sequence of Fibonacci retracement and extension levels plotted against the major swing high and low. The key Fibonacci levels are 1.272, 1.414, and 1.618, positioned around $8.31, $13.45, and $26.80, respectively. These align closely with the specific targets labeled on the chart at $7.92, $13.10, and $24.93. The clustering of these targets within the higher Fibonacci extension zones reinforces the interpretation of a potential continuation pattern. XRP_Cro’s chart also highlights how the price consolidated above former resistance before moving upward, a sign often regarded as a confirmation of renewed momentum. The most recent candles also show compression within other descending triangles. The digital asset began a new descending triangle at the start of 2025, and broke above it in July when it rose to a new all-time high . The digital asset is now trading within another descending triangle, and a breakout could send it toward the first target of $7.92. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? While the chart-based projections indicate ambitious upside levels, they remain grounded in standard technical tools. Fibonacci extensions, when applied to breakout structures, often serve as reference points for price discovery once prior resistance zones have been cleared. In this case, the alignment between multiple Fibonacci levels and XRP_Cro’s manually labeled targets strengthens the technical argument behind the analysis. The analyst did not provide a timeline for these targets but emphasized that XRP appears “gearing up for liftoff,” implying confidence in the formation’s bullish potential . As with all technical projections, future performance will depend on sustained momentum and broader market conditions. However, the structure presented in the analysis demonstrates that XRP’s price chart has entered a technically significant phase, one that traders will likely monitor closely as it unfolds.

Fundamentals and Liquidity On-chain data shared by Altcoin Vector supports this narrative. Despite active addresses plunging from over 1.6 million to around 800,000 on the BNB network during the deleveraging event, participation rebounded sharply to near previous highs amidst strong user engagement and sustained network health. Similarly, BNB’s on-chain transfer volume also reflected continued liquidity surges, large-scale transactions, and ongoing ecosystem activity. Even as the so-called “BNB Meme Season” concluded before fully maturing, speculative activity on the BNB Chain continues to thrive. Meme tokens such as PALU, 币安人生, PUP, and 4 delivered dramatic returns, and minted hundreds of new millionaires, while some whales suffered steep losses amid FOMO-driven trades. The speculative frenzy aside, Altcoin Vector explained that BNB’s current strength lies in several fundamental factors, such as liquidity and active user participation, with a maturing market structure. It added that when both fundamentals and narrative coincide, an asset often enters a sustained impulse phase; when narratives fade but fundamentals endure, it tends to consolidate. In BNB’s case, its structure not only withstood the broader market’s collapse but has also laid the groundwork for what could be the next impulse cycle. “BNB structure survived collapse. A potential new impulse phase is brewing. Not a speculative play, but a consistent tactical approach.” Market Structure Signals Confidence In terms of price trajectory, CryptoQuant found BNB has maintained its technical footing by holding above its 45-day moving average. Its latest price stands around $1,138, which is precisely aligned with its 45-day moving average, while the 90-day average trails at approximately $941. Despite a minor daily return of 2.7%, the overall setup indicates stabilization above a critical mid-term base. As such, longer averages, including the 60- and 90-day trendlines, remain upward sloping, which indicates continued momentum that was seen since early Q3. Historically, each retest of the 45-day moving average has led to renewed upward moves for BNB, as shorter-term indicators such as the 7-day and 30-day averages recover first, followed by gradual increases in price and trading volume. The current formation is similar to past accumulation zones, where traders accumulated positions ahead of significant breakouts. The convergence of short-term averages from the 7-day through the 45-day points to a period of compressed volatility. These conditions often precede decisive directional moves. Volume has also remained positive during recovery sessions, which means that buyers are actively defending key support zones.

On paper, that real-world usage should mean constant growth. Yet the SOL price tells another story. Despite its dominance in activity metrics, Solana’s price has been stuck in the same range for weeks, failing to reward its holders with even modest gains. That’s what makes the contrast with Digitap ($TAP) so striking. Solana trades sideways, but this new crypto presale project has already crossed the $1 million milestone—and investors are rushing in. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis – Strong Network, Weak Momentum The Solana price is currently trading around $192, just below the psychological $200 barrier. The chart shows a clear struggle to maintain upward momentum after multiple failed breakouts earlier this month. The 200-day moving average, currently around $176, remains the key dynamic support. The SOL price recently rebounded from that zone, but without strong follow-through from buyers, the move lacks conviction. Historically, whenever Solana failed to close several candles above the 200-day MA, it signaled further weakness ahead. Source: TradingView Short-term resistance sits at $200–$210, where multiple rejections have formed. A break above that area could open the way toward $230, but given the broader market’s hesitation, that scenario looks unlikely in the near term. On the downside, support lies at $185, followed by $176, and a daily close below those levels could trigger a deeper pullback toward $160. The RSI at 56 tells a neutral story (not overbought, not oversold), but this mid-zone reading after a failed rally often precedes another correction. Momentum traders will be watching for a drop below 45 on RSI, which would confirm a bearish continuation. In short, Solana’s fundamentals are solid, but the chart signals exhaustion. Without new catalysts, a move below $185 is more probable than a breakout above $210. Digitap Presale Explodes Past $1 Million Digitap has been breaking every presale record in sight. The project has already sold more than 73 million TAP tokens, raising over $1 million in record time. What’s behind this rush? Real utility—something most early-stage projects can only dream of. Digitap is building a live, fully functional ecosystem centered around its omni-bank concept. The app unifies banking, crypto trading, and digital finance tools into a single interface, offering services such as multi-currency wallets, Visa support, and Apple/Google Pay integration. Freelancers and digital nomads are especially drawn to Digitap because it provides tools for invoicing, payments, and income tracking, all within one ecosystem. The TAP token is at the core of this structure—used for staking, transaction discounts, and the project’s buyback-and-burn system that continually reduces circulating supply. That mix of live product, strong utility, and transparent tokenomics has made Digitap one of the fastest-growing presales of the year. The next TAP price increase in the viral crypto presale, which will raise the token price by roughly 40%, is expected any day now. Investors who joined early are already sitting on solid paper gains, and those waiting for the next stage risk buying in at much higher levels. USE THE CODE “LIVEAPP30” FOR 30% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES Digitap vs. Solana – The Clearer Bet for Growth Solana has earned its place as a top-tier blockchain. It’s efficient, scalable, and deeply integrated across DeFi and NFTs. But the market doesn’t reward usage alone—it rewards momentum, and right now, Solana doesn’t have it. Digitap, on the other hand, is still at the beginning of its journey—and that’s exactly where the upside lies. With over $1 million raised, 70 million tokens sold, and the next 40% price jump around the corner (from $0.0194 to $0.0268), it has the kind of investor energy that Solana had in its early days. The listing price is projected to be nearly 5x the current presale level, meaning those who act before the next stage could secure a major advantage before Digitap officially hits the market. Digitap’s big presale momentum, working product, and buyback-driven tokenomics make it one of the best cryptos to buy now heading into 2026. Solana remains a blue chip, but Digitap is where the real action is right now. Digitap is Live NOW.

I'm initiating BLSH at a sell rating, with far better opportunities that exist in the broader crypto sector. BLSH operates a smaller crypto exchange and CoinDesk, but struggles with limited coin offerings and lower trading volumes compared to major competitors. Key concerns include declining user engagement, trading volumes, and challenges in scaling up against larger, more trusted exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. 2025 has been a surprisingly active year for the IPO market, as many unicorns cashed in on sky-high stock valuations to test the waters as a public company. The typical pattern this year has been a strong Day 1 pop, followed by a slow burn down: that said, this doesn't mean that all these dips are worth buying. Bullish ( BLSH ), in my view, is a company that I think has further downside to go. The crypto exchange and services provider went public this year at $37 per share and promptly shot up to $68 on its first day of trading: but since then, shares of Bullish have dropped ~20% post-IPO, technically putting the stock in bear market territory. But given the fact that the stock is struggling to justify a rich valuation, I think there will be further trouble ahead for the company. Data by YCharts I'm initiating Bullish at a sell rating. In my view, there are far better crypto and crypto-related investments to make in the current market (I'm particularly bullish on CleanSpark ( CLSK ), a Bitcoin miner that is making use of its data center capacity to diversify its business into AI compute), while Bullish's metrics don't inspire much confidence. A Crypto Exchange And Data Platform First, let's get a good understanding of Bullish's business and how the company generates revenue. Bullish revenue streams (Bullish Q2 investor presentation) Bullish, as shown in the chart above, operates two key brands: Bullish and CoinDesk. At its heart, Bullish Exchange is a standard crypto exchange, and one that generates transactional revenue by taking a spread on trading volumes. The key growth driver here is, of course, volatility: the frequency with which Bullish users are making trades on the platform. We must emphasize that Bullish is a much smaller exchange platform than many of its rivals, which may give the company a hard time in attaining new clients and earning their trust, especially with new-to-crypto crowds who want the perceived stability of a larger name. According to CoinMarketCap, one of the leading sites for crypto prices and exchange data, Bullish only gives users the capability to trade 51 coins, with an average 24-hour trading volume of just $1.9 billion. Meanwhile, the largest exchange company by far is Binance, which offers 598 coins and has $19.9 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Coinbase (BASE), which offers 341 coins, is also among the better-known contenders, with $2.4 billion in trading volume. We note that while Coinbase's consumer trading volume is relatively small, Coinbase has begun gravitating toward institutional clients, which has enlarged its trading base. It's important to note that to date, Bullish has not yet generated trading revenue from the U.S., with all of its trading volumes coming from overseas markets, particularly Europe. The company recently received a license from New York State to offer digital asset spot trading and custody services, marking the beginning of its foray into the U.S. We note that hopes of positive contribution from the start of U.S. trading are one of the core supports that the stock is banking on. Describing the potential of the U.S. launch on the company's inaugural earnings call , CEO Thomas Farley noted as follows in late September: Finally, I'd like to discuss our U.S. launch. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have received the New York BitLicense. This was the last critical item for us to launch in the United States. So what's next? From an activation standpoint, our team has already been pounding the pavement, building a pipeline of interested exchange customers, including asset managers, hedge funds, retail brokers and more. In many instances, we can leverage our relationships with these very customers on the information services front to establish warm introductions and get them excited about the prospect of onboarding the Bullish. Our onboarding team and relationship managers have hit the ground running. We are also advantaged due to our global order book, a single global order book. Any U.S. client that onboards to our exchange will have access to our already existing global liquidity from day 1, meaning there is no 0 to 1 or cold start problem and meaning that U.S. customers will instantly benefit from our best-in-class liquidity in crypto's largest assets. It is worth noting that our targeted customer base is institutional. Institutional clients do take some time to fully onboard to the exchange and begin trading. We are optimistic about the opportunity in the United States, and we believe it could fast become our largest trading market."" Bullish also operates liquidity services, partnering with the likes of Solana to support the stablecoin infrastructure and provide liquidity in the crypto markets. The company's other major business is CoinDesk, which the company acquired in late 2023 . Think of CoinDesk as the rough equivalent of CNBC or Bloomberg for the crypto markets, providing live price data and headline news. CoinDesk generates subscription revenue to provide advanced data for professional traders and crypto firms, while also generating ad revenue from consumer users who land on its website. Declining Viewership And Trading Volumes Now armed with context, we can dive into Bullish's problems. Take a look at the company's most recent trending metrics below: Bullish trended KPIs (Bullish Q2 investor presentation) As shown above, transaction revenue (earned from trading spreads) declined -43% sequentially and -31% y/y to just $24.1 million in Q2, which is the quarter ending in June. The outlook is potentially worse as we look ahead to Q3. Like many other exchanges, such as Robinhood ( HOOD ), Bullish reports user trading activity on a monthly basis, and even though we haven't received the official Q3 earnings release yet, we do have the results of spot trading volumes from July through September. Bullish monthly metrics (Bullish Q2 investor presentation) Total spot trading volume in Q3 totaled $130.4 billion, while total trading volume clocked in at $142.2 billion. The concerning aspect here, however, is that spot volumes have continued to weaken every month in Q3. September, in particular, saw a -19% month-on-month decline versus $44.3 billion in August, which in turn weakened -9% from July. Trading volumes were about ~2x higher, averaging ~$80 billion per month in Q1. Of course, bulls will chime in here and say this is all prior to getting any contribution from U.S. traders. I, however, am less hopeful. If Bullish's existing customers are already showing signs of less frequent/less volatile trading, there is little hope that U.S. traders will be showing meaningfully different trends. Moreover, Bullish is entering into a very competitive crypto exchange landscape in the U.S. American investors already have access to Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood, and a host of other exchanges: just because Bullish is launching doesn't mean there is any immediate appeal that will help the company win new traders onto its platform. Native access to CoinDesk and its non-trading revenue could be considered Bullish's key advantage and distinguishing factor. And yet here, the publicly reported statuses are also quite disappointing. In Q2, CoinDesk's unique page views fell -21% y/y to 26.4 million. Meanwhile, active monthly users fell to 2.9 million, a 0.1 million sequential loss of monthly actives from Q1, and a staggering -43% decline y/y. Needless to say, CoinDesk is already active in the U.S. market and has no exogenous tailwind to boost site visitation volumes. Amid visible sequential declines in both of Bullish's core businesses, we note that the company is absorbing higher public-company costs, with headcount rising 9% y/y to 406 full-time employees. Bullish opex (Bullish Q2 investor presentation) This caused Bullish's adjusted EBITDA to fall -45% y/y to $8.1 million in the most recent quarter, with margins of 14.2% falling 10 points y/y. We do note, however, that Bullish is expecting a bounce-back in adjusted EBITDA in Q3, guiding to a $25-$28 million adjusted EBITDA at a 36-37% margin range on the back of stronger expected subscription and services revenue. Bullish Q3 outlook (Bullish Q2 investor presentation) Valuation And Key Takeaways Despite worrying signals in both trading volumes as well as CoinDesk viewership, we find that Bullish still trades at rich valuation multiples. At current share prices near $55, Bullish trades at a market cap of $7.87 billion. Meanwhile, the company has a post-IPO net asset value (including cash as well as crypto holdings) of $3.65 billion, marked as of the mid-September earnings call using a BTC price of ~$116k (currently ~4% lower, at ~$111k at the time of writing). Bullish NAV (Bullish Q2 investor presentation) Netting off this NAV as-is gives Bullish an enterprise value of $4.22 billion. For FY26, Wall Street analysts are expecting Bullish to generate $351.7 million in revenue, or 33% y/y growth. If we aggressively assume the company can maintain a ~36% adjusted EBITDA margin on this revenue profile (or $126.6 million in adjusted EBITDA, with margins flat to the company's Q3 guidance), the stock still trades at a rich 33x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA multiple. Data by YCharts Of course, Bullish trades in a rather frothy market for crypto-related companies and crypto exchanges. That said, I wouldn't bet on a very small exchange being very successful in a U.S. market that is already dominated by big names.

Investors and enthusiasts will be keen to uncover how these changes might signal new opportunities. This update delves into the latest trends and charts shaping the DeFi market, offering insights on which coins are poised for potential growth in the upcoming week. In a rapidly changing landscape of shifting focus and narratives, timely interventions and consistent visibility are crucial. This is why data-driven PR firms such as Outset PR do more than just track token prices; they also monitor the broader media environment. To significantly boost the effectiveness of PR campaigns, Outset Data Pulse provides current intelligence on crypto media performance. Arbitrum (ARB) Shows Potential for a Rebound Despite Recent Slips Source: tradingview Arbitrum's price is currently hovering between 28 to 35 cents. Over the past month, it's taken a hit, dropping by nearly 30%. Yet, the tide might soon turn. The nearest resistance level is close to 40 cents, and breaking through could push the price further, approaching 47 cents. This suggests an upside potential of around 30% from its current state.

Monero Steadily Climbs: XMR Moves Toward New Price Heights Source: tradingview Monero is on a steady rise, with its price sitting between $287 and $337. In the last month, it saw a notable increase of around 13%, boosting its value by over 43% in six months. Monero's relative strength index suggests positive momentum, hitting slightly above the average, at 60.40. The current 10-day average price is a bit higher than the 100-day average, signaling ongoing growth. If Monero breaks past its resistance level at about $359, it could aim for the next mark at approximately $409. That's about a 10% rise from current levels.

But oh, not anymore. The return of Changpeng Zhao has turned the U.S. crypto market into a direct contest between him and Brian, and neither of them can afford to pretend otherwise. After that presidential pardon from Donald Trump, CZ is no longer restricted from taking part in the exchange he built, and that changes the entire balance of power in America, where Binance has been mostly locked out. CZ’s first public act after the pardon was a message posted mid-flight. “Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice. Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide.” The market understood CZ immediately. His presence matters, because for as long as he has been in this industry, CZ has been one of the top 5 people everyone loves and respects in the community. And that matters, because Brian does not have that kind of likability. He doesn’t have fans fighting for his honor under X posts that dare to criticize him, even just in the slightest way. Changpeng Zhao at Media Village during day one of Web Summit 2022 at the Altice Arena in Lisbon, Portugal. Photo Web Summit via Flickr . Anyway, right now, Binance handles about 50% of global Bitcoin trading, while its U.S. affiliate manages less than 1%. Meanwhile, Coinbase is all over Wall Street and Silicon Valley, with deep ties to banks, investment firms, asset managers, and now, even regulators. Attorney Jonathan Groth said, “The effect of a presidential pardon is rather sweeping. It appears CZ can now re-engage and be more involved with Binance and or its subsidiaries and other ventures.” Binance plans US reintegration under CZ’s restored influence According to Bloomberg, Binance is considering either merging Binance US into the global exchange or allowing the global exchange to directly enter the U.S. market. Both options mean the same thing: U.S. users would gain access to the same liquidity, derivatives, and token depth available elsewhere. Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, said the American affiliate will likely be “reintegrated into the global Binance ecosystem, giving US investors direct access to the platform’s deep liquidity and comprehensive derivatives offerings.” As you should know, Trump has repeatedly aligned himself with crypto-friendly messaging since returning to the White House, and his family continues to benefit financially through involvement in token ventures, with Eric Trump specifically making hundreds of millions in mere weeks! But Binance also assisted the Trump-backed company World Liberty in launching a stablecoin project expected to generate tens of millions annually. Democrats like Senators Liz Warren and Chuck Schumer described CZ’s pardon as a conflict of interest, but Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pardon had been “thoroughly reviewed,” adding that it is “100% deserved.” U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren speaking with attendees at the 2019 National Forum on Wages and Working People hosted by the Center for the American Progress Action Fund and the SEIU at the Enclave in Las Vegas, Nevada.

But the pardon also removes barriers to ownership control in markets like Thailand, Malaysia, and South Korea, where Binance recently secured approval to acquire the exchange GOPAX after two years of review. Patrick Horsman, chief investment officer at Applied DNA Sciences, said Binance’s strengths make it likely to become “a dominant powerhouse in the American crypto market.” Political capital, global expansion, and direct pressure on Coinbase Moments after the pardon, Binance’s BNB token surged by nearly 10%. Bloomberg data shows that CZ’s net worth is now about $58 billion, and his family office, YZi Labs, backs multiple ecosystem projects. The BNB chain hosts around $8.7 billion in assets and ranks third behind Ethereum and Solana, as of press time. Since his release from prison in September last year, CZ has been extremely active. He backed Aster, a decentralized exchange competing with Hyperliquid, and has been building an education platform. He has met with leaders in Malaysia, Pakistan, and Kyrgyzstan, pushing national-level crypto adoption. On stage in Dubai, CZ said, “I am still young. I can’t play golf all day, you still have to do stuff.” He described doing eight to ten meetings per day. President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in 2024. Photo by Gage Skidmore via Flickr . CZ’s return also prompts speculation about whether he will reclaim the CEO position from Richard Teng, who has been leading Binance since CZ stepped down, saying he has no plans to return. David Namdar, who runs a BNB treasury business backed by CZ’s office, said, “I’d be surprised if he stepped back into running it again.” So, for now, it seems CZ will pursue US dominance without a CEO title, which is fine since the man has done a fine job of proving that he doesn’t need it to shine. But technological setbacks remain. During a historic market crash earlier this month, Binance suffered technical failures that triggered forced liquidations that led to compensation of nearly one billion dollars. Binance’s token listing fees have also been scrutinized. Whether CZ’s name ends up on the office door again or not, one thing’s clear right now. Binance isn’t knocking anymore. It’s walking in. And Coinbase better clear some space.",OP-ED|Binance|BNB|Coinbase|Gopax|USD|YZi Labs,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-26 09:00:09

Shared by crypto researcher SMQKE, the clip features Andolfatto acknowledging that Ripple’s system could “coexist with the U.S. payment system,” a remark that has reignited discussions around how blockchain technology may integrate with central banking infrastructure. The exchange took place during a public event at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, where Andolfatto previously served as Vice President of Research. An audience member, a Ripple user, raised a question regarding the possibility of peer-to-peer, currency-agnostic payment systems operating alongside central banks in the United States. The economist’s response offered a measured but notable endorsement of interoperability between traditional financial systems and blockchain-based platforms. Remember, the Federal Reserve’s David Andalfatto confirmed that Ripple’s protocol can “co-exist with the U.S Payment system.” Listen closely. https://t.co/fiz3ocUEAS pic.twitter.com/8FhivmpIJK — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 21, 2025 Andolfatto’s Explanation of Coexistence In the clip, Andolfatto acknowledged Ripple as a “currency-agnostic platform” designed to facilitate global payments without depending on a single monetary system. He explained that Ripple’s protocol is capable of processing payments for individuals and institutions across various currencies, whether U.S. dollars, yen, or digital assets such as Bitcoin . According to his remarks, the Federal Reserve could be viewed as one of several institutions whose currency could be used within the Ripple framework, suggesting a model in which central bank and blockchain-based infrastructures function in parallel. Andolfatto further described Ripple as a system capable of supporting financial inclusion by enabling cross-border transactions for the unbanked. He emphasized that the platform’s ability to operate independently of any one currency offers a potential bridge between the traditional banking sector and emerging decentralized technologies. His conclusion that there is already “room for coexistence” underscored the view that blockchain networks could integrate into the current monetary system rather than compete against it. Community Reactions and Interpretations Following SMQKE’s post, the video quickly circulated among digital asset analysts and XRP community members, many interpreting Andolfatto’s statement as validation of Ripple’s institutional relevance. An X user, X Finance Bull, responded by suggesting that coexistence may understate the eventual dynamic, arguing that central institutions could ultimately depend on Ripple’s infrastructure to facilitate efficient payment settlement. While Andolfatto’s remarks date back several years, their resurfacing comes at a time when blockchain interoperability, regulatory clarity, and cross-border payment modernization are receiving renewed attention from both policymakers and private institutions. The reference by a Federal Reserve economist to Ripple’s protocol as compatible with U.S. monetary operations continues to hold symbolic weight in ongoing debates about the role of distributed ledger technology in future financial frameworks.

Indeed, after facing the threat of dropping below $2 amid a broader market sell-off, XRP has gained over 2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $2.61 as of press time. Meanwhile, over the past week, the asset is up more than 11%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP price predictions Regarding the price outlook for November 1, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which offered several price scenarios for XRP, indicating that the most likely level will be around $2.90. The model places the cryptocurrency within a confidence range of $2.85 to $2.95, reflecting steady bullish momentum heading into November. According to ChatGPT’s analysis, XRP’s breakout above the $2.50 level represents a crucial psychological and technical shift after weeks of resistance. Trading volume around $2.60 has strengthened, signaling genuine buying interest rather than a short-term speculative move. The AI model also highlighted XRP’s tendency to move in rapid 8% to 10% bursts when momentum builds. With broader crypto sentiment remaining positive, XRP could make another upward push, testing the $3 mark before the start of November. Key resistance, as identified by ChatGPT, lies between $2.95 and $3, while solid support ranges from $2.50 to $2.55. A daily close above $2.80 would likely confirm a sustained breakout, whereas a slip below $2.60 could trigger a brief correction toward $2.45 and $2.50. XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT ChatGPT’s forecast also factors in market indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), estimated to be in the mid-60s ,a range suggesting that XRP still has room to rise without being overbought. Additionally, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current consolidation phase provides altcoins like XRP a chance to extend gains in the short term. XRP open interest dips Meanwhile, insights shared by cryptocurrency analyst CryptoRus in an X post on October 26 indicate that XRP’s open interest on Binance has plunged to the same lows seen in May 2025, when a similar flush triggered a rally from $0.70 to $3.50. This time, despite the sharp drop in leverage, XRP is holding above $2.60, signaling that strong holders remain in control. XRP open interest.

Picking the right PR partner now means finding a team that understands blockchain media, local language nuances, and how to prove ROI beyond press mentions. Below are eight agencies that define Europe’s crypto PR scene in 2025 — each with a track record, measurable results, and strong regional presence. 1. Outset PR — Europe’s Data-Driven Crypto PR Pioneer Outset PR has become the go-to name for crypto and Web3 companies aiming to turn publicity into quantifiable growth. What sets it apart is its precision on metrics — every campaign is backed by analytics tracking media exposure, engagement, and conversions across European markets. Outset PR’s edge lies in its deep understanding of European crypto media performance. The team constantly tracks which outlets and narratives drive the strongest outcomes across different EU regions. This allows Outset PR to craft campaigns that align perfectly with how the local media landscape responds — choosing stories that resonate and timing announcements for maximum impact. Case studies like Step App, ChangeNOW, and StealthEX show tangible results: token growth, millions in reach, and coverage in leading business and tech publications. By combining that media intelligence with precise reporting, the agency delivers not just exposure but meaningful visibility that moves metrics. For projects aiming to expand or strengthen their reputation in Europe, Outset PR remains the most insight-driven PR partner in the space. 2. MarketAcross — Europe’s All-in-One Crypto PR Engine Operating across multiple European markets, MarketAcross combines public relations, content marketing, and SEO. Its campaigns for networks like Avalanche, Polygon, and Ankr have driven billions in online readership.

Wachsman — Legacy Expertise with EU Depth Founded in Dublin and expanded into London, Wachsman has been a cornerstone of crypto communications since the industry’s early days. Known for its work with leading exchanges, infrastructure projects, and layer-1 blockchains, it brings old-school PR precision to the fast-moving crypto world. Its European offices make Wachsman especially effective for regulated or institutional clients seeking polished press relations and issue management within the EU. 4. YAP Global — Storytelling for DeFi and Web3 YAP Global made its name helping decentralized-finance protocols explain complex ideas in plain English. The London-based team focuses on narrative building and thought leadership, helping founders and projects position themselves as credible voices in a post-MiCA environment. With operations across Europe and Asia, YAP Global is often the first call for DeFi startups ready to move from technical obscurity to mainstream understanding. 5. EAK Digital — The PR Agency that Builds Its Own Events Turkey- and UK-based EAK Digital mixes traditional PR with owned media. It’s the organizer behind BlockDown Conference and Istanbul Blockchain Week, giving clients a stage as well as coverage. The agency’s Web3 division runs press campaigns for projects like Conflux and Wanchain, with a strong emphasis on community engagement and media visibility across Europe. 6. Lunar Strategy — Lisbon’s Crypto Growth Specialist Lisbon has quietly become Europe’s Web3 hub, and Lunar Strategy has grown alongside it. Known for its combination of PR, growth marketing, and KOL activation, Lunar delivers cross-channel visibility for projects like Polkadot, Cardano, and MultiversX. Its transparent case studies, data-first approach, and focus on emerging sectors such as DePIN and AI-crypto make it a solid choice for projects scaling across the continent. 7. PRLab — Amsterdam’s Tech-and-Crypto Communications Team Based in Amsterdam, PRLab offers tailored communication strategies for blockchain and fintech brands.

With an agile European team and deep ties to KOL networks, it helps tokens, NFT projects, and gaming ecosystems amplify campaigns across social and earned media simultaneously. How to Choose the Right Crypto PR Agency in 2025 Check MiCA familiarity. European PR now requires regulatory awareness — avoid teams that over-promise or ignore disclosure standards. Ask for real metrics. Look for deliverables beyond “coverage” — impressions, traffic, token engagement, and brand-search growth. Prioritize localisation. Europe isn’t one market; you’ll need native-language support in DE, FR, ES, and IT to make headlines stick. Ensure transparency. The best agencies share campaign reports openly. Outset PR and MarketAcross set a strong example here. Evaluate content integration. PR alone isn’t enough — long-form articles, data stories, and SEO-ready press materials sustain momentum. Final Thoughts Crypto PR in Europe has matured. The focus has shifted from hype cycles to sustainable communication built on transparency, measurable results, and compliance. Agencies like Outset PR, MarketAcross, and Wachsman show that credibility now scales faster than noise — and in 2025, that’s what wins both investors and users.

BTCI generates monthly dividends by selling call options on Bitcoin, providing regular income but with variable payouts due to Bitcoin's volatility. The ETF holds Bitcoin through the VanEck Bitcoin ETF and synthetic positions, investing surplus cash in treasuries for additional yield. BTCI has underperformed Bitcoin since inception and remains a high-risk investment, but may appeal to income-focused investors seeking crypto exposure. Article Thesis Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a very volatile asset with historically strong returns. It does not offer any income, however, and is a pure price appreciation play. NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) is an ETF that seeks to combine Bitcoin exposure with income generation via a covered call option strategy. That results in a very high income yield, but BTCI has underperformed Bitcoin since its inception, and I believe that the ETF shouldn't be seen as a low-risk investment at all. Past Coverage I have not covered NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF in the past, but I covered another NEOS income fund here on Seeking Alpha in the past: QQQI ( QQQI ), NEOS' NASDAQ-100 covered call ETF, on which I wrote a bullish article in May , with shares returning 16% since then. For income investors who are interested in high dividend yields, this ETF (and article) could be of interest. Bitcoin: Advantages And Disadvantages Bitcoin has, since its creation, been an excellent investment for long-term holders. The cryptocurrency has risen from way less than $1 per coin to more than $100,000, turning long-term holders rich. Bitcoin offers inflation protection, since a finite amount of Bitcoin can be created, it offers independence of central banks, can be stored decentrally, and so on. On the other hand, Bitcoin has some disadvantages as well -- it is very cyclical, taxation of gains can be complicated in some jurisdictions, and it does not offer any income or cash flow -- for positive returns, investors are thus forced to sell, with price appreciation not being guaranteed, despite strong historic returns. The last point, dependence on price appreciation due to there not being any cash flow, is what the Bitcoin ETF from NEOS seeks to solve. NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF: Overview NEOS is an ETF manager that is focused on income ETFs that it primarily creates via covered call option strategies, including ETFs with the NASDAQ-100, the S&P500 ( SPY ), or Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) as a basis. The ETF we'll look into today, NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF, uses Bitcoin as a basis and generates income via a covered call option overlay. A call option contract allows the buyer of the contract to buy an asset, such as Bitcoin or a stock, at a specified price during a specified time frame. The seller of the call option contract gets a payment when the option is sold -- the option premium. A covered call option strategy means that an investor holds an underlying asset, in this case Bitcoin, and sells call options to receive income via the option premiums that the seller of the option gets. If you want more information about covered call options in general, check out this article from Seeking Alpha. In BTCI's case, the strategy works like this: The ETF holds a position in Bitcoin and sells call options on Bitcoin at the same time. By selling these call options, BTCI receives regular cash flow, which is then paid out to the ETF's holders via dividends. The long position in Bitcoin, the underlying asset, is created via an investment in the VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) and via a synthetic long position (buying a call option and selling a put option at the same strike price) in the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index (""CBTX""). Since the synthetic long position does not require the same amount of money being invested compared to a regular long position, the ETF has some surplus cash that is mostly invested in treasuries, which has the benefit of creating some additional income via the interest that the ETF receives. The following chart shows what BTCI's assets look like right now -- the data is from BTCI's fact sheet : BTCI assets (BTCI fact sheet) The long call option and short put option positions with a strike price of $2,680 create the synthetic long position, the two short call positions with a strike price of $3,050/$2,900 create the covered call position, and the money that isn't needed for anything else right now is either held in cash or treasuries. BTCI: A Lot Of Income Whether option premiums are high or not depends, among other factors, on volatility. Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, thus option premiums are pretty high. That's good for BTCI, as it means that the ETF receives a lot of cash by selling covered call options. This explains how the ETF is able to offer such a high dividend yield to its investors: per Seeking Alpha, its dividend yield is exactly 30% right now. BTCI's dividend is paid out monthly, which generates a very nice regular income stream. It's important to note, however, that the monthly payments vary to some degree: Volatility is higher in some months and lower in others, which results in higher/lower option premiums, which results in higher/lower dividends, all else equal. We see this in the following table: BTCI's dividend payments over time (BTCI fact sheet) There are some ups and downs in the dividend on a month-to-month basis, and a bit of a downward trend over time. But even if BTCI were to only pay out the lowest of these payments, $1.26, in the future, the yield would be pretty high, at around 27%, based on a current share price of $57. Is BTCI A Good Investment? NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF does not have a long history, but since its inception last fall, just above one year ago, returns have been strong: its price has appreciated by 12%, and investors got a lot of income on top of that. But since BTCI is exposed to price movements of Bitcoin, we should compare its performance to that: Data by YCharts We see that BTCI has underperformed Bitcoin to some degree since its inception, even with the dividends from the ETF being accounted for -- returns were strong, but holding Bitcoin would have resulted in even better returns. While BTCI has outperformed most stocks and stock indices such as QQQ ( QQQ ) or the S&P 500 since its inception, I don't think that's a good comparison: going long BTCI means more volatility and more risk compared to stocks, as Bitcoin has regularly experienced big drawdowns in the past, 80% or even 90% in some cases, which is not the case for stock indices over the same time frame. Regulatory risks are also larger when having Bitcoin exposure, I believe. If Bitcoin were to fall a lot, the same would be true for BTCI, as its underlying assets mostly consist of (synthetic) Bitcoin. The risks of owning BTCI are thus comparable to those of owning Bitcoin outright, with history suggesting that Bitcoin has a somewhat better return outlook. This is due to the following reason: The problem with a covered call strategy is that the upside is limited at the level of the strike price of the call option. If the underlying, in this case Bitcoin, appreciates in price quickly, the call option seller may not participate fully. The downside isn't limited, though, meaning the call option seller does participate fully. Depending on the ups and downs of Bitcoin, BTCI may thus move down when Bitcoin moves down, but not move up as much as Bitcoin does during positive days/weeks/months. The income that BTCI generates wasn't enough to fully offset this, which is why BTCI underperformed Bitcoin. Going forward, the same could happen: BTCI may very well continue to underperform Bitcoin while having the same downside risk. Some investors may decide that the high yield is worth this return risk, but I think that those who want Bitcoin exposure may fare better with a pure Bitcoin long position instead of owning this ETF.

This surge propelled its market capitalization to $157.6 billion , edging past Binance Coin (BNB), which now stands at $156.3 billion. The move pushed XRP into the fourth position among the top cryptocurrencies, leaving BNB trailing behind. Notably, XRP surge to $2.63, has been fueled by strategic corporate moves and technical resilience. After recently dropping to lows of $1.90, this breakout signals renewed buying interest and growing market confidence in the token’s momentum. Therefore, XRP’s surge reflects Ripple’s strategic push into institutional markets through partnerships and compliance-driven innovations. Coupled with a stabilizing crypto market, easing inflation, and growing institutional adoption, the token’s reclaiming of a key resistance level underscores its resilience and adaptability. What’s next? Well, XRP’s technicals indicate potential for continued gains if support holds above $2.60. Short-term traders target $2.75–$2.80, while long-term investors focus on Ripple’s strategic push into institutional payments and stablecoin adoption. Therefore, XRP’s leap past BNB signals more than market rankings, it highlights strategic moves, strong technical momentum, and bullish sentiment. Its current ‘overdrive’ phase may mark a pivotal chapter, cementing XRP as a major force in crypto’s competitive landscape. XRP Gains Bullish Traction After Rebounding From Key $2.50 Support Zone XRP is showing renewed bullish momentum after bouncing off a critical support leve l at $2.50, according to market commentator Crypto Wave. This technical rebound has reignited investor optimism, as the cryptocurrency appears to be positioning itself for another potential upward surge. Notably, XRP has held the lower trendline of its ascending triangle, a pattern historically signaling strong bullish moves. Earlier in 2025, this support sparked rebounds of 70–80%, hinting the market may be gearing up for another surge. Ascending triangles signal potential breakouts in technical analysis. For XRP, repeated tests of the $2.50 support confirm resilience and reinforce its bullish structure. Traders now watch for a breakout above the upper trendline, which could trigger a renewed rally toward previous highs and beyond. Beyond technical signals, XRP’s momentum is fueled by rising adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions and growing institutional interest. According to Crypto Wave, these fundamental drivers, paired with favorable technical setups, set the stage for the token’s next bullish phase. Conclusion XRP’s surge past BNB highlights its rising market influence and strategic resilience. Reclaiming key price levels and boosting market cap, the token reflects strong technicals, investor confidence, and Ripple’s institutional initiatives. As it consolidates gains and eyes higher targets, XRP’s momentum could redefine the top-tier crypto landscape. Meanwhile, XRP’s rebound from $2.50 to $2.63 underscores its resilience and marks a potentially pivotal point in its 2025 trajectory. Backed by an ascending triangle and a history of strong rebounds, the token is poised for another bullish surge.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-26 09:17:51

The ruling was made by Justice N Anand Venkatesh, who said that although digital assets are not physical objects or legal currency, they still have all the main features of property. Justice Venkatesh noted that digital assets are identifiable, transferable, and controlled exclusively through private keys, with these features making them satisfy conditions to be identified as property. In his statement, the judge claimed that there is no doubt about crypto being a property, highlighting that it is not a tangible asset and neither is it a currency. However, he highlighted that it is a property that can be possessed, enjoyed, and capable of being held in a trust Indian High Court rules crypto is property The need for clarity came after a cyberattack on crypto exchange platform WazirX, run by Zanmai Labs Pvt Ltd. An investor had bought about 3,532 XRP tokens worth Rs. 198,516 (approximately $2,260) on the platform in January 2024. Later that year, the platform revealed that its cold wallets had been hacked, leading to a loss of more than $230 million in Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens. After the hack, all functions were disabled, and user accounts, including the investor’s, were frozen. Now, the investor is seeking legal protection, arguing that her XRP tokens were different from the Ethereum tokens that were stolen after being held in trust by WazirX. She asked the court for protection under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, so that the crypto exchange would not redistribute her holdings. Meanwhile, Zanmai and its directors have opposed this, noting that the company is carrying out the exercise under a Singaporean court order that required all users to share losses. Zanmai Labs’ argument was rejected by Justice Venkatesh, who argued that the applicant’s XRP coins were not part of the hack, which the company had claimed only affected Ethereum-based tokens. “What were held by the applicant as cryptocurrencies were 3532.30 XRP coins. What were subjected to a cyber attack on 18.7.2024 in the WazirX platform were ERC 20 coins, which are completely different cryptocurrencies not held by the applicant,” the Court said. Justice Venkatesh claims jurisdiction applies In his ruling, Justice Venkatesh mentioned that aside from being identifiable and transferable, digital assets can be controlled through private keys. He also mentioned Section 2 (47A) of the Income Tax Act of 1961, which recognizes cryptocurrencies as virtual digital assets. “In Indian law regime, the cryptocurrency is treated as a virtual digital asset, and it is not treated as a speculative transaction,” he added. In addition, the court also dismissed claims that it had no jurisdiction in the case because the arbitration was done in Singapore. It pointed to a legal precedent, noting the Supreme Court’s decision in PASL Wind Solutions Pvt Ltd v. GE Power Conversion India Pvt Ltd (2021), which means that Indian courts have the right to protect assets located in India. The High Court claimed that the transactions were made in Chennai and the investor in this case used an Indian bank account, making the case fall under its jurisdiction. Justice Venkatesh also noted that Zanmai Labs is registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in India and is allowed to handle digital assets in India. He highlighted that in this case, the exchange, who registered as a reporting entity in the country, is authorized to handle crypto transactions. “Neither the Zettai nor Binance is registered as a reporting entity in India,” he said. He added that crypto exchanges need to follow the same corporate governance standards as other businesses. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) remain popular, but their short-term volatility and unpredictable behavior pose challenges to timing and risk management. Step in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto coin in Phase 6 of the presale, with less than 25% left. The MUTM token, which began at $0.01 during Phase 1, has appreciated by 250% to $0.035. At the conclusion of the current phase, it will appreciate by 14.29% to $0.04, demonstrating the project’s steady gain model that is good news for early investors. For those investors looking to diversify away from meme coins and ride the next DeFi wave, Mutuum Finance is the top cryptocurrency to convert a $1,000 investment into nice returns in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis: Probable Rebound from Unsatiable Demand Zone Shiba Inu (SHIB) has just fallen hard, leaving a palpable gap behind which can be used as a price reversal magnet. The token is now resting in a strong demand area, meaning that the rebound here is going to occur. Analysts are pointing SHIB to hold back higher against EMAs, which will close the void gap and provide us with some kind of impression whether the buyers are prepared to assume short-term control. As SHIB short-term action is observed by traders, so too are the majority interested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with increased amounts of attention from investors anticipating the next market cycle and the rising new crypto coin. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Price Analysis: Investigating Critical Resistance Point Pepe Coin (PEPE) is currently at the 0.000069 resistance level after bouncing from near-term lows, but price action is poor on top trendline, i.e., exhaustion. A rejection in this instance could drive PEPE lower to the 0.000068-0.000069 support level, while a clean break above 7.0e-6 could start short-term momentum and a small rally. The outlook, as of now, is neutral until confirmation of either scenario. As market players closely monitor these support and resistance formulas, many are monitoring the market for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also as it gains increasing interest heading into the next major cycle of the market and is becoming a top cryptocurrency. Mutuum Finance’s Growth Exceeds Projections Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the latest hottest new crypto coins to look out for in 2025. Its presale continues to draw increasingly larger investments from global investors with over 17,450 investors contributing a combined amount of over $17.95 million thus far. In Phase 6 the token is at $0.035, the lowest you’ll ever see it, setting it up to be a great early bird investment before the token value increases to $0.04 in the next phase. The current stage has witnessed violent buying pressure pushing sales beyond the 75% mark in record time. Investors have no doubt about the future prospects of the project, making MUTM the top cryptocurrency to invest in today. Mutuum Finance similarly presents excellent opportunities for passive income. APY may be gained by investors on a demand basis by investing assets in the pool of the platform. For example, an investor depositing $40,000 USDT into the pool can gain $4,000 after a year at 10% APY by simply letting their assets work to generate money. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a typical altcoin; it’s an entire DeFi ecosystem for real-world monetary effectiveness. With more than 17,450 investors and $17.95 million raised, its twin-lending mechanism provides Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer markets, allowing individuals to generate passive revenue, obtain versatile loans, and hedge risk in an open and automated manner. Unlike meme coins such as SHIB or speculation tokens such as PEPE, MUTM has tangible utility and the potential for early-stage appreciation, making one of the top cryptocurrencies for those looking to catch the next wave of decentralized finance. For investors seeking the next new crypto coin, MUTM provides both short-term and long-term opportunity. Check out the token in presale today.

BTCI has delivered a strong yield (about 29% forward) and positive total returns in its first year, benefiting from a bullish Bitcoin environment. The fund's structure limits upside participation and exposes investors to significant downside risk if Bitcoin enters a prolonged bear market. Given the risk profile and lack of capital preservation, BTCI earns a neutral Hold rating, suitable only for those seeking regular BTC monetization. NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) is one options income fund of many. Tied to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), there's a speculative element to this. While the crypto has had many tailwinds lately, the key shortcoming is the lack of features to secure one's principal, as is normally seen with income investments. Concept Of The Fund According to its prospectus , BTCI produces income through ""synthetic"" covered calls. As a general matter, synthetic covered calls entail three components: Selling put options on an underlying asset Buying a call option at the same strike as the put-write with its premium Selling calls on that call at a higher strike price The spread between the purchased and written calls is the basis for income, supported by short-term interest rates from the cash used in the put-write. In the case of BTCI, the underlying asset for these options positions is BTC. #1 and #2 on their own normally mimic the upside of BTC during the lifetimes of the contracts, but #3 places a ceiling on this at its own strike price, so the movement of BTC's price is important for these reasons. September 2025 Fact Sheet The table above from its fact sheet shows that management is not entirely synthetic in this approach. At that time (September 30), most of the assets were in cash equivalents (Treasuries) to support the cash-secured puts, but a portion was invested in BTC ETFs as well. Both approaches allow for a covered call strategy. Recent Holdings (BTCI Official Web Page) The most recent holdings show a similar approach, with marginal differences in position sizes and, naturally, newer contracts. BTCI Official Web Page These positions are therefore actively managed according to a data-driven strategy that management believes will be effective over time. Performance And History Incepted in October 2024, the fund is just over a year old. Let's look at the different ways it has rewarded shareholders in that time. BTCI 1Y Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) Assessing its role as an income fund, BTCI has successfully paid dividends every month since then, with distributions ranging from $1.13 to $1.57. Starting at $50 per share, this works out to a yield on cost of about 33%. On a forward basis, this suggests a yield of 29%. BTCI vs. BTC 1Y Price Returns (Seeking Alpha) Looking at price returns over the past year and comparing it to BTC, both are positive, but BTC has appreciated much more. This isn't surprising, considering there are no dividends from BTC. BTCI vs. BTC 1Y Total Returns (Seeking Alpha) Looking at total returns shows a much narrower gap. BTC is naturally still ahead, lacking an expense ratio (0.99% for BTCI) or the friction that comes from actively traded positions. Outlook And Risks Even if BTC has delivered better returns, one might wonder if BTCI is a sound income vehicle, particularly in light of the strongly positive results in its first year. First, I believe we should consider the timing of its inception. BTC 5Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) As the fund was incepted in October 2024, it was positioned ideally for the outcome of the 2024 election. One will note that BTC's price immediately prior to President Trump's victory was about $68.8K. Since then, even in the pit of tariff-related fears within the broader market, BTC has not declined to that price level. This owes to Trump's friendly stance toward crypto that he adopted during the campaign, which later culminated in the passage of the GENIUS Act this summer. Nevertheless, hindsight reveals that prolonged periods of bullishness on BTC, as seen in 2020 and 2021, can be followed by similarly long periods of bearishness, as seen in 2022 and 2023. This could pose serious problems for an ETF like this. BTCI is not an income fund in the normal sense that it invests in some kind of stable or secure principal. In fact, the put-writes that account for most of its assets create an obligation to repurchase the BTC exposure at a loss if it goes down enough. As I mentioned earlier, the covered call strategy limits upside, making it difficult to participate in rebounds and recoveries. SMCY vs. SMCI Total Returns (Seeking Alpha) If we compare YieldMax SMCI Option Income Strategy ETF ( SMCY ) and Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), we see the difference for a similar strategy that incepted immediately prior to a crash in its underlying stock. Some of the rebounds in the underlying asset were shared, but we can see that it's always much more modest. The result is negative total returns, while SMCI is slightly ahead. The timing of inception only helps to illustrate a point. As the income investor is concerned, their starting point is today, and so this risk is always on the table for them. I cannot see how BTCI would be suitable for income investors who need to maintain their principal. An investment in BTCI makes more sense for someone who wants to invest in BTC but regularly monetize some of the gains, as opposed to constantly holding. BTCI works perfectly for that, tantamount to paying a manager 99 BPS to trade your BTC holdings. So long as there are tailwinds for BTC, with growing adoption among individuals and institutions alike, this approach can work, but there isn't much one can do to manage their risk either. Conclusion BTCI has produced positive returns, riding the mostly bullish trajectory of BTC the past year. As long as this continues, shareholders can continue to rake in dividends at a high yield. In the other direction, heavy capital losses can occur that are difficult to recuperate.

Alongside this initiative, the government will create a national crypto reserve that includes BNB and other digital assets. The KGST stablecoin will operate on the BNB Chain. According to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), former head of Binance and strategic advisor to the Kyrgyz Crypto Committee, the decisions were made during a meeting of the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets, attended by President Sadyr Japarov. Local media reported that the committee has two months to propose a framework for the national digital asset reserve and to begin efforts to list KGST on international platforms. The government believes that stablecoins and CBDCs will help attract investment and support growth in the digital economy. President Japarov instructed officials to advance virtual asset legislation and ordered the National Bank to begin pilot testing of the digital som. The rollout will take place in three phases: first by connecting commercial banks, then integrating the asset with the Central Treasury, and finally testing offline transactions before the CBDC launches nationwide. A final decision is expected no earlier than 2026. Education, Innovation and the Path Ahead Kyrgyzstan is also prioritizing digital literacy and education. The president tasked ministries with creating programs to train specialists in blockchain and artificial intelligence, while Binance Academy will introduce courses at ten major universities.

Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a truly remarkable milestone, soaring past the $112,000 mark. This extraordinary BTC price surge is sending ripples across the entire digital asset landscape, captivating investors and enthusiasts alike. According to market monitoring from Bitcoin World , BTC is actively trading at an astounding $112,000 on the Binance USDT market, signaling a pivotal moment for the leading cryptocurrency. What’s Igniting This Monumental BTC Price Surge? Such a significant movement in Bitcoin’s value rarely happens without powerful catalysts. Several key factors are likely contributing to this incredible BTC price surge , painting a bullish picture for the asset’s future trajectory. Understanding these drivers helps us comprehend the current market dynamics. Institutional Adoption: A growing number of institutional investors, including major corporations and hedge funds, are allocating significant capital to Bitcoin. Their increased participation provides substantial buying pressure and adds legitimacy to the asset. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and a search for alternative stores of value often push investors towards scarce assets like Bitcoin. The current financial climate appears to favor digital gold. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and the halving events, which reduce the rate of new Bitcoin creation, create a scarcity effect. This inherent scarcity, combined with rising demand, naturally fuels upward price movements. Technological Advancements: Continuous development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including improvements in scalability and security, bolsters confidence among users and developers, contributing to its long-term appeal. Beyond the Numbers: What Does $112,000 Signify for Bitcoin’s Future? Reaching $112,000 is not just a numerical achievement; it represents a profound shift in market perception and confidence. This level showcases Bitcoin’s resilience and its increasing acceptance as a mainstream financial asset. For many, this BTC price surge confirms Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against traditional market volatility. Moreover, breaking through such a significant psychological barrier often triggers further positive sentiment, attracting even more capital into the market. It signals to new investors that Bitcoin possesses robust upward momentum and a strong community backing its development and adoption. Navigating the Current BTC Price Surge: Smart Moves for Investors While an explosive BTC price surge is exciting, it also brings heightened volatility. Therefore, investors should approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy. Prudent decision-making is crucial to capitalize on gains while mitigating potential risks. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Consider Long-Term Holdings (HODL): Many seasoned investors advocate for a long-term holding strategy, believing in Bitcoin’s sustained growth potential. Short-term fluctuations become less significant with this approach. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio across different assets can help reduce overall risk exposure. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and technological updates. Reliable sources like Bitcoin World provide valuable insights. This impressive BTC price surge above $112,000 marks a truly historic moment in the cryptocurrency journey. It underscores Bitcoin’s enduring strength, growing institutional interest, and its evolving role in the global financial landscape. As the market continues to evolve, Bitcoin remains at the forefront, pushing boundaries and redefining possibilities for digital finance. The journey ahead promises to be equally dynamic and compelling. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What factors contribute to such a significant BTC price surge? Several factors typically drive a significant BTC price surge , including increased institutional adoption, favorable macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity due to halving events, and ongoing technological advancements within its ecosystem. Is $112,000 a sustainable price for Bitcoin? The sustainability of any price point for Bitcoin depends on various market dynamics, including demand, supply, regulatory environment, and broader economic trends. While past performance does not guarantee future results, breaking such a high barrier indicates strong market confidence and potential for further growth, though corrections are always possible. How does this surge impact altcoins? Often, a strong BTC price surge can have a dual effect on altcoins. Initially, some capital might flow out of altcoins into Bitcoin as investors chase its momentum. However, a sustained Bitcoin rally frequently leads to an ‘altcoin season’ where profits from Bitcoin are rotated into other cryptocurrencies, causing them to rise as well. What are the risks associated with investing during a BTC price surge? Investing during a rapid BTC price surge carries risks, primarily due to increased volatility. There is a higher potential for sharp price corrections after significant rallies. It is crucial to manage risk, avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and only invest capital you are prepared to lose.

Designed for AI agents and users to transact autonomously, the open-source protocol has attracted widespread attention from developers and investors exploring its potential to transform online payments. According to Coinbase, the system enables direct payments from AI or humans on websites and apps. A request triggers an HTTP 402 “Payment Required” alert, which sends a signed stablecoin payment that x402 checks automatically—no credit cards are involved. Coinbase’s x402 recorded nearly 500,000 transactions in seven days According to Dune Analytics, x402 saw nearly 500,000 transactions from October 14 to 20, representing a 10,780% increase compared to the previous four weeks . Transaction activity also hit new highs on Friday at 239,505, and Thursday posted a record $332,000 in volume. Coinbase’s co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed , “x402 growing like crazy.” But one X user countered that the reported surge in activity may be artificial, likening it to how blockchain transactions can be easily manipulated to inflate usage. Nonetheless, many congratulated the platform, being rather pleased with its achievements, including Suede Labs. It commented, “Exceptional—great work by everyone who brought this to life with such energy and conviction. The enthusiasm behind it says everything about where we’re headed. Suede Labs won’t be missing a moment.” Earlier this week, a16z’s crypto division cited agentic AI in its 2025 State of Crypto report, anticipating $30 trillion in autonomous transactions by 2030. In August, Kevin Leffew and Lincoln Murr of Coinbase noted that they believed agentic AIs could autonomously manage APIs, storage, and computation, enabling everything from self-driving taxis paying via stablecoins to apps permanently storing data with stablecoins. Currently, AI agents are only capable of limited autonomous crypto trading, reviewing market data, executing trades, and managing portfolios without human oversight. Leffew and Murr believe Ethereum is the ideal blockchain for HTTP 402 According to KuCoin Ventures on X, x402’s development is allowing developers to mint their own tokens outright and send memecoins into an ever-increasing frenzy. The x402 ecosystem is now worth nearly $180 million and has grown by 266% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Leffew and Murr also explain that Ethereum is the ideal blockchain for HTTP 402 because its trustless settlement layer streamlines invoice processing and dispute resolution, including chargebacks. Additionally, analysts claim the PING token has catalyzed the platform’s growth. PING became a key player in x402 testing, recording 31,000 new buyers and $3.5 million in daily trading volume, Phemex data shows. However, critics questioned the asset’s involvement, claiming that the token is risky and speculative. Binance’s addition of x402 support brought the protocol to a wider audience, allowing users to trade compatible tokens through the exchange’s wallet. Plus, the Binance integration helped support the legitimacy of the platform and the assets it offers. Meanwhile, Coinbase has recently unveiled “Payments MCP,” a new system that enables large language models, such as Claude, Gemini, and other AI agents, to handle wallet operations, fiat on-ramps, and stablecoin payments through natural language commands. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan Payments, MCP offers AI models the same blockchain tools that human users would utilize, including wallets, transaction services, and stablecoin transfers. According to Dan Kim, Coinbase’s vice president of business development and listings, and Erik Reppel, head of engineering for the Coinbase Developer Platform, the system allows AI agents to participate in “agentic commerce.” In their announcement, they referred to stablecoins as “the perfect payment infrastructure for agentic commerce.” The protocol was designed to be simple and accessible, so that anyone could play with onchain interactions with AI, the company said. Users can create a wallet and sign in with just an email address without needing any developer setup or API keys. Payments MCP comes with a graphical interface that allows Coinbase accounts to configure their AI agent, set spending limits, and manage transactions without requiring coding.

Key Takeaways: Ledger’s new Multisig app sparked backlash for adding a $10 flat fee per transaction and a 0.05% token transfer fee, on top of gas costs. Developers and users accused the company of centralizing crypto for profit-driven policies. The new Nano Gen5 comes equipped with Bluetooth and NFC connectivity. The company said the Multisig app will charge a flat $10 fee per transaction, excluding token transfers, which will instead incur a 0.05% variable fee. These costs are in addition to standard blockchain gas fees, sparking frustration among users who accuse Ledger of monetizing self-custody. Ethereum Developer Accuses Ledger of Centralizing Crypto Under New Wallet Model Ethereum developer pcaversaccio was among the loudest critics. “You parade as Cypherpunk while trying to make Ledger Wallet (rebranded from Ledger Live) the single choke point for all crypto so you can squeeze everyone through it,” he said on X . Ledger’s Chief Technology Officer Charles Guillemet has promoted the Multisig feature as a key security enhancement, emphasizing the importance of clear signing for safer transactions. However, his comments clashed with the company’s documentation, which initially stated the service was free. Guillemet later clarified that the mention of it being free was a typo, but the confusion fueled skepticism over the company’s communication and pricing strategy. Ledger CTO made a ""typo"" pic.twitter.com/NqzyMzqCJk — Jrag.eth (@Jrag0x) October 24, 2025 Founded in 2014, Ledger is one of the world’s largest hardware wallet manufacturers, claiming to secure about 20% of global crypto assets. The company has sold more than 7.5 million devices, promoting its products as an essential safeguard for users who prefer to hold their own private keys instead of relying on centralized exchanges. While Ledger’s hardware wallets remain unbreached in real-world use, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has warned that no device can protect users from phishing or social engineering attacks, which continue to be the most common threats. The backlash over Multisig fees highlights the growing tension between security innovation and commercialization in crypto infrastructure. For many users, Ledger’s latest move signals a deeper concern that the line between self-custody and corporate control is beginning to blur. Ledger Launches Nano Gen5 with NFC and E Ink Ledger has redefined its product line with a major rebranding and the launch of the Ledger Nano Gen5, its most advanced device to date. The company said its wallets are no longer just “hardware wallets” but “Ledger signers,” reflecting their expanded role in securing not only digital assets but also online identities in an era shaped by AI. The companion app, Ledger Live, is now called Ledger Wallet, serving as the central hub for managing and tracking digital value. The new Nano Gen5 comes equipped with Bluetooth and NFC connectivity for “on-the-go signing” and features an E Ink touchscreen that enables Clear Signing, Transaction Check, and the Ledger Security Key. Meanwhile, competitor Trezor unveiled its own next-generation device, Safe 7, just days before Ledger’s announcement. With features like transparent secure elements and “quantum-secure updates,” Trezor’s launch underscores the tightening race in the hardware wallet market.

Zhao, who was serving a prison sentence just a year ago for providing access to money launderers, has now been released following a pardon from the White House. The pardon is attributed to the Trump administration's friendly approach to the crypto industry and the power of its influential lobbying networks in Washington. The incident has led to comments that “anything is possible in Trump's Washington for those with the right connections.” “I don't think I know him, but I've heard many people say he was unfairly prosecuted. They said he was persecuted by the Biden administration, and at the request of many good people, I pardoned him,” Trump said Thursday. Behind the scenes of the pardon is lobbyist Ches McDowell, a close friend of Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr. His North Carolina-based firm, Checkmate Government Relations, became one of the most influential lobbying firms in Washington during Trump's second term. McDowell was notably seen at the same White House event with Trump and Trump Jr. last week. Binance hired McDowell in late September to lobby the Treasury Department and the White House on “financial policy and executive clemency.” The firm paid Checkmate $450,000 for this brief stint. Related News: Early Whale Wallet Makes $1.5 Million Profit on Binance Founder CZ's New Altcoin Efforts to pardon Zhao date back months. Three weeks after Trump's inauguration, Binance and Zhao added Teresa Goody Guillén, a lawyer who has been linked to the SEC as a potential candidate, to their team. Guillén's office reported a total of $290,000 in earnings from Binance and Zhao through 2025. “On behalf of my client, Mr. Zhao, we offer our deep gratitude to President Donald J. Trump for the courage and moral clarity that made this day possible,” Guillén said in a post on his X account after the pardon. Beyond the pardon, Zhao and Binance have also strengthened their ties to the White House by establishing business ties with the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial. Binance's lobbying efforts in Washington have paralleled the company's legal process. Binance.US hired its first lobbyist at the end of 2021 and spent more than $1 million in 2022 and $1.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. However, after Zhao pleaded guilty and the company paid a $4 billion fine, the lobbying efforts ceased completely at the end of 2023. With Trump's re-instatement, Binance's lobbying efforts have been revitalized. The company has reported $860,000 in lobbying expenses so far in 2025. Binance CEO Richard Teng also joined the advisory board of The Digital Chamber, a leading US cryptocurrency trading association, in July. “With President Trump and his administration strongly supporting the crypto industry, the future looks bright,” Teng said in a post at the beginning of the year. *This is not investment advice.

53654200,https://cryptonews.com/?p=443398,1761472073,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53654200.jpeg,"Your Crypto Isn’t Safe Outside the Blockchain, Vitalik Buterin Warns",https://cryptonews.com/news/your-crypto-isnt-safe-outside-the-blockchain-vitalik-buterin-warns/,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin issued a stark reminder that while blockchain security prevents even a majority of validator collusion from stealing on-chain assets, this protection vanishes completely when users trust validators with off-chain tasks. He noted that if 51% of validators collude or fall victim to software bugs, they cannot steal assets stored on-chain, but this ironclad protection vanishes the moment users trust validators with tasks beyond the blockchain’s direct control. Regular reminder: A key property of a blockchain is that even a 51% attack *cannot make an invalid block valid*. This means even 51% of validators colluding (or hit by a software bug) cannot steal your assets. However, this property does not carry over if you start trusting… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 26, 2025 The warning particularly highlights a critical but often misunderstood boundary in blockchain architecture . While on-chain funds remain cryptographically protected even under majority-attacker attacks, any off-chain activity that relies on validator honesty leaves users vulnerable to manipulation with no recourse. The Security Boundary Blockchain Can’t Cross Blockchain protocols enforce strict validation rules that every node independently verifies by checking transaction signatures, preventing double-spending , and ensuring that state transitions follow the protocol logic. This decentralized verification means colluding validators cannot forge transactions or create invalid blocks that steal user funds. The system’s distributed nature ensures that even majority control cannot override these fundamental safeguards. Source: EMLearning However, this protection breaks down when validators handle off-chain tasks like oracle data feeds, governance decisions, or restaking services. These activities fall outside the blockchain’s algorithmic enforcement and rely instead on validator honesty. A colluding majority could provide false data or manipulated outcomes without the cryptographic proofs that protect on-chain transactions. Users affected by such off-chain collusion have no automatic dispute-resolution or recovery mechanism. The blockchain cannot verify or contest decisions made beyond its consensus layer, leaving victims without the recourse that makes on-chain assets fundamentally secure. Why Off-Chain Trust Amplifies Risk Traditional blockchain verification requires computers to perform 100 times as much work as the original calculation. However, when users move funds off-chain, through custodial wallets , centralized exchanges , or validator-controlled computations, they surrender the blockchain’s built-in protections. Off-chain systems lack the independent verification that every on-chain node provides, leaving them vulnerable to majority validator manipulation. The distinction matters because blockchain consensus operates through algorithmic rule enforcement that no single party controls. Source: B2BINPAY Off-chain activities depend on coordinated behavior and validator integrity, but not on protocol-level verification. Smart contracts that rely on validator-provided oracle data could yield incorrect outcomes if a majority colludes to report false information, potentially causing financial losses that on-chain mechanisms cannot prevent or reverse. When asked whether his warning referenced restaking protocols like EigenLayer, Buterin confirmed the platform addresses this vulnerability through slashing mechanisms using its own token. Eigenlayer relies on slashing (for subjective criteria using its own token) for this exact reason — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 26, 2025 This economic penalty system provides some protection but cannot match the cryptographic guarantees that secure on-chain block validity against majority attacks. Balancing Privacy with Blockchain’s Transparency Shield Buterin’s security reminder comes as Ethereum pursues major privacy improvements that are different from the network’s traditionally transparent nature. Earlier this month, he detailed GKR , a cryptographic technique that verifies calculations 10 times faster than traditional methods while enabling zero-knowledge proofs, allowing computers to prove calculations are correct without revealing the underlying data. The Ethereum Foundation also launched a 47-member Privacy Cluster in September to make network privacy default rather than optional, addressing concerns that public blockchains expose too much financial information. Aside from enterprise demand, Vitalik sees it as the only way to global adoption , especially for Ethereum. Imagine if your bank account had a public URL. That’s the reality of crypto today, and why it ""will never scale beyond a niche,” says Petro Golovko. #Crypto #Blockchain #Privacy https://t.co/qQJ1BJInWt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 25, 2025 Just recently, while speaking with Cryptonews, industry expert Petro Golovko compared current blockchain transparency to the pre-encryption internet era, arguing that systems exposing salaries and account balances remain “ unusable for regular people and impossible for institutions. ” The initiative aims to enable private transactions, selective identity disclosure, and improved user privacy experience without sacrificing the verification mechanisms that prevent validator manipulation. However, the privacy push creates an apparent paradox. If transactions become private, how can the network maintain the transparent verification that protects against off-chain manipulation, Buterin warned about? The solution lies in cryptographic techniques like GKR that allow verification of transaction validity without exposing transaction details, preserving the blockchain’s core security property where invalid blocks remain rejected even under majority attacks, while shielding sensitive financial data from public view.

From its unique gaming portfolio to attractive bonuses and instant payouts, it makes your experience golden. Another reason for picking the BetGoat is its license, which is a sign of trust in the industry, reaffirming its position as the best Casino USDT TRC20.

New users can benefit from instant rakeback, reload bonuses, daily races, and weekly raffles, while loyal players unlock higher cashback, exclusive offers, and tailored rewards.

Read the full T&Cs in the cashier or promo page; if something is unclear, contact support before claiming. USDT Networks Explained (TRC-20 vs ERC-20 vs Others) USDT exists on multiple blockchains. Casinos often support TRC‑20 (TRON) for low‑fee deposits/withdrawals and ERC‑20 (Ethereum) for broader DeFi compatibility. Increasingly, casinos and wallets support Solana and TON as well. Always select the same network shown in the cashier. Mismatched networks can permanently lose funds. TRC20 (TRON) — typically low fees and quick confirmations; fees are paid in TRX. ERC20 (Ethereum) — widely supported; gas fees fluctuate with network congestion. BEP20 (BNB Chain) — generally low fees; supported by some brands/cashiers. Others — USDT is also issued on Solana, TON, and more. (See Tether’s official “Supported Protocols” registry for the full, up‑to‑date list.) Why TRC‑20 is popular: TRON produces blocks roughly every 3 seconds, making confirmations quick; fees are paid in TRX and are typically small compared with base‑layer Ethereum gas. Actual times/costs still depend on confirmations required by the casino and your wallet/exchange. Some casinos require ~15–25 confirmations for TRC‑20 before crediting; check with the live support. Why Choose USDT TRC20 Casinos VS Ethereum Casinos? Many reasons speak in favor of Casino USDT, making it the preferred choice for people worldwide. First, we can compare USDT and Ethereum and break down their structure: Tether Casinos vs Ethereum Casinos: First of all, TRC-20 and ERC-20 variants of USDT are equal to 1:1 to the US dollar. On the other hand, ERC-20 transfers usually come with large fees, so it can cost several bucks to move money. TRC-20 comes with almost null fees, usually less than a cent, which is more beneficial for regular payments and cashouts. ERC-20 transfers are much longer than USDT during the congestion. TRC-20 transactions in seconds, so you can load your balance or get winnings almost immediately. Privacy is also better on Tether Casinos, so this makes USDT more attractive for players around the globe. Stability More than Volatility: The next huge benefit of USDT casinos is stability. Compared to BTC or ETH, which change in value within a day, USDT is connected to the US dollar, reflecting its value. If you deposit $100 today, you will still be worth $100 tomorrow, which will safeguard your balance from big drops. This is also good for keeping things safer, and your cashing out makes budgeting, betting, and cashing out smoother. Preference Choose Tether (USDT) Choose Ethereum (ETH) Low fees & fast transactions ✅ TRC20 transfers cost cents ❌ Gas fees fluctuate Stable value (no price risk) ✅ Pegged to USD ❌ Prone to volatility Bonus value predictability ✅ Same value in all promos ❌ Value varies with ETH price Integration with DeFi / NFT use ⚠️ Limited ✅ Widely integrated Ease for casino banking ✅ Often faster & cheaper ⚠️ Good but higher costs Crypto/USDT disclaimer: Using cryptocurrency adds additional risks: wallet security, network fees, address/network mismatch (TRC20 vs ERC20 vs BEP20), exchange downtime, and potential stablecoin de‑pegging in extreme scenarios. Transfers are generally irreversible. Always double‑check the deposit network and address shown on the casino’s cashier. Bonus Types & Best Offers for USDT Players Attracting players to the best Tether Casinos has never been harder, so you must comply with the best practices in the market from the top platforms. Below you can see the most common bonuses on Tether Casino Sites. Welcome Bonus Most USDT casinos greet new players with a deposit-match bonus, usually 100%–300% on your first payment. Always read wagering and expiry terms before claiming. For example, BetGoat rewards new members with a Mystery Box on deposits of 50 USDT+, while mBit offers up to 4 BTC + 325 free spins across three deposits. Free Spins Many Tether casinos combine deposit matches with free spins on featured slots. KatsuBet and 7Bit regularly run mid-week free-spin promos where 30–200 spins are credited depending on your deposit size. Cashback Offer Stable-coin casinos often return a portion of losses. Bitcasino.io focuses on no-wager cashback, while Stake gives instant rakeback to VIP players, with cashback tiers that grow with your play volume.

The two most popularly used crypto types so far are Bitcoin and Tether, and both have some pros and cons. Bitcoin was invented first and it’s already known all over the globe. Still, Tether casinos have become popular recently as they are showing stability and cater to players and gambling sites. But why do people prefer USDT so much? Well, the truth is simple – it doesn't fluctuate in value; what you have today, you have tomorrow, and it follows USD when it comes to real value. This is important for gamblers who want only to enjoy games without thinking about losing their money due to currency swings. The next important thing for Tether casinos is efficiency. All transactions are simple and quick, taking only 10 minutes to one hour to be confirmed on the blockchain. Players don’t have to wait for anything and become frustrated about the lost time, but they can stay focused. You should also know that fees are much better when you choose the best USDT Casinos over BTC platforms. Bitcoin transactions can be so expensive, and you don’t want to be overcharged for transfers. USDT is much cheaper, and it adds over time, as you see. Last but not least, Tether is a convenient option and already known due to the inclusion of dollars, so you don’t risk anything when you play. You have a predictable and smooth journey. USDT vs BTC for Casino Banking USDT (TRC‑20) typically offers faster confirmations and lower, more predictable fees (paid in TRX) than base‑layer Ethereum or on‑chain BTC; actual cost/time depends on the casino’s required confirmations and current network conditions. TRON aims for ~3‑second blocks; Ethereum gas can spike with congestion; Bitcoin blocks average ~10 minutes. Choose USDT‑TRC‑20 for low‑fee, rapid deposits/withdrawals — or BTC if you specifically want BTC exposure. Features Tether (USDT) Bitcoin (BTC) Transaction Speed 1 – 20 Minutes 10 – 60 Minutes Fees $0.50 – $5 $1 – $2.50 Volatility None – Linked to the USD Very High Frequently Asked Questions About Casino USDT ✍🏻 Understanding TRC-20 and USDT Basics What is a TRC‑20 casino? TRC-20 casino is a popular gambling platform accepting USDT on the TRC-20 (Tron) blockchain. It allows you to deposit and cash out quickly while taking advantage of speedy transactions and very low fees. Why choose TRC‑20 over ERC‑20? TRC-20 (TRON) is cheaper and faster than ERC-20 (Ethereum). Ethereum gas fees can fluctuate from a few dollars to over $10, while TRON transfers often cost less than a cent and confirm within seconds. The only trade-off is that ERC-20 integrates more easily with DeFi apps — but for gaming, TRC-20 is usually the better choice. What’s the difference between USDT-TRC20, USDT-ERC20, and USDT-BEP20? They’re all Tether tokens on different blockchains. TRC20 (TRON): Low fees, fast confirmation. ERC20 (Ethereum): Higher fees, broad support. BEP20 (BNB Chain): Low fees, available at some casinos. For a deeper breakdown, see the section “USDT Networks Explained (TRC-20 vs ERC-20 vs Others)” above. ⚙️ Deposits, Withdrawals & Fees Are there any fees when using USDT at the USDT Casinos? Most casinos do not charge internal fees, but the blockchain itself adds a small network fee. On TRON (TRC-20), this is typically under $0.10 per transaction. Some casinos may apply a minimal withdrawal fee for small amounts, so check their banking page before playing. Do I need TRX for USDT-TRC20 withdrawals? Yes. TRON uses TRX tokens for gas fees. Keep a small balance (usually less than 1 TRX) in your wallet to cover these fees when sending or receiving USDT-TRC20. Without TRX, the transaction might fail or remain pending. How long do USDT-TRC20 withdrawals take? Withdrawals are usually processed and confirmed within 1–5 minutes after approval. Some casinos require 10–25 network confirmations, so total time can vary. TRC-20 is significantly faster than ERC-20, which can take 15–30 minutes during congestion. Can I send from an exchange wallet to a casino directly? You can, but it’s not recommended. Exchange wallets are shared, so your withdrawal address might not match. Use a private wallet (like TronLink or Trust Wallet) to deposit and withdraw safely. Sending funds directly from an exchange could cause delays or crediting errors. What happens if I send ERC-20 USDT to a TRC-20 address? They’re on different blockchains, so the transaction will almost certainly fail — and funds may be lost permanently. Casinos cannot recover them. Always double-check the network name (TRC-20 vs ERC-20) before sending USDT anywhere. 🪪 KYC, Security & Privacy What KYC documents might be requested for large withdrawals? Casinos may ask for: A government-issued ID (passport or driver’s license), Proof of address (utility bill or bank statement within 3 months), and A selfie or video verification to confirm identity.Once verified, future withdrawals are faster and limit-free. Is anonymity possible when playing at Tether Casinos? TRC-20 transactions are secure because they don’t require your details, just your wallet. However, from time to time, you can find Casino USDT TRC20 that require KYC (Know Your Customer) rules. This means you need to verify your identity before making withdrawals. Overall, USDT Casinos still provide more privacy compared to traditional payments such as credit cards. Conclusion As you can see, USDT Casinos have become a staple in the crypto market due to their flexibility and transparency. Players look for stable currency that doesn't change value over time, and Casino USDT enables just that. Depositing is simple and with peace of mind, allowing you to focus on real gameplay, and not financial affairs happening in the global market. Our team knows that, so we picked the Best USDT Casinos for you with the top list belonging to BetGoat, BitCasino, and BC Game.

Bitcoin went on the offensive at the beginning of the business week when it surged by over six grand in hours from $117,500 to a multi-week peak of $114,000. However, that rally was short-lived, and the subsequent correction was quite painful as BTC lost even more value than it had added and slipped to just over $106,000. All of this happened in the span of 24 hours. The bulls finally reemerged at this point and didn’t allow another leg down. Instead, bitcoin started to recover some ground and stood at $111,000 on Friday before the release of the US CPI data for September. Once it became known that the inflation was not as bad as many feared, BTC jumped by a grand only to drop by more than two in the following hours. However, it recovered the losses by Saturday morning and knocked on the $112,000 door. Although it held at first, bitcoin jumped past it earlier today and even neared $113,000, where it was stopped, at least for now.

53654568,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/vendor-performance-management-key-metrics-and-best-practices-for-measuring-success,1761472709,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53654568.jpeg,Vendor Performance Management: Key Metrics and Best Practices for Measuring Success,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/vendor-performance-management-key-metrics-and-best-practices-for-measuring-success,"Vendor performance management sets expectations, measures outcomes, and links action to financial impact. Done well, it clarifies service levels, quality standards, and cost discipline while reducing risk. The aim is simple: translate business strategy into a small set of measurable targets that suppliers understand, internal teams can administer, and executives trust. Scope, Objectives, and Ownership Business outcomes to optimize (cost, service, risk, compliance) Scorecards should reflect four outcomes: lower total landed cost, reliable service (OTIF, lead times), managed risk (continuity, financial health, cyber posture), and compliance (contract, regulatory, ESG). Every metric on the page should ladder to one of these. Governance model and RACI (procurement, quality, operations, finance) Procurement owns the framework and commercial levers; quality manages nonconformance and CAPA; operations tracks service reliability; finance validates the numbers and ties them to P&L and cash. Many teams keep the scorecard in a shared workspace, and vendor management software provides the audit trail, acknowledgments, and document links needed for clean reviews. Coverage and granularity (tier-1 vs. tier-2, site-level vs. supplier-level) Measure where variability actually lives. Tier-1 and strategic tier-2 suppliers require visibility. Site-level data often tells the operational truth; roll-ups hide chronic underperformance at a single plant. Review cadence and thresholds (monthly ops, quarterly executive, annual strategy) A practical rhythm: monthly operational huddles for issues and fixes; quarterly executive reviews to adjust targets and investments; annual strategy to rebalance the portfolio. Thresholds define when a metric triggers a root-cause and corrective-action plan. Core KPIs and How to Calculate Them Service reliability (OTIF, fill rate, lead-time adherence) OTIF reflects the customer promise; fill rate shows immediate availability; lead-time adherence checks the credibility of quoted dates. These three create a balanced picture of delivery performance. Quality and compliance (PPM defects, returns rate, CAPA closure time, ESG adherence) Quality KPIs should include defects per million, return reasons, and the time from issue to verified closure. ESG adherence indicates whether required disclosures and certifications are current and complete. Cost and productivity (price variance, total landed cost variance, cost avoidance) Price variance catches unit-price drift from contract; landed cost variance captures freight, duties, surcharges; cost avoidance records prevented increases or value-engineering savings. Process and finance accuracy (invoice accuracy, ASN match rate, PO acknowledgment SLA) Process KPIs reduce friction: clean invoices accelerate cash cycles; accurate ASNs reduce receiving delays; prompt PO acknowledgments stabilize schedules. KPI Definitions, Formulas, and Thresholds Metric Precise Definition & Formula Primary Data Source Suggested Target/Threshold Risk Trigger OTIF % of orders delivered on or before the required date and in full; on-time & in-full lines ÷ total lines × 100 WMS/TMS/ERP ≥ 95% Lead-Time Adherence Orders within quoted lead time ÷ total orders × 100 ERP/TMS ≥ 90% PPM Defects Defective units ÷ total units × 10^6 QMS/Incoming QC ≤ 500 ≥ 1,000 Price Variance (Invoice price − Contract price) ÷ Contract price × 100 ERP/AP ≤ 1% ≥ 3% Invoice Accuracy Invoices without discrepancy ÷ total invoices × 100 AP/3-way match ≥ 98% CAPA Closure Time Median days from issue to verified closure QMS ≤ 30 days > 45 days ESG Compliance Rate % of required ESG disclosures/certifications current SRM/Compliance ≥ 95% “Measure what moves the dial, not everything that moves,” remains a useful rule in procurement. High-performing CPOs concentrate on a short list of KPIs tied to growth, cost, and resilience. Data Collection, Normalization, and Segmentation Minimal data model (PO, shipment, receipt, invoice, non-conformance, contract) A credible baseline needs six objects: purchase order, shipment notice, receipt, invoice, nonconformance record, and contract header. Each KPI can be traced to one or more of these. Master-data quality (vendor IDs, site codes, units of measure, currency) Consistent vendor IDs and site codes prevent double-counting. Units of measure and currency must be standardized or converted at load to avoid false variance. Normalization and weighting (ABC/criticality, category, region, volume bands) Weight results by criticality and volume to prevent small, low-impact items from masking performance on strategic SKUs. Category and region flags help spot systemic issues. Statistical treatment (service levels vs. fill rate, seasonality, outlier handling) Use medians for time-based metrics when outliers skew averages. Separate seasonality effects from true drift. Define outlier rules upfront and document adjustments. Operating Practices That Drive Measurable Improvement SLA/scorecard design linked to contracts (targets, tolerances, remedies) Scorecards should mirror contract language: the target, the tolerance band, and the remedy if performance falls outside the band. Remedies can be credits, expedited shipping at supplier expense, or rapid-response teams. Joint business reviews (root cause, CAPA plans, dated owners, re-baselining) Reviews should end with a dated CAPA plan, named owners, and evidence requirements. Re-baseline after verified improvement, not before. Incentives and consequences (gainshare, preferred status, probation/exit paths) Preferred status and forward-volume commitments can be earned through sustained performance. Probation and exit criteria must be clear to preserve credibility. Risk integration (financial health, supply continuity, regulatory, and ESG checks) Bring risk signals into the same cockpit: financial scores, supplier news, labor or environmental findings, and cyber posture. The World Economic Forum highlights supply continuity and ESG transparency as rising board-level concerns in global supply chains. FAQ How do you measure vendor performance credibly with limited data? Start with a minimal model and focus on OTIF, lead-time adherence, PPM, and invoice accuracy. Use a three-month rolling window to stabilize signals, then layer in landed cost variance and ESG compliance as data matures. Which KPIs matter most for critical vs. non-critical suppliers? For critical suppliers: OTIF, lead-time adherence, PPM, CAPA time, and financial/ESG risk. For non-critical: price variance, invoice accuracy, and basic delivery reliability. Weight by criticality so strategic misses carry appropriate influence. How often should vendor performance be evaluated, and at what tier? Monthly operational reviews for tier-1 strategic suppliers; quarterly executive reviews for strategic and high-spend tier-2; semi-annual pulse checks for the long tail. Escalate immediately when a risk trigger fires. What tools enable reliable tracking and analytics without manual effort? Systems that combine PO, ASN, receipt, invoice, and quality events reduce reconciliation time and increase trust in the numbers. Integration with ERP and TMS ensures timestamps reflect real movement rather than spreadsheet updates. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

IBIT's volatility remains high, and technical signals are mixed, with key support at $59-$62 and a concerning bearish momentum divergence. Despite strong YTD performance and high liquidity, IBIT faces choppy price action and a bearish megaphone pattern, suggesting caution through year-end. While IBIT may benefit from relative strength versus GLD and potential November seasonality, I remain neutral amid conflicting signals. What happened to bitcoin “Uptober”? Seasonally, the kickoff to Q4 has historically been dominated by cryptocurrency bulls, but we haven’t seen that play out this time around. Indeed, the so-called “debasement trade” has lost some steam, with both the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) succumbing to some autumn selling pressure. The two alternative assets are now in notable drawdowns, though I don’t see recent price action as having the hallmarks of long-term tops. I reiterate a hold rating on IBIT. I was neutral on the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency back in the middle of the third quarter . Shares are down 4.4% since then, underperforming the S&P 500 by about 10 percentage points. I see more chop ahead, unfortunately. I say “unfortunately” because I am long IBIT. Objectively, I need to see better price action, particularly during this bullish seasonal stretch. Drawdowns: IBIT & GLD Off the Highs Koyfin Charts According to the issuer , IBIT enables investors to get exposure to bitcoin through the convenience of an exchange-traded product, helping remove the operational, tax, and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. IBIT has garnered attention for its fast ascent in terms of assets under management. Now an $89 billion ETF, it has quickly attracted retail flows, even as the year-to-date return has slipped from above 30% to just 18%. Its annual expense ratio is low at just 25 basis points, while there is no yield with this spot bitcoin product. Partly for that reason, I house IBIT in my taxable account, as there are no taxable dividends to worry about. IBIT can also be a useful tax-loss harvesting product when volatility ramps up. Share-price momentum is rated well by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system (an A), but I don’t agree with the assertion that Bitcoin is in a powerful uptrend. I’ll call out key price levels on the chart at the conclusion of the article. In terms of risk, IBIT’s standard deviation has ticked up lately, now at 48%. With such lofty annualized volatility, investors must acknowledge that the ETF will swing around wildly. Bitcoin itself notoriously gets whippy outside of the 9:30 a.m. ET – 4 p.m. ET hours (something we saw in mid-October). But the fund is highly liquid , now with average daily volume north of 50 million shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is within two basis points, per iShares. Digging deeper into why I think IBIT is caught in no-man's land, take a look at the below relative performance chart of IBIT versus GLD. Bitcoin has generally been trending lower against gold, though we are potentially near a key support point. Crypto and precious metals have routinely traded off in terms of periods of alpha, so we could see some outperformance in IBIT if this broad relative range plays out. In short, IBIT vs. GLD may inflect up soon. At the very least, it’s a chart to keep on your radar. IBIT vs. GLD: Potential Support Spot stockcharts.com Next, I’d like to call out IBIT’s volatility profile. Implied volatility, or the expected movement over the coming 30 days (annualized), has dipped below 45% after spiking to 50% earlier this month. This is another sanguine signal, in my estimation, as volatility dropping could lay the groundwork for a steadier and more sustainable price climb. What’s more, higher implied volatility compared to realized volatility makes call-writing quite attractive (for all the option-income investors out there!). Bitcoin's Implied Volatility Has Drifted Down from 50%, More Modest Historical Volatility Fidelity But we shouldn’t get too bogged down in near-term trends. Longer-term (admittedly, just this year is shown in the graph below), gold and bitcoin are relatively strong. Bitcoin’s high volatility dings its Sharpe Ratio, but it’s hard to poke too many holes in an 18% YTD advance. YTD Performance Stats Across Asset Classes Goldman Sachs I’ve honestly been quite disappointed by IBIT’s lackluster October return (or lack thereof). Down 3% MTD, the bulls have their work cut out for them if they are to take Bitcoin positive for the month. Generally, when price action bucks the usual seasonal trend, it’s important to take notice. Of course, November has been the best month in the token’s 15-year history, so perhaps the lousy trend will reverse soon. Bitcoin: Bullish Q4 Trends Haven't Taken Hold Yet Barchart The Technical Take As we wait for bullish seasonality to take root, we can eye technical trends for near-term clues. Notice in the chart below that shares are very close to a key point of polarity. The $59 to $62 range has long been a battleground for the bulls and bears to duke it out. It’s critical that IBIT hold support, but I’m worried that downward pressure could come about. Why those conclusions? Well, take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph. It has dropped to about the worst level since the March-April timeframe after notching a bearish divergence to price earlier this month. Technicians are wont to say that momentum leads price, so this could be a bearish harbinger. For now, IBIT is holding its long-term 200-day moving average. That trend indicator line remains upward-sloping, suggesting that the bulls control the primary trend. The 50dma, however, has turned down, with IBIT’s price failing to climb back above it on a test last week. With a high amount of volume by price between $45 and $70, we might just see more of the same (choppy price action) now through year-end. Finally, look closely enough at the highs and lows since July, and you’ll find the ominous “megaphone” pattern, also known as a broadening formation. It’s a bearish distribution reversal pattern, so I’m not pleased to see that as I sit on my unrealized gain in IBIT. Increased volume since the start of October underscores the threat of material distribution, too. IBIT: Shares At a Critical Juncture, 200dma In Play, Big Volume Recently stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on IBIT.

This negative trend comes on the back of what has been a disappointing price performance by the second-largest cryptocurrency in October. Following months of significant capital influx, the Ethereum ETFs seem to be in a cool-off period, with a shift in investor sentiment also seemingly in play. US Ethereum ETFs Post $93.6 Million Outflow According to the latest market data , the US Ethereum ETF market registered a daily total net outflow of $93.6 million on Friday, October 24. This negative closing performance marked the third straight day of outflows for the crypto-linked investment products. Interestingly, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (with the ticker ETHA) was the only ETH exchange-traded fund that recorded a negative outflow on the day. The largest Ethereum ETF by net assets lost nearly $101 million in value to close the week. Meanwhile, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (with the ticker ETH) was the only other spot ETH exchange-traded fund that saw any trading activity on Friday. Data from SoSoValue shows that the Ether-linked investment product witnessed a capital influx of $7.4 million. This negative $93.6 million performance compounded what had been a disappointing week for the US Ethereum ETFs, growing the current outflow streak to three straight days. Meanwhile, this daily performance brought the ETF’s weekly record to around $243.9 million total net outflow. What’s more worrying is that this is the second consecutive weekly outflow for the Ethereum ETFs for the first time since April, signaling reduced investor appetite. Demand for the exchange-traded funds, which has been quite a bright spot for Ethereum in recent weeks, seems to now be waning. Ethereum Price Overview It is difficult to dissociate the performance of the US Ethereum ETFs from the price action of the underlying asset. This direct relationship can be spotlighted from last week’s performance, as the price of Ethereum struggled to get going in the last seven days. While this sluggish condition has been a general concern for the crypto market, the large-cap assets seem to have it worse at the moment. The Ethereum price, for instance, has particularly struggled to recover and hold above the psychological level of $4,000. As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $3,950, reflecting a mere 0.7% leap in the past 24 hours.

53654573,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87481,1761472846,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,A Clear-Cut Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Forecast for 2025 and Beyond,https://timestabloid.com/a-clear-cut-mutuum-finance-mutm-price-forecast-for-2025/,"Investors have scanned the crypto market for reliable altcoins amid recent dips. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a standout DeFi crypto drawing sharp interest with its structured presale. The project has raised $17,950,000 since inception, onboarding 17,450 holders who eye long-term yields. Phase 6 now stands at 75% filled, pricing tokens at $0.035, a 250% climb from Phase 1’s $0.01. As one of the best crypto to buy now, this altcoin blends lending utility with security measures. Forecasts point to robust growth in 2025, fueled by testnet rollout and exchange potential. Thus, early positioning could yield substantial returns beyond launch. Presale Dynamics Accelerate Mutuum Finance has structured its presale across 11 phases, each capping allocations at fixed rates. Phase 6 is selling out fast. Indeed, the window to secure tokens at $0.035 is narrowing quickly. Moreover, Phase 7 will follow with a 14.3% hike to $0.04. Launch pricing sits at $0.06, promising current buyers a 371% ROI post-deployment. This progression has sparked urgency. Holders have swelled to 17,450. Funds have hit $17,950,000. Because demand persists, the team has amplified engagement. A dashboard now tracks the top 50 holders. Recently, the 24-hour leaderboard updated, resetting daily at 00:00 UTC. The top spot earns a $500 MUTM bonus after one transaction. Fortifying Trust Through Audits and Rewards Mutuum Finance has launched its official bug bounty program in partnership with CertiK. The initiative sets aside $50,000 USDT for rewards. Further, the bounty divides into four tiers based on severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Each level assigns targeted payouts. This setup ensures vulnerabilities surface early. The protocol has earned a 90/100 CertiK score. Because security underpins deployment, these steps have bolstered investor faith. Thus, the program has funneled fresh capital. Altogether, these efforts have positioned the project for seamless Q4 2025 testnet debut on Sepolia . Lending Innovations Drive Utility The platform has integrated dual markets for lending and borrowing. Peer-to-Contract pools have enabled deposits of ETH or USDT into shared liquidity. Borrowers have drawn from these, triggering algorithmic rates. For instance, a $10,000 ETH deposit has yielded 8-12% APY in simulations. Lenders have received mtTokens as interest-bearing receipts. These have accrued passive income over time. Peer-to-Peer lanes have handled niche tokens directly. Users have negotiated terms, bypassing pool constraints. Borrowers have posted over-collateral, say 150% on USDT loans. Liquidators have enforced swift resolutions during swings. Because the roadmap ties launch to token rollout, passive streams have become viable. Potential top-tier exchange listings have loomed larger. Indeed, this framework has promised scalable yields. Crystalizing the 2025 Outlook Analysts have projected Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to climb toward $0.60 by late 2025. This forecast has rested on presale velocity, audit validation, and testnet proofs. Exchange inflows have historically amplified such DeFi crypto tokens. Current momentum has mirrored resilient altcoins. Consider BNB’s path from 2020 to 2021. It had bottomed at $6.61 amid early volatility. Then, it had rocketed to $689.72 over 17 months. That surge had delivered a 104x ROI, propelled by ecosystem expansions and listings. Similarly, MUTM’s $0.035 entry has set the stage. From here, a push to $0.60 would echo that multiplier. Because utility in lending has anchored demand, sustained adoption has seemed probable. Beyond 2025, $1 thresholds have appeared feasible if Layer-2 integrations have materialized. This trajectory has underscored MUTM as the best crypto to buy now. Echoing Proven Altcoin Paths Mutuum Finance has woven security, incentives, and yields into a cohesive DeFi crypto model. Presale heat has confirmed its appeal as an altcoin primed for growth. Forecasts have highlighted 2025 gains, drawing from BNB’s blueprint. Thus, the project has stood ready for broader traction. Examine the presale dashboard today.

BTC gained some support, as per the Dad author, after Robert Kiyosaki reignited discussion on X after declaring that the way to financial freedom now runs through Bitcoin and Ethereum, not savings accounts or retirement plans. He believes that inflation, job insecurity, and “fake money” have widened the wealth gap, leaving digital assets like BTC and ETH as the new standard for “real money.” Old Thinking vs New Thinking Kiyosaki contrasted “old thinkers,” who rely on traditional education, long work hours, and fiat savings, with “new thinkers,” who invest in scarce assets and start their own ventures. He warned that this shift has turned the wealth divide into a “Grand Canyon.” MY CONCERN: “Old Thinking vs New THinking” GAP between rich and poor becomes: GRAND CANYON between rich and poor. Billions of people are struggling to: 1: “Make Ends Meet” 2: “Keep Up With Inflation.” 3: “Keep their Job” Old Thinkers: 1: Go back… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) October 25, 2025 “Someone buying Ethereum at $4,000 today will be like those who bought Bitcoin at $4,000,” he wrote, calling for investors to embrace innovation over convention. His message reflects a generational shift in which younger, risk-tolerant investors view crypto as a tool for independence rather than as speculation. Bitcoin as ‘Real Money’ Later in a follow-up post on X , Kiyosaki reaffirmed his belief in BTC, calling it “the first truly scarce money.” With a maximum supply of 21 million BTC and nearly 20 million already mined, he predicted that institutional demand would intensify, driving prices higher. “Buying will accelerate. FOMO is real,” he cautioned. Why I am buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin is first truly scarce money… only 21 million ever to be mined. World close 20 million now. Buying will accelerate. FOMO real Please do not be late. Take care — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) October 22, 2025 His comments echo the growing narrative that Bitcoin serves as a hedge against monetary debasement, a digital parallel to gold. Whether his forecast holds remains to be seen. Still, Bitcoin’s technical setup suggests volatility ahead, aligning with Kiyosaki’s long-term view that financial freedom may indeed be coded on the blockchain. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Symmetrical Triangle Signals Breakout Potential Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading near $112,304, forming a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, a pattern that typically precedes major volatility. Price action shows higher lows around $109,700 and lower highs near $114,115, suggesting market equilibrium before a potential breakout. The 20-EMA ($110,940) recently crossed above the 50-EMA ($110,524), signaling short-term bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Meanwhile, the RSI at 63 indicates healthy upward pressure without overbought risk. Candlestick patterns such as spinning tops and a bullish engulfing candle near $111K confirm renewed buying interest. A breakout above $114,115 could trigger a rally toward $117,000–$119,800, aligning with the upper trendline from September. However, failure to sustain above $111,000 might lead to a pullback toward $109,700 or $106,700. Trade Setup: A long entry above $114,100 targets $117,000–$119,800, with stops below $110,000. A drop under $109,700 would favor shorts toward $106,700. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $24.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013165 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

53654726,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/decentralized-escrows-in-modern-finance,1761472964,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53654726.jpeg,Decentralized Escrows in Modern Finance,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/decentralized-escrows-in-modern-finance,"In the wake of finance’s digital shift, escrow services are transforming into coded, transparent systems that operate without middlemen. The long-held role of banks and brokers as trusted intermediaries is being replaced by blockchain-based mechanisms that lock funds until agreed conditions are met. These decentralized structures create a trustless bridge between counterparties—a fundamental shift in how modern finance builds and enforces trust. New Frontiers in Digital Finance Blockchain innovation isn’t limited to investment or trading—it’s reshaping entertainment and payments worldwide too. As technology widens access to digital economies, new ecosystems are emerging that use the same trustless frameworks driving fintech. Platforms in gaming, wagering, and decentralized marketplaces now integrate blockchain-led transparency to secure funds and validate outcomes in real time. Among the fastest-growing examples are crypto casinos for UK players , which combine flexible payment systems with blockchain verification. These platforms often feature instant withdrawals, structured bonus systems, and a wide range of games, but their real strength lies in how every transaction is verified and recorded on-chain, ensuring clarity and trust without relying on intermediaries. This evolution reflects a broader trend—the application of decentralized systems to ensure fairness and efficiency across digital finance. Whether it’s a blockchain-based gaming platform or a fintech settlement network, the underlying principle remains the same: programmable trust built into every transaction. How Decentralized Escrow Works At its essence, a decentralized escrow system replaces human trust with programmable logic. Two parties agree on specific terms—delivery of an asset, completion of a milestone, or confirmation of service. These terms are written into a smart contract on the blockchain. The buyer deposits funds into that contract, and the seller performs their obligation. Once the conditions are fulfilled and verified, the contract automatically releases the funds. No lawyer, bank, or intermediary is needed to mediate or validate the process. This automation is made possible through blockchain’s core properties: immutability, transparency, and consensus. Every transaction is recorded permanently, and every party can verify the state of the contract in real time. It’s a mechanism that blends cryptographic assurance with financial precision. The system reflects structured growth and disciplined execution , minimizing bias and manual intervention, though vulnerabilities in code or external data can still occur. Key Features That Make the Difference Decentralized escrow systems introduce a distinct layer of reliability and efficiency compared to traditional setups. Smart contracts enforce agreements automatically, removing human error and delay. Transparency ensures that every transaction and state change is verifiable by anyone involved. The model also eliminates dependence on centralized authorities, making it resistant to manipulation or censorship. Another crucial factor is interoperability. Many decentralized escrow platforms are now being designed to operate across multiple blockchains, enabling assets and obligations to move freely between ecosystems. This cross-chain capability enhances liquidity and expands the potential for complex financial arrangements, from real estate tokenization to institutional settlements. The result is faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions that redefine what it means to transfer value safely. Imagine an investment consortium funding a real estate project through tokenized assets. Instead of transferring capital directly to a developer, investors deposit their funds into a decentralized escrow contract. Each payment is released automatically when construction milestones are verified through independent oracles or digital attestations. This ensures accountability and transparency throughout the project’s lifecycle. In this way, decentralized escrow becomes not just a tool for trust, but an infrastructure for disciplined capital flow. Why This Matters for Fintech and Crypto In today’s peer-to-peer economy, counterparties often operate across borders and under varying levels of regulatory oversight. Traditional escrow systems can struggle in such an environment, burdened by manual processes and jurisdictional friction. Decentralized escrow, on the other hand, provides a programmable layer of trust that operates consistently regardless of geography or identity. This technology aligns perfectly with the broader fintech mission of removing friction and cost from financial systems. For crypto markets, where pseudonymity is common and transactions occur at high velocity, decentralized escrow introduces a sense of order and security without slowing innovation. It also strengthens governance in tokenized economies by embedding transparency directly into settlement mechanisms. The contract itself becomes the enforcer, ensuring that obligations are met as promised. It also signals a broader evolution in how financial infrastructure is built. Fintech no longer relies solely on platforms and institutions—it now extends to protocols and programmable agreements. Decentralized escrow fits this evolution by offering structure where traditional trust is absent, and by providing compliance-grade transparency without sacrificing autonomy. It represents the next stage of transactional design: financial systems that are not just digital, but self-governing, precise, and verifiable by design. When to Use Decentralized Escrows Decentralized escrow systems are most valuable in transactions where trust is uncertain, verification is essential, or intermediaries add unnecessary cost. They excel in milestone-based contracts, multi-party investments, and deals involving tokenized or digital assets that can be managed programmatically. These systems provide a strong framework whenever automation, transparency, and immutability are needed to secure counterparties’ commitments. In summary, the approach is most relevant: • When escrow funds must remain transparent and non-custodial, ensuring both parties can independently verify holdings without transferring control to a third-party institution.• When settlement depends on on-chain or external verification, allowing conditions such as delivery, performance, or milestone completion to trigger releases automatically.• When counterparties operate remotely or pseudonymously, creating an auditable and tamper-proof layer of trust in transactions between unknown or cross-border participants.• When automation and reduced costs are priorities, removing administrative delays, paperwork, and intermediary fees through fully autonomous smart contract execution.• When the assets or obligations can be represented digitally on-chain, enabling seamless integration of escrow logic with tokenized assets, digital currencies, or programmable financial instruments. Challenges and Considerations Despite the promise, decentralized escrow faces several practical challenges. Encoding subjective conditions into smart contracts remains complex—what one party defines as “completion” may not always be quantifiable in code. Oracles, which supply off-chain data to contracts, introduce their own points of trust and potential vulnerability. Dispute resolution is another issue: while contracts can execute objective logic flawlessly, human disagreements often require nuanced judgment. Cross-chain compatibility also poses technical hurdles. Although prototypes of multi-chain escrows exist, broad adoption requires standardized protocols and greater reliability. Security and contract accuracy remain paramount; even minor bugs, flawed logic, or oracle errors can result in locked or misallocated funds. Finally, as decentralized finance moves closer to mainstream financial institutions, these systems will need to coexist with evolving regulations governing custody, settlement, and investor protection. Integration into Mainstream Finance The next phase of decentralized escrow is likely to merge with the infrastructure of modern finance rather than replace it. Financial institutions and fintech providers are already experimenting with embedding escrow logic into tokenization frameworks, enabling automated settlement for digital securities and asset-backed tokens. This integration could transform how capital markets manage conditional payments, subscriptions, and multi-party contracts. As blockchain technology matures and compliance frameworks adapt, decentralized escrow may become a standard fixture in financial architecture. Future developments will likely include improved dispute-resolution systems, standardized contract templates, and scalable solutions operating across multiple chains and asset classes. Layer-2 technologies could make these systems faster and cheaper, paving the way for real-time, programmable settlement in global markets. Institutional adoption will depend on how seamlessly these systems can integrate with existing compliance and custody frameworks. Banks, asset managers, and exchanges are exploring hybrid models where on-chain escrows interact with regulated off-chain entities, maintaining transparency while meeting audit and reporting standards. This convergence points to a future where decentralized mechanisms operate quietly beneath the surface of traditional finance—automating trust without disrupting governance. Rethinking the Foundation of Trust Escrow has always symbolized trust—the mechanism that bridges intention and fulfillment. What’s changing is who holds that trust. In decentralized systems, it is no longer a person or institution but a contract written in code, executed by consensus, and visible to all. This quiet revolution reshapes how agreements are enforced, how capital is protected, and how confidence is built in a digital marketplace. In the emerging landscape of modern finance, decentralized escrows represent more than just a technical innovation; they are a philosophical shift. They redefine how value is exchanged and safeguarded. For fintech pioneers, crypto investors, and institutional players alike, the question is no longer whether decentralized escrows work—it is whether we are ready to build financial systems where trust is not promised, but programmed.

The analyst described the chart as a “worst-case scenario,” which illustrated a sharp retracement to the October 10 low before a rebound to new local highs. As of October 22, XRP’s market activity has closely mirrored the initial portion of that scenario, with price movements confirming the downside and positioning the asset for possible recovery momentum. Are you mentally prepared for this possible #XRP scenario? pic.twitter.com/JiLl1l0xhL — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 22, 2025 Market Developments and Chart Overview The four-hour Bitstamp chart shared by the analyst depicted XRP’s drop toward the October 10 low, followed by a substantial recovery trajectory projected to extend above $3.80. With XRP recently consolidating near the $2.6 range, the early stage of this recovery phase appears to be in focus. The earlier decline aligns with the scenario’s downside expectation, signaling that the market has already absorbed significant selling pressure. The next key question is whether XRP can sustain a reversal strong enough to validate the bullish continuation outlined in the projection. Technical Context and Potential Recovery Path The October 10 level has emerged as a critical technical reference point. The fact that XRP revisited and stabilized near this area suggests that it may have established a temporary base of support. According to Steph Is Crypto’s outlined structure, maintaining this level could be a prerequisite for the anticipated upward trajectory. The projected rebound implies an acceleration of buying momentum in late October, potentially driving prices toward higher resistance zones into early November if broader market sentiment remains constructive. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Investor Sentiment and Market Reactions Reactions to the post reflected cautious optimism. A commenter suggested that XRP’s future price movements could align with the ongoing adoption of ISO 20022 standards , emphasizing that structural changes in global financial messaging may play a role in its next market phase. Another respondent indicated increased confidence by expanding their holdings, expressing a belief that current prices offer long-term value opportunities. These perspectives indicate that investor sentiment remains largely steady despite recent volatility. Steph Is Crypto’s scenario has transitioned from theoretical to partially realized, as XRP completed the anticipated decline and entered a period of stabilization. The market’s response around the October 10 low will be key to determining whether the next leg—a recovery toward the $3 range—can materialize. For now, XRP appears to be at a technical crossroads, with traders closely observing volume strength and resistance behavior to assess whether the recovery path outlined by the analyst begins to take shape in the final weeks of October.

However, the broader market has staged an impressive recovery since those multi-year lows (for some). On a weekly scale, both ADA and DOGE have gained around 6% but are still close to some danger zones depicted by the popular analyst Ali Martinez. In the case of Cardano’s native token, he said it needs to defend the $0.63 support. Currently, ADA trades at $0.66, which is just inches above that line. If it remains above it, though, Martinez outlined a potential bullish breakout with a next target of $0.85. Moreover, the analyst with over 160,000 followers on X outlined an even more impressive and perhaps slightly far-fetched goal of $1.70 if the breakout reaches its ultimate level. Cardano $ADA must hold $0.63 to rebound toward $0.85 and set up a bullish breakout to $1.70. pic.twitter.com/MTFL7rJIAy — Ali (@ali_charts) October 25, 2025 The largest meme coin’s case appears rather identical. The critical level it needs to maintain is the support at $0.18. As of press time, DOGE trades well above it (close to $0.20) following a 1.6% daily increase. If it bounces off that level, Martinez said its path to $0.25 and $0.33 opens up. Recall that the meme coin briefly tapped $0.30 in mid-September but it hasn’t traded as high as $0.33 since the start of the year. Dogecoin $DOGE must defend $0.18.

Jamieson Greer, who represents the US on trade matters, told reporters in Kuala Lumpur that talks were moving in the right direction. “I think that we’re getting to a spot where the leaders will have a very productive meeting,” Greer said before leaving to join President Donald Trump. Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sat down with He Lifeng, a senior Chinese official handling economic matters. The weekend meetings marked the fifth time the two sides have met face-to-face since May. As reported by Reuters, Li Chenggang, China’s lead trade negotiator was also taking part in the discussions. Rare earth controls dominate discussion The talks happened on the sidelines of a gathering of Southeast Asian nations. When a reporter asked if rare earths came up during the discussions that started Saturday, Greer confirmed the two countries covered many topics, including keeping their current pause on new trade actions in place. Both nations want to stop their trade dispute from getting worse. Trump has warned he will put 100 percent tariffs on Chinese products and impose other restrictions starting November 1. This threat came after China greatly increased its limits on shipping rare earth magnets and minerals to other countries. Trump flew into the Malaysian capital Sunday morning for the summit. The visit kicks off a five-day trip across Asia that will end with a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. If the Kuala Lumpur talks go well, it clears the path for the October 30 meeting between the two leaders. The White House has said the Trump-Xi meeting will happen, but Beijing has not yet confirmed it. Trump plans to discuss several issues with Xi. These include Chinese purchases of American soybeans, worries about Taiwan, and the release of Jimmy Lai, a jailed Hong Kong media businessman. Lai started the now-closed Apple Daily newspaper, which supported democracy. His imprisonment has become the most well-known case of China limiting rights and freedoms in Hong Kong. Trump also said he wants China’s help dealing with Russia as the war in Ukraine nears its fourth year. Secretary of State Marco Rubio made clear Sunday that America will not abandon Taiwan in exchange for better trade terms with China. Fragile trade agreement under strain Relations between the world’s two biggest economies have become tense in recent weeks. A fragile agreement reached during their first round of talks in Geneva in May and extended in August has not stopped both sides from hitting each other with more penalties, export limits, and warnings of stronger payback. The current round of talks will likely focus on China’s tighter controls on rare earth exports, which have led to worldwide shortages. As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier, the Trump administration is thinking about stopping exports of “critical software” to China in response, which would affect items from laptops to jet engines.

With midterms underway, everyone tied to pesos and bonds is watching minute by minute, not because they love politics, but because the future of President Javier Milei’s free-market plan is hanging in the air. A brutal selloff last month already reminded investors what can happen when things go sideways, and this vote could break what’s left or buy Milei more time, no in-betweens. Half of the Chamber of Deputies and one-third of the Senate are up for grabs. Milei’s party, La Libertad Avanza (LLA), is still tiny. It holds just 37 out of 257 lower house seats, and only 6 of 72 in the Senate. A majority is mathematically impossible. But that’s not the point. If LLA scores above 35%, or more than the Fuerza Patria opposition, analysts say it might calm the peso chaos… for now. Peso sinks while Milei pushes for congressional gains The Argentine peso is in rough shape. It plunged to a record 1,490 per dollar earlier this week. Traders are now betting on another devaluation, no matter what Milei says. “There is a great deal of uncertainty,” said Nery Persichini, head of strategy at GMA Capital. “The better the government performs, the stronger the peso and other assets will be. If it loses badly, Monday will be very sour.” That pessimism started building last month after Milei’s candidates lost badly in a provincial race. Then came multiple defeats in Congress, triggering panic, as the peso came under fire, and whispers of an unplanned devaluation started flying. Some thought he wouldn’t survive politically, but instead, he kept doubling down, and now, his entire legislative agenda (tax, labor, austerity) is riding on this vote. Despite all this, Milei somehow got help from abroad. The US Treasury intervened directly in Argentina’s currency market and helped the central bank secure a $20 billion swap line. That lifeline hasn’t stopped the bleeding. Global funds have been pulling out. Local savers are converting pesos into dollars fast, expecting the exchange rate will fall again the moment polls close. There’s also a political calculation. Milei’s team knows they don’t need to win a majority; they just need a number big enough to scare moderate parties into cooperating. “What’s at stake is how much it costs Milei to pass bills in Congress,” said Juan Germano, head of political consultancy Isonomía. “The result is very important, and there is a very fine line between victory and defeat.” Frustration rises as economy and reforms stall Milei’s campaign message in 2023 was anti-corruption and austerity. Now it’s 2025, and both are under fire. Argentina’s economy has been shrinking since May, with inflation way down (from 289% in April 2024 to 32% now, the lowest in seven years), but wages and pensions are falling behind. People are angry. You add in those multiple corruption scandals , and the trust problem gets worse. Polls are showing a tight race. Projections for LLA’s vote share hover between 34% and 42%, but their edge over Fuerza Patria has been slipping. UBS strategist Pedro Quintanilla-Dieck said markets aren’t feeling confident. “They’re not expecting a strong result,” he said. “We’re seeing expectations in the low 30s.” The peso’s future looks fragile. Analysts doubt the government can keep defending the current exchange band. Billions have already been spent holding the line. Most see that defense as temporary. Many assume Milei is just waiting for the vote to end before letting the peso drop again. Trump added more pressure. He warned publicly that if Milei’s plan fails at the polls, his administration would pull the plug on support. That message shook confidence further, especially among bondholders already watching yields jump. At his final campaign rally, Milei called this a turning point. “For the first time in 100 years we have an opportunity to change the future of this country,” he said. “Don’t waste this opportunity.” But if LLA can’t pull off a decent showing, the next big move in Argentina might be out of his hands.

The popular analytics platform Santiment highlighted the price increase, which comes after some social media FUD regarding a substantial whale sell-off. XRP is at ~$2.60 after a +4% day. We’ve seen some retail FUD across social media, indicating small wallets are selling off. During this $2-$3 price stretch, high crowd predictions of $XRP under $2 is a buy signal and above $3 is a sell signal. Link: https://t.co/aUGQ5jYWJK pic.twitter.com/q6yqtLpO11 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 25, 2025 XRP Whales Are Selling, What’s the Impact? In two consecutive Fridays – on October 10 and 17 – XRP, alongside the rest of the market, plunged hard. On some exchanges, Ripple’s token dumped below $1, a level not seen in roughly a year. Analysts tried to explain this massive leg down, and many cited on-chain data to indicate that whales had reduced their XRP holdings by selling massive quantities. Similar reports continued in the following weeks, and almost every XRP correction was attributed to large investors getting out. More recently, data from Ali Martinez showed that whales had disposed of another 70 million tokens in the span of just 48 hours. Nevertheless, Santiment called this a social media FUD, which hasn’t prevented the underlying asset from posting some impressive gains over the past week, as it’s up by 13% since last Sunday. When to Buy or Sell? Santiment has been a long-time proponent of Warren Buffett’s narrative that people should buy when others are fearful and sell when they are greedy. Consequently, the analytics resource indicated that investors should look for an XRP entry when the crowd starts to speculate about a potential drop below $2. In contrast, they might want to look for a reduction of the investment when the crowd’s expectations do a 180-degree turn and they start to envision a massive surge past $3. Santiment’s picture from above demonstrates that the overall belief is that XRP might be heading for a substantial correction now.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse doubled down on XRP’s core role this week by stating , ”I'm reminding you all that $XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does. Lock in.” Notably, these remarks coincided with Ripple’s rebrand of its prime-broker acquisition into Ripple Prime, a strategic move aimed at simplifying and scaling institutional access to crypto markets. The institutional narrative amplifies the technical case. By bringing a multi-asset prime-broker under its umbrella, Ripple aims to remove execution and custody frictions that have long deterred large institutional allocations to crypto. Industry analysts argue that as prime services become integrated with Ripple’s payment rails and liquidity tools, demand for XRP could shift from retail-led speculation to more durable institutional flows, a structural demand boost that would help sustain higher price levels. On the technical side, XRP’s price action has been forming bullish structures that traders watch closely. Short-term charts show the token holding critical support zones while compressing into a pattern that typically precedes strong directional moves. Several market commentators point to $3 as the immediate resistance hurdle, a clean daily close above that level would validate momentum and open the path to targets clustered around $3.30–$3.45, measured by pattern projections and recent volume dynamics. Nevertheless, risk remains because failure to reclaim $3 with conviction could spark profit-taking and expose XRP to broader market volatility. Still, CEO-level confidence, a major institutional rollout, and strong technical support sharply raise the odds of a decisive breakout in traders’ eyes. Conclusion XRP’s push toward the $3–$3.45 zone now stands on solid ground, powered by both narrative momentum and strengthening market structure. Ripple’s institutional expansion via Ripple Prime points to growing, utility-driven demand, while CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s renewed confidence has energized sentiment at a pivotal technical juncture. As long as key support zones hold and buyers defend the trend, XRP looks poised to extend its rally. And if a clean breakout confirms, it wouldn’t just validate XRP’s long-term value argument, it could elevate its standing across the top tier of digital assets.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-26 10:58:27

According to their analysis, since Donald Trump resumed office in January, he excluded tax benefits for EV buyers from consideration. He advocated for the elimination of regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. This action marks a shift from the Biden administration’s supportive approach towards the industry. The US automotive industry faces a significant crisis The US Clean Investment Monitor , a database created by Rhodium Group and MIT, shared data highlighting a sharp decline in E-related investments of almost a third, to $8.1 billion in the three months preceding September, compared to the same period last year in the country. Examples of electric vehicle-related investments include batteries, vehicle assembly, and charging equipment. The data also revealed that approximately $7 billion of planned EV investments were canceled from April to September. This situation prompted industry leaders and experts to investigate the root cause of the problem. While researching, they discovered that the decrease in US support might significantly impact the industry in the coming years. Based on their argument, this might benefit China in the EV competition and establish uncertainty in the EU regarding its plan to ban the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. Håkan Samuelsson, CEO of Volvo Cars, weighed in on the topic of discussion. Samuelsson urged the US to accelerate their development process in EVs to keep up with China. According to the CEO, weakening these signals could hinder progress due to changes from the White House. Considering the intense nature of the situation, some European car manufacturers have stepped up their efforts to urge Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union, to ease its ban on gasoline engines, allowing for the sale of vehicles like plug-in hybrids after 2035. Meanwhile, in contrast to the Biden administration’s supportive approach to electric vehicles , Trump has cautioned that electric vehicles could significantly harm the US automotive industry and lead to price hikes for consumers. This change in Washington has spurred unfavorable forecasts for EV sales in the US. An example of these predictions is AlixPartners’ forecast, which highlights that fully electric vehicles are expected to account for 7% of US car sales in 2026. Notably, this is about half of what the consultancy had earlier predicted. They also pointed out that hybrids will represent 22%, internal combustion engines (ICEs) will make up 68%, and plug-in hybrids will account for 3%. China plays a crucial role in the global auto sales Reports indicate that the Trump administration has reduced government support for the car industry, particularly the EV sector. This has created a trade war, causing problems for electric vehicle buyers and manufacturers. Consequently, demand for these vehicles has drastically decreased, and manufacturers are beginning to reduce the number of EVs they produce. Regarding the situation, General Motors announced this month that it is expecting a $1.6 billion loss in its quarterly earnings due to the decrease in value of its EV operations. Some manufacturers have adopted new strategies to tackle this issue. To support this claim, Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, stated that the company will focus on partial electrification rather than fully electric vehicles. Interestingly, this is not the situation in the global market. Market research firm Rho Motion revealed that global electric vehicle sales reached their highest record of approximately 2.1 million in September. According to the firm, this record was partly due to US buyers racing to purchase electric vehicles before a tax credit expired. Moreover, this milestone has been credited to the robust demand in China, with Chinese buyers accounting for about two-thirds of global sales. With this sales record, it is worth noting that September is often referred to as the “golden month” for auto sales in China, where carmakers typically release new models during this period.

The asset has staged a mild recovery toward the upper boundary, signaling early signs of renewed strength. While extended consolidation in this region remains likely, a valid breakout could trigger a sustained directional move. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC remains confined within a crucial range, with the 200-day MA near $109K providing solid support and the 100-day MA around $115K acting as immediate resistance. The recent rebound from the $108K demand zone has pushed the price back toward the upper boundary of this structure. The recovery candles show a constructive tone, but the $115K–$116K region, which overlaps with an institutional supply zone (DP), represents the first key test for bullish continuation. A decisive close above this level could open the path for a retest of the $120K–$122K liquidity pocket, followed by a potential revisit of the $126K all-time high. Conversely, rejection from the 100-day MA would likely prompt a pullback toward the $108K accumulation zone, which continues to serve as a high-liquidity demand base and the foundation of recent rebounds. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour structure highlights Bitcoin trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern, following a sharp recovery from the $102K–$104K institutional demand zone. This pattern reflects a period of volatility compression, typically preceding a strong breakout. Currently, the asset is attempting to break above the upper trendline, which would confirm a bullish momentum shift and target the $120K–$122K liquidity zone. However, failure to sustain above resistance and the formation of another lower high could invite renewed downside toward the $108K support for a potential base retest. Momentum remains constructive but fragile, suggesting the market is entering a critical decision phase where volatility expansion is imminent. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The Realized Price of mid-term holders (3–6 month cohort) continues to act as a key market pivot, historically serving as both support and resistance during major turning points. This metric reflects the average acquisition cost of coins held by this group, offering valuable insight into prevailing sentiment. Bitcoin’s rebound from $102K has lifted price action just above the $109K Realized Price, putting mid-term holders back into slight profit. This development typically reduces short-term selling pressure and signals improving conviction among market participants. The $114K region now emerges as a decisive threshold. A confirmed breakout and hold above this level would reinforce confidence among these holders, potentially igniting a new bullish leg toward fresh all-time highs. Conversely, failure to hold above it could tilt sentiment back toward caution, exposing Bitcoin to deeper corrective moves within its current range.

In a recent video shared on X, Rietveld discussed the upcoming launch of the Coinbase OneCard in collaboration with American Express. The initiative introduces a 4% Bitcoin cashback reward on all purchases, marking one of the first large-scale integrations between a traditional financial institution and a leading crypto platform. Rietveld noted that while the current focus is on Bitcoin rewards, the underlying framework could easily extend to other digital assets, such as XRP, as adoption grows. The card is expected to launch first in the United States before expanding internationally, representing a major step toward integrating digital assets into everyday consumer spending. INSANE #Crypto and #XRP News!!! pic.twitter.com/wtTsw6TrEc — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 23, 2025 Bridging Traditional Finance and Digital Assets Rietveld emphasized that the card’s structure represents a meaningful evolution in how people interact with cryptocurrency. Instead of purchasing Bitcoin directly, users accumulate it as rewards from routine spending. In his breakdown, he illustrated that someone spending $100,000 annually could earn $4,000 worth of Bitcoin through cashback incentives—funds that would otherwise have remained outside the crypto economy. This model effectively channels consumer spending into continuous crypto accumulation, providing a tangible on-ramp for mainstream users who may not yet be comfortable with direct investment. He further noted that similar systems could eventually extend beyond Bitcoin to other digital assets such as XRP and other established cryptocurrencies. This expansion, in his view, would deepen integration between blockchain networks and consumer finance, allowing individuals to diversify their crypto exposure through everyday transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Global Impact The planned international rollout of the Coinbase OneCard, according to Rietveld, could have significant implications for both adoption and liquidity across global crypto markets. By incentivizing users to accumulate digital assets through spending, rather than speculation, the initiative aligns with broader industry efforts to normalize crypto as a legitimate component of financial life. He suggested that as more people begin earning and holding cryptocurrencies through credit card systems, overall transaction volume and on-chain activity could see a meaningful rise. The development also indicates increasing collaboration between financial giants and digital asset platforms. American Express’s involvement demonstrates growing institutional confidence in crypto-backed products, while Coinbase’s participation ensures infrastructure and regulatory compliance. Levi Rietveld’s commentary underscores a shifting landscape in which digital assets are no longer confined to exchanges or investment portfolios. The Coinbase OneCard initiative positions cryptocurrency as a functional and accessible reward system within mainstream finance. As the rollout progresses beyond the United States, it could further validate the role of crypto-based incentives in driving broader adoption and sustained engagement across the global financial ecosystem.

The deal keeps a 20% tariff on most goods shipped from the country to the United States, while allowing some products to move toward zero duty later. A joint statement released Sunday said both sides have agreed on a framework for “reciprocal, fair and balanced” trade. In return, the country will provide what the statement called “preferential access” for most American goods. The current tariff level was first announced in July, when President Donald Trump said the United States would apply a 20% charge on many products from the country and a 40% levy on goods routed through the country from elsewhere. Last year, the country recorded a trade surplus of $123 billion with the United States, its largest export market. The new agreement keeps the tariff rate at 20% for now, but Washington and Hanoi will identify items where the rate can fall to zero. According to the statement, the change “will provide both countries’ exporters unprecedented access to each other’s markets.” Non‑tariff rules come under review The statement said both sides will work to finish legal steps, sign the agreement, and prepare for it to enter into force. It also said the United States and Vietnam will work on non‑tariff barriers. The country agreed to recognize U.S. motor vehicle safety and emissions standards. That means vehicles built to American rules can be sold there without new testing. It also agreed to address import licensing for U.S. medical devices and to streamline regulatory approvals for U.S. pharmaceutical products. The statement added that the country will fully implement obligations under certain international intellectual property treaties. The statement also said: “The United States and Vietnam are committed to strengthening cooperation towards our shared goals to enhance supply chain resilience, including addressing duty evasion and cooperating on export controls.” Duty evasion concerns have grown in recent years, especially involving goods that pass through the country from third countries before entering the United States. The framework aims to limit that practice through new verification steps and data cooperation between customs agencies. The focus on supply chain resilience reflects heavy trade flows between both economies. Bilateral trade in the first nine months of this year reached $126.4 billion, up 27% from a year earlier, according to customs data. In the same period, the country’s trade surplus with the United States increased to $99.1 billion from $77.2 billion a year earlier. Airline purchase and agricultural deals expand U.S. export reach To reduce the trade gap, the country has recently agreed to buy more American goods. Vietnam Airlines (V3), the national carrier, will purchase 50 Boeing aircraft in a deal valued at more than $8 billion, according to the White House. The statement also said companies from the country signed twenty memorandums of understanding with American firms to buy agricultural commodities worth an estimated $2.9 billion. The agreement leaves tariff adjustments for later. For now, only the framework is settled: 20% stays, a list of possible zero‑duty goods will be drafted, and access for American products will expand. The plan also includes domestic procedures in both countries before final entry into force. Officials said this process will take shape “in the coming weeks”, with signing preparations already underway. The joint document repeated that the goal is to maintain what it described as a “reciprocal, fair, and balanced” trading relationship. The next step is selecting which goods move into the zero‑duty category. The process will involve trade agencies, product‑specific assessments, and formal notice. No timeline was released for those product lists, and no sectors were named in advance.

However, with significant supply zones directly ahead, the probability of an extended consolidation phase remains high until a decisive move confirms trend continuation. Ripple Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, XRP has attracted notable buying interest from the lower boundary of its multi-month ascending wedge, initiating a recovery phase. The asset has now reached and slightly surpassed the 200-day MA at $2.6, a key technical milestone that suggests a potential shift in sentiment — provided it can hold above this level. However, the $2.7 supply zone sits just above the moving average, representing a critical obstacle that could reject further upward momentum and maintain price compression within the broader wedge. Therefore, XRP’s behavior around this confluence zone will be pivotal in defining the next directional trend. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour structure shows a clear accumulation pattern forming around the $2.2 support region, which has triggered a strong bullish reversal. The asset’s recent breakout from an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern underscores improving market sentiment, driving the price toward the $2.6 resistance level. If XRP manages to retest the broken neckline and establish a stable pullback structure, continued bullish momentum could emerge, with potential targets extending toward $2.8 and beyond. Conversely, failure to maintain momentum above $2.6 may lead to sideways consolidation, keeping the asset range-bound in the short term.

The move is part of a larger effort to leverage blockchain and digital assets to modernize the financial system, attract foreign investment, and promote transparency in government and banking operations. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic confirmed it will conduct a three-phase pilot of the digital som, building on its earlier demo with Build Block TECH. The pilot will begin by linking commercial banks for interbank transfers, followed by integration with the Central Treasury for government and social payments. The final stage will test offline and low-connectivity transactions before a national rollout. “After successfully piloting all three phases, the platform will be rolled out nationally and scaled,” the central bank said.

CZ announced that Binance Academy will partner with 10 leading Kyrgyz universities and fully localize the Binance app in the country. The announcement came days after Donald Trump pardoned CZ, who had faced charges related to anti-money laundering violations during his time as Binance CEO. Zhao pleaded guilty to money laundering violations at the crypto exchange back in 2023. Binance agreed to pay over $4 billion in forfeiture, while Zhao was ordered to pay $50 million in fines in order to resolve the landmark crypto case .

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of $480.9 billion, gained 1.04% over the past day. Despite recent market volatility, ETH’s ability to maintain higher lows suggests growing trader confidence as it inches closer to a potential breakout. The recent price action signals that buyers are quietly regaining control, as ETH consolidates within a tightening range between $3,920 and $4,115—a zone that typically precedes major directional moves. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical Outlook: $4,300 Target in Focus On the 4-hourly timeframe, the ETH/USD is shaping up for a possible symmetrical triangle breakout. Typically, a breakout of such a pattern triggers sharp price swings, particularly in the same direction where it is breaking out now. In this case, ETH is breaking out to the upside. The 20-day EMA ($3,935) has nearly crossed above the 50-day EMA ($3,926), a short-term bullish signal indicating momentum may soon accelerate. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 58, suggesting mild bullish bias without overbought conditions, leaving room for continued upside. Recent candlestick formations, spinning tops, Doji candles, and a bullish engulfing pattern, underscore a tug of war between bulls and bears, with momentum slowly tipping toward buyers. Ethereum price prediction is likely to be bullish if ETH breaks above $4,115, the next resistance lies at $4,298 and $4,550, supported by historical Fibonacci levels. A rejection at current levels, however, could drag ETH toward $3,712 or $3,510, where demand has previously emerged. Trade Setup and Market Outlook For traders, a breakout above $4,115 offers a favorable long opportunity, targeting $4,298–$4,550, with a stop below $3,920. Conversely, a drop under $3,920 could open the door for short-term bearish setups toward $3,510. Ethereum’s tightening price structure reflects volatility buildup—a condition often followed by sharp expansion moves. Whether it’s a bullish surge or a bearish pullback, this breakout is likely to define ETH’s direction heading into November 2025. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

The Meta co-founder said that his 13-year stretch as Asana’s CEO was “exhausting,” and that he never planned to take the top job in the first place. Dustin, who helped build Facebook in 2004 alongside Mark Zuckerberg , Eduardo Saverin, Chris Hughes, and Andrew McCollum, walked away from the social network in 2008 but kept a little over 8% of the company, which made him one of the youngest billionaires on the planet with a net worth around $12 billion. After leaving Facebook, Dustin co-founded Asana, a work-management software platform meant to make collaboration easier. He became its CEO almost by accident. Earlier this year, he stepped down after 13 years, becoming the company’s chairman while still holding 53% of Asana’s outstanding shares, split between Class A and Class B stock. His comments about the experience gave a rare look at what it means to be an introvert running a fast-growing tech company through years of chaos. Dustin explains why being CEO wore him down On the podcast, Dustin said , “I don’t like to manage teams, and it wasn’t my intention when we started Asana.” He said he wanted to focus on engineering instead. “Then one thing led to another and I was CEO for 13 years and I just found it quite exhausting,” said Dustin. He described being an introvert forced to “put on this face day after day,” expecting it to get easier once the company matured. It never did. “The world just kept getting more chaotic, the first Trump presidency and the pandemic and all the race stuff.” He said that being CEO eventually felt less like building a company and more like “reacting to problems.” Dustin’s honesty about introversion and leadership mirrors what many high-profile figures have shared. Zuck, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett have all described themselves as introverts who prefer quiet over crowds. Meanwhile even as Dustin has stepped back from daily leadership, Meta continues expanding. On October 21, Meta and funds managed by Blue Owl Capital entered a joint venture to develop and own the Hyperion data-center campus. Meta will handle construction and property management, while Blue Owl will own 80% of the venture. Meta will hold 20%. Both parties agreed to fund their share of roughly $27 billion in total development costs covering power, cooling, and connectivity systems. As part of the deal, Meta contributed land and construction-in-progress assets tied to the project, which had been classified as held-for-sale. Blue Owl’s managed funds injected $7 billion in cash, while Meta received a one-time $3 billion distribution from the venture.

With momentum building and the wider crypto market heating up, bullish expectations for XRP are surging. According to Mikybull Crypto’s analysis, XRP is currently consolidating beneath what he identifies as a key resistance “red band,” a zone aligning with the $7 price target. This level has been highlighted as a pivotal breakout zone, one that could trigger steep upward continuation if reclaimed with strong volume. The analyst suggests that surpassing $7 would likely signal the start of this final expansion leg, opening the door for an extended rally toward $11 to $15. These targets are derived from macro technical patterns forming over multiple years, including XRP’s compressed structure and repeatable breakout cycles. Historically, long periods of accumulation and contraction in momentum have preceded rapid market repricings for the asset, a trend many traders believe is repeating now. The bullish narrative is also supported by rising institutional exposure tied to Ripple’s enterprise-level developments. As more financial players explore digital asset integrations, XRP’s role as a liquidity and settlement token continues to expand. This evolving utility may reinforce support for the asset during any major price discovery phase. What is expected? Well, market sentiment around XRP is strengthening as capital rotates back into assets still far below prior all-time highs. Traders increasingly view XRP as a high-upside play, and analyst Mikybull Crypto warns the coming weeks could be decisive, potentially confirming whether XRP is on the verge of its most aggressive growth phase of the cycle. Still, the road higher won’t be perfectly smooth because XRP must defend key support and deliver a clean breakout above $7 to validate this bullish setup. Falling short of that level could invite fresh profit-taking and stall the anticipated expansion with price presently trading at $2.62. Conclusion XRP is approaching a critical inflection point. Analysts say a decisive break above the $7 “red-band” resistance could trigger its long-awaited final expansion phase, accelerating price discovery toward $11–$15. Despite inherent volatility, strengthening institutional demand, reviving market sentiment, and historically bullish cycle patterns all point to XRP’s most powerful upside potential still ahead.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-26 11:27:07

According to reports, hackers are using a backdoor in a maliciously modified version of the Telegram X messenger. This backdoor grants them complete control over their victims’ accounts and allows them to operate without detection. According to reports, the malware is sent into devices through deceptive in-app advertisements and third-party app stores that masquerade as legitimate dating and communication platforms. This threat represents a significant escalation in mobile malware distribution, with it spreading across 58,000 infected devices. In addition, it has also spread across more than 3,000 smartphones, tablets, TV boxes, and some Android-based vehicle systems. Hackers weaponize Telegram with malware to gain access The report claims that the backdoor distribution started in 2024, with the hacker primarily targeting Brazilian and Indonesian users through Portuguese and Indonesian language templates. The victims come across advertisements within the mobile application, which redirect them to fake app catalogs featuring fake reviews and promotional banners advertising free video chats and dating opportunities. These fake websites deliver apps infused with malware that look the same as the legitimate ones. Aside from the malicious websites, the backdoor has also infiltrated established third-party repositories, including APKPure, ApkSum, and AndroidP, where it is deceptively posted under the official messenger developer’s name despite having a different digital signature. Analysts identified the malware as having an exceptional capability to steal confidential information, which includes login credentials, passwords, and complete chat histories. The backdoor also hides compromised account indicators by hiding third-party device connections from active Telegram session lists. In addition, it is capable of removing or adding its victims to channels and chats without their approval, disguising these actions entirely, and transforming compromised accounts into tools for artificially inflating Telegram channel subscribers. What sets it apart from conventional Android threats is its use of the Redis database for command-and-control operations. The earlier versions of the malware relied on traditional C2 servers, but the developers have integrated Redis-based commands. Malware manipulates functionalities without detection The report claims that the backdoor uses multiple techniques to manipulate messenger functionalities without being detected. For operations that won’t interfere with core app features, the hackers use already prepared mirrors of messenger methods, which are separate code blocks responsible for specific tasks within the Android program architecture. This mirror allows the app to display phishing messages within windows that perfectly replicate the original Telegram X interfaces. For other operations that require deeper integration, the malware uses the Xposed framework to modify the app methods, allowing abilities like hiding specific chats, concealing authorized devices, and intercepting clipboard contents. The backdoor malware uses the Redis channels and C2 servers to receive extensive commands, including uploading SMS, contacts, and clipboard contents whenever a user minimizes or restores the messenger window. The clipboard monitoring is used by hackers to steal data, such as crypto wallet passwords, mnemonic phrases, or confidential business communications that were unknowingly exposed. The backdoor collects device information, installed application data, message histories, and authentication tokens, and transmits the information to the hackers every three minutes while maintaining the appearance of a normal Telegram messenger operation.

Crypto transactions. Source: Arkham The data indicates a series of large transfers involving major exchanges and the Hyperliquid bridge, highlighting aggressive trading activity focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). Two weeks ago, the trader received multiple inflows from Crypto.com’s hot wallet, totaling over $20 million in USDC and ETH. Shortly after, substantial transfers were made to Hyperliquid’s Bridge2, suggesting capital deployment into leveraged trading positions. Currently, the trader holds massive long positions, $131 million in Ethereum and $155 million in Bitcoin, positions that have significantly appreciated as both assets rallied over the past two weeks. Indeed, the profit came at a time when Bitcoin faced massive bearish sentiment triggered by renewed trade tensions between the United States and China. At one point, the asset faced the threat of plunging below the $100,000 mark but has since found stability, reclaiming the $110,000 support level.

One of them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is in Phase 6 of its presale, having sold over 75% and raising over $17.95 million. Starting from $0.01 in Phase 1, the MUTM token has now increased to $0.035, an increase of 250%. Its price will continue to launch at $0.06, showing a consistent growth plan that favors early birds. MUTM’s dual-lending environment of Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools enables borrowing, lending, and earning on a single platform with ease, providing real-world use case utility that XRP can’t match. As investors hunt for the top crypto to buy today, Mutuum Finance is a low-entry, high-reward opportunity to outperform legacy altcoins as the next big DeFi crypto breakout of 2025. XRP Price Analysis: Bears Hold the Line Near $2.55 Ripple (XRP) is trying investors’ patience once more. Following the establishment of support above $2.25, XRP briefly tried to follow Bitcoin and Ethereum into a recovery, breaking above $2.50, but bears are now firm at the $2.55 resistance level. Trading below $2.42, bulls require a clean break above $2.55 to threaten $2.65–$2.70, while the $2.32–$2.27 area is still key support; loss of this area could have XRP vulnerable to further declines in the $2.20 area. Near-term momentum is deteriorating but overall structure implies a turn if buyers reappear. While traders wait for XRP’s next moves, many are also researching emerging DeFi crypto projects with strong fundamentals and enormous upside potential, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining more attention for the next market cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Update Mutuum Finance remains in presale, with robust momentum from over 17,450 token holders and $17.95 million generated. The presale has also completed five phases and is currently in Phase 6, with over 75% of this phase sold already. The token began at $0.01 in Phase 1 and has grown to $0.035, a 250% rise. The subsequent phase will increase the price by another 20%, whereas the official launch price is pegged at $0.06, which is a 600% profit from the first phase and double the current price. For a new crypto, with almost 17,500 holders is not a mean feat. Investors are supporting the project as it builds a DeFi crypto lending and borrowing protocol with excellent chances of adoption. Some big investments have already taken place, and to reward the best supporters, the team introduced a Top 50 leaderboard, which offers MUTM bonuses to the largest investors according to their rank. This introduces a competitive and fun factor to the presale. The team also revealed on their official X account that the development of the lending protocol has commenced, with a release of testnet in Q4 2025. This shows that progress is not just happening on the presale side of things but also on the development of the actual platform, increasing investor confidence and credibility in the roadmap. The listing of the token should coincide with the full launch of the platform, as per the roadmap. Synchronizing the events may enhance the prospects of getting listed on prominent CEXs and DEXs, garner attention, and onboard more users, benefiting the overall growth of the protocol. Mutuum Finance: A DeFi Play Beyond Legacy Altcoins Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top DeFi crypto project with tangible real-world utility and early-stage growth prospects. With more than 17,450 investors and $17.95 million in funds raised, its two-token lending ecosystem enables users to lend, borrow, and earn easily, providing useful financial utility that older altcoins such as Ripple (XRP) simply cannot compete with. As Phase nearly 6 concludes and the token is ready for its next price step, early adopters can reap the rewards of both strategic positioning as well as the platform’s long-term adoption potential. For those investors looking for what’s the best crypto to buy with real-world DeFi use cases, MUTM is a growth, engagement, and long-term returns project designed for the changing 2025 crypto market.

Following a bullish start, which established a new all-time high at $126,000, the premier cryptocurrency experienced a heavy correction mid-month, resulting in present price levels around $111,400. Amid these developments, crypto analyst Amr Taha has noted a recent shift on the Binance network, with potentially bullish implications for market participants. Related Reading: BTC Trapped In Tight Range: Liquidity Heatmap Shows Key Price Points At $115K, 106K Exchange Reserves Near Critical Low In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, Amr Taha shares insights into Bitcoin’s possible near-term trajectory, using data from the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve on Binance. As the name implies, this metric is an on-chain indicator that tracks the total amount of Bitcoin held in exchange wallets over time. The exchange reserve is an important measure of investors’ sentiment, as a high figure suggests preparation to sell and a growing lack of conviction among investors. However, when investors withdraw large amounts of their holdings from exchanges, especially within a short period, it indicates confidence in the asset’s prospects for price appreciation. Taha points out that the Bitcoin exchange reserves on Binance have seen a significant decline, with the current reading approaching 610,000 BTC, a level last reached in July, and also one of the lowest levels seen last year. While Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have steadily declined throughout 2025, the analyst remarks that the most recent decline looks “extremely aggressive,” implicitly suggesting the possibility of an imminent radical change. One possible effect of this drastic drop in exchange reserve is a supply shock, i.e., a sudden drop in the available supply of an asset. This abrupt shrinkage in selling supply also increases the market’s fragility to the upside, with increasing demand serving as fuel to bolster major upswings. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Macro Target Remains Above $2, And The Market Crash Hasn’t Changed It Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Falling Exchange Reserve Interestingly, Taha explains that as Bitcoin’s price swings around the $111,500 level, it reflects an underlying amount of demand, thus reinforcing earlier conjectures on growing long-term holders (LTH) confidence. As a result, Bitcoin could soon see an influx of momentum to push its price to the upside. Aside from growing institutional and whale accumulation standing as the primary driver of declining reserves, the analyst also points out the immense demand from the spot ETFs as another factor in play. A proportion of BTC typically gets pulled into these funds, thereby competing with the supply of Bitcoin available in the market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is worth approximately $111,613, reflecting no significant movement in the past day.

The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $2.62, up 2.63% in the past 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $3.68 billion. XRP ranks #4 globally, commanding a market cap of $157.4 billion and a circulating supply of over 60 billion coins. The steady climb in XRP’s price comes amid renewed optimism in the broader crypto market and increased institutional engagement, driven by Ripple’s ongoing expansion in global payments. However, technical indicators suggest that XRP may still be consolidating before confirming its next major move. XRP Technical Picture: Bearish Triangle Looms Despite the week’s strong performance, XRP’s chart structure remains cautious. The token is forming a descending triangle pattern, defined by lower highs near $2.71 and a flat base at $2.26. This formation typically signals waning bullish strength and potential continuation of a corrective phase if resistance levels fail to break. Key signals include: The 20-day EMA ($2.54) is below the 50-day EMA ($2.69), indicating sellers still have the upper hand. RSI near 52, rebounding from oversold conditions, indicating mild buying interest but not yet a trend reversal. Spinning tops and Doji candles across recent sessions — classic signs of market indecision before volatility expansion. For XRP to regain momentum, it must decisively break above $2.72. Failure to do so could confirm resistance, pulling the price back toward $2.26 or even $2.02, where historical demand has previously stabilized the market. XRP/USD Trade Setup: Breakout or Pullback Ahead From a trading standpoint, XRP price prediction is at a technical crossroads. Short-term traders are closely monitoring the $2.70–$2.72 zone for a breakout confirmation. A successful close above this level could open the path toward $3.15, aligning with prior swing highs. Conversely, rejection at this resistance could reintroduce bearish momentum. Trade Outlook: Bullish Scenario: Long above $2.72, targeting $3.15 with stops below $2.54. Bearish Scenario: Short near $2.70, targeting $2.26–$2.02, with stops above $2.75. In summary, while XRP’s 11.4% weekly gain underscores growing optimism, the token remains technically constrained within a descending triangle. A clear breakout will be needed to confirm whether this rally marks the start of a larger recovery or just another pause before the next pullback. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework.

This significant price action has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally, signaling robust market confidence. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is now trading at $113,013.45 on the Binance USDT market, marking a pivotal moment in its ongoing journey. What Does Bitcoin $113,000 Really Signify for the Market? Reaching a price point like Bitcoin $113,000 is more than just a number; it represents a powerful psychological barrier overcome and often indicates strong bullish sentiment. Historically, breaking through such significant levels can trigger further upward momentum as new investors enter the market and existing holders feel more confident. This surge highlights Bitcoin’s resilience and its growing acceptance as a mainstream asset. For many, this latest achievement reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a leading digital store of value. The continuous upward trajectory, even amidst market fluctuations, suggests an underlying strength driven by fundamental factors and increasing demand. Key Catalysts Behind the Bitcoin $113,000 Ascent Several factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s impressive performance. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone following the crypto market: Institutional Adoption: A growing number of major financial institutions are integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and services, bringing substantial capital and credibility to the asset. Scarcity and Halving Events: The programmatic scarcity of Bitcoin, amplified by events like the Bitcoin halving , reduces the supply of new BTC, which naturally pushes prices higher if demand remains constant or increases. Macroeconomic Environment: In an era of inflation concerns and geopolitical uncertainties, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by some as a hedge against traditional economic instability. Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements in Bitcoin’s underlying technology and network security also contribute to investor confidence. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin, helping it not only reach but potentially sustain levels like Bitcoin $113,000. Navigating the Volatility: Opportunities and Risks Above Bitcoin $113,000 While the excitement around Bitcoin $113,000 is palpable, it is essential to approach the market with a balanced perspective. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and significant price surges can often be followed by corrections. Investors should be prepared for potential pullbacks, which are a natural part of any asset’s price discovery process. However, for those with a long-term vision, these price movements can present unique opportunities. Diversifying portfolios and understanding personal risk tolerance remain critical strategies in this dynamic environment. The journey past Bitcoin $113,000 is likely to involve continued price discovery. What’s Next for Bitcoin $113,000 and Beyond? Looking ahead, the trajectory of Bitcoin remains a topic of intense speculation. Many analysts are now eyeing the next major resistance levels, with some predicting even higher peaks in the coming months. The sustained interest from retail and institutional investors alike suggests that Bitcoin’s growth story is far from over. For investors, staying informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and technological innovations will be key. Whether you are a seasoned trader or new to the space, the current climate surrounding Bitcoin $113,000 offers a compelling case for continued observation and strategic planning. The ascent of Bitcoin above $113,000 is a testament to its enduring appeal and growing significance in the global financial landscape. This milestone not only ignites enthusiasm but also prompts important discussions about the future of digital assets. As Bitcoin continues to carve out its path, its journey remains one of the most compelling narratives in modern finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is the Bitcoin $113,000 level important? Breaking the Bitcoin $113,000 level is significant because it represents a new psychological and technical milestone. It indicates strong buying pressure and positive market sentiment, often paving the way for further price discovery and attracting more investors to the asset. Q2: What factors are driving Bitcoin’s price surge? Key drivers include increased institutional adoption, the inherent scarcity of Bitcoin exacerbated by halving events , its role as a potential hedge against inflation, and continuous advancements in its underlying technology and ecosystem. Q3: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after it reached Bitcoin $113,000? The decision to invest is personal and depends on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. While Bitcoin $113,000 is a high price, many believe Bitcoin still has significant long-term growth potential. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s performance impact other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the broader crypto market. When Bitcoin experiences a significant surge, like reaching Bitcoin $113,000, it often creates a positive ripple effect, leading to increased interest and price appreciation in altcoins, though not always immediately or equally. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin at this level? Investing in Bitcoin, especially after a surge, carries risks such as high price volatility, potential market corrections, regulatory uncertainties, and security concerns related to crypto wallet management. It’s vital to invest only what you can afford to lose and to understand the market’s dynamic nature. Did you find this article insightful?

At the ASEAN summit in Malaysia, Trump and regional leaders are expected to discuss tariffs and access to rare earth minerals, key issues set against the backdrop of the ongoing US-China trade war . The American President also intends to talk about his diplomatic deals to end the eight global wars, including the ceasefire deal already signed by Israel and Hamas. Trump leads ceasefire deal between Thailand and Cambodia Having arrived in Malaysia, President Trump has signed a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. Per the agreement, Thailand will free Cambodian detainees while Cambodia begins pulling back heavy weapons in the first phase, with regional observers ensuring that hostilities do not resume. Referring to the peace accord, Trump told reporters: “We did something that a lot of people said couldn’t be done.” Meanwhile, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet hailed the day historic, and Thailand’s Anutin Charnvirakul said the deal offered a foundation for enduring peace. The two South Asian nations had initially consented to a ceasefire in July , following Trump’s warning that he would withhold trade agreements if the conflict persisted. During the ASEAN summit, Trump will meet with other world leaders looking to strengthen ties with Washington. His itinerary also includes talks in Tokyo with Japan’s new conservative Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, and a meeting with South Korea’s President, focusing on trade and security. The possibility of a meeting with China’s Xi Jinping during the South Korean leg of Trump’s trip remains uncertain, with speculation growing that it may not materialize. There’s also talk that Trump may have another face-to-face encounter with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Each of Trump’s bilateral meetings will be closely watched for progress in repairing economic and trade relationships, honoring investment pledges, and fostering stronger regional security ties. Later in the day, Trump is also expected to sign trade and critical minerals agreements with Malaysia, part of Washington’s broader push to diversify supply chains and reduce dependence on China, which has curbed exports of vital tech components. Tensions between Beijing and Washington have escalated in the past few weeks Tensions between Beijing and Washington have escalated recently after China announced plans to impose restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals. To which Trump responded with threats of more levies, specifically a 130% on Chinese exports by November 1, up from the current 30%. The US president added that he may limit exports of critical software to China. Beijing then signaled that it would retaliate and has thus far suspended US soybean purchases. Earlier this month, Trump had hinted on Truth Social that he may not meet with Xi Jinping. However, he seemed more optimistic in his recent conversation with the Chinese leader, in hopes of reaching an agreement. He remarked, “I think we’ll make a deal. I think we’re going to make a deal on — the rare earth is the least of it. … I think we’re going to make a deal on soybeans and the farmers. I think we’re going to make a deal on maybe even nuclear.” High-level trade talks in Malaysia this weekend between US and Chinese officials are expected to lay the groundwork for the president’s discussions with Xi. Nicholas Burns, a former top US diplomat in Beijing, has, however, noted that he does not foresee a completed trade agreement being reached. If the leaders meet, he expects they might only settle on certain guiding principles for their teams to implement. According to Dr. Philip Luck of CSIS, leaders may focus on de-escalating conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, rather than addressing the fundamental issues driving US-China tensions.

The paper, according to SMQKE, identified BFT-based models as the most efficient and scalable for distributed network operations, highlighting their advantages over mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). This validation positioned BFT as the preferred architecture for high-speed and secure transaction processing within financial networks. SMQKE emphasized that XRP, XLM, and HBAR already employ variations of Byzantine Agreement models within their respective consensus frameworks. By referencing the Federal Reserve’s findings, the researcher suggested that these assets had long been technically aligned with the principles necessary for secure digital payment systems. The acknowledgment, therefore, was seen as an early endorsement of the technologies underpinning these networks. FEDERAL RESERVE RESEARCH HAD ALREADY VALIDATED BFT, CONFIRMING XRP, XLM, AND HBAR’S ROLE IN SECURE PAYMENTS The Federal Reserve previously acknowledged the efficiency and scalability of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus models in an earlier research paper outlining a… pic.twitter.com/J7OocjIdYc — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 22, 2025 Implications for ISO 20022-Compliant Assets The discussion also drew attention to the relationship between these BFT-based assets and the ISO 20022 messaging standard , which is now widely adopted across international payment systems. According to SMQKE, the combination of Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus and ISO 20022 compliance reinforces XRP, XLM, and HBAR’s suitability for integration into modern financial infrastructure. This compatibility not only supports interoperability but also provides a framework for aligning distributed ledger technology with regulatory and institutional standards. The researcher noted that this intersection between compliance and consensus efficiency may explain why these assets continue to be referenced in conversations about the evolving digital payments landscape. As central banks and payment authorities modernize their infrastructures, the technical attributes outlined in the Federal Reserve’s earlier study appear increasingly relevant. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Foundation for Broader Financial Integration SMQKE further connected this research to the Federal Reserve’s more recent openness toward engaging with private crypto companies through its payment systems. This development, the researcher argued, demonstrates that the foundations laid by prior studies on BFT and secure network design were not theoretical exercises, but preparatory steps toward a more integrated financial model involving digital assets. Another X user, 36crypto, shared a similar interpretation, noting that the Federal Reserve’s acknowledgment of BFT’s strengths underscores the potential of XRP, XLM, and HBAR as efficient, scalable, and secure payment solutions. The commentary reinforced the notion that these assets, due to their technical and compliance attributes, are well-positioned for greater adoption within institutional frameworks. Overall, SMQKE’s analysis presents the Federal Reserve’s research as a precursor to current efforts toward blockchain-enabled financial modernization, situating BFT-led digital assets at the center of that ongoing transition.

This comes following positive news from US Secretary Bessent, who noted that China is ready to make a deal that will remove the 100% tariff imposed by the POTUS. BREAKING: US Treasury Secretary Bessent says China is “ready” to make a trade deal with the US after 2 days of negotiations. Bessent says the agreement will remove President Trump’s 100% tariff set to go live November 1st. — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) October 26, 2025 Recall that Donald Trump shocked the financial markets on October 10 when he claimed that China was deceitful in some sensitive economic areas and warned that the US would impose a 100% tariff against several products. Later, he confirmed the new taxation, which was supposed to become official on November 1. However, the leaders of the two superpowers have scheduled a meeting this week in Europe. In the meantime, both parties’ delegations have met on a couple of occasions to discuss the terms. According to a Reuters report from earlier today, the POTUS said he was confident of striking a deal with President Xi Jinping, after top economic officials reached a preliminary consensus in the trade talks. The Kobeissi Letter noted that this is the 10th and final step of Trump’s tariff plan, which includes announcing a new deal and a subsequent surge in the financial markets.

The entrepreneur took to his personal X handle to share the announcement, quoting an account that shared a similar announcement that came with a tutorial on how to turn on the kids mode. The development follows an announcement that was shared by Musk in July 2025, announcing the development of Baby Grok, an AI application specifically for kids. Speaking about the kid-friendly application, Elon Musk said on a livestream at the time that he expects Grok to discover new technologies before the end of this year, with one such being the new kid-friendly application. Users interested in setting up the new kids mode will find it in the Grok mode settings. They can set up a protection PIN and remove it when they wish. Elon Musk announces Baby Grok amid criticisms The development of Baby Grok became necessary after the platform faced global criticisms over the companions or AI characters that it made accessible, even in kid mode. After xAI released its update at the time, the platform introduced two new companions : Ani, a sexualized blonde anime bot, and Bad Rudy, a red panda. Users claimed the characters could still be accessed by kids even after they have been switched off by enabling kid-mode. Some hours after his initial post, Elon Musk shared another post on X, claiming that the “kids mode” works just like the enterprise mode for companies. “A friend of mine just pointed out that Grok ‘kids mode’ has the same settings as what companies demand for enterprise mode,” Elon Musk said. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s announcement of Baby Grok has drawn mixed reactions from users on X. While some see the move as innovative, others strongly believe that kids have no business using AI. According to a user, he mentioned that the move by Elon Musk and his company was wrong thinking. Instead, he said the Tesla billionaire should have made a separate application that would cater to the needs of kids. Another user urged parents to shun the app, noting that they should not allow their kids access to it until they are old enough. Some users praised the company for creating a kid-friendly approach. One user mentioned that the kids’ mode is brilliant, noting that it is a win for safe AI. Another user added that it will help their children if they are inquisitive about certain things they watch, and they need to ask questions. In addition, one user mentioned that the app will teach children curiosity before they grow up, and it could end up being a tool to rewrite reality itself. Meanwhile, Meta recently announced that it will launch some new parental control features to help parents manage how teenagers talk to its AI characters across its platforms. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the company will allow parents to turn off one-on-one chats, block specific AI bots, and see what topics their teens discuss with the chatbots. The company highlighted that these features were still in development with a view to launching them next year. “Making updates that affect billions of users across Meta platforms is something we have to do with care, and we’ll have more to share soon,” Meta said in a statement posted on its blog. The update came amid several instances of scrutiny and criticisms that the platform has faced over teen safety and mental health issues tied to its applications. The development is also coming amid a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into companies like Meta and how AI chatbots impact children. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Armstrong emphasized that capital formation on blockchain technology could democratize access to early-stage investments while making the fundraising process faster, cheaper, and more transparent for entrepreneurs worldwide. Coinbase Acquires Echo to Transform Startup Fundraising The exchange announced its $375 million acquisition of Echo , an onchain capital-raising platform founded by crypto veteran Jordan “Cobie” Fish. Echo has helped over 300 projects raise more than $200 million since launching in 2024. Armstrong explained that connecting Coinbase’s half-trillion dollars in customer assets with quality projects seeking capital creates a powerful network effect for the crypto economy. The acquisition extends Coinbase’s infrastructure across the full lifecycle of crypto ventures, from token creation and cap table management to fundraising and secondary market trading. Armstrong told interviewers that Echo would initially operate as a standalone platform, while its Sonar product would integrate into Coinbase’s broader ecosystem. The CEO revealed he had been courting Cobie for some time after receiving consistently accurate critical feedback about Coinbase’s products on social media. “ Every time I’d call him, you know, I DM’d him on X a while back and was like, ‘Man, you keep lighting us up on X, but you’re right every time,’ ” Armstrong said. Coinbase purchased UpOnly NFT from well-known crypto trader Cobie for $25 million, resurrecting the podcast show “UpOnly” after three years halt. #Coinbase #UpOnlyNFT #Cobie https://t.co/vrIurEXZR3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 21, 2025 The deal also included Coinbase’s $25 million purchase of the UpOnly NFT , reviving the popular crypto podcast that paused during the FTX collapse. Vision for Full Lifecycle Onchain Company Building Armstrong detailed how startups could soon handle every business milestone through blockchain rails. “ You can go in there and open a Coinbase account for your startup ,” he explained, suggesting the company might even help entrepreneurs incorporate onchain through decentralized autonomous organizations. Founders could then “ press the raise money button ” to distribute pitch materials to interested investors, with capital arriving instantly via USDC smart contracts instead of waiting weeks for wire transfers and legal paperwork. The CEO highlighted the painful traditional fundraising process that entrepreneurs currently endure. “ Every entrepreneur who I know finds the fundraising process to be pretty onerous ,” Armstrong stated. “ It usually takes like two to three months where everything else that you’re focused on has to stop. You go do tons of pitch meetings. You get told no 19 out of 20 times. “ The vision extends beyond initial fundraising to daily operations and eventual public listings. Armstrong noted that crypto payment integration and financing tools would be readily available as companies generate revenue. “ Eventually someday you’re going to want to go public ,” he said, describing how companies could list their shares onchain for retail trading. Armstrong emphasized that this full-stack approach would “ increase economic freedom ” and enable more entrepreneurs globally to launch businesses. “ This will just increase economic freedom. It’ll increase the number of companies who go raise capital and get started out there in the world ,” he added. Source: YouTube Regulatory Path for Onchain IPOs Takes Shape Armstrong confirmed Coinbase is working closely with the SEC to establish frameworks allowing retail investors to participate in onchain fundraising under appropriate safeguards. The CEO acknowledged that accredited investor rules provide important consumer protections but also prevent non-wealthy individuals from accessing high-growth investment opportunities. “ In many ways the accredited investor rules are kind of unfair, ” he said, expressing hope for finding the right balance between protection and access. Armstrong revealed he attempted to conduct Coinbase’s own 2021 public listing partially onchain but found regulators unprepared at that time. “ Unfortunately, like the SEC at that time was not the kind of, it wasn’t ready, let’s put it that way, ” Armstrong explained. “ Now we have an SEC that’s much more engaged and willing to innovate on this frontier, ” he stated, predicting the first company will go public onchain within two to three years. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is ""eager"" to get crypto market structure legislation done as Senate Democrats meet with crypto executives. #Coinbase #BrianArmstrong https://t.co/AD96Q2DSAV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 22, 2025 He envisions a future in which major corporations are listed entirely on the blockchain as crypto continues to transform financial services. Armstrong also emphasized that most companies would likely raise capital using stablecoins to maintain pricing stability while continuing to hold Bitcoin or other crypto assets as treasury management tools. “ It’s almost becoming like a best practice if you want to hedge against inflation, ” he noted regarding Bitcoin treasury holdings.

He confirmed the breakthrough on Sunday after back-to-back talks in Malaysia with China’s top negotiators. “China was ready to make a deal after two days of negotiations,” Scott told NBC’s Meet the Press . The talks were aimed at stopping Trump’s proposed 100% tariff hike on Chinese goods set for November 1. Scott said both sides now have a working “framework” for President Trump and Xi Jinping to meet in person later this week. If the deal holds, the tariff threat gets pulled off the table, and discussions over AI technology and companies like Nvidia, Nexperia , Tesla will begin. “President Trump gave me a great deal of negotiating leverage with the threat of the 100% tariffs,” Scott said. “I believe we’ve reached a very substantial framework that will avoid that and allow us to discuss many other things with the Chinese.” When asked if that included Nvidia specifically, Scott said , “Of course!” China signals pause on rare earth export limits China’s dominance in rare earth minerals, which are used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets, had triggered fresh tensions after Beijing hinted at restricting exports. That’s now paused. “I’m also anticipating that we will get some kind of a deferral on the rare earth export controls that the Chinese had discussed,” Scott told NBC. Beijing currently controls nearly the entire global supply chain for rare earths, and the U.S. has been scrambling for alternatives. Trump touched down in Malaysia on Sunday for a summit with Southeast Asian leaders. It’s the first stop in a packed five-day Asia tour. But the real showdown is expected Thursday, when Trump meets Xi in South Korea. According to Scott, “We’ve agreed to meet. We’re going to meet them later in China, and we’re going to meet in the U.S., in either Washington or at Mar-a-Lago.” Trump also plans to visit Xi in Beijing early next year ahead of Lunar New Year on February 17. A Washington D.C. meeting may also happen before Xi’s G20 visit in the fall. Trade wasn’t the only topic on the table. Trump plans to confront Xi over fentanyl when they meet in South Korea. Washington blames China for flooding U.S. streets with precursor chemicals that fuel the deadly opioid epidemic. Beijing has rejected that accusation, claiming America’s addiction crisis is driven by its own internal demand. Agriculture and AI included in broader deal On top of rare earths and fentanyl, the two sides discussed agriculture, AI, and broader trade flows. Scott hinted at possible large-scale Chinese soybean and farm product purchases, saying, “I think we are going to be able to discuss substantial soybean and agriculture purchases for our American farmers.” The final round of talks happened over the weekend in Malaysia between Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, trade minister Li Chenggang, Scott, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. After the meetings, Li confirmed a preliminary consensus was reached on keeping the trade truce alive and moving forward on fentanyl and export controls. Trump told reporters after the meetings, “I think we’re going to have a deal with China.” He didn’t give a date but confirmed meetings with Xi are happening in both countries soon. Scott has now used the word “framework” three times in public since the talks ended, and called the agreement “very substantial.” It’s unclear how long it holds, but for now, the tariffs are off, the rare earths stay flowing, and both leaders are boarding planes. Scott is expected to stay in Asia through the week, with more side meetings lined up before the Trump-Xi summit. He’s also been pushing discussions on AI cooperation, though no further details were released. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The crypto market may appear random, but massive gains follow projects with structure, vision, and scalability. As investors chase the top crypto coins for 1000x gains , presales and staking ecosystems have become the true battlegrounds of innovation. 2025 is already shaping up to be another year of discovery, and the smartest traders are tracking ecosystems built on sustainable models, not short-lived hype.

BullZilla ($BZIL): The Ethereum-Powered Roar of 2025 BullZilla ($BZIL) is not just another meme coin; it’s a myth engineered into math. As one of the top crypto coins for 1000x gains , it employs an automated system that increases its price every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours. This design eliminates stagnation while fueling continuous demand. BullZilla’s structure blends entertainment with tangible economics through its 70% APY HODL Furnace, the Roar Burn Mechanism, and a 32-billion-token referral vault. Each function contributes to scarcity and momentum, aligning early believers with long-term growth. Currently in Stage 8 (Echoes of the Bull), BullZilla has raised over $960K, sold 31 billion BZIL, and gained 3,200 holders. ROI projections reach 2,639.81%, while early believers aim beyond 3,200%. The next 3.46% price jump ($0.0001924 → $0.00019906) rewards conviction over hesitation. A $1,000 allocation secures 5.197 million BZIL, plus 10% extra through referrals. This is not speculation; it’s precision. The project’s Ethereum foundation and transparent mechanics create a self-sustaining loop of belief and deflation. The $5K Leap: How BullZilla Investors Could Ride the Next Big Crypto Wave A $5,000 purchase at the current Stage 8 price of $0.0001924 secures around 25.985 million BZIL tokens. When BullZilla lists at the projected price of $0.00527, that position could be worth about $136,935, delivering a 27x ROI before staking or referrals. The 70% APY HODL Furnace adds another layer of reward, turning passive holding into steady compounding income.

As a top DeFi project and flagship of the crypto market, Bitcoin’s renewed energy suggests that we might be witnessing the next big altcoin wave. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, a new player is gaining traction and ready to ride the cycle with Bitcoin’s momentum. Bitcoin’s Volume Surge: A Clear Signal Bitcoin’s volume spike is no accident. Reports show sharp increases in taker-buy volume, which indicates aggressive buying from whales and institutions. On top of that, Prince Filip of Serbia recently declared support for Bitcoin . For those hunting the best crypto to buy now, Bitcoin’s role as the anchor becomes even more critical. When volume surges, it signals liquidity, conviction, and the kind of momentum that fuels the next big altcoin in 2025. Early buyers are already up as institutions load up. Why does volume matter? Because a price move without meaningful volume tends to fade. High volume confirms a move has strength behind it. Bitcoin’s rebound above key levels suggests the current climb is different from past blips. What This Means for Altcoins With Bitcoin setting the tone, many altcoins will follow. When the flagship surges, liquidity flows out and finds the next high-growth crypto to buy. Some projects will boom; some will lag. But this is a classic moment for those tracking undervalued crypto projects, cross-chain DeFi projects, and best DeFi altcoin picks. The scarcity of early opportunities means the window is tight. Missed entry now could mean waiting a full cycle again. Why This Could Be a New Cycle Cycles in crypto are real. We’ve seen them before, and volume surges often mark the pivot. As trading activity intensifies, new money enters, and risk tolerance shifts. Bitcoin’s dominance may slip temporarily, but that often opens the door for fastest growing crypto in 2025 to shine. At this stage, horizon-scanning matters: Which projects will benefit from Bitcoin’s lift? Which will languish? If you want the best crypto to buy now, you need alignment with the broader cycle — and timing. Why Remittix Is Positioned to Ride This Wave Enter Remittix — a young yet highly demanded pay-fi focused ecosystem that has already secured $27.7 million in private funding. As Bitcoin charts the cycle’s start, Remittix offers early-stage crypto investment appeal with structural alignment to broader trends.

Here Are Realistic Targets,https://timestabloid.com/technical-analyst-xrp-at-1000-is-highly-unlikely-here-are-realistic-targets/,"Crypto analyst ChartNerd has responded to The Real Remi Relief’s recent post on X, which outlined highly optimistic price targets for several digital assets, including an XRP valuation above $1,000. ChartNerd stated that such a level is highly unlikely within the next cycle, adding that a range between $13 and $27 appears far more realistic based on technical indicators. The discussion emerged after The Real Remi Relief shared a list of projected prices for leading cryptocurrencies, emphasizing that the estimates were derived from research, historical trends, and the anticipated impact of a “super cycle.” The post claimed XRP could surpass $1,000 , alongside other ambitious targets, including $250 for XLM, $50 for XDC, and $1,000 for SOL and QNT. According to Remi, the numbers represented semi-conservative expectations assuming utility-driven adoption and the absence of market disruptions. These are my numbers for the Bull Run based on my info, research & history XRP = $1000+ XLM = $250+ XDC = $50+ HBAR = $150+ ADA = $100+ ONDO = $100+ LINK = $300+ SOL = $1000+ QNT = $1000+ These are semi-conservative numbers and I personally think they will be higher.… — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) October 22, 2025 Emphasis on Risk Management and Market Reality While optimistic about future growth, The Real Remi Relief cautioned followers against overconfidence, referencing personal experience from a previous bull run where profit-taking was delayed in anticipation of higher prices. The post urged investors to take profits in intervals and secure holdings on cold wallets, warning that exchanges prioritize their own interests. The broader message balanced enthusiasm for long-term value with reminders about the unpredictability of crypto cycles. ChartNerd, however, took a more grounded approach. The analyst suggested that even in favorable market conditions, a $1,000 valuation for XRP is statistically and technically improbable in the current cycle. Their projection of $13 to $27 was framed as being aligned with historical chart behavior and realistic growth models, rather than speculative super-cycle scenarios. A Third Perspective on Institutional Catalysts Another X user, Jason Krypto, contributed an alternative viewpoint that incorporated both technical and institutional factors. He acknowledged that, from a charting standpoint, ChartNerd’s targets are reasonable, but argued that external developments could reshape the valuation framework entirely. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to his comment, catalysts such as the introduction of XRP-related ETFs , potential banking integrations, and full-scale adoption could push prices into a much higher range, possibly between $100 and $1,000 by the end of 2026. Assessing the Divergence The exchange reflects a clear split between two schools of thought in the crypto market — one grounded in chart-based technical authenticity and another built on the expectation of broad institutional utility and macro adoption. While ChartNerd’s conservative forecast underscores measurable resistance levels and prior cycle structures, the more bullish outlooks hinge on transformative regulatory and financial integration. Whether XRP reaches the upper end of either spectrum remains dependent on how quickly utility and institutional access evolve in the coming years.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase’s x402 protocol saw a 10,000% surge in transactions, processing nearly 500,000 payments in one week. The protocol revives the HTTP 402 “Payment Required” code to enable instant on-chain stablecoin payments. Rising developer interest has fueled x402-powered token launches. According to data from Dune Analytics , the payments protocol has surged more than 10,000% in transactions over the past month. Coinbase’s x402 Revives HTTP 402 to Enable Instant On-Chain Payments Originally introduced in May, x402 reimagines the long-unused HTTP 402 status code, “Payment Required,” as a native internet payment layer. It enables automatic, real-time transactions without credit cards or intermediaries. Users, or AI agents, can request a service, receive a 402 payment prompt, and send a signed stablecoin payment, which the system verifies on-chain. From Oct. 14 to 20, the protocol processed nearly 500,000 transactions, a 10,780% increase from the previous month. Activity peaked on Friday with 239,505 transactions recorded, while Thursday saw a record $332,000 in transaction volume. The sudden spike comes amid growing attention to “agentic AI,” autonomous artificial intelligence systems capable of managing finances and resources, highlighted this week in a16z Crypto’s 2025 State of Crypto report. The firm projected that such agents could power up to $30 trillion in autonomous transactions by 2030. x402 growing like crazy link in thread https://t.co/xAghleCzJq — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) October 24, 2025 Coinbase developers Kevin Leffew and Lincoln Murr explained in August that x402 could enable a new financial layer for digital agents, allowing them to pay for compute, storage, or even transportation without human intervention. “They need atomic payments, programmable policies, and composable wallets,” they wrote. “Ethereum and stablecoins give them exactly that.” Developers have also begun using x402’s framework to launch new tokens, sparking a wave of x402-powered memecoin projects, according to KuCoin Ventures. The trend was strong enough for CoinGecko to add “x402 tokens” as a separate category, which has since swelled into a $180 million market, up 266% in just 24 hours. Coinbase’s new protocol underscores a larger shift toward integrating AI and on-chain finance, where machines can autonomously handle payments and data without third parties. If adoption continues at its current pace, x402 could become the first working bridge between AI systems and blockchain-based economic activity, a key step toward what Coinbase once called “fixing the internet’s first mistake.” Coinbase Faces Scrutiny After AI Coding Tool Vulnerability Exposes Security Risks Last month, an exploit in Cursor, the AI-powered coding assistant reportedly used by all Coinbase engineers, sparked widespread concern in both the crypto and cybersecurity communities. The flaw, dubbed the “CopyPasta License Attack,” was revealed by cybersecurity firm HiddenLayer and allows hackers to insert hidden markdown instructions that spread malware through developer files such as README.md and LICENSE.txt. Once triggered, the attack can compromise entire codebases with minimal user action. HiddenLayer demonstrated how the vulnerability could silently inject malicious code capable of stealing data, creating backdoors, or altering critical systems. The firm said similar risks exist in other AI coding tools like Windsurf, Kiro, and Aider. The disclosure came shortly after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that AI now writes up to 40% of the company’s code, with plans to raise that figure to 50%. Critics, including developers and academics, warned that Coinbase’s rapid AI rollout could endanger user assets and core infrastructure.

He delivered this update during the Fortune Global Forum conference held in Riyadh, saying: “We’ve made remarkable progress transforming our economy and society. As of the end of 24, 85% of our initiatives were completed or are on track with most targets met or exceeded.” Khalid did not list the specific targets already achieved but confirmed that 675 companies now have their regional headquarters in Riyadh as part of the push to draw global firms into the capital. The update served as a lead‑in to the Future Investment Initiative conference scheduled to begin on Tuesday. The Vision 2030 strategy aims to shift the country away from heavy reliance on oil, expand non‑oil revenue, attract global capital, and increase tourism. The plan has moved forward, but not without adjustments. There have been delays linked to cost pressures, supply chain hurdles, and the scale of the projects involved. Vision 2030 shifts and projects adjust The minister emphasized the ongoing diversification process. Saudi Arabia has focused on moving international business centers into Riyadh, modernizing local economic structures, and building global‑facing sectors. However, the multi‑billion dollar NEOM megacity project has faced repeated delays. Reuters said it has been scaled back as the government prioritizes infrastructure linked to international sporting events, including preparations connected to the 2034 World Cup. Another major development under Vision 2030 is the New Murabba project in downtown Riyadh. Its CEO, Michael Dyke, spoke at the same conference. He laid out planned investment opportunities in technology, real estate, and construction. The project was launched in 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to build a new district intended as a central part of the diversification push. It will require international financing, long‑term urban construction, and staged rollouts. Saudi Arabia’s leadership is also working on diplomatic positioning to support the economic plan. The crown prince is expected to travel to Washington next month for meetings at the White House. This visit will take place on November 18 and 19. It will be the first U.S. visit since early 2018. One of the goals of the trip is to reset long‑term relations and establish conditions that could support eventual ties with Israel. The timing follows a cease‑fire agreement negotiated to stop the two‑year conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Defense discussions between Riyadh and Washington Saudi Arabia is in talks with the United States on a defense deal that could be signed during the crown prince’s visit. The Financial Times reported this development, citing people familiar with the negotiations. A senior Trump administration official allegedly said there were “discussions about signing something when the crown prince comes, but the details are in flux.” The FT reported that the possible deal could resemble the U.S.-Qatar agreement, where the United States pledged to treat any armed attack on Qatar as a threat to itself. The U.S. deal with Qatar followed an air strike in Doha last month in which Israel attempted to kill Hamas leaders. The U.S. State Department described its defense cooperation with the kingdom as a “strong bedrock of our regional strategy,” but declined to provide details. The White House and the government in Riyadh did not respond to requests for comment regarding the reported negotiations. Saudi Arabia has sought similar security guarantees as part of broader talks linked to normalizing relations between Riyadh and Israel. Last month, the kingdom signed a mutual defense pact with Pakistan, which possesses nuclear weapons capability. This pact was described as part of a longer effort to secure regional balancing arrangements and external military support without relying on a single partner.

According to the firm, the reshuffle is a shift toward next-generation wealth management with a focus on global expansion and artificial innovation. Mirae Asset Financial Group, which boasts more than $695 billion in assets under management, claims the development aims to boost its structural transformation across its group in a bid to achieve growth through global expansion , AI, digital innovation, and risk management. Korean finance firm wants to boost AI-driven global expansion According to the firm , Chung Ji-Kwang, head of the new growth investment division at Mirae Asset Capital, will be named as the Chief Executive Officer of the division, while Chae Chang-Seon, who was in charge of running real estate development at Mirae Asset Consulting, will be appointed as its CEO. Lee Tae-Sang, the head of risk management at Energy Infra Asset Management, will also assume the role of the Chief Executive Officer of the division. The three newly appointed CEOs of the divisions were all born in the 1970s, showing the intention of the group to shift leadership into a new generation. In addition, incumbent Mirae Asset Capital CEO Lee Man-Hee is expected to step down from his role, although a date has not been specified. He is expected to leave with most of the key founding members who played a role in building up the Korean firm, with its founder, Park Hyeon-Joo, having exited the firm in a shift that began with a major reshuffle in 2023. As part of the organizational reshuffle, Mirae Asset Securities’ Tech & AI division will be transformed into a unit that will cater to new technologies, focusing on developing new growth engines based on AI and Web3. This will enable them to serve clients in the crypto industry. In addition, the firm has announced its decision to expand its pension management division from three to four units, strengthening its capabilities in the growing pension market and enhancing business activities targeting multinational corporations and public institutions. The firm plans to launch for digital and traditional assets With the country’s growing pressure to strengthen productive finance, Mirae Asset Securities has announced the establishment of a new investment banking division. This division will be tasked with enlarging the role of the firm in attracting funds in the capital market. The brokerage also set up divisions that will be dedicated to integrating managed accounts and financial consumer protection. While the group did not specify any organizational reshuffle concerning Mirae Asset Global Investments, it highlighted that the division will further improve its product competitiveness by leveraging different investment strategies and developing innovative flagship products, offering investors a wider range of investment opportunities in the market. It also added that Mirae Asset Financial Group plans to take steps toward a digital-driven financial future. “The group aims to spearhead Web3-based businesses both at home and abroad, to establish a ‘Global Digital Wallet,'” it said, referring to its goal to launch a platform that can integrate traditional and digital assets by June next year. In addition, the firm mentioned that it will not rest on its past achievements, noting that all employees are still charged to provide wealth management services on a global level under the ‘Client First’ philosophy.

Carney did not argue or rant. He simply said Canada is prepared to restart trade discussions with the United States at any time. Speaking in Malaysia at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting, he said: “Canada stands ready to build on the progress that we had been making in our negotiations or discussions with our American counterparts.” As Carney traveled in Asia, Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Canada. The move was a response to a TV advertisement produced by the province of Ontario and broadcast in the United States. The ad used clips of former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford had already said he would stop the ad after the weekend, but Trump went ahead with the tariff escalation. Trump had said , “Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.” He then later told reporters on Air Force One that he did not plan to meet Carney while both leaders were in Asia for major global summits. Carney focuses on talks, not theatrics Carney stated that trade negotiations with the United States are the sole responsibility of the federal government. He said open talks remain “the best way forward.” He made clear that Canada wants structured, official discussions instead of public arguments. Carney also said that his current trip is about expanding trade relationships beyond the U.S. market, with a long-term goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-U.S. markets over the next ten years. During this press appearance, Carney did not take questions. He is expected to do so during a later scheduled session. At the moment, Canada faces a base U.S. tariff rate of 35%. However, most Canadian goods are exempt because of rules under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump has not said whether the new 10% tariff will remove or change that exemption. On top of the base rate, the U.S. also applies sector-specific tariffs. Canada’s steel and aluminum fall under a 50% tariff on foreign metals. Cars and trucks assembled in Canada are only partly exempt from Trump’s 25% tariffs on most foreign-made vehicles. Canadian officials spent recent weeks negotiating tariff relief on metals, including a visit by Carney to the White House on October 7. But last Thursday, Trump halted all trade talks after seeing the Ontario TV ad. Before leaving for Asia, Carney said, “We can’t control the trade policy of the United States.” He also noted progress had been made and repeated that Canada is ready to continue once the U.S. is willing. Carney is spending nine days in Asia, including visits to Singapore and South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. The goal is to promote Canadian trade across the region. At the ASEAN summit, he spoke about reducing Canada’s heavy trade dependence on the U.S. and highlighted efforts to negotiate a free trade agreement with the ASEAN bloc. He also pointed out that Canada can serve as an energy supplier, especially as the government pushes to speed construction of liquefied natural gas terminals on the Pacific coast. In his remarks, Carney said, “Canada is a strong, reliable partner that has much of what the world wants.” Get seen where it counts.

This and more interesting news from the past week or so will be detailed in the following article. Hidden Road and Other Big Ripple Deals Although the Hidden Road purchase, worth $1.25 billion, was initially announced in April, the actual conclusion was highlighted on Friday. In a statement on X, the Brad Garlinghouse-led company noted that the brokerage platform will now be known as Ripple Prime. This means that the company is now the first in the crypto industry to “own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker – bringing the promise of digital assets to institutional customers at scale.” Teuncrium’s CEO weighed in on the matter, indicating that Ripple is “building the new Wall Street with XRP and Hidden Road.” Garlinghouse took it to X to highlight the company’s five big moves since 2023. Despite the ongoing pressure from the SEC lawsuit at the time, Ripple made two significant purchases in 2023 and 2024: namely, the acquisitions of Metaco (a Swiss-based crypto custody provider) and Standard Custody & Trust Company, an enterprise-grade, regulated platform for cryptocurrencies. 2025 became an even more impactful year for Ripple as, aside from Hidden Road, it also announced deals to acquire Rail for $200 million and GTreasury for $1 billion. Additionally, Evennorth Holdings, a newly formed Nevada corporation, launched and entered a business combination agreement with Armada Acquisition Corp II to enable institutional adoption of Ripple’s XRP. XRP Back to 4th In line with the aforementioned announcements from Ripple, the project’s native token is about to close with a substantial 11.5% weekly surge that has driven its price to a multi-week peak of $2.65. This has helped its market cap soar to almost $159 billion, which makes XRP the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by surpassing BNB. What’s particularly interesting about this price surge is that it comes at a time when whales have been seemingly taking profits off the table with sizeable sell-offs. In contrast, the popular meme coin and futures trader going by the X handle James Wynn said he was joining the XRP Army with a significant investment. Wynn noted that he went “down the rabbit hole of XRP” and determined it could “revolutionize the banking systems.” Popular analyst Ali Martinez picked up today’s price move from XRP and outlined the next critical resistance on its way toward $3.00. He also brought up the first line of defense in case this rally is another fakeout.

Specifically, within just 24 hours, total market capitalization surged from $3.69 trillion to $3.84 trillion, adding roughly $150 billion in value. Crypto market cap chart. Source: CMC Several assets have been at the forefront of this momentum. For instance, as of press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) had climbed 1.54% to $113,566, while Ethereum ( ETH ) followed with a 3.39% rally to $4,076. Solana ( SOL ) rose 2.49% to around $198, BNB ( BNB ) gained 1.91% to $1,135, and XRP joined the uptrend with a 2.70% increase to $2.65. Top crypto market gainers. Source: Finbold Why crypto market is rallying The surge came after significant developments in Beijing and Washington, where China’s Vice Minister of Commerce announced that both nations had reached a “consensus” on key trade issues. The discussions reportedly covered export controls, tariff suspensions, fentanyl-related measures, anti-drug cooperation, trade expansion, and U.S. Section 301 fees.

This INCLUDES export controls, tariff suspensions, fentanyl-related measures, anti-drug… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) October 26, 2025 Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent further reinforced the bullish sentiment, stating that China is “ready” to finalize a trade deal following two days of negotiations, adding that Beijing intends to make “substantial” purchases of U.S. soybeans. President Trump also expressed optimism that a “complete deal” could be reached within the week, comments that injected fresh confidence into global markets. It’s worth noting that these same trade tensions previously contributed to the recent market corrections. At the time President Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on China, Bitcoin was attempting to break above $130,000 to set a new record high. Despite the easing of trade threats, Bitcoin has continued to struggle with volatility, failing to reclaim the $115,000 level. Now, with progress toward a trade deal and the potential for sustained positive inflows into exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), Bitcoin may have a better shot at breaching the $115,000 resistance.

This is where infrastructure-based crypto plays start to matter even more than the headline tokens. Breakout Signs and Technical Context Ethereum’s price action lately has been mixed. On the one hand, ETH broke above the $3,800 support zone with some conviction. According to an analysis, “Ethereum is showing a lot of strength… remained above $3,800 and gained 1.5% in the last 24 hours” with potential for a move toward $4,280. If we dig deeper into the data, recent charts show ETH forming a possible triple-bottom pattern between roughly $3,750 and $3,800, with a resistance neckline in the ballpark of $4,000 to $4,300. To add fuel, exchange-reserve metrics are pointing to fewer ETH being held in sell-ready wallets, a hint that supply may be tightening. On the other hand, while some models suggest upside, the consolidation phase remains real: ETH has recently slipped below that key support level and is resettling. Worse yet, if it loses grip below approximately $3,600, a deeper correction toward $3,200–$3,500 could come into view. Institutional and Fundamental Factors Beyond charts, there are material fundamentals. ETH continues to benefit from large-scale positioning: for instance, a whale recently opened a roughly $131 million long position, while exchange reserves hit multi-year lows. Also, the forthcoming network upgrades (e.g., improved scalability) and institutional flows into ETH-related products provide tailwinds. According to one piece: “October has brought … robust institutional demand and a surge in inflows to newly established spot ETFs” for Ethereum. That said, the risk backdrop is far from trivial. Macroeconomic headwinds —such as rising interest rates, regulatory ambiguity, and a decline in speculative retail momentum —make the path forward for ETH anything but smooth. So, here’s a summary outlook: Given current conditions, ETH’s next meaningful move depends on confirmation of a breakout above $4,000. If that happens, a push toward $5,000 is within reach. If not, the risk of a pullback toward $3,400–$3,600 remains significant. Why this Matters for Remittix (RTX) As Ethereum wrestles with breakout versus trap, the broader crypto ecosystem is evolving as well. Remittix is quietly building a bridge between the crypto world and everyday fiat payments . What it offers goes beyond ‘buy crypto and hope it moons’; instead, the focus is on converting digital assets (including the likes of Ethereum) directly to fiat and sending those funds across borders. This infrastructure play is what is making Remittix feel more compelling; if the platform continues to execute, its value will come from how people use it, not just hype. With its PayFi model poised for global rollout and support for dozens of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, Remittix stands out as an alternative path in crypto. And if ETH regains momentum and restores market confidence, the ripple effect supports the idea that crypto infrastructure matters, not just speculative price moves. Projects like Remittix benefit when the narrative shifts from ‘which coin goes up’ to ‘which platform supports real-world utility and transfers.’ In short: ETH’s next move shapes the market backdrop; Remittix aims to capitalise on the infrastructure layer beneath it.

In fact, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed moments of bearish action in what is widely regarded as the historically bullish month of “Uptober.” With the substantial downward pressure in recent weeks, the Bitcoin price looks set to close the month in the red. However, a recent evaluation shows that the market leader might be gearing up for its next major price move in the coming week. Why BTC Could Make A Major Move Next Week In a recent video on YouTube , crypto analyst Maartunn shared an exciting hypothesis around the Bitcoin price, saying that the coin could make its next big move in the coming week. This evaluation is based on the Bitcoin Crash Price Trace, which monitors BTC’s behavior after a major price downturn. According to Maartunn’s analysis, the Bitcoin price tends to enter a period of consolidation or sideways movement after a sharp crash for about two to four weeks, before making its next major move. This has been the case for the flagship cryptocurrency since it fell more than 16% on October 10. Maartunn noted that the market leader is currently 14 days into this consolidation phase, meaning that the next move could come anytime from now. The analyst went further to provide clues in the data, highlighting that market volatility is shrinking for the premier cryptocurrency. Maartunn believes that this decline in volatility signals that investors are waiting on the sidelines for the next significant price move. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $111,690, reflecting a mere 0.6% jump in the past 24 hours. Level To Watch For The Next Move Maartunn went further by revealing $112,500 as a critical level to watch in case the Bitcoin price makes its next major move. This price level is the short-term holders’ (STHs) realized price, which often acts as a dynamic support and resistance level . Typically, with BTC’s value beneath this STH realized price, it means that the most reactive set of Bitcoin investors is in the red. These short-term investors are likely going to offload their assets at breakeven price—when the Bitcoin price returns to their cost basis. Ultimately, this sell-off would put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, making the STH realized price (currently at $112,500) a significant resistance level.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-26 14:00:09

That’s the critical question emerging as the market watches Solana’s every move. While its technical specs are impressive, many are starting to ask whether this raw speed truly translates into a better day-to-day experience for managing money. This gap between high-tech potential and practical utility is precisely where Digitap ($TAP) is making its stand, prioritizing seamless integration over pure performance metrics. Solana: Impressive performance, but with limits One of the major attractions of Solana is its network, which supports speedy transactions and low fees. Most decentralized applications depend on it, and the volume of daily transactions is enormous. But the network isn’t flawless. During busy periods, congestion slows things down, and while it hasn’t happened in the past year, Solana was once famous for outages. Solana’s popularity is clear, yet the biggest headwind has been its rampant success to date. Now valued at way over $100 billion, the upside for investors buying SOL today is minimal. Digitap: An all-in-one solution for users and investors Digitap takes a different approach. As the world’s first omni-bank, it lets users manage both crypto and fiat from a single account. Payments are instant, cards work physically or digitally, and transfers cross borders without friction. Security and privacy are central, backed by independent audits from Solidproof and Coinsult . The app is live on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, with a fully functioning beta and active users. For investors, it represents a solid alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies while offering real-world functionality. $TAP vs $SOL: Who might capture tomorrow’s market? When it comes to adoption and versatility, Digitap shows promise. Solana tends to attract developers and DeFi-focused projects, whereas $TAP targets a wider audience: individual users, small businesses, and investors seeking an easy way to handle multiple currencies. Transaction volumes are smaller than Solana’s but growing quickly, thanks to the platform’s simplicity and interoperability. Mobile and desktop access, combined with innovative tools for money management, allows $TAP to reach market segments often overlooked by larger coins. Key figures and $TAP presale dynamics The presale highlights real potential. Already more than one million dollars have been raised, with 72 million $TAP being sold. The price has steadily increased: from $0.0125 to $0.0159, now $0.0194. The next tier is $0.0268, which means that early investors can see gains before the official launch. USE THE CODE “LIVEAPP30” FOR 30% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES Why Digitap could dominate the next decade Digitap’s accessibility and rapid user growth make $TAP a candidate for long-term impact in fintech. Integrating crypto and fiat in one platform makes cross-border transactions more efficient and money management easier.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-coach-warns-crypto-and-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"Financial educator Coach JV has released a new video in which he delivered what he described as an “important warning” to his followers. The video, posted on October 23, 2025, serves as both a caution and a reaffirmation of his investment approach. He began by referencing the recent announcement by blockchain company Kedena, which confirmed it was shutting down operations. For Coach JV, this event symbolizes the volatility of the cryptocurrency sector and reinforces his decision to concentrate his holdings in established digital assets. He emphasized that while his message is not financial advice, it is based on his personal research and investment strategy. His tone was one of concern rather than alarm, urging viewers to remain composed, avoid speculation, and prioritize long-term positioning. The educator explained that the closure of Kedena reflects a broader shakeout in the digital asset market—one where weaker projects are gradually being eliminated as regulatory and institutional adoption advance. 10/23/2025 Massive Warning! Not financial advice. #crypto #investing pic.twitter.com/2HvFmLgQIF — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) October 23, 2025 Focus on Core Digital Assets Coach JV stated that he would be consolidating his portfolio primarily into XRP, Bitcoin, and Solana, identifying them as his top three holdings. He added that by 2030, much of his remaining portfolio would likely be folded into these assets. Alongside them, he currently maintains positions in XLM , WFI, HBAR, and VeChain. His reasoning centers on sustainability, liquidity, and regulatory progress. He reiterated a philosophy he has shared for years: first resistance, then regulation, followed by eventual institutional participation. According to him, the cryptocurrency industry has now entered what he calls the “adoption and tokenization phase,” where major financial institutions are integrating blockchain technology into existing frameworks. He cited examples such as BlackRock’s increasing exposure to Bitcoin and growing stablecoin activity connected to major corporations and political figures. A Shift Toward Institutional Integration Coach JV described the evolving financial landscape as a gradual transition from traditional centralized systems to decentralized frameworks built on distributed ledger technology. He outlined what he sees as a “rewiring” of finance—from industrial to digital, from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. His commentary reflects a belief that digital assets, such as XRP and Bitcoin , represent the backbone of this transformation. He also mentioned that scarcity and fixed supply models within major cryptocurrencies could help mitigate inflationary pressures in the long term. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He encouraged investors to approach emerging tokens with caution, suggesting that speculative assets should represent only a small portion of any portfolio. In his view, the focus should remain on cash flow, asset appreciation, and financial protection through proper structuring and risk management. Emphasis on Discipline and Risk Management Throughout his message, Coach JV underscored the importance of discipline and consistency in wealth building. He repeated his long-held principle—“de-risk, de-risk, de-risk”—and referenced Warren Buffett’s investment rule of avoiding losses above all else. He also highlighted the role of insurance and structured financial products as tools for long-term preservation of wealth. Coach JV’s latest video explains the shutdown of Kedena as not merely an isolated incident but a sign of an evolving market where only the strongest, most utility-driven projects will endure. His call to action was clear: remain vigilant, stay disciplined, and avoid the illusion of easy profits in an unpredictable financial environment.

The financial investigation is allegedly part of Western pressure to end the bitter conflict in the Eastern European nation, which is now rising on Ukraine after it was recently ramped up against Russia. Ukraine’s partners to press Kyiv by probing its cash The West has commissioned an audit of funds sent to and withdrawn from Ukraine, Oleksii Arestovych, ex-advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, unveiled on social media. In a post on his Telegram channel on Saturday, he pointed out that the inquest concerns transfers of misappropriated funds, particularly those made with cryptocurrencies. Commenting on the news he highlighted, Arestovych insisted: “This is the first serious step by Western partners in the fight against corruption in Ukraine. A large-scale audit has been launched by people who have extensive experience and capabilities in identifying corrupt funds.” He suggested that the move is part of new pressure on Ukraine, which is yet to reach a deal with Russia to terminate the brutal war that has been going on mostly on its territory for over three years now. Arestovych also reminded that Russia already received a “double ultimatum – sanctions are being imposed on the Russian Federation, and the West is threatening to supply Ukraine with long-range weapons and lift the ban on strikes deep inside the country.” He was referring to fresh American and European sanctions on Russia , imposed earlier this week by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, frustrated over the lack of real effort on the part of Moscow towards peace, and the EU, which approved its 19th package of penalties , including measures against Russian crypto platforms. In an excerpt from a conversation with independent Russian journalist and podcaster Yulia Latynina, attached to his Telegram post , the Ukrainian politician also revealed that the investigation has been ordered by the British government. London has hired a “very serious” auditing company and asked it to check all cryptocurrency transfers to and from Ukraine, he elaborated. Without providing further details, he also noted: “This is already serious. It looks like a financial investigation of the machinations of Ukrainian authorities … It’s the first serious news about Western auditing of Ukrainian corruption.” Arestovych added “this sounds like pressure on both sides” and recalled President Trump’s recent statements that each of the two warring nations would have to make concessions. Arestovych has been right before Oleksii Arestovych is known for pretty accurately predicting Russia’s invasion back in 2019. In late 2020, the former military intelligence officer was appointed advisor on strategic communications in the field of national security and defense to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak. He played a role in mobilizing the Ukrainian society to halt the initial trust of Russia’s army into their country in early 2022, when Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor following years of intervening in support of pro-Russian forces across the border. At the time, he held daily briefings on the current situation on the battlefield and beyond, while his appearances in a YouTube podcast, discussing the latest developments, secured him significant following in Ukraine and in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet. In August 2022, Arestovych made public his intentions to run for president of Ukraine. He fell out of favor with Zelenskyy’s administration after that, and especially following a comment in early 2023, suggesting that a Russian missile had hit a residential building in the city of Dnipro after being diverted by a Ukrainian air defense strike. Amid strong reactions to his explanation, he apologized and then resigned his post in mid-January 2023, but remained active in the public online space, increasing criticism of Zelenskyy’s rule and calling for presidential elections despite the ongoing war. Arestovych left Ukraine following calls from officials in Kyiv for his arrest amid accusations of his being a Russian spy, with his name on a list of suspected terrorists and extremists. He is currently believed to be residing mainly in the United States. Get seen where it counts.

According to Whale Alert , a staggering 450,000,000 USDT transfer , valued at approximately $450 million, recently occurred. This significant sum moved from the HTX exchange to the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, Aave. Such a large-scale transaction immediately raises questions about its implications for both platforms and the broader crypto ecosystem, signaling potential shifts in liquidity and investment strategies. What’s Behind This Massive USDT Transfer? Understanding the players involved is crucial to grasping the weight of this event. HTX , formerly Huobi, is a major centralized cryptocurrency exchange. Aave , on the other hand, is a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, allowing users to earn interest on deposits and borrow assets. The reported USDT transfer from a centralized exchange like HTX to a DeFi protocol like Aave suggests a strategic move by a large holder, often referred to as a ‘whale’. HTX: A global digital asset exchange known for its wide range of trading pairs and services, serving as a gateway for significant capital flows. Aave: A prominent DeFi protocol where users can supply cryptocurrencies to earn interest or borrow against their holdings, emphasizing decentralization and transparency. USDT (Tether): The largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It is a crucial asset for liquidity and trading within the crypto space, often used by large investors to move value efficiently. This particular USDT transfer signifies a substantial shift in capital. It’s not just about the volume, but also the destination, which is a key indicator of potential future activity within the DeFi landscape. Unpacking the Implications: Why Does This USDT Transfer Matter? A transaction of this magnitude doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It carries substantial implications for liquidity, market sentiment, and the operational dynamics of both HTX and Aave. When $450 million in stablecoins enters a DeFi protocol, it can significantly boost the protocol’s liquidity, potentially leading to increased borrowing capacity and more attractive interest rates for lenders. This can draw further attention and capital into the Aave ecosystem. Consider these key points: Aave’s Liquidity Boost: The influx of 450 million USDT dramatically increases the available capital on Aave. This can enhance its lending pools, making it more robust and appealing for larger borrowers seeking substantial loans. Potential for Yield Farming: Whales often move substantial stablecoin holdings to DeFi protocols to participate in yield farming strategies, aiming to earn high returns on their assets. This USDT transfer could be a precursor to such lucrative activities. Market Confidence: Such a large deposit into Aave can be seen as a vote of confidence in the protocol’s security and stability, especially given the current market conditions and the broader interest in decentralized finance. HTX’s Role: While the funds left HTX, it highlights the exchange’s continued role as a significant gateway for large capital movements into the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. This movement underscores the interconnectedness of centralized and decentralized finance, showcasing how large entities strategically leverage both for their financial objectives. Decoding Whale Behavior: What Can We Learn from This USDT Transfer? Whale movements are often closely watched indicators of potential market shifts or strategic plays. A USDT transfer of this size from an exchange to a lending protocol typically suggests a few possibilities. It could be a whale preparing to deploy capital into various DeFi strategies, seeking higher yields than what centralized exchanges might offer, or even a liquidity provision strategy for a specific project. Such actions are usually well-calculated and reflect a deep understanding of market dynamics. Observing these large transactions provides valuable insights: Strategic Positioning: Whales often position their assets to capitalize on anticipated market trends or to participate in new DeFi opportunities that promise significant returns. Risk Management: Moving funds from an exchange to a self-custodied DeFi protocol can sometimes be a move to reduce counterparty risk associated with centralized entities, emphasizing a preference for decentralized control. Market Sentiment: While not a direct indicator of bullish or bearish sentiment for volatile assets, a large stablecoin move into DeFi suggests active engagement and a search for utility within the ecosystem, indicating a positive outlook on DeFi’s potential. Ultimately, this significant USDT transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the continuous flow of capital between different segments, from centralized exchanges to the innovative world of decentralized finance. The transfer of $450 million in USDT from HTX to Aave is more than just a large transaction; it’s a powerful signal. It highlights the growing sophistication of large investors and their increasing utilization of DeFi protocols for capital deployment and yield generation. This movement injects substantial liquidity into Aave, potentially influencing borrowing rates and attracting further participation. As the crypto landscape evolves, tracking such whale movements remains crucial for understanding market sentiment and anticipating future trends. This event underscores the robust and dynamic interaction between centralized exchanges and the ever-expanding decentralized finance ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is USDT and why is this transfer significant? USDT , or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Its significance lies in its role as a primary liquidity asset in the crypto market. A USDT transfer of $450 million is significant because it represents a massive movement of capital, impacting liquidity and potentially signaling strategic financial maneuvers by large investors or ‘whales’. 2. What is HTX and what is Aave ? HTX (formerly Huobi) is a major centralized cryptocurrency exchange where users can trade various digital assets. Aave is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. The transfer signifies movement from a centralized trading hub to a decentralized lending platform. 3. What are the potential impacts of this large USDT transfer on Aave? This substantial USDT transfer to Aave significantly boosts the protocol’s liquidity. This can lead to increased borrowing capacity, potentially lower borrowing interest rates, and more attractive yields for those providing liquidity. It strengthens Aave’s position as a robust DeFi lending platform, making it more appealing for large-scale operations. 4. How do whale movements like this affect the broader crypto market? While a stablecoin transfer doesn’t directly impact the price of volatile assets, large whale movements, especially from exchanges to DeFi protocols, often indicate strategic positioning. They can signal increased engagement in yield-generating activities, confidence in specific DeFi platforms, or a shift in capital allocation strategies, all of which contribute to the overall market sentiment and liquidity dynamics. 5. Is this USDT transfer a common occurrence? While large transactions are not uncommon in the crypto space, a single USDT transfer of $450 million is notable due to its sheer size. It’s an event that catches the attention of market analysts and often prompts speculation about the motives behind such significant capital reallocation, making it a topic of interest for the crypto community.

Kiyosaki argued that the path to financial freedom is no longer through traditional savings and retirement plans, but through digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Anyone who buys Ethereum today at $4,000 will be like the rich who invested in Bitcoin when it was $4,000,” Kiyosaki claimed, urging his followers to break free from old financial patterns. Related News: US and China Make Mutual Positive Statements Regarding Tariffs - Here Are the Details The famous author stated that the gap between the rich and the poor has “grown as deep as the Grand Canyon,” and that billions of people are struggling with inflation, financial hardship, and unstable jobs. According to Kiyosaki, “old thinkers” try to solve their financial problems by working more, going back to school, saving “fake money,” and investing in retirement plans. In contrast, “new thinkers” start their own businesses and hold their savings in assets like “real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.” *This is not investment advice.

With structure improving and liquidity returning, traders see a clean neckline break that can unlock a fast run into the high $2 zone. As attention floods back to payments narratives, one name in that lane keeps cropping up in pro chats for different reasons altogether. The Pattern Driving Today’s XRP Price Prediction XRP trades around $2.56 at the time of writing after reclaiming $2.50, a level many mapped as neckline resistance. A sustained hold above this zone keeps the immediate trend pointed higher and keeps the $2.60 to $2.80 pocket in play for momentum chasers in the near term. That context is the foundation for today’s XRP price prediction focus. The setup most desks are watching is an inverse head and shoulders. By textbook rules, a confirmed break above the neckline often projects a measured move roughly equal to the distance from the head to the neckline. If that logic holds, a push through $2.60 opens a glide path toward $2.80 and beyond if volume confirms. Traders use this playbook because the pattern has a long history as a bearish to bullish reversal. Levels, Triggers, and Invalidation For this XRP price prediction, $2.50 to $2.53 now acts as first support. Above, $2.60 is the next momentum marker; clear it on rising volume, and $2.80 becomes the magnet. Lose $2.50 decisively and the pattern risks failing, putting $2.40 back on watch for dip bids. Managing risk around these bands is key because failed breakouts can unwind quickly. Recent coverage flagged price coiling between roughly $2.33 and $2.44 ahead of a volatility break. That compression has now resolved upward, which is why liquidity has started to follow price rather than fight it. If flows keep improving into month end, the XRP price prediction case for $2.80 gains credibility. Why Some Analysts Are Watching Remittix Payments is the narrative bid behind XRP, and that is why a number of investors are also scanning Remittix at the margin. RTX focuses on crypto to bank rails with a wallet that is already in beta with community testers, plus confirmed centralized exchange listings lined up at BitMart and LBank, with another listing in preparation. The team is verified by CertiK and has been ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens, which is why analysts keep citing its credibility when they scan for the next wave of real-world utility. RTX currently lists around $0.1166 per token, placing it in the ‘top crypto under $1’ bucket that many early stage crypto investment hunters screen first. Whales Seek New Leverage Alongside XRP Prediction The XRP price prediction that points to $2.80 rides on one thing now: maintaining the breakout above $2.50 with real volume behind it. Hold the neckline, clear $2.60, and momentum funds will likely crowd for a fast extension. Miss those triggers and the window narrows. For investors who want a second payments bet alongside XRP’s move, RTX’s low entry price, verification, and growing exchange access explain why it keeps landing on shortlists without stealing the headline today.

MUTM is currently priced at a paltry $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. The phase’s progress is less than 25% remaining to hit sold out. The project has raised more than $17.95 million and has more than 17,450 investors on-boarded, with investor confidence high. MUTM’s DeFi double-lending model, which integrates Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, provides scalable capital effectiveness and yield opportunities non-competing with traditional platforms such as ADA. With its potential for quick gains, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as the top crypto to buy among investors looking for a high-growth, early-stage DeFi trade ahead of the 2025 market cycle. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis: Testing Key Support Under Bearish Pressure Cardano (ADA) is testing a structural key support as it continues to decline in a bearish channel. The token has experienced repeated breakouts failing and firm resistance near $0.85, with signs of ongoing selling pressure. ADA is now testing its long-term support trendline, an area where the buying had previously intervened. A bounce here successfully could see a short-term push towards the $0.70–$0.75 area if momentum holds. As ADA grapples with this technical hurdle, shareholders are focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with tremendous growth potential and innovative DeFi solutions, climbing on the strength of its early-stage promise and dual-lending model. Many investors see MUTM as the best crypto to buy today given its strong utility and early entry potential. Mutuum Finance’s Unwavering Growth Supports Scaling Investor Sentiment Mutuum Finance MUTM is generating quite a buzz among DeFi communities being named the best crypto to buy this year. The token is currently in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035 with a 16.17% increase from Phase 5 and this is as low as it will get. Demand has been ginormous with over 17,450 investors investing more than $17.95 million so far. With over 75% of Phase 6 sold, Mutuum Finance is showing enormous investor demand and is unveiling itself as a high-growth DeFi crypto with long-term value, positioning it as a top crypto to buy for serious early-stage investors. Roadmap Milestone and Protocol Development Mutuum Finance Phase 1 was achieved with emphasis on setting the stage for its long-term plans. This comprised the presale launch, external audit of the MUTM smart contract, establishment of a legal and compliance department, and documentation of educational materials explaining the principles and operation of the platform. And now Phase 2, the work is to actively build the DeFi lending and borrowing protocol . The first version of the protocol will become active on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, recently announced on X. Early features will be published to integrate liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidation automation, all towards making a secure and optimal decentralized lending platform. In accordance with the project roadmap, the full protocol and MUTM token are to be released at the same time, a tactic that will initiate token utility on day one. The simultaneous release of the protocol and token increases the likelihood of listings on prominent centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) shortly after release, a key factor that can amplify exposure, liquidity, and early price momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly turning out to be one of the most promising DeFi plays in 2025. With more than 17,450 investors on board, providing more than $17.95 million, its double-lending mechanism, mixing Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, provide super-scalable yield potential and top-level capital utilization not available through more traditional channels such as Cardano (ADA). With Phase 6 reaching maturity at $0.035 and the V1 protocol on the verge of its Sepolia testnet launch, MUTM offers early adopters not only speculative value, but actual DeFi utility and strategic ground. To those that want the best crypto to buy with good upside potential and actual use in the real world, Mutuum Finance is a project designed for long-term adoption and good returns, clearly the top crypto to buy in 2025.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-thinks-8-13-and-27-targets-are-too-low-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst ChartNerd has shared a new perspective on XRP’s potential trajectory, indicating that his earlier price targets of $8, $13, and $27 might not fully capture the digital asset’s long-term potential. His assessment, which builds on earlier technical analyses, reflects a growing conviction that the coin could surpass his previous estimates based on recurring historical patterns and fractal behavior in its market structure. $XRP : All the FUD makes me think my $8/$13/$27 targets are too low https://t.co/XlOv0sGxbk — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 22, 2025 Technical Confluences Supporting the Projection In the post that preceded his latest comment, ChartNerd outlined a series of four fractal-based indicators that form the basis of his bullish stance. The first, termed “Fractal 1,” centers on XRP’s monthly 20 EMA retest — a technical signal he notes was also seen in 2017 during a consolidation phase that later led to a significant price surge. He said this as a repeating pattern that could indicate another major move ahead in 2025. “Fractal 2” involves a Supertrend retest that, according to the analyst, provides additional technical strength to the setup described in the first fractal. The third element, “Fractal 3,” focuses on the absence of a blow-off top in the monthly RSI, combined with Fibonacci extension levels that point to price regions of $13 and $27. ChartNerd explains that these same extension levels — specifically the 1.414 and 1.618 Fibonacci zones — were achieved during the 2017 cycle. His fourth fractal, based on a 3-month Gaussian Channel regression band, identifies how past declines consistently found support near this lower boundary before breaking through red resistance zones, suggesting that the market may be approaching a similar point once again. Market Reaction to the Analysis The analyst summarized that all four fractals collectively “paint a story” of higher valuations ahead for XRP . His confidence appears to have strengthened to the point of suggesting that even his earlier bullish targets might now underestimate the asset’s ultimate upside potential. Several users on X responded with differing interpretations of his outlook. One user, IL DUCE DELLA RANE, argued that the suggested targets were “far too low,” proposing instead that those price levels could merely represent points where momentum accelerates toward even greater highs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Justin Oleary, took a more skeptical tone, pointing out that eight years have passed without XRP reaching even half of ChartNerd’s lowest target. Ongoing Debate Over XRP’s Future Despite differing opinions, the technical framework outlined by ChartNerd underscores a continuing belief among some market analysts that XRP could be on the verge of replicating past performance cycles. His reference to confluence between multiple indicators and historical price behavior has drawn attention from traders seeking to identify similar market setups. Whether the next phase will validate his fractal-based projections remains to be seen. However, the discussion reinforces XRP’s ongoing role as one of the most closely analyzed assets in the digital market.

The plant, located in Greater Manchester, is one of the UK’s largest chip manufacturing facilities and reported £192m in revenue last year. Lawmakers say that leaving control in the hands of a company ultimately owned by a Chinese technology group leaves room for interference, access to industrial data, and leverage over a key part of Britain’s supply chain. The latest call follows a move by the Dutch government, which used emergency powers this month to seize control of Nexperia’s headquarters in the Netherlands. Dutch officials said there was a risk that China could restrict access to microchips and “pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.” They also removed the firm’s Chinese chief executive, Zhang Xuezheng, and stated that staff in China had been told they had the “right to refuse” orders from European leadership. This raised an alarm that the command of the company is fragmented across jurisdictions. Politicians warn government to act Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative Party leader, said the situation mirrors the 2023 case where Nexperia was forced to sell its semiconductor plant in Newport to Vistry following government intervention. Iain argued the government must now take the same approach with Stockport. He said: “The same rules should apply. I don’t understand why this hasn’t been resolved by the Government. The Government has got to wise up and start taking decisions that are in the best interest of Britain’s security. Security comes first. Defence of the realm is their first priority and yet they behave as though it’s their last.” Nexperia has been owned since 2019 by Wingtech, a Chinese technology firm. Although Nexperia is headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, political figures say the chain of control points back to Chinese industrial and political influence. The company also continues to operate a site in Hamburg, alongside the Stockport factory now under scrutiny. Iain accused Labour of taking a softer stance toward China to avoid harming trade prospects. He said: “The trouble is the Government is basically weak in this area. They’re very weak. Look at the fight we’ve had over the spy trials and their desire not to upset China. They’re desperate for a trade arrangement with China, but China is a threat to us, in every degree. It’s time that they faced up to this challenge. China poses the single greatest challenge to our freedoms that any country has done since the ending of the Cold War.” Supply chain concerns hit UK carmakers Bob Seely, former MP and author of The New Total War , also issued warnings. He said: “We have to be much wiser in our dealings with China’s communist leaders, especially when it comes to tech. We have got it wrong for well over a decade, and it’s getting worse under Labour. China is not really interested in investing, only selling, finding useful tech and dominating global supply chains. We kowtow for no good reason … making the world more dangerous in doing so.” He added: “The CCP have us where they want us. Our foreign policy, Whitehall and Treasury establishment is supine and our bankrupt Labour Government so desperate for economic crumbs that – despite pledges to the contrary – we are abandoning our interests and values.” Industry groups warn that Nexperia’s chips are used widely by European carmakers, meaning any ongoing disruption could spread into manufacturing. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders cautioned last week: “If not resolved quickly this issue has the potential to severely disrupt vehicle production and market supply.” A government spokesperson said : “We are monitoring the situation closely and remain in touch with Dutch counterparts regarding actions taken in relation to Nexperia. We are fully committed to supporting the UK’s semiconductor sector, which is why in the last few months alone, we have announced £75m for skills, innovation centres, and a dedicated UK Semiconductor Centre to strengthen the sector. We continue to monitor for any potential impacts on semiconductor supply chains for UK carmakers.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Tech|Nexperia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-26 15:10:05

During a packed day of high-stakes diplomacy in Kuala Lumpur, both countries signed a framework to remove nearly all trade barriers between them. Thailand agreed to slash tariffs on about 99% of U.S. goods, everything from farm exports to industrial products. The U.S. is committed to clearing non-tariff barriers and setting up a new system to handle future disputes. The announcement came during the regional summit where President Donald J. Trump participated in the 13th annual U.S.-ASEAN meeting. He didn’t stop at Thailand. He also signed reciprocal trade agreements with Cambodia and Malaysia, issued joint statements with Vietnam, and hammered out multiple defense deals. Trump met with four heads of government in a single day, called it “a historic alignment of peace and commerce,” and said, “We’re clearing the table, making it fair, finally.” Thailand signs peace with Cambodia, frees detained soldiers Thailand didn’t just ink trade deals. It signed peace. Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul joined Cambodia’s leader at a ceremony hosted by Trump and Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. There, they signed the ‘Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords,’ an agreement that ended months of rising border tension. Thailand agreed to free 18 Cambodian soldiers who had been detained since July. Both sides committed to building border observer teams. These will monitor activity and de-escalate flashpoints in real time. “This is about peace with real consequences,” Trump said. “People’s lives are on the line. And now they’ll be safe.” This peace breakthrough wasn’t isolated. In the same room, Malaysia finalized a major deal with the U.S. that will cut tariffs and lift restrictions on American agriculture, cars, and machinery. Malaysia will also end unfair policies that blocked U.S. vehicles from competing in its market. In return, the U.S. will recognize Malaysian regulatory oversight, no more double testing or duplicate forms. Cambodia made a similar offer, agreeing to eliminate all tariffs on U.S. exports, including food and industrial goods. With Cambodia, Washington also agreed to restart the ANGKOR SENTINEL defense exercise, last held in 2017. And for the first time since Prime Minister Hun Manet took power, he met face-to-face with a U.S. president. The U.S. also agreed to lift its arms embargo and open more training seats at West Point and the Air Force Academy for Cambodian officers. US, Thailand ramp up defense and crime-fighting partnership Thailand and the United States also expanded defense cooperation. Both countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding focused on strengthening supply chains for critical minerals used in chips, EVs, and more. The MOU also promotes deals between U.S. and Thai firms. The goal? Push back against subsidized dumping, fake pricing, and low standards that’ve polluted global markets. Thailand also pledged to step up cybercrime cooperation. U.S. and Thai law enforcement agencies will now work together to crack down on scam centers and financial fraud rings, some of which have stolen over $10 billion from Americans. “These aren’t kids in basements. These are organized networks. We’re going after them,” a U.S. official said. Elsewhere, Trump closed a $3.4 billion annual LNG deal with Malaysia’s Petronas, $42.6 million in coal sales, and $119 million in telecom exports. Malaysia committed to buying 30 Boeing planes with an option for 30 more, and agreed to purchase $150 billion worth of U.S. semiconductors, aerospace parts, and data center gear. Both countries signed another MOU on maritime security and even co-signed the Artemis Accords—bringing the number of space-exploring nations onboard to 59.

In line with the general crypto market, the altcoin produced a modest rebound from the deep correction levels seen in mid-October. Amid this price action, renowned market analyst Ali Martinez has shared a developing bullish pattern that suggests more profits ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Rebounds From Bull Market Support: Can It Conquer The ‘Golden Pocket’ Next? Buy The Dip At $15 – Here’s Why In a recent X post on October 25, Martinez postulated that LINK could be gearing up for a major rally, with technical indicators hinting at an incoming bullish opportunity. In analyzing the LINKUSDT daily chart, investors may have a chance to notch a 300% gain in the coming months. Based on the chart analysis presented by Martinez, LINK is trading within a broad ascending parallel channel that has defined its market behavior since mid-2023. Notably, the altcoin last bounced off the lower boundary of this channel in June 2025 to trade as high as $28.00, before descending to current market prices around $18.00. Martinez anticipates that LINK will complete its ongoing decline by revisiting the channel’s lower boundary, with the $15.00 zone, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, serving as the key area of interest. The analyst identifies $15.00 as a strong accumulation zone, advising investors to consider buying at that level. From there, LINK is expected to stage a recovery toward the upper boundary of the channel. However, Martinez cautions that the token could face interim resistance around $20.04, corresponding to the 0.786 Fibonacci level, which may trigger a brief pullback to $18.00 before a potential breakout rally. If this setup unfolds as projected, LINK could surge toward the $46.31 mark, matching the 1.272 Fibonacci extension, representing an upside of roughly 300% gain from the expected accumulation point.

Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has declined by 43.38% and is valuedat around $366 million. Looking at its monthly chart, LINK remains down by 11.05% despite the modest recovery seen in the last week, signaling that the token still needs further upside to fully reverse its recent losses and bring most new investors back into profit. With a market cap of $12.35 billion, LINK continues to hold its position as the twelfth largest cryptocurrency in the market.

The market is set up for a possible run above $120,000, but experienced investors understand that the most explosive profits are usually made on upstart altcoins instead of established behemoths. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is selling for only $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. The MUTM token has already jumped to $0.035 from its original Phase 1 price of $0.01, a 250% rise. After the present phase ends, it’s going to increase to $0.04, reflecting the project’s gradual value appreciation strategy in favor of early adopters. Mutuum Finance provides real utility for investors with enormous growth potential. It’s being promoted by the majority of analysts as the next big cryptocurrency as well as the next crypto to explode, with early adopters looking for life-changing returns in the next cycle. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Consolidates Under $110K Amid Uncertain Market Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to fresh selling pressure after falling under $109.5K, extending briefly to $106.7K before a limited bounce. Bulls are finding it difficult to recapture important levels, and an inability to close back above $110.5K may see the way opened to additional downside towards $105K or even $103.5K. BTC is currently consolidating losses below important moving averages, and the market is playing a wary “wait-and-see” game. Traders might want to watch resistance areas very carefully, but longer-term investors can view this as yet another shakeout along the way to the next leg up. As Bitcoin works its way through this area of doubt, most investors are viewing Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) strong growth prospects, i.e., a project that is gaining traction in DeFi, and potentially the next crypto to explode. Early Presale Momentum Spurs Investor Interest Mutuum Finance has gained tremendous traction with its multi-stage crypto presale initiated early in 2025. This strategy provides investors with clarity on upcoming prices and encourages early investors with scope for substantial returns. The MUTM token is currently selling at $0.035 in Phase 6 from $0.01 in Phase 1, providing early purchasers a close to three-times value appreciation. To date, the presale has collected $17.95 million, attracted over 17,450 holders, and sold approximately 75% of Phase 6. After this phase, the token price will rise by about 14% towards $0.04 phase 7 price. Of the 4 billion total token supply, 1.76 billion are allocated to the presale, with more than 760 million already sold in earlier phases. Such robust take-up indicates strong demand from both smaller retail investors and bigger players with multiple six-figure whale purchases amongst them as they seek to position themselves in advance of the next big cryptocurrency move. Understanding Stable Borrowing Rates Stable lending rates provide predictability by locking in a guaranteed interest rate upon lending, usually determined as a weighted average of the prevailing variable rate and other market factors. Since borrowers have the advantage of rate stability, the starting stable rate is generally above the current variable rate, where the protocol is compensated for less risk of future interest rate increases. Stable rates can, however, be rebalanced in case of an extreme change in market conditions. Rebalancing typically occurs when the prevailing supply rate drops to 90% or lower of the rate which would be active if all borrows were variable. During such instances, if the variable rate is far above the stable rate, the protocol can adjust the borrower’s stable rate upwards to ensure fairness and safeguard liquidity. For example, the rebalancing test can be formulated as: Current supply rate, Supply rate if all borrows were variable. Keep in mind that not all tokens are suitable for stable borrowing; highly volatile or low-liquidity assets are riskier and therefore aren’t suitable for stable-rate borrowing. Next Crypto to Explode BTC is below $110K as whales quietly accumulate, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 is the real show. 75% of Phase 6 sold out from $0.01, with the next phase reaching $0.04. Double-lending DeFi, mtTokens, and early-adopter incentives are what will make MUTM the next crypto to explode and the next big cryptocurrency poised for growth.

53663957,614161,1761494436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53663957.jpeg,"Bitcoin’s Illiquid Supply Drops By 62,000 BTC – What’s Behind The Shift?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-illiquid-supply-by-62000-behind-shift/,"Blockchain analysis platform Glassnode has shared some important insights on Bitcoin’s liquidity levels amid a rather volatile market period. Notably, the leading cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain its “Uptober” form after a price surge to $126,000 was followed by a heavy correction to below $105,000. While Bitcoin has shown some recovery activity since then, it is yet to break above the $115,000 resistance, while its total monthly gain stands at 0.47%. Bitcoin Liquidity Rises, Testing Demand Strength In an X post on October 25, Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s illiquid supply has fallen by 62,000 BTC since mid-October. For context, Illiquid Bitcoin refers to BTC that is held in wallets with little to no history of selling. They are essentially coins that are unlikely to move because their holders rarely spend and are considered off the market. Therefore, a decline in illiquid BTC suggests that more coins are returning to active circulation, increasing available supply. This dynamic can make sustained price growth more challenging unless offset by a strong surge in demand. Glassnode explains that illiquid supply growth has been a positive catalyst in this market cycle before this recent decline occurred. Historically, similar pullbacks, such as the 400,000 BTC decline in January 2024, have tended to slow market momentum by increasing the amount of Bitcoin in active circulation. Who’s Behind The Sale? In analyzing this fall in illiquid BTC, Glassnode further discovered that Bitcoin whales’ accumulation activity has accelerated. In particular, BTC wallets have increased their holdings over the past 30 days and have yet to liquidate any large positions since October 15. Therefore, the rise in BTC liquidity has been driven by retail investors. More data from Glassnode reveals that wallets holding between 0.1-10 BTC, i.e. $10,000 to $1,000,000, have been producing consistent heavy outflows. In particular, this set of traders has been steadily reducing their BTC exposure since November 2024. In relation to recent price action, Glassnode analysts note that momentum buyers, primarily retail investors, are increasingly exiting the market. Although dip buyers i.e., whales, have stepped up their activity, their demand has not been sufficient to absorb the excess supply, leading to the price imbalance currently observed. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,570, reflecting a modest 0.89% gain over the past 24 hours. On higher timeframes, the leading cryptocurrency has recorded a 4.11% increase over the past week and a marginal 0.05% rise over the past month.",Bitcoin|bitcoin whales|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Glassnode|illiquid bitcoin|retailers,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-26 16:00:36

The analyst shared two charts illustrating parallel formations between both cycles, indicating that XRP may be entering a similar two-phase upward trajectory. The left side of the comparison shows XRP’s 2017 breakout from a prolonged descending trendline, followed by a steep first wave and a period marked as “re-accumulation.” That consolidation phase preceded a second wave that sent XRP to new highs. On the right, EtherNasyonal’s 2025 chart depicts an almost identical sequence, showing a clean breakout, a sharp initial rise, and a developing re-accumulation zone that the analyst implies could serve as a launch point for another rally. $XRP history doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes. After its major trend breakout in 2017, XRP initiated a two stage parabolic run, Wave 1st, followed by Re-accumulation, and then Wave 2nd. Today, the picture looks surprisingly similar. Some cycles don't just repeat…they are reborn. pic.twitter.com/iZxcHgPu8b — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 24, 2025 Analyst Emphasizes Structural Pressure In the discussion that followed the post, another user suggested that the approval and trading volume of exchange-traded funds could be a key factor in driving XRP higher. EtherNasyonal responded that while ETF inflows are indeed a catalyst, the main force behind a sustained move would stem from deeper market mechanics. The analyst noted that a structural buildup in XRP’s long-term chart has been developing for years and that its release could create the conditions for a more powerful advance. The comments suggest that EtherNasyonal views ETF developments as secondary to broader structural patterns, implying that price behavior is being guided by technical and cyclical forces rather than short-term speculative events. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Context Supports the Outlook The 2017 comparison is notable for its precision. The earlier cycle showed XRP moving from below $0.01 to over $2.00 in a rapid two-stage surge once it broke free from a prolonged downtrend. The analyst’s current chart, with price levels adjusted to the present scale, positions XRP around the same phase of re-accumulation, hinting at potential continuation toward higher levels if the pattern maintains its symmetry. EtherNasyonal’s analysis places current XRP activity within a long-term historical framework, emphasizing that price cycles may not repeat perfectly but often align in structure. The suggestion that XRP could be preparing for a second wave similar to that of 2017 adds to the growing technical optimism surrounding the asset. According to the analyst, the next decisive move will depend on how the market responds as the present re-accumulation phase matures, and whether the underlying structural pressure he describes finally begins to unwind.

53664575,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1417643,1761495794,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/53664575.jpeg,"Bitcoin Accumulation Patterns Show Late-Stage Cycle Maturity, Not Definite End: CryptoQuant",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-accumulation-patterns-show-late-stage-cycle-maturity-not-definite-end-cryptoquant/,"Bitcoin’s current price movement continues to raise questions about whether the bull cycle is coming to an end. However, accumulation patterns across different cohorts of BTC investors indicate the cycle is in late-stage maturity, not at a definitive end. According to a report from CryptoQuant, on-chain data shows that although bitcoin’s short-term momentum is weakening, its long-term structural demand remains intact. This is substantiated by accumulation patterns in the dolphin cohort, the investor group comprising exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporations, and large BTC holders. Late-stage Maturity or Cycle End? CryptoQuant analysts said the dolphin cohort is the anchor of this bull cycle and has become the most important group to monitor. These addresses hold a balance of 100 to 1,000 BTC and now account for the largest share of the circulating bitcoin supply (26%, or 5.16 million BTC). Their counterparts, including the whale, fish, and humback cohorts, account for just 21.32%, 21.57%, and 14.06% of the circulating BTC supply. With the bulk of BTC holdings concentrated in this cohort, their behaviour can significantly affect market direction. Analysts found that growing accumulation from the dolphin cohort has aligned with upward price movement in the past. Contrarily, a slowdown preceded distribution or corrective phases. In the current cycle, dolphins have been the primary accumulator, increasing their balances by more than 681,000 BTC in 2025. In contrast, their counterparts have recorded net declines in their holdings. This dynamic shows that institutions and large investors have been absorbing supply from smaller investors, sustaining a demand base for this cycle. Dolphins Are Still Accumulating As other investor cohorts reduce their holdings, the bull cycle increasingly depends on continued accumulation from dolphins. So, if the pace of dolphins’ accumulation slows, the market could move from an expansion to a consolidation phase. The dolphin cohort’s annual growth needs to stay above its 365-day moving average for the bull cycle to maintain its uptrend. As it stands, dolphin holdings are rising at an annualized rate of 907,000 BTC, well above the 365-day moving average of 730,000 BTC. Unfortunately, the cohort’s 30-day balance growth has fallen below its 30-day moving average, signaling weakening demand. Analysts noted that the slowdown in balance growth coincides with bitcoin’s recent price correction from its all-time high above $126,000. Nevertheless, the market structure suggests that demand from dolphins has not deteriorated; hence, the bull cycle may be in its later stages rather than at its conclusion. Bitcoin needs an accelerated monthly accumulation rate to push to new highs.

A substantial Bitcoin transfer , involving thousands of coins, has just occurred, prompting questions about its potential impact on the market. This kind of movement often signals significant underlying shifts, making it crucial for us to understand what’s truly happening. What Exactly Happened with This Massive Bitcoin Transfer? Recently, the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert , reported a monumental transaction. Specifically, 6,396 BTC was moved from the well-known cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase , to a completely new and unknown digital wallet. This single Bitcoin transfer is valued at approximately $726 million , based on market prices at the time of the transaction. The destination wallet remains undisclosed, adding an element of mystery to the movement. Such large transactions are often referred to as ‘whale movements’ due to the immense volume of assets involved. These large-scale transfers are closely watched by market participants, as they can sometimes precede significant price action or signal changes in market sentiment. Why Do Large Bitcoin Transfers Matter So Much? When an enormous amount of Bitcoin moves, it’s rarely a casual event. These significant Bitcoin transfers are important because they can offer insights into the intentions of major holders, often called ‘whales’. Whales are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. Their actions can influence market dynamics due to the sheer size of their holdings. Here’s why such a large transfer garners attention: Market Sentiment: A transfer to an exchange might suggest an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and lowering prices. A transfer off an exchange, like this one, could indicate long-term holding or institutional custody. Institutional Interest: Large movements to new, unknown wallets are sometimes linked to institutional investors securing assets in cold storage for long-term investment. Supply Dynamics: Removing a significant amount of Bitcoin from an exchange reduces the immediate liquid supply available for trading, which could theoretically put upward pressure on prices if demand remains constant. Therefore, tracking these movements provides a window into the broader forces shaping the crypto market. Is This a Cause for Concern, or a Normal Occurrence in the Crypto Space? While a Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude naturally raises eyebrows, it’s essential to consider various possibilities before jumping to conclusions. Not all large transfers signal impending market upheaval. Several scenarios could explain this particular movement: Institutional Cold Storage: A major institution or high-net-worth individual might be moving their assets from a hot wallet on an exchange to a more secure, offline cold storage solution for enhanced security. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The BTC could be part of an OTC transaction, where a large block of Bitcoin is sold directly between parties, bypassing public exchanges to avoid market disruption. The buyer would then move it to their private wallet. Exchange Rebalancing: Sometimes, exchanges themselves move funds between their own wallets for internal management, security upgrades, or liquidity rebalancing. However, the report specifically mentioned an ‘unknown new wallet,’ suggesting a non-exchange destination. The lack of immediate selling pressure on Coinbase after the transfer might lean towards scenarios like cold storage or OTC deals, rather than an imminent sell-off. What Does This Mean for the Future of the Crypto Market? Observing a significant Bitcoin transfer is like watching a single piece move on a giant chessboard. It’s a clue, but not the entire game. While this particular movement doesn’t provide a definitive prediction for the market, it reinforces the ongoing trend of large players actively managing their substantial crypto holdings. For everyday investors, the key takeaway is to remain informed and understand the various interpretations of such events. Large transfers highlight the dynamic nature of Bitcoin’s supply and demand. It’s a reminder that while the market can be volatile, fundamental shifts in how large holders manage their assets are constantly occurring, influencing the overall ecosystem. This recent Bitcoin transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is a prime example of the significant, yet often opaque, movements that characterize the cryptocurrency market. Valued at nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars, it underscores the substantial capital flowing within the digital asset space. Whether it signals institutional accumulation, enhanced security measures, or an OTC deal, such events are crucial for understanding the broader trends and potential future direction of Bitcoin. As the crypto landscape evolves, monitoring these ‘whale’ activities will continue to be a vital part of market analysis. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? In cryptocurrency, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. Why do whales move large amounts of BTC? Whales move large amounts of BTC for various reasons, including securing assets in cold storage, executing over-the-counter (OTC) deals, rebalancing portfolios, or preparing for significant market moves. Is Coinbase a secure exchange for Bitcoin transfers? Coinbase is widely regarded as one of the most secure and reputable cryptocurrency exchanges globally, employing robust security measures for asset storage and transactions. How does Whale Alert track these transactions? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors public blockchain ledgers for large cryptocurrency transactions and reports them in real-time.

On-chain analytics platform Santiment reported that wallets holding between 100 and 10,000 ETH, also known as whales and sharks, have begun to rebuild positions after unloading roughly 1.36 million ETH between October 5 and 16. Notably, the Ethereum collective holdings chart shows that nearly one-sixth of those coins have already been clawed back, as some confidence starts to return to the second-largest crypto asset. Related Reading: ‘The Best Is Yet To Come’: Ripple President Sees Bright Path Ahead For XRP Whales Reverse Course After Early-October Capitulation The first half of October was highlighted by one of Ethereum’s most pronounced periods of capitulation this year. Macroeconomic fears due to US tariffs saw the Bitcoin price undergo a flash crash that dragged many altcoins to the downside. During this move, Ethereum’s price also fell very quickly, dropping from highs around $4,740 on October 7 to as low as $3,680 on October 11. Interestingly, on-chain data shows that the selling pressure from large holders amplified this move, as the chart from Santiment shows a steep decline in their cumulative holdings from about 24.5 million ETH to roughly 22.6 million ETH. This 1.9 million ETH drop reflected clear risk-off behavior among whales and sharks, who had been net buyers since August. However, once selling momentum began to fade, accumulation started to return. Institutional inflows started to return into Spot Ethereum ETFs, and whale/shark trades started accumulating Ethereum. Since October 16, the same cohort that contributed to the liquidation has begun adding back to their positions. Santiment noted that these holders are finally showing some signs of confidence, demonstrating an incoming extended recovery phase following the shakeout. 218,470 ETH Added In Last 7 Days According to Santiment’s data, the collective holdings of addresses with 100 to 10,000 ETH have rebounded to approximately 23.05 million ETH after bottoming out in mid-October. A highlighted annotation on the chart shows that 218,470 ETH were accumulated in just the past week, signaling a tangible shift in on-chain behavior. Ethereum collective holdings of wallets holding 100-10,000 ETH. Source: Santiment This increase represents roughly one-sixth of the coins previously dumped, a sign that major investors are gradually re-entering the market after what appeared to be an exhaustion phase. Similar accumulation trends have often preceded a broader recovery in Ethereum’s price, especially when accompanied by stabilization in the ETH/BTC trading pair. As it stands, the Ethereum price appears to be building a firmer base for the next phase of its recovery heading into November. When whale wallets accumulate, it reduces the circulating supply available on exchanges and reduces selling pressure.

The analyst detailed a network of corporate treasuries reportedly using XRP as part of their financial infrastructure, suggesting that these entities are building liquidity mechanisms for cross-border settlements rather than engaging in speculative accumulation. Emerging XRP Treasury Network According to the analyst, there are now eleven companies confirmed to be holding XRP within their treasuries. These entities represent a growing institutional layer within the XRP ecosystem, indicating a shift from retail speculation toward strategic utility. Among the most notable names is Evernorth, reportedly backed by Ripple and holding an estimated $1 billion in XRP. The company is expected to deploy operations on the Flare Network, further integrating tokenized liquidity solutions into enterprise applications. Additional participants in this emerging network include Trident with $500 million, Webus International with $300 million , and VivoPower with $121 million. Other firms such as Wellgistics and Everything Blockchain (EBZT) are also said to be leveraging Flare for yield generation, reinforcing the connection between XRP liquidity and interoperable blockchain environments. There’s a reason you keep seeing “Evernorth,” “SBI,” and “Ripple” in the same filings. 11 treasury entities — all building liquidity pipelines for $XRP . They’re not buying hype.

The hidden network is already live. pic.twitter.com/2mOjnQlW2p — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 24, 2025 Institutional Coordination and Utility Focus Ripple Van Winkle emphasized that these developments represent deliberate coordination rather than independent diversification. The concept of “network seeding,” as he described it, reflects the strategic placement of XRP across various treasuries to create a foundation for global payment corridors. This approach mirrors institutional liquidity preparation seen in traditional finance, where asset deployment across jurisdictions supports faster and more efficient settlement systems. The analyst’s remarks also connected the growing XRP treasury framework to broader institutional readiness. He compared it to mechanisms historically used by central entities to support bridge asset functionality, implying that the present configuration could be paving the way for cross-border payment solutions where XRP plays a core infrastructural role. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Global Positioning and Strategic Implications Notably, the list of treasury holders includes international firms such as Gumi in Japan and BC Japan, reflecting the geographic diversity of XRP adoption. The combined value of holdings across the identified entities surpasses several billion dollars, underscoring the scale of the initiative. Digital Comm, Hyperscale, and Wellgistics add to the breadth of the network, each contributing to a structure that prioritizes liquidity and utility over short-term price movement. While further confirmation from the involved companies would provide clearer insight into the operational scope of these treasuries, the alignment of names such as Evernorth , SBI, and Ripple in related filings continues to draw analytical focus. Ripple Van Winkle concluded that the infrastructure supporting XRP’s institutional role is already in motion, suggesting that what is currently visible may represent only a fraction of a broader financial architecture being quietly established.

The Ripple price is showing positive movement after a week of volatility. CoinMarketCap data shows the price of XRP has increased by 3.2% on the weekly chart. The Ripple coin is now heading for the $2.50 resistance, which the cryptocurrency has failed to breach after two attempts in the last seven days. XRP needs to decisively flip the $2.50 resistance into support and push toward the psychological $2.80–$3.00 zone. On the downside, failure to hold $2.30 could expose $2.00 once again. Yet, the Ripple price stays bearish. Its RSI reading is below the neutral 50 mark, suggesting lingering bearish pressure. Meanwhile, ChartNerd reports that XRP trades within an ascending channel. He estimates that the price of Ripple may go up to $5.00 within the next few weeks. $XRP is showing signs of a bullish reversal on the horizon. Channel support awaits below, with HLs on the weekly MACD, and SRSI levels in oversold territory. $5 is the first move of many on the next impulse.

Just hours after the pardon was announced, Zhao posted a statement on social media platform X, saying, “I am grateful to President Trump for today's pardon and for upholding America's commitment to justice, innovation, and fairness. We will do everything we can to make America the capital of cryptocurrencies.” The pardon marks a remarkable comeback for Zhao, who resigned as Binance CEO nearly two years ago after pleading guilty to charges of failing to prevent money laundering. Experts say the decision could pave the way for Zhao to reclaim an active role at Binance and his other ventures. The Trump administration is known for its policies supporting digital assets. Binance's support for a Trump-affiliated company's stablecoin project also drew attention recently. Democrats characterized this collaboration as a conflict of interest, while White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the pardon “has been thoroughly evaluated from a legal perspective.” Markets reacted quickly following the pardon. BNB, the Binance ecosystem's native altcoin, gained as much as 8% following the news. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Zhao's wealth currently stands at $58 billion. Binance's US arm, Binance.US, still has limited operations and is managed independently of the main platform. However, following the amnesty, Binance is reportedly considering restructuring in the US market and considering integration options with its global platform. Related News: A Metric That Could Signal About Ethereum's Price Has Emerged - Analysts Reveal “This cycle is largely driven by US institutional investors. Binance may now shift its focus in that direction,” said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. Following the pardon, Zhao appears to have begun to reassess his political and global influence. He has met with leaders in countries like Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Pakistan, and serves on blockchain advisory councils in regions ranging from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan. He also supports the decentralized exchange Aster and is working on a new education-focused app. CZ hinted at a comeback at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, saying, “I'm still young. I can't play golf all day, I need to be productive.” Changing his social media profile from “ex-Binance” to simply “@Binance” fueled speculation about whether he would return to his CEO role. However, those close to Zhao believe he is not eager to return directly to the CEO role. “He's acting more comfortably now,” said David Namdar, a director at BNB Treasury. “I would be surprised if he were to return to the CEO role.” “I expect Zhao to be more involved in Binance operations after the pardon. A founder's return usually drives growth and efficiency,” said Cosmo Jiang, a partner at Pantera Capital. *This is not investment advice.

The token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that has already sold more than 75% of Phase 6 presale to raise more than $17.95 million. The MUTM token has appreciated 250% from Phase 1 launch at $0.01 to where it stands now at $0.035. Upon completion of the present phase, the token will appreciate by another nearly 15% to $0.04, which is in tune with the project strategy of gradual growth in embracing early adopters. MUTM provides easy lending, borrowing, and yield farming to users, something that SHIB can never possibly emulate. For these investors looking for what to invest in crypto or where to invest in crypto today, Mutuum Finance is a perfect combination of initial growth potential and practical financial innovation that will be ideal for the investor to dump meme coins by 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Update: Accumulation Signs In A Descending Wedge Shiba Inu (SHIB) just went through a mammoth 289 billion token exchange outflow, about 1.45% of supply, in a demonstration of continuous accumulation as investors transfer capital from exchanges and eliminate selling pressure from the picture. SHIB technically is trading around $0.000010, forming a falling wedge chart pattern with the bottom support of $0.0000095 and the top resistance of $0.000012. RSI at 37 is showing oversold conditions and short-term bounce potential but inability to reclaim key levels could extend sideways stagnation. While such structural issues continue to plague SHIB, more and more investors are drawn towards newer projects with early-cycle momentum and new DeFi innovation, hoping to get on board projects with better potential for the next cycle of growth in the markets. Mutuum Finance Surpasses Market Projections Mutuum Finance MUTM is quickly becoming one of the top upcoming crypto projects Platform adoption has dwarfed initial estimates with more than 17,450 investors in presale and pledging over $17.95 million. The momentum has been quicker than analysts initially projected. Such strong presale momentum positions Mutuum Finance at the head of the class for top cryptos to buy today. Over 770 million MUTM tokens were allocated in earlier rounds, a decent indication of investor demand and pre-release early liquidity generation to look forward to the platform’s launch on mainnet. Such a success is an indication of ever more holders believing in Mutuum Finance’s roadmap and on establishing real-world utility rather than speculation mania. How Stable Borrowing Rates Work on Mutuum Mutuum provides the lender with an option of fixed rates under specific market conditions where cost of repayment is determined. In the event there is an available fixed rate option chosen by the lender, the initial rate is determined on weighted average of current variable rate and other market conditions. While any such fixed rate is above the current variable rate, it is in compensation for the lower risk of future interest rate fluctuations. Fixed rates are not fixed at all, however; they can be re-set in the event of sudden shifts in market conditions. For instance, in case the current supply rate is less than 90% or less than what will be utilized when all borrows are variable, then the protocol can exchange the borrower’s stable rate with the aim of upholding equity and securing liquidity. Worth noting is that no token can be borrowed stably because very illiquid or volatile assets are very risky. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $17.95 million from more than 17,450 investors, with phase 6 less than 25% close to selling out. Its initial supporters of its dual-lending P2C and P2P network reap passive income, flexible borrowing, and set up for growth potential in its early stages. Investors who want to learn what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in currently have to move quickly, proceed directly to Mutuum Finance’s official website and purchase your tokens before the final supply vanishes.

XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

The coin’s price has increased to a high of $2.63 over the last 24 hours. The coin has gained up to 3.11 percent of its value. Technical indicators give neutral signals, but the price charts project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying interest took hold, bringing the price to $2.63 during the day. The RSI increased to 52.06 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.47 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $23.24 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that Ripple CTO David Schwartz is stepping back from his daily duties at Ripple Labs after more than 13 years at the firm. He also noted that he isn’t leaving the company permanently and will join the company board. He will stay as CTO Emeritus, an honorary title. XRP price prediction October 2025 According to the Ripple price prediction, in October 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.60.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October, XRP is trending near the $2.9 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-26 17:32:39

53667113,614213,1761501615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53667113.jpeg,$133 Million In Bitcoin On The Move: SpaceX Makes Mysterious Transfer,https://bitcoinist.com/133-million-in-bitcoin-on-the-move-spacex-makes-mysterious-transfer/,"According to blockchain trackers and reporting by market outlets, SpaceX moved 1,215 BTC — roughly $133 million — into new wallet addresses late last week. The transfers were flagged by analytics firms on October 24, 2025. The company has not issued an explanation for the activity. New Wallets Receive Large Transfers Blockchain data shows the movement split into roughly 300 BTC (about $33 million) and 915 BTC (about $100 million). Based on reports, the destination addresses are newly created or newly associated with the company and are not yet broadly labelled on public trackers. On-chain records list timestamps and transaction IDs, but the transfers are otherwise standard Bitcoin transactions with typical fees. ARKHAM ALERT: SPACEX MOVING $130M $BTC SPACEX JUST MOVED FUNDS TOTALLING $133.7M. THEY TRANSFERRED 300 BTC ($33M) AND 915 BTC ($100.7M) TO NEW WALLETS THIS COMES 3 DAYS AFTER THEIR LAST MOVE OF 100 BTC pic.twitter.com/YplK8QAdvn — Arkham (@arkham) October 24, 2025 SpaceX’s Known Holdings And Recent Transfers Before these moves , wallets linked to SpaceX were reported to hold about 8,285 BTC, a stash valued at roughly $914 million when Bitcoin traded above $110,000. The firm has engaged in large transfers before, and this action joins a string of high-value on-chain movements by corporate holders over the past year. The size of the transfer and the profile of the sender drew immediate attention because SpaceX ranks among the larger private-company holders of Bitcoin. No Public Explanation From SpaceX SpaceX has not confirmed whether the transfers represent a sale, a custodial change, or an internal tidy-up of wallets. Reports have disclosed that analysts, watching the chain, tend to treat such moves as either custody rearrangements or preparatory steps for other activity. Some observers say shifting coins between company-controlled addresses is a normal part of treasury management. Others warn that without a statement, market observers will assume the worst or the most market-sensitive option: liquidation. Market Reaction And Wider Context While the transfers did not prompt a major price shock, they did spark conversations and volatility in trading feeds. Whale trackers and exchanges flagged the transfer for a short time, and some crypto commentators took note of timing while prices were near recent highs. For investors, these are moves worth nothing. A large on-chain transfer from a corporate wallet changes the demand picture around available supply for sale, will continue to exist, even if the coins are ultimately still held in the company’s custody. On-Chain Clues And Takeaways Analysts identify a few clues on chain: the addresses are recently used, no immediate moves to exchanges, and the transfer is in multiple outputs. These clues support the idea that the transaction is internal, meaning co-mingling coins from two cold storage wallets or simply moving coins to a new custodian. Still, until SpaceX or a trusted representative comments, any explanation is provisional and should be treated cautiously.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-oversold-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst STEPHISCRYPTO has identified a notable technical development for XRP, pointing to oversold conditions on the weekly Stochastic RSI. The observation, shared through an accompanying chart, suggests that the current setup closely mirrors previous moments when XRP experienced significant price recoveries. The chart provides historical context by showing how earlier oversold readings on the same indicator preceded substantial percentage gains. $XRP is oversold! pic.twitter.com/B2mTJ7Ue0Q — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 24, 2025 Historical Pattern of Recoveries The weekly chart for XRP against the U.S. dollar, sourced from Bitstamp, outlines multiple oversold points where the Stochastic RSI entered its lower zone. Each instance coincided with a marked price rebound shortly afterward. According to the data presented, past occurrences of this signal led to approximate gains of 94%, 110%, 49%, 75%, 600%, and 126%. The latest reading, again positioned in the oversold area, places the current price near $2.45, with a question mark appearing at higher levels on the chart, implying uncertainty around how far the next potential move could extend. Technical Interpretation The analyst’s chart highlights a repetitive pattern: when XRP’s Stochastic RSI reached similar low zones in previous cycles, upward movement followed soon after. The pattern’s consistency across several years highlights the indicator’s relevance for identifying moments of market exhaustion and potential reversal. While the chart does not forecast an exact price target, the repetition of this technical condition provides a reference point for traders monitoring potential directional shifts in XRP’s medium-term trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Implications An X user, Malik, commenting under the post, suggested that broader factors may also play a role, noting that “we all need to wait for the government shutdown to end so the ETFs can be approved.” His comment reflects the sentiment that technical indicators alone may not dictate XRP’s next move, as macroeconomic and regulatory developments continue to influence market behavior. Although historical patterns can be informative, they do not guarantee future outcomes. The broader market environment, liquidity conditions, and regulatory shifts remain key variables shaping XRP’s performance. STEPHISCRYPTO’s observation presents an evidence-based view of market behavior rather than a definitive forecast. The latest oversold reading marks a moment that historically preceded renewed strength in XRP’s price, but its implications depend on whether broader market momentum aligns with prior cycles. For now, the technical signal reinforces the view that XRP has entered a level of oversold pressure on the weekly timeframe—a condition traders and analysts will be watching closely as the market develops.

Vincent Karremans, who has only been overseeing Dutch economic policy in a caretaker capacity for a little over three months, used emergency powers to remove Chinese influence from the company. The move placed the Netherlands at the center of a geopolitical fight involving Beijing, Washington, and major European car manufacturers that depend on steady chip supplies. Karremans acted after warnings that the company’s ownership structure was becoming a risk to Europe’s manufacturing stability, and that internal decisions made by Zhang Xuezheng threatened to shift crucial operations out of Europe. Beijing responded by blocking the Chinese factory that handles part of the production workflow for Nexperia, disrupting the normal supply chain that sends components from Europe to Asia and back again. Automakers in Europe and Japan were told they might soon face reduced deliveries. European factories are now preparing for possible production halts if the situation is not resolved in days. The timing could not be worse, with industries already strained by weak consumer demand, higher costs, and pressure from shifting global trade rules under President Donald Trump’s administration. Karremans moves to block Wingtech control Karremans gained the authority to intervene when he invoked the 1952 Goods Availability Act. The law had never been used before. It allows the Dutch government to override company decisions if the continuity of supplies essential to the national economy is at risk. After filings in an Amsterdam court, Zhang was formally removed from his role on October 7. Karremans said the action was needed because Zhang “was secretly working behind our backs to relocate the company abroad.” Zhang had already dismissed three senior figures in the Netherlands and had approved around $130 million in questionable internal transactions linked to a firm he also controlled. A spokesperson for Nexperia said, “We hope this matter can be de-escalated soon, in the benefit of all parties involved.” But Chinese officials reacted sharply. During a phone call with Karremans, China’s commerce minister Wang Wentao said that the takeover had “seriously affected” the stability of global supply chains. Beijing sees Wingtech, the parent company, as part of its long-term plan to grow industries in which it wants to hold global influence. Many sectors in China, including electric vehicles and robotics, rely on the type of chips produced by Nexperia. The significance of the company lies in its volume. Nexperia manufactures transistors and logic chips used in vehicles, consumer electronics, and industrial machinery.It produces around 3,000 components every second. While the company is small compared to Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, the loss of its European capacity could affect a wide layer of manufacturing. Desmond Doran of the University of Kent Business School stated, “the disruption around Nexperia (6) was entirely foreseeable,” noting the risks of cross-border dependency. European automotive sector faces immediate Pressure Germany has already entered discussions with the Dutch government over the possible fallout. A spokesperson for Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s administration confirmed that Berlin is in “intensive discussions” about the situation. Chris Miller, author of Chip War , said that because of the scale of Nexperia’s supply role, any disruption “could have dramatic implications for manufacturing supply chains.” The European automotive association ACEA said that the industry was taken by surprise. Its director general Sigrid de Vries said, “The automotive industry suddenly finds itself in this alarming situation. We really need quick and pragmatic solutions from all countries involved.” The tensions first emerged in late 2023, when senior managers at Nexperia contacted the Dutch ministry to express concerns about shareholder interference. Meetings followed between the company and the state. Agreements were drafted to add a supervisory board and diversify ownership to include a Western minority stakeholder. However, progress stalled when Wingtech was placed on a U.S. trade restrictions list. In December 2024, the Dutch government told Nexperia that it needed to guarantee its operational presence in Europe. The company responded that it could not offer such a guarantee. Karremans, who previously founded the job platform magnet.me and served as youth minister, also announced investments of €200 million for an artificial intelligence center in Groningen and nearly €500 million aimed at strengthening the country’s technology sector. During a parliamentary debate, he stated, “We need to be much more active.” His actions with Nexperia became the first major example of that stance. The situation now depends on negotiations between the Netherlands and China. Factories across Europe are counting days. The stakes involve not only one chipmaker, but strategic control over manufacturing power in both regions.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $1,466.81 by the end of 2028. By 2031, Monero’s price may surge to $3,363.29. Monero (XMR) stands out in the crypto space for its strong focus on privacy and decentralization of transactions., making it one of the leading privacy focused cryptocurrencies. This makes it a popular choice for privacy advocates and those prioritizing security. The Monero ecosystem constantly evolves, marked by significant milestones like enhanced protocol upgrades and growing adoption across various sectors, which underscore its utility. As Monero progresses, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features drive significant value growth, as many traders speculate?

Monero price has support and resistance at $325 and $350, respectively. The Monero price history and analysis for October 26 shows XMR has risen to $350. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR rises to $350 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a strongly bearish market sentiment as the asset loses over 5% of its value across the last seven days. After oscillating between the $320 and $340 level the price fell to $300 before finding support. The following rally has observed XMR soaring to $350 where it trades at press time. XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView The indicators reflect the bullish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show rising buying pressure as trading volume increases. The MACD shows rising bullish pressure at current price level. Moreover, the RSI has risen to near the overbought region showing bullish market sentiment as the index rises to 64.66. The diverging Bollinger Bands suggest high volatility across the next few days. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero observed strong bullish momentum until it reached the $340 level where it finds short-term resistance level and returned back to the $300 level before finding support. The move was followed by a swift turn of momentum with the bulls soaring to the $350 mark where XMR trades at press time. XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView The RSI is at 74.76, showing overbought trend position as XMR rises to $350, suggesting a trend correction.

XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView Monero price analysis shows that XMR experienced strong as the price rapidly rose to the $340 mark. However, the price faced strong bearish pressure at the level causing a decline to the $265 level. The recent recovery to $320 XMR was followed by sharp decline to $300 before rapidly rising to the $350 mark. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to consolidate at the current level as the trend corrects. The price should be expected to trade below the $350 mark but is not expected to fall below $325. On the other hand, a bearish breakout would mean a drop to the $300 level with potential to drop back to the $265 mark. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a swift recovery from $266 lows to the $330 price level before falling back to $300 where it found support to initiate the recent rally to $350. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then.

The project is still just $0.035 in Stage 6 of its presale, and over 75% has already been sold. Over $17.95 million has been raised and MUTM has met with extensive investor interest. Runner-up is Ethereum (ETH), still a mainstay of the crypto ecosystem, but the freshness of Mutuum Finance and the early-stage momentum make it the best crypto to buy during the next bull run. For those investors looking for the next big play in 2025, MUTM is already the top crypto pick even ahead of Ethereum. Ethereum (ETH) Price Outlook Ethereum (ETH) is trading at important levels, with $3,700 and $4,200 being pivotal support and resistance areas. Although potential exists in the market for a push higher, a breakdown below $3,700 may open the way to a more significant correction, possibly filling the range as low as $3,500 before buyers enter. On the other hand, retaking the $4,200 level may be the catalyst for a near-term rally and re-established bullish momentum. While traders are watching these significant levels, many are also looking for opportunity in the crypto market, especially new projects with solid early-stage growth potential, which are becoming more favored by investors who are looking for the next big breakout. Mutuum Finance Sets New Presale Record Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best crypto to buy today within the DeFi space. Its presale is still exploding, with over 17,450 investors currently investing over $17.95 million. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.035 in Stage 6, offering a limited-time discount for early investors to invest in the future leading top crypto prior to the bull market explosion to follow. Mutuum determines borrowing interest rates based on the usage of its lending pools, the proportion of borrowed capital to overall available capital. This strategy maintains liquidity. When there’s a lot of capital, rates are minimal to encourage borrowing and get inactive assets into action. When there’s limited liquidity, rates go up, encouraging borrowers to repay and drawing in new deposits from lenders who want to earn more. By tying interest rates to the utilization level of capital, Mutuum aligns the incentives of lenders and borrowers and ensures a robust, efficient market. Upcoming Milestones Mutuum Finance is approaching a pivotal phase with the V1 launch of its lending and borrowing protocol on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, providing a live proof of platform functionality. In the meantime, the presale is ongoing and continues to build momentum, with Phase 6 already 75% sold and the next price point rise just around the corner. That platform development is ongoing and the presale is on track is an indication of increasing interest and momentum for this new DeFi cryptocurrency. How Borrow Rates React to Capital Utilization on Mutuum The interest rate of borrowing on Mutuum is set according to the utilization rate, which approximates the amount of capital presently borrowed in relation to the overall pool supply. The variable rate mechanism contributes to ensuring the incentivization of liquidity by market forces. Interest rates are relatively low when capital is plentiful, stimulating borrowing and triggering dormant assets. Conversely, when capital is scarce, rates rise to compensate for loan repayments and attract more deposits from lenders seeking additional yields. By adjusting rates proportional to utilization, Mutuum ensures that there is an efficient and balanced lending environment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy in 2025, combining early-stage growth potential with a functional DeFi environment. With more than 17,450 investors and more than $17.95 million invested and Phase 6 available at only $0.035, MUTM presents the exceptional chance to get in prior to the next phase increasing to $0.04. Its two-lending model successfully achieves equilibrium between Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity so that users are able to earn yields, borrow without liquidating assets, and attain market-driven interest rates. Although Ethereum (ETH) is a crypto staple, MUTM’s groundbreaking design, scalability, and presale hype also make it an attractive option for investors looking for both real-world use cases and early access to high-growth DeFi.

Krugman said the government shutdown delayed the release of the September employment report, leaving policymakers in a state of “partial blindness.” According to the renowned economist, economic data that appears positive on the surface can, upon closer inspection, raise alarming signals. Related News: Today's Most Talked About Altcoin GIGGLE Receives Confusing Official Statement - “Not Affiliated With Us” Krugman said that this “abnormal” situation in the economy manifests itself under three main headings: Sharp polarization: He pointed out that while the field of artificial intelligence is growing rapidly, other sectors are stagnating. Employment freeze: While there have been no large-scale layoffs, the unemployed or those seeking new jobs are having difficulty finding employment, he said. K-shaped growth: He stated that although investments in artificial intelligence support economic growth, this growth is concentrated in the upper income segment of society, while middle and low-income consumers face increasing difficulties. Krugman described the current outlook for the US economy as “one that is experiencing rapid growth in the age of artificial intelligence but deepening inequality.” *This is not investment advice.

After more than a year of steep outflows and weak performance, investors are starting to circle back to a region that looked like a lost cause just weeks ago, according to Bloomberg. Global investors pulled nearly $900 million from the region’s markets this month in yet another round of exits in a streak that’s lasted almost a full year. While money poured into Taiwan, South Korea, and China, where tech shares have rallied hard, Southeast Asian equities were left behind. Even so, traders now see an opening as valuations drop, political tensions cool, and supply chains drift further away from China. “Any sign of a more durable and favorable US-Asean trade framework would be positive for the region,” said Homin Lee, macro strategist at Lombard Odier in Singapore. Investors eye the rebound as valuations hit record lows The MSCI has surged by 10% year-to-date, a far cry from the 29% rally across broader emerging markets, its weakest relative showing since 2020, per Bloomberg’s data. The region’s stocks are trading at about 14 times forward earnings, compared with 19 times for the MSCI All Country World Index. That discount has attracted bargain hunters looking for value as global valuations stretch to their highest levels in four years. “We’re getting a bit more cautious on the global rally,” said Shay Pang, senior portfolio manager at Amova Asset Management in Singapore. “If you are an Asia-Pacific portfolio manager, I would rotate out of China and move into more defensive countries such as India and ASEAN.” Local governments are also moving fast to capitalize. Vietnam is pushing for 10% annual growth over the next five years, helped by high-end manufacturing moving from China. Earlier this month, it finally secured its long-awaited upgrade to emerging-market status from FTSE Russell, a shift expected to draw billions in new capital. Malaysia is chasing growth through AI-driven data centers and wants to position itself as a key rare earth metals processor for Australia. These projects are pulling fresh investor attention toward the region after months of stagnation. Trump signs new trade and minerals deals as ASEAN regains momentum Trump’s first stop in Kuala Lumpur wasn’t just for photo ops. He and Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim signed a trade agreement and a critical minerals pact on Sunday. The deal came just two months after Trump’s 19% tariff on Malaysian goods, a move that initially soured relations. Anwar described the new agreements as “a significant milestone” that would “improve the relationship between the nations beyond trade.” From there, Trump moved to finalize a broad trade deal with Cambodia, along with a framework agreement and a critical minerals memorandum of understanding with Thailand. These moves underscore Washington’s renewed interest in Southeast Asian economies amid ongoing friction with Beijing. Outside the U.S., Canada is still negotiating long-term trade ties with the bloc, while the European Union is targeting a full ASEAN trade pact by 2027. Yet challenges remain. U.S. tariffs on regional goods are still among the highest globally, and tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to cast a shadow over exports. “In order to find long-term capital being deployed in ASEAN, we would need to see more growth, trade tariff rates changing substantially, and a significant currency appreciation,” said Mixo Das, Asia equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “The bigger risk is that nothing changes and the status quo continues, rather than something that materially worsens.” Even with those risks, the shift away from AI-driven rallies elsewhere could benefit Southeast Asian markets. The region’s limited exposure to tech speculation may act as a cushion if global equities stumble. Political developments are also helping. In Thailand, the government led by Anutin Charnvirakul is promising populist spending ahead of elections and working to offset a strong baht that’s pressuring exporters. Anutin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet signed an agreement in Malaysia to manage their border dispute, which had earlier turned violent. Malaysia hosted the signing, acting as a neutral facilitator between the neighbors. In Indonesia, sentiment improved after Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa injected $12 billion into state banks to expand lending. The country’s stock index now offers a 5% dividend yield, attracting global funds seeking stable returns. Investment managers say banks, healthcare, and consumer stocks in Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore are showing strong value potential. Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager at M&G Investments, said that as multinational companies expand their operations across the region, “Southeast Asia offers compelling long-term opportunities.” Get seen where it counts.

53670059,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=845998,1761507429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53670059.jpeg,Apple to bring iPhone 17 Pro’s vapor chamber cooling to iPad Pro by 2027,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apples-ipad-pro-vapor-chamber-cooling-system/,"Apple is preparing to bring the iPhone 17 Pro’s vapor chamber cooling system to the iPad Pro, with the change likely landing in the 2027 model, according to Bloomberg. The feature, already rolled out on this year’s iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, was designed to handle the heat generated by high-performance chips during power-heavy tasks like gaming, video editing, and on-device AI. Now, Apple’s moving the same system into tablets (specifically the iPad Pro) without adding fans, marking the first time it applies that level of thermal solution to a product this thin. The system uses liquid evaporation and condensation inside a sealed metal chamber to move heat away from the chip. On the iPhone, that approach replaced the titanium frame’s former role in heat dissipation. That frame had been a problem on the iPhone 15 Pro and 16 Pro, which regularly ran hot and were uncomfortable to hold. But the iPhone 17 Pro solved it. You can now launch games or run Apple Intelligence tools without the whole thing overheating. Apple plans to do the same with the iPad Pro, which, despite having a bigger body than a phone, still struggles to stay cool when pushed. Apple targets overheating problem with M6 iPad Pro The iPad Pro is becoming more like a portable desktop, and that comes with heat. Just last week, Apple released a new version of the iPad Pro with the M5 chip, which benchmarks say is now just as powerful as the M1 Ultra from the Mac Studio. That chip once cost over $3,000 and ran in giant metal towers. Now it’s in your lap. But the M5 still isn’t immune to thermal throttling. That’s why Apple is already working on a vapor chamber for future models. The 2027 iPad Pro will likely ship with the M6 processor, built using TSMC’s 2-nanometer process, which improves power efficiency and keeps speeds high without wrecking battery life. But even with that advancement, Apple knows it needs a better cooling system, especially as more users load the iPad with video editing, AI tools, and Mac-style multitasking on iPadOS. Apple usually refreshes the iPad Pro every 18 months. Based on that cycle, the vapor chamber will show up around spring 2027. The company’s long-term goal is to boost performance while keeping the tablet fanless, even though similar devices from other brands already include vapor chambers. But Apple wants to use the feature as a key selling point to drive upgrades from users still on older models. The new cooling tech would also help Apple push a bigger gap between the iPad Air and iPad Pro lines. In 2024, the iPad Air was upgraded to a 13-inch screen, the same size as the Pro, and it’s scheduled to get the M4 chip in 2026. That move blurred the line between the mid-tier and premium models. Giving the Pro exclusive hardware features, like vapor chambers, would help separate the two again and steer users toward the higher-priced option. Apple accelerates ad rollout for Maps while foldable iPad stalls Apple is also rolling out a plan to inject advertising into the Apple Maps app, with the new placements going live sometime next year. Under the system, restaurants, retailers, and local businesses can pay for better visibility in search results, similar to how developers already buy top placement in the App Store’s Search Ads section. Apple believes it can do it better than Google, with a cleaner layout and AI-based targeting that shows more relevant ads based on user behavior. But this move could push more users away. Many iPhone owners are already frustrated with aggressive marketing inside the device, from banners for AppleCare+, Apple Music, TV+, and Fitness+, to sponsored spots inside Apple News. And with the iPhone 17 Pro starting close to $2,000, users say Apple is asking for too much. “It’s already a billboard,” one longtime customer told Gurman. “And now they want Maps too.” Even though Apple sees a big money opportunity here, it’s also bracing for pushback. Internally, the company is planning ways to avoid making Maps feel like just another ad channel. But some employees involved in the project still worry the strategy could backfire, especially with Donald Trump now back in the White House, where his administration could apply more scrutiny to Apple’s growing ad business. Meanwhile, Apple’s long-rumored 18-inch foldable iPad is on life support. After planning to release the tablet in 2028, engineers have now delayed it until 2029 at the earliest. The reason: hardware problems. The prototype is too heavy. The foldable OLED screen is too fragile. And the expected price tag is over $3,000, likely around $3,400, the same as the Huawei MateBook Fold, which is already being sold in China. Apple doesn’t know if there’s even a market for a foldable iPad at that price. People working on the project told Gurman it’s a 50-50 chance whether the thing ever ships. Apple has a habit of walking away from hardware that doesn’t look profitable. The self-driving car was axed last year. Earlier this year, it shelved the Apple Watch with a built-in camera. Most recently, the company ditched a cheaper version of its Vision Pro headset, which was supposed to be lighter and easier to wear.

Speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Scott dismissed claims that the move was a bailout, emphasizing that the funding came directly from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a Treasury pool under his control, not taxpayer cash. “There will be no taxpayer losses. This is a swap line. This is not a bailout, and it is from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which I control at Treasury,” Scott said. “It has never registered a loss. It is not going to register a loss.” The United States sealed the agreement earlier this month, just days ahead of Argentina’s high-stakes midterm elections. Officials from both countries held closed meetings in Washington, after which the U.S. bought Argentine pesos on the open market and finalized the $20 billion swap deal with Argentina’s central bank. The timing was not coincidental. Argentina’s libertarian President Javier Milei, who is backed by the Trump administration, is facing pressure to protect his fiscal austerity and market reform agenda from opposition rollbacks in Congress. U.S. buys pesos and activates $20B swap with Argentina The Treasury has been actively purchasing pesos on global markets, even though traders and economists say the currency is significantly overvalued. The intervention has raised eyebrows. Despite repeated questions, the Treasury has shared very little about the mechanics of the swap line or the peso buying operations. But Scott doesn’t care what Wall Street thinks. “We are supporting a U.S. ally in Latin America,” he told NBC, making it clear that this move was about foreign policy as much as it was about economics. The swap line itself is not funded by Congress. Instead, it comes from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which holds about $211 billion and was last used during the COVID-19 crisis and the 2023 U.S. bank panic. The fund’s biggest asset is the Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund, not taxpayer dollars. That’s why Scott keeps repeating that the U.S. won’t eat any losses here, no matter how the peso performs. Argentina’s elections are happening under heavy economic pressure. Milei’s camp is betting on voter support to secure more congressional seats and avoid any reversal of his shock therapy reforms. These include drastic spending cuts, deregulation, and slashing the size of the state, all policies that fit cleanly into the Trump economic playbook. Scott says the U.S. wants to send a clear message to Latin America Scott then said that the Trump administration is using this Argentina deal to send a warning shot to other regimes in Latin America. “We want to set the tone in Latin America,” he said. “We don’t want Argentina to become Venezuela, a failed narco-state.” That wasn’t subtle. He called Venezuela by name and made it clear that the U.S. intends to use its financial power upfront to stabilize governments it considers friendly. Scott also listed countries watching closely. “Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay; they all want to follow,” he said, claiming that other governments in the region are eyeing Milei’s reforms and U.S. support as a potential model. “So we think it is much better to use American economic power up front to stabilize a friendly government and lead the way,” Scott added. This isn’t the first time the U.S. has quietly used the Exchange Stabilization Fund for international leverage, but it is the first time since 2020 that it’s been deployed this openly. With the dollar still strong and the peso under attack, the U.S. is throwing its weight into Argentina’s currency war, with zero intention of letting it look like a handout. Just don’t call it a bailout. Scott won’t tolerate that.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August.

The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly.

In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800.

Whereas Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains retail driven in popularity due to memes, another token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is taking the headlines as a new crypto making waves in the DeFi space. Sold at a minimum of $0.035 during Phase 6 of its presale, over $17.95 million raised, MUTM is fast finding its way into the watchlist of tokens. Its two-way DeFi lending protocol, which incorporates Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, provides yield potential on a scalable level and increased capital efficiency, giving it practical, real-world utility that differentiates it from purely speculative coins. Investors searching for a mix of strong fundamentals combined with explosive growth potential will find Mutuum Finance to be a new crypto with potential to fuel the next crop of market leaders and a top consideration among the best cryptos to buy now. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis: Oversold Accumulation Signs Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently witnessed a massive 289 billion token withdrawal from exchanges, around 1.45% of its overall supply, as a long-term accumulation sign with holders taking coins off exchanges and reducing selling pressure. On a technical front, SHIB is currently trading at around $0.000010, creating a descending wedge pattern with support level at $0.0000095 and resistance level at $0.000012. Oversold at RSI of 37, indicating a bounce may be due in the near term; but inability to hold key levels extends the consolidation and caps the upside. SHIB’s accumulation phase indicates cautious optimism; yet there are some investors now focusing on newer industries offering early-stage growth with practical DeFi usability, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new crypto that is gaining attention ahead of the next major market cycle and catching the eye of those looking for the best cryptos to buy now. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Waiting for Finalization Mutuum Finance MUTM presale is triggering a great deal of investment attention, making MUTM one of the best cryptos to buy now in 2025. Phase 6 has established the token price at $0.035, which is a 16.17% increase from Phase 5. This is as low as it will go in this phase. After Phase 6, Phase 7 will start at $0.04, a 14.28% rise, noting that early entry is crucial. Investor interest continues to be robust, with over 17,450 investors putting over $17.85 million invested so far. With about 75% of Phase 6 sold, competition is high as people race to become part of this expanding DeFi platform, one of the most promising new crypto projects in the crypto universe. Secure Architecture and Incentive-Based Community Model Mutuum Finance possesses a strong security framework that is designed to safeguard the protocol and its users. Key features consist of Loan-to-Value structure for controlling borrowing on collateral, asset-backed collateral levels, and risk-based liquidation points that vary based on the risk profile of discrete assets. Reserve factor acts as a buffer against loss due to defaults or market fluctuations, with increased reserves for riskier assets to ensure platform stability. Besides security, Mutuum Finance also boasts an incentivized active user base. A $100,000 giveaway gifts ten members $10,000 each in MUTM tokens, given as a reward for new investment into the project. The campaign incentivizes participation while rewarding early players and expanding the platform’s ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is among the best cryptos to buy now, with early-stage growth paired with real-world DeFi utility. Already more than 75% sold at Phase 6 at $0.035, with more than 17,450 investors and $17.95 million raised, demonstrating clear market conviction. Its dual-layer lending approach, integrating Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, facilitates scalable yield generation, flexible borrowability, and capital deployment efficacy, achieving tangible benefit versus speculative-only tokens such as Shiba Inu (SHIB). With the presale phase nearing $0.04 soon, early access enables investors to obtain positions prior to wider utilization. For users looking for a token that offers real-world utility, community engagement, and strong growth prospects, Mutuum Finance will be one of the leaders of the next generation of DeFi in 2025, a standout new crypto ready to dominate the market.

ADA is down 2% in the last 24 hours, 7.8% in the last seven days, and a staggering 22% in the last month. However, bullish sentiment remains high among market analysts. With emerging enterprise use cases, a broader positive market outlook, and ecosystem developments, many remain hopeful that Cardano and Ethereum's performance will turn things around and target much higher prices. As a result, we will analyze the possible price target for Cardano if the Ethereum and Cardano market trends continue to be aligned and Ethereum, the leader of the altcoin sector, reaches $20,000. Ethereum Predictions Reaching $20,000 Despite losing 10% of its value over the past 30 days, Ethereum remains one of the top cryptocurrencies this season. For example, before the current consolidation, Ether rose from around $2,500 in July to $4,950 in August. However, many suggest that Ethereum could see much higher prices. Fundstrat CIO Tom Lee is one prominent industry leader who shares this view, predicting that Ether could reach $12,000 by the end of this year, followed by $60,000 within a few years. Analyst Ted shared on X that Ethereum will peak between $18,000 and $20,000 this cycle. The bullish trend stems from Ether's likelihood of capturing global M2 supply through trend correlation. Cardano's Price Will Increase If Ethereum Reaches $20,000 To understand the full impact of Ethereum's surge to $20,000 on Cardano, we asked OpenAI's ChatGPT. The chatbot offered various analogies for this event, offering both bullish, moderate, and bearish scenarios. For context, Ethereum's current price is $3,853 and its market cap is $465 billion. Therefore, a rally to $20,000 would result in a 5.2x increase, bringing its market cap to $2.41 trillion. Applying this directly to Cardano, assuming it rises proportionally to Ethereum, ADA would be expected to reach a new record high of $3.32. However, ChatGPT shared a realistic target under different market conditions, noting that market dynamics make such an ideal correlation nearly impossible. This analysis highlights the intertwined nature of Cardano and Ethereum's price movements, particularly during major bullish cycles driven by institutional and retail momentum. In a bearish scenario, Cardano would double to $1.28 when Ethereum reached $20,000. In a medium-term scenario, ADA's price would quadruple to $2.56. However, in bullish and extremely bullish scenarios, ADA would outperform Ether by 6.8x and 10.2x, respectively. These increases would peak at $4.35 and $6.52, respectively. Expert Research Shares New 100-Fold Coin If you're looking to capitalize on this uptrend and turn your mid-cap capital into generational wealth, small- and mid-cap altcoins are your best bet. Recent research has filtered through the noise and identified Minotaurus (MTAUR) as the next promising cryptocurrency with the potential to turn your 100 USDT into millions. Interestingly, Minotaurus showed all the promising signs of a token with significant adoption and upward momentum. Its low-cost and efficient blockchain, coupled with its excellent fit for the casual gaming niche and real-world usage, made it a prime candidate for a wild rally this time around. Currently trading at 0.0001247 USDT, Minotaurus offers not only a fair entry level but also a good price for accumulation, given its future trajectory. Backed by its vibrant community and clear use case, MTAUR could replicate the early success of leading assets like Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP. Can MTAUR Make You a Millionaire? At the current market price, 100 USDT could buy over 800,000 MTAUR. If MTAUR were to hypothetically rally over 86,000%, as XRP has since its all-time low, a 100 USDT portfolio would be worth over 86,100 USDT. Now, imagine buying 1,000 USDT or 10,000 USDT worth of MTAUR at the current price, mirroring XRP's all-time high rally. Such a portfolio increase could easily make one a millionaire. You don't want to miss out on this opportunity; buy MTAUR now before the price starts to rise.
