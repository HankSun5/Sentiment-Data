Bernstein Predicts Target Despite Election Impact",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-at-200000-by-2025-bernstein-predicts-target-despite-election-impact/,"Less than a day before the polls closed in the United States, crypto analysts continued to offer their two cents on the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For example, many Wall Street analysts say wild BTC market prices will continue after the elections. Other analysts and observers have shared their price predictions based on who will win this Tuesday. Related Reading: Why One Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy XRP—Before It Hits $14 Gautam Chhugani of the Berstein Group projects that Bitcoin can increase to $80,000 or even $90,000 if the Republican Donald Trump wins the election. If Kamala Harris wins the polls, Chhugani expects the BTC price to dip to $50,000. But Bernstein didn’t stop making Bitcoin predictions immediately after the election; the group remains bullish on Bitcoin in the short term and expects the digital asset to hit $200,000 by 2025. According to Bernstein analysts, the other key factors driving Bitcoin’s price are the increasing demand for spot BTC ETFs and rising US debts. Bernstein Adjusts BTC Price Predictions: $50K Under Harris, $80-90K With Trump Bernstein analysts have adjusted their Bitcoin price estimates based on the potential outcomes of the upcoming U.S. election. If Harris wins, they foresee Bitcoin dropping to around $50,000, while a… pic.twitter.com/Z1zJ21aJ48 — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) November 4, 2024 Bernstein’s Bullish Outlook For Bitcoin Next Year Analysts at Bernstein are betting on Bitcoin and expect its price to reach $200,000 by the end of next year, regardless of the election results. Gautam Chhugani made this bold prediction days before the Americans visited the polls and added that the results would not impact the long-term outlook for the asset. The analyst’s bullish project on Bitcoin is anchored on several factors. He even likened the asset to a “genie out of the bottle” and said stopping its price trajectory is difficult. Chhugani identified a few factors that can drive the asset’s price, including increased interest on the BTC ETFs and higher government’s national debt. Last month, Bernstein’s top analyst targeted $100k for Bitcoin but soon revised his projection to reflect changes in market trends. BTC’s Erratic Price Action Ahead Of Elections This year’s election battle between Trump and Harris is among the most highly debated and anticipated. In addition to traditional polling, data from betting markets like Polymarket became famous, too. For example, at Polymarket, Trump remains the favorite, cornering 63% of all wagers, with Harris getting 38%. Bernstein analysts say that regardless of the results, the asset will have short-term price movements. However, they expect BTC to benefit more from a Trump win. In the same Bernstein analysis, Bitcoin may increase to $90,000 if the Republican wins. Currently, Bitcoin’s price has dropped to $69k to $68k due to profit-taking. Also, analysts noted the weak inflows this week to ETFs. Most analysts agree that Bitcoin is still poised for an end-of-the-year rally.

For example, in a Harris presidency, Ether may gain due to heightened regulations that can limit the performance of its competition, like Solana. However, Chhuhani offers a differing view, saying if the SEC adopts moderate policies, these can propel Bitcoin and other assets. This year’s election cycle puts crypto and the blockchain at the center of debates. Both candidates have shared their thoughts on crypto, with Trump offering more crypto-friendly solutions. Initially, Democrat Harris was reluctant to offer policy proposals, but she shifted her tone as the campaign moved forward.

Wall Street and the world waits with bated breath for the culmination of the race to the White House. As of 1851 ET, S&P 500 futures ( SPX ) were +0.11% , while Nasdaq 100 futures ( US100:IND ) were +0.04% . Dow futures ( INDU ) were +0.14% . With the first polls closing in Ind. and Ky., exit polls conducted by media outlets showed voters expressing concerns about democracy and the economy. The three major stock indexes earlier staged a broad advance during market hours, with each ending more than 1% higher. U.S. equities have been remarkably resilient to the usual volatility that an election year can bring. The 2024 election season has been full of twists and turns and has, at times, been extremely divisive. History shows that the benchmark S&P 500 ( SP500 ) for the most part gains in a year after an Election Day. ""Irrespective of who wins the presidency, strong seasonals favor stocks from now to year-end, especially since a blue sweep is not in the cards. The most likely scenario is a mixed Washington, with leaders on both sides of the aisle needing to compromise to get things done. However, a red sweep is still possible, which will help equities via pro-growth policies that likely incorporate aggressive onshoring ambitions, lower corporate taxes, and a subdued regulatory landscape,"" José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. ""In conclusion, however, bond yields are critical to watch as investors and traders examine the inflationary, deficit and activity impacts of incoming policies,"" Torres added. The inexorable bull run in U.S. stocks did take a bit of a breather the last two weeks, as some caution finally appeared to seep into sentiment ahead of the election outcome. Of note, the Cboe Volatility Index ( VIX ) - widely seen as Wall Street's fear and volatility gauge - posted its highest closing level pre-Election Day since 1990 outside the bear market in 2000, the financial crisis in 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic crash in 2020. Looking at the fixed-income markets, the benchmark 10-year yield ( US10Y ) was down marginally to 4.29%, while the shorter-end, more rate-sensitive 2-year yield ( US2Y ) was up nearly 3 basis points to 4.20%. For more, see how Treasury yields have done across the curve on the Seeking Alpha bond page. In moves across other assets, WTI crude oil futures ( CL1:COM ) were +0.81% , while Brent crude futures ( CO1:COM ) - the international oil benchmark - were +0.59% . Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was last +2.9% at $69,771.77.
