Bernstein Predicts Target Despite Election Impact",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-at-200000-by-2025-bernstein-predicts-target-despite-election-impact/,"Less than a day before the polls closed in the United States, crypto analysts continued to offer their two cents on the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For example, many Wall Street analysts say wild BTC market prices will continue after the elections. Other analysts and observers have shared their price predictions based on who will win this Tuesday.

If Kamala Harris wins the polls, Chhugani expects the BTC price to dip to $50,000. But Bernstein didn’t stop making Bitcoin predictions immediately after the election; the group remains bullish on Bitcoin in the short term and expects the digital asset to hit $200,000 by 2025. According to Bernstein analysts, the other key factors driving Bitcoin’s price are the increasing demand for spot BTC ETFs and rising US debts. Bernstein Adjusts BTC Price Predictions: $50K Under Harris, $80-90K With Trump Bernstein analysts have adjusted their Bitcoin price estimates based on the potential outcomes of the upcoming U.S. election. If Harris wins, they foresee Bitcoin dropping to around $50,000, while a… pic.twitter.com/Z1zJ21aJ48 — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) November 4, 2024 Bernstein’s Bullish Outlook For Bitcoin Next Year Analysts at Bernstein are betting on Bitcoin and expect its price to reach $200,000 by the end of next year, regardless of the election results. Gautam Chhugani made this bold prediction days before the Americans visited the polls and added that the results would not impact the long-term outlook for the asset. The analyst’s bullish project on Bitcoin is anchored on several factors. He even likened the asset to a “genie out of the bottle” and said stopping its price trajectory is difficult. Chhugani identified a few factors that can drive the asset’s price, including increased interest on the BTC ETFs and higher government’s national debt. Last month, Bernstein’s top analyst targeted $100k for Bitcoin but soon revised his projection to reflect changes in market trends. BTC’s Erratic Price Action Ahead Of Elections This year’s election battle between Trump and Harris is among the most highly debated and anticipated. In addition to traditional polling, data from betting markets like Polymarket became famous, too. For example, at Polymarket, Trump remains the favorite, cornering 63% of all wagers, with Harris getting 38%. Bernstein analysts say that regardless of the results, the asset will have short-term price movements. However, they expect BTC to benefit more from a Trump win. In the same Bernstein analysis, Bitcoin may increase to $90,000 if the Republican wins. Currently, Bitcoin’s price has dropped to $69k to $68k due to profit-taking. Also, analysts noted the weak inflows this week to ETFs. Most analysts agree that Bitcoin is still poised for an end-of-the-year rally.

For example, in a Harris presidency, Ether may gain due to heightened regulations that can limit the performance of its competition, like Solana. However, Chhuhani offers a differing view, saying if the SEC adopts moderate policies, these can propel Bitcoin and other assets. This year’s election cycle puts crypto and the blockchain at the center of debates. Both candidates have shared their thoughts on crypto, with Trump offering more crypto-friendly solutions. Initially, Democrat Harris was reluctant to offer policy proposals, but she shifted her tone as the campaign moved forward.

This relatively low volatility has marked a calm period for Bitcoin, allowing it to stabilize in the $68,000 to $69,000 range over the past few days. The steady price trend has prompted analysts to forecast possible upward movement, pointing to various technical patterns and indicators suggesting a potential rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Slide To $65,000 As Critical Support Level Fails – Details 30% Bitcoin Rally In Play Among the analysts forecasting bullish momentum for Bitcoin, a renowned crypto analyst known as Captain Faibik recently shared insights on X regarding a technical pattern called a “Descending Broadening Wedge.” Faibik highlighted that Bitcoin has completed a breakout from this pattern on a weekly chart and is now in a “retest” phase. A Descending Broadening Wedge is typically considered a bullish reversal pattern in technical analysis. The pattern forms as price action creates lower highs and lower lows within diverging trendlines, implying that the downward momentum may weaken. If the price breaks upward through the resistance, it can indicate that the asset will likely see a price surge. Faibik expects a successful retest of the recent breakout of this pattern from BTC and has set a midterm target of $88,000, forecasting a potential 30% increase in Bitcoin’s value by the end of the year. Bullish Divergence And Long-Term Holder Behaviour Alongside Faibik’s observations, another well-known analyst, Javon Marks, pointed to signs of bullish divergence on Bitcoin’s chart. In technical analysis, bullish divergence occurs when an asset’s price makes lower lows while a technical indicator, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), creates higher lows. This divergence can suggest a potential reversal as buying momentum begins to build. According to Marks, this divergence indicates that Bitcoin’s bulls may be preparing for a move, which could translate to regained dominance in the market. Marks’ view supports the possibility of an upward trend in the medium term, even if the short-term market conditions seem uncertain. Meanwhile, IntoTheBlock, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, recently reported interesting trends in Bitcoin’s holder’s balance metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Offload Over 177k BTC: Is A Price Surge Or Correction Next? According to their data, while long-term Bitcoin holders are currently selling, the scale of these sell-offs appears moderate compared to previous bull cycles. In prior cycles, long-term holders often sold more aggressively, signaling a peak in market sentiment.

Memecoins Drive Unprecedented Trading Volumes Key to the recent surge in trade on Solana is platforms including Pump.fun, a memecoin generator, and Raydium, a decentralized exchange (DEX). Pump.fun brought in $30.5 million in October; Raydium recorded around $30 billion in trading activity. Particularly those looking for low-cost, high-frequency trades—an area where Solana’s infrastructure shines against more expensive networks like Ethereum—the activity generated by this memecoin has drawn more users to the network. Still, several business leaders are wary. Though memecoins have attracted a lot of attention in Solana, Eden Au, research director at The Block, pointed out that their long-term consequences are yet unknown. Au posits that changing market dynamics and shifting user preferences may impede current progress if fresh utility and attractiveness do not arise beyond memecoins. Solana DeFi Ecosystem Flourishes In addition to the memecoin excitement, Solana’s DeFi network has experienced significant growth. Solana’s DeFi industry, with a substantial $5.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), experienced a 26% growth in Q3, reflecting significant expansion propelled by platforms such as Kamino.

Integrations like PayPal’s PYUSD have strengthened Solana’s stablecoin ecosystem, making its programmable transfer features more appealing. SOL Price Target & Resistance Level Over the course of the past month, the value of Solana’s native token, SOL, has increased by around 12%. It is currently selling at $162, figures from Coingecko show. Market observers are currently looking at a resistance level of $185. It is possible that the token’s price will increase even further if it is able to break through this barrier; the expected price targets range from $220 to $240. If SOL is able to maintain its consistency and make the most of its current developments, then the next several weeks will be the determining factor.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the crypto industry in general has received a lot of attention in 2024. At the start of this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provided a boost after its long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded products. Not long after, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a record high north of $73,000 in March, though it retreated after its last halving on April 19. Here are some bitcoin backed exchange-traded funds of interest: ( IBIT ), ( ARKB ), ( GBTC ), ( BRRR ), ( BTCO ), ( HODL ), ( BTCW ), ( FBTC ), ( BITB ), and ( EZBC ).

As of 2251 ET, S&P 500 futures ( SPX ) were +1.17% , while Nasdaq 100 futures ( US100:IND ) were +1.22% . Dow futures ( INDU ) were +1.26% . Wall Street and the world waits with bated breath for the culmination of the race to the White House. So far, as per a live election tracker by the Associated Press , Trump had secured 210 electoral votes while Harris had 113. Either candidate requires 270 to win. Though the count was still progressing, and many Western states were yet to send in updates, Trump trades were picking up. In the fixed-income markets, U.S. Treasury yields jumped as bonds were dumped. The benchmark 10-year yield ( US10Y ) was up 18 basis points to 4.46%, while the shorter-end, more rate-sensitive 2-year yield ( US2Y ) was up 11 basis points to 4.30%. For more, see how Treasury yields have done across the curve on the Seeking Alpha bond page. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index ( DXY ) climbed +1.66% to its highest level since July. The currency is expected to benefit from a low-tax and high-tariff environment under a potential Trump administration. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) undoubtedly say the most dramatic reaction. The world's largest cryptocurrency smashed past the $74K level for the first time ever and in the process set a new record high. The crypto industry has been embraced by Trump in his election campaign. The three major U.S. stock indexes earlier staged a broad advance during market hours, with each ending more than 1% higher. U.S. equities have been remarkably resilient to the usual volatility that an election year can bring. The 2024 election season has been full of twists and turns and has, at times, been extremely divisive. History shows that the benchmark S&P 500 ( SP500 ) for the most part gains in a year after an Election Day. ""Irrespective of who wins the presidency, strong seasonals favor stocks from now to year-end, especially since a blue sweep is not in the cards. The most likely scenario is a mixed Washington, with leaders on both sides of the aisle needing to compromise to get things done. However, a red sweep is still possible, which will help equities via pro-growth policies that likely incorporate aggressive onshoring ambitions, lower corporate taxes, and a subdued regulatory landscape,"" José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. ""In conclusion, however, bond yields are critical to watch as investors and traders examine the inflationary, deficit and activity impacts of incoming policies,"" Torres added. The inexorable bull run in U.S. stocks did take a bit of a breather the last two weeks, as some caution finally appeared to seep into sentiment ahead of the election outcome. Of note, the Cboe Volatility Index ( VIX ) - widely seen as Wall Street's fear and volatility gauge - posted its highest closing level pre-Election Day since 1990 outside the bear market in 2000, the financial crisis in 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic crash in 2020. In moves across other assets, WTI crude oil futures ( CL1:COM ) gave up gains to turn negative, last -0.93% , while Brent crude futures ( CO1:COM ) - the international oil benchmark - also followed suit, last -1.02% .

Dogecoin Investors Have Been Showing Signs Of FOMO Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about how the trend in the Total Amount of Holders has been like for the various top coins in the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Reveals Buying Opportunities At Lower Prices – Details The “Total Amount of Holders” here refers to an indicator that, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total number of addresses on a given network that are carrying a non-zero balance. When the value of this metric rises, it means new investors are joining the blockchain or old ones who had sold earlier are buying back into the coin. The indicator also registers an increase whenever existing users divide their holdings into multiple wallets for purposes like privacy. In general, all three of these factors are simultaneously at play whenever this trend develops, so some net adoption of the asset could be assumed to be taking place. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests some of the holders have decided to clear out their wallets, potentially because they want to get away from the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other top assets: As displayed in the above graph, most of the assets have registered an increase in Total Amount of Holders recently, but Bitcoin has gone against the grain as its non-zero wallets have declined instead. More particularly, the number one cryptocurrency today hosts 211,500 less addresses compared to three weeks ago, which has brought the metric’s value to 54.38 million. This means that some investors of the asset don’t believe the current rally would continue further, as they have decided to liquidate their holdings at the recent prices. Historically, assets in the sector have tended to be sensitive to investor sentiment, but the relationship has been an inverse one: prices tend to go up when investors are showing FUD, while they go down in times of FOMO. Thus, the recent drop in the Total Amount of Holders may actually prove to be a bullish sign for Bitcoin. From the chart, it’s visible that the metric has shown the opposite trajectory for Dogecoin, as 46,400 addresses with a balance have showed up on the network in the past week alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Threat Of Falling To $63,000 Despite Rising Odds For Trump’s Election Victory “This is a sign of traders speculating and gambling on meme coins, even after last week’s local top,” notes the analytics firm. Going by what history tells us, this FOMO may not be the best sign for Dogecoin. DOGE Price Dogecoin has continued its latest bullish push during the last 24 hours as its price has broken beyond the $0.168 mark.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2420 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.250. Are Dips Supported In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2150 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2080 level. The next major support is near the $0.1920 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1654 swing low to the $0.2200 high. The main support sits at $0.1780.

35772251,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651742,1730871006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/35772251.jpeg,Analyst Reveals Bitcoin’s ‘Chopsolidation’ Phase Nears End—Are New Highs in Sight?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-reveals-bitcoin-chopsolidation-phase-nears-end/,"Bitcoin market trend may be on the verge of a significant shift, according to a recent analysis shared by CryptoQuant analyst Percival. Percival described Bitcoin’s current phase as “chopsolidation,” a term used to describe a period of minimal directional movement where price consolidation occurs without a clear trend. This period, he suggests, may be drawing to a close, with an imminent market movement expected in the coming weeks. The Chopsolidations metric, as Percival notes, doesn’t predict the direction of Bitcoin’s next move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Offload Over 177k BTC: Is A Price Surge Or Correction Next? Instead, it assesses the exhaustion level of the current trend, helping to determine whether Bitcoin’s price is due for a reversal or continuation. Percival’s analysis highlights that while there are indicators of strength at various points, the market remains divided on Bitcoin’s next direction. So far, some investors believe that recent accumulation is sufficient to push Bitcoin past its all-time high, while others expect a more cautious upward movement or even a potential correction. Assessing Bitcoin’s Support Levels And Potential Price Rebound Percival’s analysis further points to two key periods in September and October where Bitcoin established notable support levels, marked by brief but significant price stability zones. These areas, which he identified as orange zones on his chart (shared above), served as points where Bitcoin’s price “reloaded” — essentially, zones where demand was strong enough to halt price declines temporarily. With the current price hovering near these support levels, Percival suggests that the market may find a new bottom if Bitcoin faces any short-term downward pressure. This support could create a foundation for upward movement in the weeks ahead. The Chopsolidations indicator, according to the CryptoQuant analyst’s breakdown, is showing signs of readiness for a strong trend based on weekly and monthly readings. Although he did not specify a particular directional bias, he noted that the current market strength could be enough to drive Bitcoin’s price upwards if additional demand or a favorable macroeconomic environment aligns with market sentiment. This trend could play out over the short term, where sufficient market activity might lift Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Continuous Struggle To Make A Major Move So far, Bitcoin’s price has continued to face a struggle to make a significant move, especially to the upside. Instead, the asset has seen a form of calmness in volatility following its recent decline below the $70,000 price mark. Particularly, at the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $68,721—a price region BTC has remained quite stable for the past 3 days since its most recent decline.
