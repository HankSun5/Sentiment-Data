Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/400-million-xrp-abrupt-surge-heres-the-significance/,"XRP recorded a significant increase in on-chain transaction volume recently, with nearly 400 million transactions processed in a single day. This spike in network usage marks one of the most active periods in recent months, drawing attention from analysts and investors alike. However, despite the sharp rise in activity, XRP’s market price has remained relatively stable. Market Activity and Technical Outlook For May, data shows several transaction volume surges, culminating in the sharp increase observed on the 27th. These types of movements often reflect large-scale transfers between wallets, which could be linked to institutional portfolio adjustments or internal exchange settlements. Despite the volume spike, price movement has remained subdued. XRP continues to trade within a narrow range, fluctuating between $2.20 and $2.50. This price behaviour suggests investor hesitation, with no clear directional momentum developing so far. Technical analysis of the XRP/USDT pair indicates a symmetrical triangle formation, a classic sign of market consolidation. Currently, the price is testing support at both the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). A minor golden cross is visible, but it has not resulted in significant upward momentum yet. If the price breaks out, it may aim for resistance levels near $2.60 to $2.70. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Caution Still High While the recent jump in transaction volume signals increased network activity, it does not necessarily guarantee short-term price appreciation. Market interest, particularly among retail investors, appears limited. This is evident in the relatively low trading volume on exchanges, suggesting that traders are waiting for a confirmed breakout before re-engaging. For now, XRP must hold above the $2.20 support level to avoid a deeper pullback. Should buying pressure increase and the price move above $2.50, a renewed uptrend could emerge, supported by the growing network utility. However, without a decisive move from market participants, the asset remains locked within its current range. In summary, although XRP’s on-chain performance has improved notably, its price has yet to reflect that strength. Investors are advised to monitor volume and resistance levels closely as the market searches for direction. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Understanding the broader economic climate is crucial for anyone navigating digital assets. A recent report from Odaily sheds light on a key development within the US economic sphere that warrants attention: comments from a top White House official regarding US trade policy and the future of US trade deals . What Did the White House Economic Council Director Say About Trade Tariffs Impact? According to the report, Kevin Hassett, who served as the Director of the White House National Economic Council (NEC) during the period referenced, expressed significant confidence regarding a recent ruling concerning tariffs. Hassett’s comments focused on the potential trade tariffs impact and the administration’s strategy moving forward. Here are the key takeaways from Hassett’s statement: Confidence in Overturning Ruling: Hassett is confident that a recent tariff ruling will be successfully overturned upon appeal. No Impact on Agreements: He believes this specific ruling will not negatively affect ongoing trade agreements. Expectation of More Deals: More trade agreements are anticipated in the coming weeks. Deals Ready for Decision: Three trade agreements were specifically mentioned as being ready for then-President Donald Trump’s final decision. This perspective from a high-ranking official within the White House economic council offers insight into the administration’s view on the stability and direction of its trade agenda, despite potential legal or regulatory challenges. Who is Kevin Hassett and Why Does His Opinion on US Trade Deals Matter? Kevin Hassett is an economist who held prominent positions within the US government, including chairing the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and serving as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC). The NEC is a principal forum used by the President for considering policy matters involving domestic and international economic issues. Its Director plays a crucial role in coordinating economic policy-making across various government agencies. Hassett’s statements carry weight because they reflect the administration’s official stance and expectations regarding its economic and trade policies. His confidence in overturning a tariff ruling and the expectation of impending US trade deals signal a particular outlook on the administration’s ability to navigate trade disputes and secure new agreements. Understanding Trade Tariffs and Their Potential Market Ripple Effects Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. Governments use them for various reasons, including protecting domestic industries, generating revenue, or as a tool in trade negotiations. While seemingly straightforward, tariffs can have complex and far-reaching economic consequences: Potential Impact Area Description Consumer Prices Can increase the cost of imported goods, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. Domestic Industries Can make domestically produced goods more competitive but may also increase costs if industries rely on imported components. Export Markets Can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, harming domestic exporters. Supply Chains Can disrupt established global supply chains, forcing companies to find new suppliers or relocate production. Market Sentiment Trade disputes and tariffs often create uncertainty, which can negatively impact investor confidence and lead to volatility in stock markets, commodity prices, and even potentially influence sentiment in digital asset markets. The specific tariff ruling mentioned by Hassett, though unnamed in the report, likely pertains to a particular industry or country. His confidence in its reversal suggests the administration believes its trade strategy remains legally sound or that alternative legal avenues will succeed. This perceived stability, or lack thereof depending on the outcome, contributes to the overall economic narrative that influences global markets. Why Does White House Economic Council Commentary Matter for the Global Economy? The economic policies set by major global powers like the United States have a significant impact on international trade flows, currency valuations, and overall market stability. The White House economic council plays a key role in shaping these policies and communicating them to the public and markets. When a high-ranking official like Kevin Hassett speaks with confidence about overturning a tariff ruling and the impending success of US trade deals , it sends a signal: Signal of Resolve: It indicates the administration’s determination to pursue its trade agenda despite obstacles. Signal of Stability (Potential): If the appeal is successful and deals are struck, it could reduce uncertainty surrounding specific trade relationships. Signal of Negotiation Stance: It might also provide clues about the administration’s negotiating leverage and priorities in ongoing discussions. For those monitoring global markets, including the cryptocurrency space, these signals are part of the larger mosaic of economic data and political developments that inform investment decisions and risk assessments. While not a direct driver of crypto prices, the health and stability of the global economy, heavily influenced by US trade policy , can impact capital flows and investor appetite for riskier assets. Navigating the Future: What Does This Mean for US Trade Policy and Beyond? Hassett’s comments paint a picture of an administration actively pursuing its trade objectives and confident in overcoming legal challenges to its tariff strategy. The expectation of more US trade deals suggests ongoing efforts to reshape trade relationships through negotiation rather than solely relying on tariffs. Key Aspects to Consider: Benefits: Successful trade deals can open new markets for US goods, potentially boost economic growth, and provide greater certainty for businesses engaged in international trade. Overturning a potentially disruptive tariff ruling could prevent negative consequences for specific industries. Challenges: Trade negotiations are complex and can face political hurdles both domestically and internationally. The success of appeals is never guaranteed. Furthermore, the specific terms of new trade deals can have varied impacts across different sectors of the economy. Examples: The mention of three deals ready for the President’s decision highlights concrete progress in specific negotiations, although the details of these agreements were not provided in the report. Actionable Insights: Stay informed about developments in US trade policy and global trade relations. Monitor the outcomes of tariff appeals and the details of any new trade agreements announced. While the link to crypto is indirect, major shifts in global trade can influence broader market sentiment and economic forecasts. The confidence expressed by a figure within the White House economic council is a data point in the ongoing story of global economic relations. It underscores the dynamic nature of international trade and the continuous efforts by governments to shape it. Conclusion: The Interconnectedness of Global Economics and Trade Tariffs Impact Kevin Hassett’s statements regarding the expected overturning of a tariff ruling and the anticipation of further US trade deals offer a glimpse into the perspective from the highest levels of the US economic policy-making body. His confidence, as reported by Odaily, suggests a belief within the administration that their approach to US trade policy is resilient and set to yield further results in the form of new agreements. While this news directly concerns international trade and US economic strategy, its relevance extends to anyone observing global markets. The potential trade tariffs impact , the stability (or instability) created by trade disputes, and the positive momentum from new US trade deals all contribute to the overall economic environment that indirectly influences investment climates, including the appetite for digital assets. Keeping an eye on these macroeconomic signals, even those originating from the White House economic council , provides valuable context for navigating the complexities of today’s interconnected financial world.

While the headlines might seem focused purely on traditional finance, the latest economic data out of the United States holds significant clues for the future direction of the crypto market. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis recently released its second estimate for the first quarter of 2025, and the numbers caught many by surprise. Decoding the Latest US GDP Numbers So, what exactly did the data show? The report indicated that the US GDP , or Gross Domestic Product – the total value of goods and services produced in the country – contracted at an annual rate of 0.2% in Q1 2025. This figure was slightly less severe than the 0.3% decline that analysts had broadly expected, but it still represents a significant shift. Think of GDP as a report card for the US economy . A positive number means the economy is growing, while a negative number signals a slowdown or contraction. The previous quarter (Q4 2024) saw a healthy expansion of 2.4%. This sharp reversal into a GDP contraction in Q1 is therefore a notable event, suggesting the economic momentum seen late last year has faded. Here’s a quick look at the recent trend: Q4 2024 (Final Estimate): +2.4% Expansion Q1 2025 (Second Estimate): -0.2% Contraction This data point is crucial because it’s one of the primary indicators economists and policymakers use to gauge the health and direction of the economy. While this is the second of three estimates, the final number is usually close to the second, meaning this contraction is likely to stick. What Does This Economic Data Signal for the US Economy? A GDP contraction , even a modest one like 0.2%, immediately raises questions about the underlying strength of the US economy . While one quarter of negative growth doesn’t automatically mean a recession (which is typically defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction), it certainly puts recessionary fears back on the table for many analysts. What could be behind this slowdown? Several factors might contribute, including: Cooling Consumer Spending: Consumers are the engine of the US economy. If high inflation or borrowing costs are finally biting, they might be pulling back on spending. Reduced Business Investment: Uncertainty about the future economic outlook can lead companies to delay investments in new equipment, buildings, or hiring. Impact of Higher Interest Rates: The Federal Reserve’s past interest rate hikes are designed to slow the economy to combat inflation. This contraction suggests those policies are having their intended effect, perhaps more strongly now. Understanding this specific piece of economic data is key to forming a broader view of the macroeconomic landscape. Connecting the Dots: Economic Data and the Crypto Market Impact Now, let’s get to why this matters for you, the crypto enthusiast. Traditional economic data like the US GDP report can have a significant crypto market impact , albeit sometimes indirectly. Here’s how the dots connect: Investor Sentiment: A weakening US economy often leads to a shift in investor sentiment. When the economy looks shaky, investors tend to become more risk-averse. This can mean pulling money out of assets perceived as higher risk, which sometimes includes cryptocurrencies, and moving into safer havens like government bonds. Monetary Policy Expectations: A contracting economy puts pressure on the Federal Reserve. If the economy continues to slow, the Fed might feel compelled to lower interest rates sooner than previously anticipated to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates can make riskier assets, including crypto, relatively more attractive compared to low-yield traditional investments. Inflation Outlook: While the GDP report itself isn’t an inflation print, a slowing economy can potentially ease inflationary pressures as demand cools. A clearer path towards lower inflation could also influence the Fed’s actions and market sentiment, impacting crypto. Dollar Strength: Economic performance can affect the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international investors. So, while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, their prices are still heavily influenced by global macroeconomic conditions and the liquidity available in the system, much of which is tied to the health of the US economy and the policies of its central bank. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market After This US GDP Report Given this new piece of economic data , what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key economic data releases, not just US GDP . Inflation reports, jobs numbers, and Fed announcements are all critical pieces of the puzzle. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: A potentially slowing economy can bring increased market volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Watch the Fed: Pay close attention to statements from Federal Reserve officials. Their reaction to this data will be a major factor influencing market expectations regarding future interest rates. Consider Diversification: While crypto is your focus, think about how this economic backdrop affects your overall investment strategy. This GDP contraction serves as a reminder that the crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. External economic forces play a significant role in shaping its landscape. In Conclusion: A Warning Signal from the US Economy The Q1 2025 US GDP report showing a 0.2% contraction is a crucial piece of economic data that investors should not ignore. It signals potential headwinds for the US economy after a period of expansion and could influence everything from Federal Reserve policy to overall market sentiment. While the direct link isn’t always immediate, the potential crypto market impact from a slowing economy and subsequent policy responses is undeniable. Staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is just as important as tracking on-chain metrics or project developments when navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

This is where the AI crypto browser aims to shine. The intelligent agents within the Donut browser are designed to understand your intent and autonomously execute these kinds of blockchain transactions . Think of it like having a personal crypto assistant built directly into your browser. Here’s how it could simplify things: Token Swaps: Instead of manually finding the best DEX, approving tokens, setting slippage, and executing the swap, you might simply tell the AI agent, “Swap 1 ETH for USDC,” and it handles the rest, finding the optimal route and price. Yield Farming: Participating in yield farms often involves depositing liquidity pairs, staking LP tokens, and managing rewards. An AI agent could potentially monitor opportunities, suggest strategies, and even execute deposits or withdrawals based on parameters you set. Portfolio Optimization: Managing a diverse portfolio requires constant monitoring and rebalancing. An AI agent could analyze market conditions, track your holdings, and suggest or automatically execute trades to maintain your desired asset allocation or risk level. This level of automation has the potential to drastically lower the barrier to entry for interacting with DeFi and other web3 protocols. Transforming User Interaction with Decentralized Applications Beyond automating transactions, the AI crypto browser is set to redefine how users interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Today, interacting with a dApp often feels like using a clunky, early-internet website. Donut aims to make this experience intuitive, efficient, and safer. Key features planned for the Donut browser that enhance dApp interaction include: Built-in Wallets: Seamless integration of secure crypto wallets means you don’t need separate browser extensions or apps to connect to dApps. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Access: Direct access to various DEXs simplifies trading and liquidity provision. AI-Powered Risk Screening: A critical feature is the use of AI to analyze smart contracts and dApp interactions for potential risks, scams, or vulnerabilities, providing users with warnings before they connect their wallets or sign transactions. This adds a crucial layer of security that is often missing in the current landscape. By integrating these features and layering AI on top, Donut Labs is creating a more unified, intelligent, and user-friendly gateway to the decentralized web. This could be a major catalyst for broader adoption of decentralized applications in the coming years. The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities While the vision is compelling, building an AI crypto browser comes with significant challenges. Training AI agents to safely and effectively interact with the ever-evolving landscape of smart contracts and protocols is a complex task. Ensuring the security of the AI itself and preventing potential exploits is paramount. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI and crypto also presents a hurdle. However, the opportunities are immense. If successful, Donut could become the preferred way for millions of new users to enter the crypto space, abstracting away much of the technical complexity and risk currently involved. The $7M funding provides Donut Labs with the resources needed to tackle these challenges head-on and capitalize on the opportunity to be a leader in the next generation of crypto infrastructure. What Does This Mean for the Future? The investment in Donut Labs signals a growing trend: the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. As AI becomes more sophisticated, its ability to understand, navigate, and execute actions within complex digital environments like the blockchain increases. A dedicated AI crypto browser could pave the way for a future where interacting with DeFi, NFTs, and other web3 services is as simple as telling an AI agent what you want to achieve. Donut Labs anticipates that their approach will contribute significantly to broader adoption of decentralized technologies in the coming decade. The ability to automate and simplify complex blockchain transactions , combined with enhanced security features, could finally make web3 accessible to a mainstream audience. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Interaction The $7M funding secured by Donut Labs is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a vote of confidence in the future of AI-powered crypto interaction. By developing an AI crypto browser designed to simplify blockchain transactions and enhance the user experience with decentralized applications , Donut Labs is at the forefront of building a more accessible and intelligent decentralized web.

The global crypto market cap has recently soared past an incredible milestone, exceeding $3.5 trillion. This isn’t just a number; it reflects a massive influx of capital and growing confidence in the digital asset space. What’s behind this surge? According to the on-chain analytics experts at Sentora (formerly known as IntoTheBlock), a major catalyst is the increasing institutional demand . What’s Fueling the Crypto Market Cap Surge? The headline figure of the crypto market cap crossing the $3.5 trillion threshold is certainly attention-grabbing. Sentora’s report highlights that while the entire ecosystem is contributing, the primary engine driving this recent growth is the significant interest and investment coming from large institutions. Bitcoin’s Role: A large part of this institutional focus is centered around Bitcoin . With the advent of regulated investment products like spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions, traditional finance players now have easier, more familiar avenues to gain exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Capital Influx: Institutions manage vast sums of capital. Even a small allocation from a large pension fund, hedge fund, or corporate treasury can represent hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars flowing into the market, disproportionately impacting the overall crypto market cap . Validation and Confidence: Institutional involvement often lends an air of legitimacy and maturity to an asset class. Their participation signals to other large players, and even sophisticated retail investors, that the market is becoming more established and less speculative than in its earlier days. Beyond Bitcoin: Strength in the Broader Ecosystem While Bitcoin might be leading the charge in terms of institutional flows, Sentora’s data reveals that the health of the crypto ecosystem extends far beyond just the king coin. The broader landscape is showing robust signs of recovery and growth, indicating increasing utility and adoption. DeFi’s Rebound: Decentralized Finance ( DeFi ) is seeing a significant resurgence. Sentora noted that DeFi loan books have rebounded to an impressive $30 billion. This metric is a key indicator of activity and confidence within decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading protocols. The recovery here suggests users are actively engaging with decentralized applications again after previous market downturns. Stablecoins’ Steadfast Growth: Stablecoins , digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, have also seen remarkable growth. Sentora’s report points out a substantial 56% increase in their capitalization over the past year. This growth is crucial as stablecoins act as the primary medium of exchange within the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading, lending, and payments without needing to constantly convert back to fiat currency. Their expanding market cap reflects increased activity and liquidity across the entire space. How is Regulation Shaping the Future? The evolving regulatory landscape in the United States is playing an increasingly important role in the crypto narrative, particularly concerning DeFi and stablecoins . Sentora highlighted that guidance and potential regulations from key bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are poised to significantly shape the future trajectory of these sectors. Clarity for Institutions: Regulatory clarity is often cited as a major hurdle for institutions considering deeper involvement in crypto. Clear rules around classification (is an asset a security or a commodity?), trading, and custody can provide the certainty large compliance departments require. Defining DeFi: Regulators are grappling with how to oversee decentralized protocols. Future guidance could impact how DeFi operates, potentially affecting everything from user interfaces to the underlying smart contracts. While some fear over-regulation, clear guidelines could also legitimize certain activities and attract more mainstream users and capital. Stablecoin Frameworks: Given their role in facilitating transactions and their potential to scale, stablecoins are under intense scrutiny. Proposed regulations aim to ensure their stability and prevent their use in illicit activities. A robust regulatory framework for stablecoins could pave the way for their wider adoption in payments and traditional finance. While regulatory developments can introduce uncertainty in the short term, many market participants view thoughtful regulation as a necessary step towards the long-term maturity and sustainability of the digital asset market. Benefits and Challenges of Increased Institutional Adoption The surge in institutional demand bringing the crypto market cap to new heights comes with both significant benefits and potential challenges: Benefits: Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital means deeper markets, making it easier to buy and sell assets without causing significant price swings. Reduced Volatility: Institutional trading strategies are often less emotional and short-term focused than retail, potentially leading to more stable market movements over time. Enhanced Legitimacy: Their participation validates crypto as a serious asset class, attracting further investment and talent. Infrastructure Development: Institutions require sophisticated tools and services, driving innovation in custody, trading platforms, and data analytics. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large pools of institutional capital could potentially lead to greater centralization of power and influence within certain protocols or assets. Market Manipulation Risks: While regulations aim to prevent this, large players could potentially exert undue influence on market prices. Regulatory Hurdles: The very regulations designed to attract institutions can also impose restrictions that impact the decentralized nature of some crypto projects, particularly in DeFi . Correlation with Traditional Markets: Increased institutional involvement could lead to crypto markets becoming more correlated with traditional finance, potentially reducing its diversification benefits. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast What does this mean for you, the individual interested in or invested in crypto? The market reaching a $3.5 trillion crypto market cap driven by institutional demand is a strong signal of maturation. It suggests that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative bets, but as legitimate components of global financial portfolios. Keep an eye on how regulatory discussions progress, as they will significantly impact the operational landscape for DeFi and stablecoins . Understanding the difference between assets primarily driven by retail vs. those attracting institutional interest (like Bitcoin ) can also be key to navigating market dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets? Sentora’s latest data paints a clear picture: the crypto market is experiencing a period of significant growth, propelled by the increasing appetite from institutional investors, particularly for Bitcoin . This influx of sophisticated capital, coupled with the robust recovery seen in sectors like DeFi and the expanding utility of stablecoins , underscores the ecosystem’s resilience and evolving nature. As regulatory frameworks begin to solidify, they promise to further shape this burgeoning market. The journey to $3.5 trillion is a testament to the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric, potentially ushering in a new era for crypto.

While your focus might be on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the latest altcoin moves, paying attention to the broader financial landscape, especially the US stock market , is more crucial than ever. Today brought some notable news from Wall Street as markets opened with significant upward momentum. Let’s dive into what happened and why it matters for your digital asset portfolio. Positive Signals from the Stock Market Open The start of trading saw major indices pushing into positive territory, reflecting a notable shift in investor sentiment as the stock market open got underway. Here’s a quick look at the performance of the key benchmarks: S&P 500: Gained +0.79% NASDAQ Composite: Led the charge with a significant +1.43% increase Dow Jones Industrial Average: Posted a modest +0.14% gain This broad-based rise across different sectors indicates a potential increase in risk appetite among investors, a factor that often has ripple effects across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Understanding the S&P 500’s Move The S&P 500 , often considered a bellwether for the overall health of the U.S. economy and stock market, showing a nearly 0.8% gain right out of the gate is a strong signal. This index represents the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Its positive movement suggests confidence in the earnings outlook and economic stability, at least for the short term. For crypto investors, a rising S&P 500 can sometimes correlate with positive sentiment spilling over into digital assets, especially those seen as growth investments. Why the NASDAQ’s Surge is Particularly Interesting for Crypto The NASDAQ , heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, posted the most significant percentage gain among the major indices today. This is particularly relevant for the crypto market because many crypto investors and projects are aligned with the technology sector. Historically, there has been a notable correlation between the performance of the NASDAQ and the price movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A strong NASDAQ often suggests positive sentiment towards tech innovation and growth assets, which can directly benefit the crypto space. When tech stocks are rallying, it can create a favorable environment for digital assets that are also perceived as high-growth, disruptive technologies. The Dow Jones and Broader Market Health While the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s gain was more modest compared to the NASDAQ and S&P 500, its positive opening contributes to the overall narrative of a strong market start. The Dow tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies, often referred to as ‘blue-chip’ stocks. Its positive performance suggests that confidence isn’t limited just to the tech sector but is potentially spreading to broader industrial and financial areas of the economy. This widespread positivity can reinforce the overall bullish sentiment in the traditional markets, which, as mentioned, can influence the crypto market through various channels, including investor confidence and capital flows. What Does This Stock Market Open Mean for Crypto Investors? The correlation between traditional markets, especially tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies has become more pronounced over recent years. Here’s a breakdown of what today’s positive US stock market opening could imply for your crypto investments: Benefits: Positive Sentiment Spillover: A rising stock market can indicate increased investor confidence and risk appetite, potentially leading investors to allocate more capital into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Macro Environment Indicator: Strong stock performance might reflect underlying positive economic factors (like favorable inflation data or optimistic growth forecasts) that could also support the crypto market. Validation of Growth Assets: The NASDAQ’s strong performance, in particular, can signal continued belief in growth-oriented and technology-driven assets, which aligns well with the narrative surrounding many cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Increased Correlation Risk: While correlation can be beneficial during market rallies, it also means crypto is more susceptible to downturns in traditional markets. If stocks fall, crypto might follow. Less Diversification: High correlation means holding both stocks and crypto might offer less diversification benefit than in the past. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Given the connection, how should a crypto investor react to this positive stock market open ? Monitor Key Economic Data: Keep an eye on the factors driving the stock market (inflation reports, jobs data, central bank commentary) as they increasingly influence crypto. Watch Tech Sector Performance: Pay close attention to the NASDAQ and major tech stocks, as their movements often foreshadow trends in the crypto market. Consider the Macro Landscape: Don’t view crypto in isolation. Understand its place within the broader financial ecosystem. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Recognize that increased correlation means crypto’s volatility might be tied more closely to macro swings. Concluding Thoughts Today’s strong opening across the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow Jones is a significant event in the traditional finance world, and its implications for the cryptocurrency market are noteworthy. While crypto has its unique drivers, the increasing interconnectedness with global markets means that positive signals from Wall Street, particularly from the tech-heavy NASDAQ, can contribute to a favorable environment for digital assets. Staying informed about these traditional market movements is no longer optional but a vital part of navigating the complex and exciting world of cryptocurrency investing.

Last week, a hacker hit Cetus with a sophisticated smart contract exploit targeting the decentralized exchange’s (DEX) concentrated liquidity market maker (CLMM) pools, purloining approximately $223 million worth of assets from the platform. The DEX quickly froze $162 million worth of the stolen assets. Now, the Sui community is currently voting on a proposal that enables a special transaction to return those frozen assets from two attacker addresses back to Cetus. If passed, the vote would approve a one-time authentication of two special transactions hard-coded with the two attacker addresses, stolen asset objects, and their destination. The votes are weighted by validator stake, but the Sui Foundation’s stake is excluded to maintain neutrality. The vote passes if more than 50% of the total stake participates and there are more “yes” votes than “no” votes. The voting period ends next week, but early passing could happen as early as Thursday if the remaining unvoted stake cannot change the outcome. That appears poised to happen, with 71% of the validators having already voted “yes” at time of writing, compared to 0.3% for “no,” 1.5% abstaining and 27.2% who had yet to vote. Cetus also announced this week that it is in a position to fully cover the remaining losses via cash, token treasuries and a loan from the Sui Foundation, pending the vote’s passage. “Because full recovery is dependent upon the results of the community vote, we humbly ask for the Sui community’s full support to recover the funds via the upcoming vote. We recognize that this is an extraordinary ask forced by our actions, however we think it is the right decision especially for those affected.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

45265608,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164180,1748563251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45265608.jpeg,AI Licensing Deal: NYT and Amazon Forge Landmark Agreement,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nyt-amazon-ai-deal/,"BitcoinWorld AI Licensing Deal: NYT and Amazon Forge Landmark Agreement In a significant development impacting both the media landscape and the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, The New York Times has entered into an AI licensing deal with Amazon. This agreement allows the tech giant to use The Times’s extensive editorial archives to train its various AI platforms. This move comes less than two years after The New York Times initiated a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging copyright infringement over the use of its content for AI training without proper authorization or compensation. What Does the Amazon AI Deal Involve? The core of this agreement is the licensing of The New York Times’s diverse editorial content to Amazon. According to statements from The Times, this includes a broad spectrum of material designed to enhance Amazon’s customer experiences powered by AI. Key aspects of the deal include: Access to news articles published by The New York Times. Inclusion of content from NYT Cooking, the outlet’s popular food and recipe site. Utilization of material from The Athletic, The Times’s sports-focused publication. Potential integration of this content into Amazon’s Alexa software, suggesting AI-driven interactions could leverage Times information. While the specific financial terms of this Amazon AI content licensing agreement have not been publicly disclosed, it marks a notable first for both parties involved. For Amazon, it represents their initial foray into securing such a large-scale content licensing deal specifically for AI training purposes. For The New York Times, it’s their first official generative AI-focused licensing agreement, signaling a strategic shift towards potentially collaborating with AI developers under controlled terms. Why Did The New York Times Pursue an AI Licensing Deal Now? The context of this deal is crucial. In late 2023, The New York Times filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft. The suit claimed that these companies used millions of articles published by The Times to train their AI models, including large language models central to Generative AI applications, without obtaining consent or providing compensation. Both OpenAI and Microsoft have disputed these allegations. This legal action highlighted the complex and often contentious relationship between content creators and AI developers regarding the use of copyrighted material for training data. The decision by New York Times AI strategy to pivot from litigation against some AI companies to a licensing partnership with another like Amazon suggests a potential path forward for publishers seeking to monetize their archives in the age of AI. Unlike OpenAI, which has reportedly signed numerous similar licensing deals with various publishers globally (including The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, NewsCorp, and Axel Springer), Amazon’s deal with The Times appears to be a foundational step in its content acquisition strategy for AI development. Implications of Licensing Media Content for AI Training Deals like this Media Content licensing agreement between The New York Times and Amazon raise important questions about the future of journalism, AI development, and copyright in the digital age. Publishers face the challenge of protecting their intellectual property while also exploring new revenue streams and adapting to technological shifts. Potential Benefits: Revenue for Publishers: Licensing provides a potential new income source for media organizations whose traditional models are under pressure. Improved AI Models: Access to high-quality, verified journalistic content can theoretically lead to more accurate, reliable, and nuanced AI models. Controlled Use: Licensing agreements can provide publishers with more control over how their content is used by AI companies compared to unauthorized scraping. Potential Challenges: Undisclosed Terms: The lack of transparency in deal terms makes it difficult to assess the true value exchanged and set precedents for future agreements. Impact on Traffic: If AI models directly answer user queries using licensed content, it could potentially reduce direct traffic to publisher websites. Defining Fair Use: The legal battles and licensing deals are part of a larger effort to define what constitutes fair use of copyrighted material in the context of AI training. This agreement between The New York Times and Amazon is more than just a business transaction; it’s a significant indicator of how major content creators and technology platforms are navigating the complex intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence capabilities. As AI models become more sophisticated, the value and necessity of high-quality, verified human-created content for their training becomes increasingly apparent, making these licensing deals a critical trend to watch.

45265617,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=761135,1748563253,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45265617.jpeg,Ethereum Tests Key Weekly Resistance – Analyst Sets $4K Target If ETH Breaks Out,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-tests-key-weekly-resistance-analyst-sets-4k-target-if-eth-breaks-out/,"Ethereum is taking the lead in the crypto market as Bitcoin continues to consolidate near its all-time highs. After months of lagging behind BTC, ETH is now making a strong move, with bulls pushing price action toward the critical $2,800 resistance. This level, which has consistently capped upside momentum since early February, now stands as the key battleground for Ethereum’s next major leg. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Market sentiment has shifted as Ethereum shows signs of reclaiming dominance, driven by renewed spot demand and strengthening technicals. Top analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on the rally, emphasizing the importance of the $2,850 mark. According to Pillows, this is the most significant resistance Ethereum has faced in this cycle, and breaking through it could unlock a powerful move toward $3,000 and beyond. Momentum has been building steadily over the past few weeks, and ETH’s recent resilience against macroeconomic pressure is adding to the conviction. If bulls manage to flip this resistance into support, it could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin surge. For now, all eyes are on Ethereum as it flirts with a breakout that could reshape market dynamics heading into June. Ethereum Eyes Expansion Phase Amid Shifting Global Dynamics Ethereum is positioning itself for a potentially expansive move as both technical indicators and market sentiment continue to align in its favor. After weeks of consolidation and steady gains, ETH is now testing the $2,850 resistance—a level that has held price down since February. The setup suggests that Ethereum is not only regaining momentum but could also lead the next phase of the crypto rally. While the crypto market gains traction, broader macroeconomic forces are reshaping investor behavior. A recent decision by the U.S. Federal court to strike down former President Trump’s tariffs on various countries has created fresh uncertainty across global markets. This policy reversal could introduce volatility in traditional finance, as trade dynamics shift and new fiscal responses take shape. Despite this uncertainty, Ethereum appears to be thriving. There’s a view that crypto assets like ETH could perform well under tight economic conditions, and current price action supports that view. ETH is showing resilience, supported by growing spot demand, a bullish structure, and rising investor confidence. Pillows highlighted in his latest analysis that if Ethereum reclaims the $2,850 level in the coming sessions, the path to $4,000 will open quickly. This would represent a major breakout and likely trigger a wave of capital rotation from Bitcoin and stablecoins into altcoins. For now, ETH remains just below a breakout point. If bulls can push decisively above resistance, it would confirm the start of an expansionary move that could reshape the broader market, positioning Ethereum as a leading force in the next phase of the cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Reclaims Weekly Key Levels Ethereum is showing renewed strength on the weekly chart, currently trading at $2,728.36 after reaching a high of $2,789.50. This move marks a significant recovery from recent lows near $1,600 and confirms the formation of a strong uptrend. ETH has now reclaimed the 34-week EMA at $2,511.42 and is pushing above the 100-week SMA at $2,605.71. These moving averages now act as dynamic support levels, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The next critical level to watch is the 50-week SMA, currently sitting at $2,729.64, just slightly above the current price. A confirmed weekly close above this level would mark the first time ETH has sustained strength above it since late 2023. That could open the door for a push toward the $3,200–$3,600 zone, with $4,000 in sight if momentum accelerates. Volume has also picked up on this recent move, signaling healthy participation from buyers. Historically, similar recoveries from major moving average clusters have preceded expansive legs in Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally As long as ETH maintains this structure and closes the week above $2,700, bulls are likely to retain control. The breakout above $2,850—last defended in early 2024—remains the final hurdle before Ethereum can challenge prior cycle highs.

Recent analysis suggests several powerful forces are aligning, potentially driving the premier cryptocurrency to new heights. If you’re watching the crypto market , understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial. A deep dive into on-chain and technical data reveals five compelling signals that point towards continued upside potential for Bitcoin . These factors aren’t just isolated events; they represent shifts in market structure and investor behavior that have historically preceded significant price appreciation. Let’s break down what these signals are and why they matter for the future trajectory of Bitcoin . Signal 1: Sustained Whale Accumulation One of the most telling signs of smart money confidence is the behavior of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. These entities control vast amounts of Bitcoin and their movements can significantly influence market dynamics. Recent data indicates a sustained pattern of accumulation by these large wallets. What does this mean? Reduced Supply on Exchanges: When whales move Bitcoin off exchanges into cold storage, it signals an intent to hold for the long term, reducing the readily available supply for selling. Confidence in Future Price: Accumulation suggests these large players believe the current price is attractive and expect it to rise considerably in the future. They aren’t selling into strength; they’re buying dips or accumulating steadily. Market Strength: Sustained buying pressure from large players provides a strong foundation for price support. This consistent absorption of supply by whales is a fundamental bullish signal, suggesting strong hands are positioning for significant gains. Signal 2: Strong Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products, particularly in the United States, has been a game-changer for the crypto market . These vehicles provide traditional investors with an accessible and regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin . The inflows into these ETFs have been substantial and consistent. Here’s why this is bullish: New Capital Injection: ETFs bring significant new capital into the market that might otherwise not have directly invested in Bitcoin . This includes institutional funds, wealth managers, and retail investors using traditional brokerage accounts. Demand Exceeding Supply: The rate at which these ETFs are buying Bitcoin to back their shares often exceeds the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined daily. This creates a supply shock dynamic. Validation and Legitimacy: The success and adoption of Bitcoin ETF s lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially attracting even more conservative investors over time. The sustained demand from the ETF sector is a powerful engine driving the Bitcoin price higher by absorbing available supply. Signal 3: Elevated Investor Sentiment Market psychology plays a significant role in price movements. While not a fundamental driver, elevated investor sentiment can fuel momentum and extend rallies. Various metrics, from social media trends to survey data and funding rates in derivatives markets, suggest sentiment remains broadly positive towards Bitcoin . Why is positive sentiment important? Increased Participation: Positive sentiment encourages more people to buy, from retail investors entering the market to existing holders increasing their positions. Reduced Selling Pressure: When sentiment is high, holders are less likely to sell on minor price dips, leading to more resilient price action. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: In the short to medium term, widespread belief in a rising market can contribute to that rise as buying activity increases. While sentiment can be fickle, its current elevated state indicates a general bullish outlook across the crypto market , supporting the potential for continued price increases. Signal 4: Rising Open Interest Despite All-Time Highs Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures or options) that have not been settled. Typically, when an asset reaches new all-time highs, open interest might decline as traders take profits or close positions. However, in the current cycle, open interest in Bitcoin derivatives has remained elevated or continued to climb even as the price reaches record levels. What does this signal? New Money Entering: High open interest at highs suggests new positions are being opened, not just old ones being rolled over or closed. This indicates fresh capital and new market participants are entering the derivatives space, often with bullish bets. Confidence in Continuation: Traders are willing to take on leveraged positions even at high prices, implying confidence that the rally is not over. Potential for Volatility: While bullish, high open interest also increases the potential for large price swings due to liquidations if the market moves sharply in one direction. This metric, analyzed alongside funding rates, provides insight into the leverage and conviction within the market, and current readings suggest a strong belief in further upside. Signal 5: Potential Short Liquidations Above $111,000 The derivatives market isn’t just about bullish bets. Many traders take short positions, betting on the price to fall. Data on liquidation levels shows where these short positions would be forced to close if the price rises, potentially triggering a cascade of buying. Analysis points to significant clusters of short positions that could face liquidation if Bitcoin surpasses levels between $111,000 and $115,000. Why is this a bullish signal? Liquidation Cascades: When the price hits these levels, automated systems force short sellers to buy Bitcoin to cover their positions. This sudden buying pressure can rapidly accelerate the price increase. Fuel for the Rally: These forced buys act as fuel, pushing the price higher and potentially triggering further liquidations at even higher levels. Weakening Opposition: Liquidating short positions removes market participants betting against the price rise, reducing selling pressure. The presence of these potential liquidation zones above current price levels creates a technical setup where a move higher could gain rapid momentum, helping propel the Bitcoin price towards and potentially beyond these targets. Putting It All Together: A Broader Bull Cycle Individually, each of these five signals provides a piece of the puzzle. Taken together, as highlighted by the Cointelegraph analysis of on-chain data and technical indicators, they paint a compelling picture of a market structure geared for further appreciation. Sustained whale accumulation reduces supply, robust Bitcoin ETF inflows create consistent demand, elevated sentiment encourages participation, high open interest shows conviction, and potential short liquidations offer technical upside fuel. The report suggests this isn’t just a temporary bounce, but rather that Bitcoin is firmly entrenched in a broader bull cycle. This cycle is characterized by fundamental shifts in adoption, market infrastructure (like ETFs), and increasing confidence from both retail and institutional players. Price Targets: $120,000+ and Beyond? Based on these bullish signals and the broader market context, the analysis indicates a strong likelihood of Bitcoin surpassing the $120,000 mark in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, the potential exists for the price to reach as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025. It’s important to remember that price targets are projections based on current data and market conditions. The path to these levels is unlikely to be a straight line, and volatility is inherent in the crypto market . However, the confluence of these five bullish factors provides a data-driven basis for these optimistic forecasts. What Does This Mean for Investors? For those participating in or watching the crypto market , these signals offer valuable insights: Actionable Insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange reserves, whale wallet movements, and long-term holder behavior. Track ETF Flows: Watch weekly or monthly reports on Bitcoin ETF inflows to gauge institutional and traditional investor demand. Understand Sentiment: While not a primary driver, sentiment indicators can help understand market psychology and potential short-term swings. Be Aware of Liquidation Levels: Understanding where significant liquidation clusters lie can help anticipate potential areas of accelerated price movement. Consider Long-Term Perspective: The analysis points to a broader bull cycle, suggesting that focusing on the long-term trend rather than short-term volatility may be beneficial. Potential Benefits: Significant price appreciation for existing holders. Opportunities for new investors to participate in a potentially growing market. Further maturation and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. Potential Challenges: Market volatility means significant price swings are possible. External factors (regulatory news, macroeconomic shifts) can impact the market. Reaching price targets is not guaranteed and depends on the continued strength of these signals and overall market conditions. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook Supported by Data The convergence of sustained whale accumulation , strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, positive investor sentiment, rising open interest at highs, and technical liquidation zones above current levels presents a powerful case for continued upside in the Bitcoin price . These signals, derived from detailed on-chain data and technical analysis, suggest the current market environment is robust and poised for further growth. While no market move is guaranteed, the weight of evidence points towards a high probability that Bitcoin is set to climb higher, with targets of $120,000 and potentially $200,000 appearing increasingly plausible within the next year and a half. For anyone interested in the future of finance and digital assets, keeping a close watch on these key indicators is essential.

According to market data from Coingecko, AVAX, which had a fully diluted valuation of about $10.2 billion and a 24 hour average trading volume of around $610 million, dropped nearly 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $22.44 at the time of this writing. What Happened to Avalanche Fundamentals The Avalanche network has grown to a vibrant web3 ecosystem with more than $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) and nearly $2 billion in stablecoins market cap. The mainstream adoption of the Avalanche network by institutional investors has been bolstered by the notable development of its ecosystem’s tokenization technology. As a result, the Avalanche network has achieved more than 46k active daily on-chain users. Meanwhile, several fund managers – led by VamEck, and Grayscale Investments – are seeking to offer spot AVAX ETFs in the United States in the near future. AVAX Price Expectations In the weekly timeframe, AVAX price has been recovering from the 2022 crypto bear market. The utility-focuses altcoin has been forming a macro bullish continuation since March 2024, which is characterized by a falling symmetrical channel in the weekly timeframe. In the four hour timeframe, AVAX price has been forming a symmetric triangular pattern in the past four weeks. AVAX price has respected a rising logarithmic trend established since April 9, thus signaling a bullish continuation pattern. According to on-chain data , AVAX price has established a robust support level above $22.8, especially after 362k wallets accumulated more than 21.65 million AVAX coins. Consequently, a consistent close beyond the liquidity level above $25 will trigger a fresh rejuvenated rally toward the target range between $35 and $55.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 00:10:41

The Blockchain Builders Fund , a fund with strong ties to Stanford University, has successfully closed its oversubscribed Fund I, securing a substantial $28 million. This significant milestone marks a fresh wave of investment specifically targeting promising pre-seed and seed-stage blockchain startups. What is the Blockchain Builders Fund and Why Does it Matter? The closure of the Blockchain Builders Fund ‘s first fund at $28 million, exceeding its initial target, signals robust investor confidence in the future of blockchain technology and its applications. What makes this fund particularly noteworthy is its affiliation with Stanford, suggesting a potential pipeline of talent and research-backed insights informing its investment decisions. By focusing on the earliest stages of startup development – pre-seed and seed – the fund is positioning itself to support founders right from the ground floor. This is a critical phase where startups require not just capital, but often strategic guidance, network access, and operational support to transform innovative ideas into viable products and businesses. Fueling Innovation: How the Fund is Investing in Web3 Startups The fund hasn’t just been raising capital; it’s already actively deploying it. According to a press release via Chainwire, the Blockchain Builders Fund has already allocated over $16 million from Fund I across a diverse portfolio of 40 projects. This demonstrates a rapid pace of investment and a broad scope of interest within the web3 ecosystem. The investments span several key sectors poised to drive the next wave of web3 adoption and innovation: Artificial Intelligence (AI): Exploring the intersection of AI and blockchain, potentially funding projects focused on decentralized AI, AI-enhanced dApps, or blockchain infrastructure for AI. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Supporting the evolution of financial applications built on blockchain, from lending and borrowing protocols to decentralized exchanges and novel financial instruments. Infrastructure: Investing in foundational technologies that make web3 more scalable, secure, interoperable, and user-friendly, such as layer 2 solutions, developer tools, and data protocols. Real-World Assets (RWA): Backing projects that tokenize or bring tangible assets onto the blockchain, unlocking new possibilities for liquidity and ownership in areas like real estate, art, or commodities. This strategic allocation across varied, high-growth sectors highlights the fund’s vision for a multi-faceted web3 future, powered by innovative web3 startups . The State of Blockchain Funding : A Sign of Market Confidence? In a market cycle that has seen periods of cautious investment, the successful oversubscription and closure of a $28 million fund dedicated to early-stage web3 is a positive signal. It suggests that despite market volatility, there remains significant capital eager to back foundational technologies and disruptive business models within the blockchain space. The fact that the fund is already more than halfway deployed ($16M out of $28M) across 40 projects reinforces the narrative that promising opportunities exist and are being actively pursued by investors. This level of activity in blockchain funding at the early stage is often seen as a leading indicator for future growth and innovation in the ecosystem. Why Focus on Early-Stage Crypto ? The Potential and the Risks Investing in early-stage crypto startups comes with inherent risks. Many projects fail to gain traction, navigate regulatory hurdles, or achieve product-market fit. However, the potential rewards can be substantial. Early-stage investments offer the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of technologies and companies that could potentially reshape industries. For the Blockchain Builders Fund, focusing on this stage allows them to work closely with founders, helping to shape their strategies, build strong teams, and navigate the complex web3 landscape. It’s an investment in potential, betting on visionary teams building the infrastructure and applications for the decentralized future. Navigating the Future: The Role of Venture Capital Web3 With $16 million already deployed, the Blockchain Builders Fund still has over $12 million remaining in Fund I. The plan is to invest this remainder by the end of the year. This indicates a continued push to identify and support promising projects in the coming months. The role of venture capital web3 funds like this is crucial for the health and growth of the ecosystem. They provide the necessary capital for innovation, help translate complex technical ideas into marketable products, and connect startups with the resources they need to scale. Their investment decisions often highlight emerging trends and areas of perceived high potential within the market. Conclusion The closure of the Blockchain Builders Fund’s $28 million Fund I is a significant development, injecting vital capital into the early-stage web3 ecosystem. With investments already spread across key areas like AI, DeFi, infrastructure, and RWAs, the fund is actively backing the builders of the decentralized future. This move underscores continued confidence in the potential of blockchain technology and highlights the critical role of venture capital in nurturing the next generation of web3 innovation.

As the chief executive officer of one of the most talked-about ventures in digital assets — Twenty-One Capital Inc., Mallers aims to reshape corporate Bitcoin holdings and challenge Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds over 580,000 BTC, valued at approximately $64 billion. Jack Mallers aims for Saylor’s crown with billion-dollar Bitcoin bet Twenty-One is supported by the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald LP, stablecoin powerhouse Tether Holdings SA, and the Japanese investment firm SoftBank Group. The company is not simply following the ever-expanding list of businesses chasing after the opportunity to imitate Strategy , Michael Saylor’s software firm that has been transformed into a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin — it is trying to beat it. Twenty-One Capital, backed by notable entities including Tether and Cantor Fitzgerald, recently disclosed a $458 million Bitcoin acquisition. The firm plans to publish its Bitcoin addresses to verify its reserves, emphasizing transparency in its operations. In contrast, Michael Saylor’s Strategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, recently purchasing an additional 4,020 BTC, bringing its total holdings to over 580,000 BTC. Mallers envisions Twenty-One Capital acquiring up to 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply, approximately 1 million BTC, signaling a bold ambition to rival Saylor. Many people outside the crypto community have recognized Jack Mallers mostly for being emotional in 2021 when he announced that Bitcoin would become legal tender in El Salvador at the biggest conference in Miami. How Mallers ended up as the leader of Twenty One may be as interesting as Mallers’s story about turning El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele onto Bitcoin. Mallers narrates his journey to explore Bitcoin Mallers explained that his path to Twenty-One went through Tether Holdings SA CEO Paolo Ardoino, who has known Mallers since his early days in Bitcoin. Mallers began revealing his exploration of Bitcoin. He explained that he grew up in and around traditional finance and was first exposed to Bitcoin in 2013 when his father co-founded and sold a discount futures brokerage. Apart from his father, his stepmother is deep in the crypto world, known as BitcoinMom on X. Mallers dropped out of college and founded Zap Solutions Inc., Strike’s parent company, when he was 23. Mallers also revealed that Tether’s sister company, Bitfinex, was the first major exchange to implement the Lightning Network. He continued by saying that he was one of the most vocal early developers of the Lightning Network, referring to the Bitcoin payment protocol. “And so Paolo and I would talk, and that was à la 2017,” the CEO of Strike concluded. In the meantime, Tether was establishing a deeper relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald, the investment bank that US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick led before he was recruited to work as part of President Donald Trump’s executive staff. Cantor helps oversee Tether’s reserves and holds a convertible bond with the largest Stablecoin operator. Lutnick has helped transform Tether, a firm formerly eyed with suspicion by Washington, into an unlikely ally of the president. Due to Cantor’s ties with Trump, Mallers mentioned that Tether is the only link between him and the bank and Lutnick, whose son Brandon currently manages the company. He admitted that he did not know Brandon well, but he was his banker. Crypto investors prefer Mallers to Saylor as a perfect choice for Twenty-One Mallers and Tether crossed each other’s paths over the years, including overlapping in El Salvador, where Strike and Tether now have headquarters. When Mallers launched Strike in El Salvador in 2021, it became the most downloaded app in the country. Strike first relied on Tether’s USDT stablecoin as a substitute for the dollar, but it quickly dumped USDT in favor of partnerships with banks in El Salvador. In 2023, Strike started adding Tether again to its platform. However, it was not until the end of last year when the concept for Twenty- One began to take shape, Mallers said. Mallers remembers meeting Tether and their team in November at a Plan B Forum, a conference co-hosted by the Swiss city of Lugano and Tether. “We had a smart conversation about the direction of the world, their plans, and my plans,” Mallers said. For many people, Mallers is an appealing choice to lead Twenty-One because he is so frank about his defense of Bitcoin. Whereas Saylor frequently appears as a serious businessperson, Mallers comes across with the “crypto bro” appeal that is quite attractive to retail crypto investors. Additionally, Mallers, like many online influencers, is active on his YouTube channel, where he uploads videos and hosts a weekly podcast about Bitcoin and the financial systems called The Jack Mallers Show. Mark Palmer, a senior analyst for fintech and digital assets at Benchmark, also stated that although Michael Saylor’s role as a promoter of Strategy and Bitcoin had been incredibly helpful, Jack Mallers, who is a charming person and famous in the crypto world, is a great choice to promote both Twenty-One Capital and Bitcoin.

Co-sponsored by eight other members of Congress—five Republicans and three Democrats—the legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. The CLARITY Act establishes how the United States should treat cryptocurrencies and digital assets. For years, the crypto industry has thrived in a legal gray zone. The absence of clear rules has confused and stifled innovation . This bill is meant to change that. It is a follow-up to last year’s Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), but it further lays out oversight duties. Representative Dusty Johnson said that America was poised to lead the world in the digital assets market but emphasized that this could not happen without a clear regulatory framework. The bill is long and is expected to be the focus of extensive negotiations among the two parties and chambers. In the meantime, it is a strong step forward for crypto legislation in Congress. Key provisions target market oversight The Clarity Act assigns most of the responsibility for supervising crypto trading markets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill confers “exclusive regulatory jurisdiction” on the CFTC for digital commodity spot markets — the areas where commonly used assets such as Bitcoin trade. Meanwhile, the SEC will continue to oversee digital assets classified as securities —those you invest in with the expectation of profiting from the efforts of others. According to this structure, crypto firms would be free to register with the CFTC or the SEC, depending on the digital assets they work with. The bill tenures provisional registration for crypto firms to begin operating while agencies work out the regulations. It also requires platforms to follow anti-money laundering rules outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act. For example, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and wallet providers will be excluded from SEC oversight in some cases. The Clarity Act, if implemented, would allow regulators only 12 months to promulgate rules. That timeline is relatively short in the arcane realm of financial rule-making, which can frequently drag on for years. Congress sparks debate with Clarity Act introduction The Clarity Act comes at a moment of increasing political fascination with crypto and pressure to regulate. Whereas the stablecoin bill is considered further along the track, this latest attempt targets larger market structure issues. The measure is backed heavily by House Republicans, particularly those on the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees. But its future is uncertain. Democrats are divided. Some worry the bill is overly friendly to the crypto industry. Others worry about links between crypto firms and Donald Trump, who has recently re-emerged in the political world. Still, a handful of Democrats have backed clear crypto standards — particularly if they safeguard consumers. The crypto industry, beyond Congress, is paying close attention. The bill has won praise from the crypto advocacy group Stand with Crypto. They describe it as a “big step forward” when providing companies and developers the legal certainty they need to do business in the U.S. Some experts suspect the bill and stablecoin legislation could eventually be bundled into a single package. That would produce an even broader crypto law — possibly the first in the United States. President Trump has urged Congress to pass both bills by August, before the congressional recess. But inside sources say that’s a highly ambitious goal. There will be hearings on the new bill next week. Members of Congress will also have an opportunity to publicly debate what’s in it, amendments, and the way forward.

Get ready for some exciting news that bridges the gap between blockchain technology and everyday student life. Zebec Network (ZBCN), known for its innovative Solana-based payment solutions, has just made a significant move that could change how students manage their money across the United Kingdom. In a press release shared via Chainwire, Zebec announced its acquisition of Science Card, a prominent platform already serving over 50,000 students in top UK universities. This isn’t just another corporate deal; it’s a strategic play set to accelerate the adoption of crypto debit card UK services and revolutionize student finance crypto possibilities. Breaking Down the Big News: The Zebec Acquisition Let’s dive into the details of this pivotal Zebec acquisition . Zebec Network is building a name for itself with its real-time, continuous payment streams and on-chain payroll solutions. By acquiring Science Card, they’re not just buying a company; they’re gaining immediate access to a large, established user base within a key demographic – university students. Science Card has built a strong presence within the UK university ecosystem, providing card services tailored to students. Imagine having a payment platform already integrated into campus life, trusted by thousands. That’s the foundation Zebec is now building upon. This move significantly strengthens Zebec’s existing suite of card offerings, which includes payroll cards and general-purpose crypto debit cards. Why is this such a big deal? For Zebec, it’s about rapid expansion and user acquisition in a targeted market. For UK students, it opens the door to potentially more flexible, efficient, and innovative ways to handle their finances, powered by blockchain technology. Bringing the Crypto Debit Card UK Experience to Students One of the most tangible outcomes of this acquisition is the potential for widespread adoption of the crypto debit card UK market specifically among students. While crypto debit cards have been around, integrating them directly into a platform already used by tens of thousands of students removes significant barriers to entry. So, what exactly is a crypto debit card? Think of it like a regular debit card, but instead of drawing funds directly from a traditional bank account, it’s linked to your cryptocurrency holdings. When you make a purchase, the crypto is instantly converted to the local currency (in this case, GBP) at the point of sale. This allows users to spend their crypto like regular money anywhere cards are accepted. For UK students, this could mean: Easy Spending: Using crypto to pay for textbooks, groceries, rent, or a well-deserved coffee without needing to manually convert it beforehand. Global Access: Potentially easier international transactions or online purchases. Exploring Crypto: A practical, low-friction way for students to engage with their crypto holdings in their daily lives. By integrating their crypto debit card capabilities with the Science Card platform, Zebec is poised to make spending crypto as easy as swiping a regular student ID or bank card on campus and beyond. Leveraging the Science Card UK Platform The genius of this acquisition lies in the existing infrastructure and user base of Science Card UK . This isn’t Zebec starting from scratch to build a student network; they’re plugging into one that’s already established and trusted. Science Card has successfully navigated the complexities of partnering with UK universities and understanding the specific financial needs and habits of students. Their platform likely includes features relevant to student life, such as discounts, budgeting tools, or integration with university services. Zebec’s challenge and opportunity now is to seamlessly integrate their blockchain payment technology and crypto debit card functionality into the existing Science Card experience. This means maintaining the familiar aspects that students rely on while introducing the new benefits of blockchain. Consider these integration possibilities: Adding an option to link a crypto wallet to the Science Card account. Allowing users to top up their card balance using various cryptocurrencies supported by Zebec. Providing educational resources within the app about managing crypto and using the debit card. The existing relationship Science Card has with over 50,000 students across leading UK institutions provides Zebec with a direct channel to a tech-savvy demographic that is often open to exploring new financial technologies. The Broader Impact on Blockchain Payments UK While the immediate focus is on students, this Zebec acquisition also has wider implications for the landscape of blockchain payments UK . A successful integration and adoption within the university sector could serve as a powerful case study for bringing blockchain-based payment solutions to other demographics and industries in the UK. The UK has been a significant hub for fintech innovation, but the widespread adoption of crypto for everyday payments is still in its early stages. Initiatives like this, which target a specific, receptive market segment with a practical use case (spending), can help normalize and accelerate the use of blockchain technology for transactions. Key takeaways for the UK blockchain payment space: Increased Visibility: Putting crypto debit cards into the hands of tens of thousands of students raises awareness and understanding. Infrastructure Development: This push requires robust backend systems for conversions, compliance, and transaction processing within the UK’s regulatory framework. Setting Precedent: A successful model in the student sector could inspire similar initiatives in other consumer or business segments. Furthermore, Zebec’s foundation on the Solana network highlights the potential for fast, low-cost transactions, which are crucial for micro-payments and frequent spending typical of student life. This acquisition could showcase Solana’s capabilities for real-world payment applications in the UK market. What Does This Mean for Student Finance Crypto? Let’s get specific about the impact on student finance crypto . University life often involves managing budgets carefully, dealing with student loans, part-time work, and various expenses. Introducing a crypto element adds a new dimension. For students who already hold crypto, this provides an easy way to access the value of their digital assets without complex off-ramping processes. For those new to crypto, the integrated platform could serve as a gentle introduction, making it less intimidating to get started. Potential Benefits for Students: Benefit Explanation Convenience Spend crypto easily at millions of locations worldwide. Access to Funds Quickly use the value of crypto holdings for immediate needs. Potential Rewards Some crypto cards offer rewards in crypto or other benefits (details pending Zebec’s integration). Financial Education Opportunity to learn about digital assets and blockchain in a practical way. Potential Challenges Students Should Be Aware Of: Price Volatility: The value of crypto can change rapidly, impacting the spending power of funds held. Regulatory Clarity: The UK’s stance on crypto regulation is evolving, which could affect services. Tax Implications: Spending crypto may have tax consequences depending on individual circumstances and local laws. Understanding Fees: Be aware of any conversion fees, transaction fees, or card maintenance fees. Actionable Insights for Students: If you’re a student at a UK university served by Science Card, keep an eye out for announcements from Zebec and Science Card regarding the integration. Understand how the new features work, research the cryptocurrencies supported, and start small if you’re new to spending crypto. Always prioritize understanding the risks involved, especially regarding volatility. Looking Ahead: The Future of Zebec and UK Student Finance The Zebec acquisition of Science Card is a bold step that positions Zebec to become a key player in the crypto debit card UK market, leveraging an established student network. It highlights the growing trend of blockchain companies seeking real-world use cases and direct consumer adoption. The success of this integration will depend on several factors, including the seamlessness of the technology, the clarity of communication to students, and adapting to the UK’s specific financial and regulatory environment. If successful, it could pave the way for further innovation in student finance crypto and significantly contribute to the broader adoption of blockchain payments UK . This isn’t just about payments; it’s about potentially empowering a new generation with tools to interact with digital assets in a practical, everyday context.

Meta AI, the AI assistant integrated across Meta’s suite of applications, has reached a remarkable benchmark, signaling widespread adoption and Meta’s aggressive push into the AI space. For those following the intersection of technology and digital platforms, this milestone is particularly noteworthy. Rapid Growth in Meta AI Users During the company’s annual shareholder meeting, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta AI now boasts one billion monthly active users. This figure represents a doubling of its user base in a relatively short period, up from 500 million monthly active users reported in September 2024. This rapid growth underscores the increasing consumer interaction with AI features embedded within popular social platforms. The integration of Meta AI across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger has clearly contributed to its swift ascent in user numbers. Making the AI assistant readily available where people already spend their time has removed significant barriers to adoption. What’s Next for Meta AI? Looking ahead, Mark Zuckerberg outlined Meta’s strategic focus for the AI assistant. The primary goal for this year is to enhance the user experience and position Meta AI as a leading personal AI assistant. Key areas of development include: Personalization: Making the AI more tailored to individual user needs and preferences. Voice Conversations: Improving the capability for natural and effective voice interactions. Entertainment: Expanding its use cases within entertainment contexts across Meta’s apps. This focus on deepening the experience suggests Meta is moving beyond basic AI interactions towards creating a more integral and valuable tool for its massive user base. Meta AI Milestone: Paving the Way for Monetization? With a user base of this scale, the question of monetization naturally arises. Zuckerberg indicated that the plan is to first build out the AI assistant’s capabilities and user engagement before focusing on generating revenue. However, he did mention potential future avenues for monetization as the assistant evolves: Inserting paid recommendations within interactions. Launching a subscription service for users seeking access to more compute power or premium features. Should Meta pursue a subscription model, it would enter into direct competition with established players like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which already offers paid tiers for enhanced access and capabilities. This move could reshape the landscape for consumer-facing AI services. The Role of the Standalone AI Assistant App Adding to Meta’s AI momentum, the company launched a standalone Meta AI app just a month prior to this announcement. While the primary driver of the billion users is likely the integration within existing apps, the dedicated app provides a focused environment for users who wish to interact with the AI outside of their social feeds. It also serves as a platform for Meta to test and roll out new AI features more directly. The rapid accumulation of Meta AI users demonstrates the tech giant’s commitment to making AI a core part of its ecosystem and future business model. As the AI assistant continues to evolve, its potential impact on how people interact with technology and digital content will be significant.

One of the most anticipated events in the crypto space is just around the corner. The Circle IPO is officially on the calendar, signaling a significant step for the stablecoin giant and the broader digital asset market. When is the Circle IPO Happening? According to recent reports, stablecoin issuer Circle is targeting the week of June 2nd for its initial public offering. This timeline suggests that the company has finalized key details, including the pricing structure and the official schedule for the launch. This move comes after previous attempts and market explorations, indicating Circle’s readiness to go public amidst improving market sentiment. BlackRock Circle: What’s the Interest? Adding another layer of intrigue to the offering is the reported interest from financial titan BlackRock. The world’s largest asset manager has shown interest in potentially acquiring a 10% stake in Circle. This isn’t the first time BlackRock and Circle have collaborated; BlackRock is a reserve manager for Circle’s USDC stablecoin, holding a portion of its reserves in BlackRock-managed money market funds. This existing relationship makes BlackRock’s potential investment in the public offering a notable development. Is a Pre-IPO BlackRock Deal Likely? While BlackRock’s interest is significant, securing a major pre-IPO deal at this late stage seems unlikely. According to Jay Woods, a strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, such substantial investment agreements are typically finalized much earlier in the IPO process. This suggests that if BlackRock were to acquire a stake, it would likely happen as part of the public offering itself rather than a separate, private transaction beforehand. Why is the Circle Stock Generating Buzz? The potential launch of Circle Stock is generating considerable buzz for several reasons: Improving Market Conditions: The broader financial markets, including tech and crypto-related sectors, have seen more favorable conditions recently, creating a better environment for new public offerings. Strong Demand: There appears to be robust interest from both retail and institutional investors. Reports suggest that major players like ARK Invest are considering a substantial purchase, potentially up to $150 million, signaling confidence in Circle’s business model and future prospects. Leading Stablecoin Position: Circle is the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Its central role in the digital economy and decentralized finance (DeFi) makes it a compelling investment opportunity for those looking for exposure to the crypto space through a regulated entity. What Does This Stablecoin IPO Mean for Crypto? Circle’s move to become a publicly traded company marks a significant milestone for the entire digital asset industry. As a major Stablecoin IPO , it provides traditional investors with direct exposure to a core piece of the crypto infrastructure through a regulated, transparent corporate structure. This could pave the way for more crypto-native companies to follow suit, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital economy. The Bigger Picture: Crypto IPOs on the Horizon? The successful launch of the Crypto IPO by Circle could serve as a crucial test case and a catalyst for other cryptocurrency companies considering going public. It demonstrates that investors are willing to back established, revenue-generating businesses within the crypto ecosystem. This trend could lead to increased transparency and regulatory clarity for the industry as more companies adopt the reporting standards required of public entities. Conclusion Circle’s planned IPO in early June, coupled with strong institutional interest from firms like BlackRock and ARK, highlights growing confidence in the stablecoin issuer and the broader crypto market. While a pre-IPO deal with BlackRock seems improbable at this stage, the overall market reception is expected to be positive. This public offering is not just about Circle; it represents a maturing moment for the crypto industry, offering traditional investors a new avenue to participate in the digital asset revolution.

The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to political debate, but recent developments in the UK are particularly noteworthy. Nigel Farage, the prominent leader of the Reform Party, has unveiled ambitious plans that could fundamentally alter the landscape of UK crypto regulation if his party secures victory in the upcoming general election. This isn’t just minor tinkering; Farage is proposing a bill designed to propel the UK into becoming a global ‘crypto powerhouse’, a vision that surprisingly echoes the stance taken by former US President Donald Trump. What is the Core of the Proposed UK Crypto Bill? At the heart of Nigel Farage’s pitch to the nation’s crypto enthusiasts lies a specific legislative proposal – a dedicated UK crypto bill . This bill isn’t a vague promise; it outlines concrete steps intended to foster growth and adoption within the digital asset space. According to reports, the key pillars of this proposed legislation are designed to make the UK a significantly more attractive jurisdiction for crypto investors and businesses alike. Let’s break down the main components: Reduced Capital Gains Tax: One of the most significant proposals is the intention to slash the capital gains tax rate on crypto investments down to a flat 10%. This is a dramatic reduction from current rates, which can be as high as 20% for higher-rate taxpayers, and is seen as a direct incentive to encourage investment and trading activity within the UK. Regulatory Sandbox for Innovation: The bill aims to establish a dedicated regulatory sandbox specifically for crypto innovation. This provides a controlled environment where businesses can test new technologies, products, and services without facing the full burden of existing regulations initially. It’s designed to encourage experimentation and growth in a safe manner, allowing regulators and innovators to work together. Ensuring the Right to Use Crypto for Payments: A foundational element of broader crypto adoption is its utility in everyday transactions. The proposed bill seeks to explicitly protect and ensure the right for individuals and businesses to use cryptocurrency for payments. This move could pave the way for greater integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. These proposals collectively signal a potential shift from a cautious, sometimes perceived as restrictive, regulatory approach to one that is actively seeking to attract crypto talent and capital. Understanding Nigel Farage’s Crypto Stance For many, linking Nigel Farage crypto policy might seem unexpected. Known primarily for his euroscepticism and populist politics, his foray into the specifics of digital asset regulation highlights the growing importance of crypto as a political issue. Farage’s messaging positions this move as part of a broader strategy to modernize the UK economy, cut red tape, and attract industries of the future. His engagement with the crypto topic isn’t just about economic policy; it’s also a clear attempt to connect with a specific demographic. The cryptocurrency community, particularly younger individuals, often expresses frustration with traditional financial systems and regulatory hurdles. By proposing policies that are seen as pro-crypto, Farage and the Reform Party are directly appealing to this segment of the electorate. This political manoeuvre is proving to be potentially effective. Recent polls and reports indicate that the Reform Party has seen a notable surge in support, particularly among younger voters aged 18-34. While it’s difficult to attribute this rise solely to their crypto stance, it undoubtedly plays a role in differentiating them from more established parties and signalling an openness to new technologies that resonate with this demographic. The Reform Party Crypto Policy: Mirroring Trump’s Approach? One of the most intriguing aspects of Farage’s proposal is the explicit comparison being drawn to Donald Trump’s recent pivot towards a more crypto-friendly position in the United States. Trump, who previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, has increasingly embraced digital assets, holding crypto and making public statements supportive of the industry, often contrasting his view with that of the Biden administration. The parallels between the two leaders’ approaches are striking: Aspect Nigel Farage (UK) Donald Trump (US) Overall Goal Make UK a “crypto powerhouse” Support crypto industry, prevent hostile regulation Key Proposals (Farage) / Stance (Trump) Lower Capital Gains Tax, Regulatory Sandbox, Right to Payments Preventing Fed CBDC, Accepting Crypto Donations, General Pro-Crypto Rhetoric Target Demographic Younger, tech-savvy voters Younger, tech-savvy voters, crypto community Political Strategy Differentiate from opponents, attract future industries Differentiate from opponents, appeal to a growing voter bloc Public Persona Populist, anti-establishment Populist, anti-establishment This mirroring suggests a potential emerging trend in populist politics globally: recognizing the growing economic and political significance of the crypto space and actively courting its participants. Both leaders, known for their anti-establishment appeal, seem to understand that the crypto community often views excessive regulation and traditional financial structures with suspicion. By positioning themselves as champions of crypto, they tap into this sentiment. What Does This Mean for Crypto Tax UK? Let’s delve deeper into the potential impact on crypto tax UK . The current system can be complex, with capital gains tax applied to profits from selling, trading, or gifting crypto. The rate depends on an individual’s overall income and whether they are a basic or higher-rate taxpayer, ranging from 10% to 20% (on gains above the annual allowance). For businesses, crypto is generally subject to Corporation Tax. Farage’s proposal for a flat 10% capital gains tax rate on crypto is a significant departure. This would make the UK’s crypto tax regime potentially one of the most competitive among major economies. The argument for this reduction is multi-faceted: Stimulate Investment: A lower tax burden incentivizes investors to enter the market and trade more actively, potentially increasing liquidity and market size. Attract Capital: Lower taxes can make the UK a more attractive destination for international crypto investors and funds. Simplify Compliance: While not explicitly stated how it would be simplified beyond the rate, a flat rate could potentially simplify calculations for some investors. Increase Tax Revenue (Potentially): The Laffer Curve principle suggests that sometimes lowering tax rates can lead to increased overall tax revenue due to stimulated economic activity. Proponents of the 10% rate would argue this could be the case for crypto. However, critics might raise concerns about fairness (is it equitable to tax crypto gains lower than other asset classes?) and the potential impact on government revenue in the short term. Nevertheless, for crypto investors in the UK, this specific proposal is likely the most immediately impactful part of the potential bill. Challenges and Opportunities for UK Crypto Regulation Implementing a comprehensive UK crypto regulation framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and preventing illicit activity is a delicate balancing act. Farage’s proposed bill presents both significant opportunities and considerable challenges. Opportunities: Becoming a Global Leader: A clear, favorable regulatory environment could position the UK as a preferred location for crypto businesses, startups, and talent, competing with jurisdictions like Switzerland, Singapore, or parts of the US. Fostering Innovation: The regulatory sandbox, in particular, offers a structured way to allow new ideas to flourish without being stifled by outdated rules. Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector can contribute to job creation, investment, and overall economic output. Increased Adoption: Making it easier and more appealing to hold and use crypto could accelerate mainstream adoption among the UK population. Challenges: Defining ‘Crypto’: Regulation needs clear definitions. What specific digital assets would fall under this bill? How would it handle rapidly evolving areas like DeFi, NFTs, or stablecoins? Consumer Protection: While encouraging innovation is key, ensuring adequate protection for retail investors from scams, fraud, and market volatility remains paramount. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system requires robust AML/CTF measures, which can be complex with decentralized technologies. Balancing with Traditional Finance: How would this new framework interact with existing financial regulations and institutions? Would it create an uneven playing field? Political Opposition: Any new bill, especially one touching on complex and sometimes controversial areas like crypto, will face scrutiny and potential opposition from other political parties and stakeholders. The success of such a bill would heavily depend on the details of its implementation and the ability of regulators to adapt to the fast pace of technological change in the crypto space. Can the UK Truly Become a Crypto Powerhouse? Nigel Farage’s ambition is clear: to make the UK a dominant force in the global crypto economy. The proposals within the potential UK crypto bill , particularly the tax reduction and regulatory sandbox, are certainly steps that align with this goal. Countries that have adopted favorable regulatory environments have seen significant growth in their crypto sectors. However, achieving ‘powerhouse’ status requires more than just a favorable bill. It necessitates: Talent Pool: Ensuring a skilled workforce in blockchain technology, cybersecurity, and finance. Infrastructure: Reliable digital infrastructure and connectivity. Banking Relationships: Crypto businesses often struggle with obtaining banking services; supportive traditional finance is crucial. Global Reputation: Building trust and a reputation for regulatory clarity and stability on the international stage. While the proposed bill lays a foundation, becoming a ‘powerhouse’ is a long-term project requiring sustained effort and a holistic approach across various sectors. The Road Ahead for Reform Party Crypto Policy The future of the Reform Party crypto policy hinges significantly on the outcome of the next UK general election. If the party gains substantial influence or forms part of a government, these proposals could move from aspiration to legislation. The rising support for Reform, particularly among demographics interested in crypto, gives these proposals a degree of political weight they might not have had previously. It will be crucial to watch how other political parties react to these proposals. Will they ignore them, criticize them, or perhaps adopt similar, albeit modified, stances to appeal to the same voters? The conversation around crypto regulation in the UK is clearly evolving, pushed forward by these explicit political commitments. For anyone involved in the UK crypto space, understanding the nuances of these proposals and the political forces behind them is essential. It could signal a fundamental shift in how digital assets are treated in the country, impacting everything from investment strategies to business operations. Summary: Nigel Farage and the Reform Party have put forward a bold vision for the UK’s future in the digital asset space, proposing a dedicated UK crypto bill aimed at creating a ‘crypto powerhouse’. Key elements include a significant reduction in crypto tax UK capital gains to 10%, the establishment of a regulatory sandbox, and ensuring the right to use crypto for payments. This approach mirrors recent moves by Donald Trump in the US, highlighting a potential global trend among populist leaders to appeal to the growing crypto community. While the proposals offer clear benefits for fostering innovation and attracting investment, they also present challenges related to implementation, consumer protection, and integration with existing financial systems.

Recently, attention has been drawn to a prominent Hyperliquid whale trader, identified as James Wynn, who is reportedly facing a substantial unrealized loss on a large Bitcoin position. What Happened to the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bitcoin Long? According to data shared by HypurrScan and cited by JinSe Finance, James Wynn, known for his significant trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform, holds a substantial Bitcoin long position. This position, however, is currently underwater, facing an unrealized loss estimated at a staggering $5.4 million. The details surrounding this specific trade highlight the inherent risks associated with high leverage: Trader: James Wynn (a known Hyperliquid whale) Platform: Hyperliquid Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) Position Type: Long (betting on price increase) Leverage: 40x Current Situation: Facing an unrealized loss of approximately $5.4 million An ‘unrealized loss’ means the position is currently losing money based on the market price, but the loss isn’t locked in unless the position is closed or, critically, liquidated. Understanding Leveraged Trading and Liquidation Price This situation brings the concepts of leveraged trading and the liquidation price into sharp focus. Leveraged trading allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. In this case, 40x leverage means James Wynn is trading a Bitcoin position 40 times larger than the initial margin (collateral) he put down. While leverage can significantly amplify profits if the market moves favorably, it equally magnifies losses when the market moves against the position. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out the initial margin. This is where the liquidation price becomes critical. The liquidation price is the specific market price at which a leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent the trader’s losses from exceeding their margin. For James Wynn’s 40x Bitcoin long, the reported liquidation price is set at $106,340. This means if the price of Bitcoin were to drop to this level, Hyperliquid would automatically close his position, realizing the full loss and potentially more, depending on market conditions during liquidation. For a 40x long position, a relatively small percentage drop in the price of Bitcoin can lead to liquidation. Conversely, a 40x short position would face liquidation if the price rose significantly. Why Do Traders Use Such High Leverage? Given the immense risk, one might wonder why traders, especially large ones like a Hyperliquid whale , would use such high leverage like 40x. The primary reason is the potential for outsized returns. Consider this: Without leverage, a 1% increase in Bitcoin price yields a 1% profit on the invested capital. With 40x leverage, a mere 0.25% increase in Bitcoin price could theoretically yield a 10% profit on the initial margin (0.25% * 40 = 10%). This potential to generate significant profits from small price movements attracts aggressive traders. However, the flip side is equally true: a small adverse price movement can lead to rapid and substantial losses, including the loss of the entire initial margin upon reaching the liquidation price . The Implications of a Large Crypto Loss A potential crypto loss of $5.4 million is significant, even for a whale trader. While whales often have deep pockets and can withstand large losses, an event like this highlights the extreme volatility and risk present in the crypto markets, particularly on perpetual futures platforms like Hyperliquid. For the individual trader, reaching the liquidation price means their entire margin for that position is gone. For the platform and other traders, a large liquidation can sometimes add selling pressure to the market, although sophisticated platforms like Hyperliquid have mechanisms designed to minimize market impact. This situation serves as a stark reminder: High leverage is a double-edged sword. Market conditions can change rapidly, turning profitable positions into losing ones quickly. Liquidation is a real and present danger in leveraged trading. Lessons for Traders from This Hyperliquid Whale Situation While the scale of a Hyperliquid whale ‘s position is far beyond that of most retail traders, the principles and risks remain the same. This event offers valuable lessons: Understand Leverage: Never use leverage you don’t fully comprehend. Know the exact price point where your position will be liquidated. Risk Management is Key: Always trade with a stop-loss order to limit potential losses before the liquidation price is reached. Only risk a small percentage of your total trading capital on any single trade. Start Small: If you’re new to leveraged trading, begin with very low leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) to understand the dynamics before considering higher amounts. Volatility Matters: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets. High leverage combined with high volatility dramatically increases the risk of rapid liquidation. Don’t Blindly Follow Whales: While tracking large traders can offer insights, their risk tolerance and capital reserves are vastly different from yours. A loss they can absorb could be catastrophic for a smaller trader. The potential crypto loss faced by James Wynn underscores that even experienced, large-scale traders are not immune to the inherent risks of the market and the amplified dangers of high leverage. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale of High Stakes Bitcoin Longs The situation involving the Hyperliquid whale James Wynn and his substantial unrealized loss on a 40x Bitcoin long serves as a powerful cautionary tale. It vividly illustrates the immense potential rewards and, more importantly, the catastrophic risks associated with high-stakes leveraged trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market. With a reported liquidation price of $106,340 looming, the outcome of this specific position remains uncertain. However, the event itself provides a crucial reminder for all traders: understand your tools, manage your risk diligently, and be acutely aware of the price points that could lead to a significant crypto loss . In the world of high leverage, the margin for error is incredibly thin. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

A recent development that has captured attention is the latest funding round for Twenty One , a prominent Bitcoin treasury firm. The company has successfully raised an additional $100 million, pushing its total capital raised to an impressive $685 million. This news comes as the firm makes significant strides towards a major SPAC merger , signaling growing confidence in the institutional adoption of digital assets and highlighting the potential for substantial Cryptocurrency Investment in structured financial products. Twenty One’s Funding Milestone: Reaching $685 Million The additional $100 million was secured through convertible senior secured notes. This type of financing allows investors to potentially convert their debt into equity at a later date, often under specific conditions. According to CoinDesk, this recent infusion of capital stems from existing investors and sponsors exercising options that were part of an earlier fundraising round in April. Key details of the financing include: Amount Raised: An additional $100 million. Financing Instrument: Convertible senior secured notes. Total Capital: Brings Twenty One’s total capital raised to $685 million. Source: Existing investors and sponsors exercising April options. Note Terms: 1% coupon rate, due in 2030. This substantial fundraising underscores strong investor belief in Twenty One’s strategy and future prospects, particularly as a leading Digital Asset Firm focused on treasury management involving Bitcoin . Navigating the Path to Public Markets: The SPAC Merger with CEP Beyond the funding news, Twenty One is actively progressing towards a merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners (CEP). The chosen route for this significant corporate event is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger structure. What is a SPAC merger? A SPAC, often called a “blank check company,” is a firm with no commercial operations that is formed solely to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company. For a private company like Twenty One, merging with a listed SPAC offers an alternative path to becoming a publicly traded entity compared to a traditional IPO. The strategic rationale behind this SPAC merger with a reputable financial institution like CEP is clear. It provides Twenty One with: Public Listing: Access to public capital markets. Enhanced Credibility: Association with a long-standing financial player like Cantor Equity Partners. Increased Visibility: Greater exposure to institutional and retail investors. This move is a significant step for a Digital Asset Firm seeking mainstream financial integration. Twenty One’s Strategy: A Focus on Bitcoin and Treasury Management Twenty One positions itself as a Bitcoin treasury firm. This implies a focus on holding and managing significant amounts of Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, potentially similar to other public companies that have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Led by Brandon Lutnick, the firm’s actions suggest a strong conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. This is further evidenced by their disclosed $458 million Bitcoin acquisition earlier this month. Such substantial acquisitions by institutional players are closely watched indicators of increasing institutional confidence and can influence overall sentiment around Cryptocurrency Investment . What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investment and the Market? The developments surrounding Twenty One , its significant fundraising, and its impending SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners carry broader implications for the digital asset landscape and Cryptocurrency Investment : Institutional Validation: Large fundraising rounds and mergers involving established financial names signal growing institutional acceptance and integration of digital assets. M&A Trend: This highlights a potential trend of mergers and acquisitions as digital asset firms seek scale, regulatory clarity, and access to traditional financial markets. Maturation of the Space: The use of sophisticated financial instruments like convertible notes and structures like SPACs indicates the increasing maturity of the digital asset industry. Focus on Bitcoin: Twenty One’s clear focus on Bitcoin treasury management reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a potential corporate reserve asset. For investors interested in the institutional side of crypto, Twenty One’s journey provides a compelling case study of how a Digital Asset Firm is navigating growth and seeking integration with traditional finance. Conclusion Twenty One’s successful raising of an additional $100 million, bringing its total capital to $685 million, is a significant financial milestone. Coupled with the active progress towards a SPAC merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners, these events underscore the firm’s ambitious growth trajectory and the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world. As a dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm, Twenty One’s strategic moves, including its recent substantial Bitcoin acquisition, reflect a strong commitment to digital assets. This progression is a positive indicator for the broader landscape of institutional Cryptocurrency Investment and the continued evolution of the Digital Asset Firm ecosystem.

When it comes to digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, the lack of a defined legal framework has been a significant hurdle for many businesses looking to integrate this technology. However, recent comments from a major player in the traditional finance space suggest that progress on this front could be a game-changer. The prospect of a US stablecoin bill is being viewed with optimism by industry leaders. Why Does the MoneyGram CEO See This as a ‘Huge Unlock’? Anthony Soohoo, the CEO of MoneyGram, a long-standing global leader in cross-border peer-to-peer payments, recently shared his perspective on the potential impact of forthcoming stablecoin regulation in the U.S. According to reports from financial news aggregators, Soohoo described the passage of such legislation as a “huge unlock” from a business standpoint. But what exactly does this mean, and why is a company like MoneyGram so interested in stablecoins? For MoneyGram, a business deeply entrenched in facilitating the movement of money across borders, stablecoins represent a potential evolution of their core services. Here’s a breakdown of why clear rules around stablecoins could be so impactful: Faster Settlements: Traditional cross-border payments can involve multiple intermediaries and take days to settle. Stablecoins, built on blockchain technology, offer the potential for near-instantaneous settlement, drastically reducing transaction times. Lower Costs: Reducing the number of intermediaries and streamlining the settlement process can lead to significant cost savings, both for the business and the end consumer sending or receiving money. Expanded Reach: Stablecoins could potentially open up new corridors and markets where traditional banking infrastructure is less accessible or more expensive. Innovation in Financial Products: Regulatory clarity allows companies to build new services and products on top of stablecoin rails, fostering innovation in payments, remittances, and potentially other financial services. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: The current ambiguous regulatory landscape creates risk and hinders investment. A clear US stablecoin bill would provide the necessary legal certainty for businesses to confidently invest in and deploy stablecoin-based solutions at scale. Soohoo’s comments underscore the growing recognition among established financial institutions that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, are not just a fringe technology but a powerful tool that can enhance existing business models and create new opportunities, provided the regulatory environment is conducive. What Could Stablecoin Legislation Entail? While the specifics of any potential US stablecoin bill are still being debated in Congress, discussions generally revolve around key areas aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring stability and consumer protection. Potential elements of such legislation could include: Issuance Standards: Requirements for stablecoin issuers regarding reserves (what assets back the stablecoin), transparency, and auditing. This is crucial for ensuring that a stablecoin maintains its peg to the underlying asset (like the US dollar). Licensing and Supervision: Establishing which regulatory bodies (e.g., banking regulators, SEC, CFTC) would oversee stablecoin issuers and potentially other entities involved in stablecoin activities. Consumer Protection: Rules designed to protect users from fraud, ensure clear disclosure of risks, and provide recourse in case of issues. Interoperability: Potentially addressing how different stablecoins and traditional financial systems can interact seamlessly. Passing comprehensive crypto regulation, specifically for stablecoins, is seen by proponents as essential for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in financial innovation. Without clear rules, businesses might hesitate to build and operate stablecoin services within the U.S., potentially pushing this activity to other jurisdictions. The Broader Impact of a US Stablecoin Bill The enthusiasm expressed by the MoneyGram CEO highlights a significant shift. It indicates that major players in traditional finance are not only observing the digital asset space but are actively anticipating and advocating for regulatory clarity to leverage this technology. A well-crafted US stablecoin bill could have ripple effects beyond just payments and remittances: Increased Institutional Adoption: Regulatory certainty is a major factor for larger financial institutions considering entering the digital asset space. Clear rules for stablecoins could pave the way for broader adoption across various financial sectors. Enhanced Dollar Dominance: By providing a clear framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins, the U.S. could strengthen the international role of the dollar in the digital age. Foundation for Future Innovation: Stablecoins are often seen as a foundational element for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based applications. Regulation could provide a stable base for these sectors to grow responsibly. While challenges remain, including finding the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks, the potential benefits articulated by leaders like MoneyGram’s CEO underscore the importance of legislative action. The passage of a thoughtful US stablecoin bill is widely anticipated as a crucial step towards integrating digital assets more fully into the mainstream economy. Conclusion: A Path to Growth Through Clarity Anthony Soohoo’s characterization of a US stablecoin bill as a “huge unlock” for business is a powerful endorsement from a company that understands the complexities of moving money globally. His comments reflect a growing sentiment within the financial industry that clear, effective stablecoin legislation is not just about regulating a new technology, but about enabling significant business efficiencies, cost reductions, and opportunities for innovation. As discussions continue in Washington, the business world, from established giants like MoneyGram to agile fintech startups, will be watching closely, hopeful that regulatory clarity will indeed unlock the full potential of stablecoins and other digital assets in the United States.

Judson Althoff, a Chief commercial officer of Microsoft, told workers that the British Universal bank signed on to buy 100,000 licenses of Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant, marking a significant deal. At the standard list price of $30 per user per month, this deal could generate approximately $36 million in annual revenue for the tech firm, though large clients typically receive bulk discounts. Microsoft has embedded Copilot, its flagship AI offering, across its products. During the firm’s third-quarter earnings call on April 30, CEO Satya Nadella listed an array of Copilot-infused applications and strong adoptions. According to Nadella, the tech firm is previewing a first-of-its-kind software engineering agent capable of asynchronously handling developer tasks. He noted that GitHub Copilot now has over 15 million users, a more than fourfold increase year-over-year, with adoption by both digital-native firms like Twilio and large enterprises including Cisco, HPE, Skyscanner, and Target, all leveraging the tool to embed AI across the entire software development lifecycle. Microsoft reveals its main focus of increasing Copilot adoption The people who wished to remain anonymous as the deal was privately revealed that Althoff said several dozen clients — such as Accenture Plc, Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG, and Siemens AG — now have more than 100,000 Copilot users. Microsoft is concentrating on getting Copilot adopted and is closely monitoring how much of the customer workforce is using the tools, Satya Narayana Nadella, a chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft, said during a company-wide town hall event. Following its close partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and as such, it is inserting Copilot into its suite of productivity apps. The world’s largest software maker is seen as a leader in commercializing AI products. Microsoft said in January that its AI suite, which includes cloud infrastructure and AI applications, was on track to achieve at least $13 billion in annual revenue. Despite all these progresses, Wall Street is still eager to see proof that the multibillion-dollar bet is working. Corporate clients describe Copilot as a measured rollout and a series of trials Many anecdotes have emerged on corporate customers adopting Copilot, but Microsoft has not shared a total customer count or the financial impact of those sales. Other corporate clients have said the tools need a lot of internal tweaks and employee training. Moreover, many say their use of Copilot is best described not as a race to equip all of their employees with the expensive software as quickly as possible but as a measured rollout plus a series of trials. Weeks after disclosing plans to lay off 6,000 workers — nearly 3% of the workforce — Microsoft also has reason to rally the troops. In the meeting, Nadella addressed the cuts and explained that they were driven by organizational changes rather than employee performance. The layoffs were concentrated on the people who build the company’s products, suggesting that even engineering jobs are not immune to the age of artificial intelligence. Microsoft declined to comment on the matter. Representatives from Barclays, Accenture, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Siemens also did not provide a statement.

Bitcoin $90,000 Dream Is A “Fairy Tale” “To make it clear,” the analyst wrote, “the idea to casually dip to 90K and resume the daily uptrend sounds like a fairy tale to me.” According to Dr. Cat, such a move would require Bitcoin to breach no fewer than four critical support levels on higher timeframes, which he considers “so unrealistic that… [it] may come only in the dreams of someone sidelined waiting for these prices.” Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Instead, Dr. Cat identifies a narrow window of “imbalances” across the daily, 2-day, and 3-day Ichimoku indicators—most notably between $102,600 and $106,300—that remain untapped. “These are pending a touch,” he noted, pointing to the Kijun Sen and Tenkan Sen levels as crucial balance markers. The weekly Chikou Span (lagging span), a key indicator in Ichimoku theory, currently sits above prior candle closes—a historically bullish condition that suggests Bitcoin is still in a strong uptrend unless it closes below those support levels. Dr. Cat charted these historical supports using the 26-period look-back rule: approximately $103.600 for this week, rising to $108.300 by mid-June before dipping toward $99,000 by late June. “If CS has managed to keep above candles so well until now on the steepest past slope, it’s very unlikely to go below them,” he emphasized. However, the bullish case comes with a short fuse. A pivotal technical event—the bullish TK cross on the weekly chart—is expected on June 9. “But if [it’s] below ATH, it will be fake as Kijun Sen will be flat,” he warned. In plain terms: unless Bitcoin prints a new all-time high shortly after the TK cross, the signal will be invalidated. On the other hand, a new ATH post-cross would confirm what Dr. Cat calls a “super clear and bullish signal: very, very unlikely not to be followed immediately by a strong bullish continuation.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock Notably, he flags a divergence between BTCUSD and BTCEUR, the latter of which is already showing the Chikou Span dipping into candle territory, a neutral-to-bearish signal. “BTCEUR… looks significantly worse than BTCUSD,” he observed. “This chart is simply neutral and can go either way: much higher than here, or as low as ~70K EUR.” He attributes some of the current BTCUSD bullishness to USD weakness, adding that mid-June will likely clarify whether this price strength is structurally sound or artificially inflated. Zooming out to the monthly chart, Dr. Cat unveiled his most aggressive forecast yet: $270,000 per BTC, based on Ichimoku Price Theory’s “4E model.” While he acknowledged this as a “wild guess,” he argued that the crypto market tends to defy consensus expectations. “Plenty of people seem to be skeptical of this bull run,” he said. “And even if they expect it to continue, they bet mostly on shy/moderate targets. My bet is on the latter [being surpassed].” The next two to three weeks will be decisive. A failure to break all-time highs in June—combined with Chikou Span weakness or daily trend breakdowns—could signal a prolonged cool-off into Q4. Until then, all eyes are on the weekly TK cross and the market’s reaction. At press time, BTC traded at $108,783.

Veteran gold advocate and renowned Bitcoin skeptic, Peter Schiff, recently stirred the pot by attending the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. His presence alone was noteworthy, but it was his outspoken commentary that truly grabbed headlines, reigniting the fiery Peter Schiff Bitcoin debate. Schiff didn’t hold back, leveling sharp criticisms against the leading cryptocurrency and firmly reiterating his long-held belief that only gold holds the status of a true reserve asset. What Exactly Did Peter Schiff Claim About Bitcoin? Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, used the platform not to praise Bitcoin, but to dismantle its perceived value and purpose. His core arguments, as stated during or around the conference, were pointed and direct: No Intrinsic Value: Schiff asserted that Bitcoin is an asset devoid of intrinsic value. Unlike commodities or productive assets, he argues, Bitcoin doesn’t inherently produce anything or have a physical use case beyond speculation. This lack of inherent worth, in his view, means it cannot create real wealth in the traditional sense. A ‘Giant Cult’: Perhaps his most provocative claim was labeling the Bitcoin community a “giant cult.” This suggests a group bound by fervent, perhaps irrational, belief rather than fundamental value or logic. Not a Technological Innovation: Countering a common narrative, Schiff dismissed Bitcoin as a significant technological breakthrough, instead comparing its structure and market dynamics to that of a meme coin – assets often driven purely by hype and community sentiment rather than underlying technology or utility. Gold is the ONLY True Reserve Asset: Schiff doubled down on his stance that gold is the unparalleled store of value and the sole true reserve asset. He cited the continued purchasing of gold by central banks globally as evidence supporting this claim, contrasting it sharply with their lack of significant Bitcoin holdings. These statements underscore the fundamental divide between gold bugs like Schiff and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world. For Schiff, Bitcoin’s value is purely speculative, a bubble waiting to burst, while gold’s value is timeless, proven by millennia of history and its tangible nature. Exploring the Core of the Bitcoin Intrinsic Value Debate The concept of Bitcoin intrinsic value is a central point of contention. For traditional investors like Schiff, intrinsic value is often tied to physical properties, utility, or the ability to generate future cash flows (like a stock). Gold has industrial uses, serves as jewelry, and has a long history as a medium of exchange and store of value. Bitcoin proponents argue that its value isn’t ‘intrinsic’ in the traditional sense, but derived from other crucial factors: Decentralization: Its independence from central authorities makes it censorship-resistant and a hedge against traditional financial system risks. Scarcity: The hard cap of 21 million coins creates digital scarcity, a key driver of value, similar to how the limited supply of gold contributes to its value. Network Effect: The growing number of users, developers, and businesses built around Bitcoin increases its utility and security. Security: The robust proof-of-work mechanism makes the network incredibly secure against attacks. Utility as Digital Gold/Store of Value: In a digital age, Bitcoin offers a way to store and transfer value across borders without intermediaries, acting as a digital alternative to gold. While Bitcoin lacks physical form or industrial use, its value proposition lies in its unique digital properties and the robust network supporting it. The debate hinges on whether these digital attributes constitute a form of ‘intrinsic’ or fundamental value in the 21st century. Is the Bitcoin Community a ‘Giant Cult’? Addressing the Bitcoin Cult Claim Schiff’s description of the community as a Bitcoin cult is undoubtedly inflammatory. While the term ‘cult’ typically implies blind devotion, manipulative leadership, and isolation from reality, the Bitcoin community is characterized by passionate belief, strong evangelism, and a shared vision for a decentralized future. Similar to early adopters of any revolutionary technology or movement, Bitcoin enthusiasts often display deep conviction and are eager to convert others. They pore over technical details, debate economic theories, and actively participate in promoting adoption. This passion can sometimes be perceived as cult-like by outsiders, especially given the asset’s volatility and the strong conviction many holders have in its long-term success despite setbacks. However, comparing it directly to a harmful cult ignores the open, decentralized nature of the community, the lack of a single leader, and the fact that participation is voluntary and based on investment thesis or ideological alignment rather than coercive control. While pockets of extreme views or toxic behavior exist, labeling the entire global community a ‘cult’ is a broad generalization that many find unfair and dismissive. Bitcoin vs Gold: The Ultimate Reserve Asset Showdown The core of Schiff’s argument and a perpetual topic of discussion is the Bitcoin vs Gold comparison. For centuries, gold has been the go-to asset during times of economic uncertainty, held by individuals and nations alike as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Its status as a Gold reserve asset is well-established. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a newcomer, only gaining prominence in the last decade. Its proponents argue it possesses properties that make it superior to gold in the digital age. Let’s look at a comparison: Feature Gold Bitcoin Intrinsic Value (Traditional View) Yes (Physical, Industrial, Jewelry) Debatable (Digital Utility, Network Effect) Scarcity Finite (Mining is difficult but supply increases) Absolutely Finite (Hard cap of 21 million) Portability Difficult (Heavy, requires security) Easy (Digital, can be sent anywhere instantly) Divisibility Difficult (Cutting/melting) Easy (Divisible up to 8 decimal places – satoshis) Verifiability Requires expertise/equipment Easy (Blockchain transparency) Storage Cost/Security Requires secure vaults, insurance Requires digital security (wallets, keys) Historical Precedent as Money/Store of Value Thousands of years ~15 years Central Bank Adoption as Reserve Asset Widespread and increasing Minimal (Some exploration/discussion) Volatility Relatively low High While gold has the advantage of history and stability, Bitcoin excels in areas like portability, divisibility, and transparency in the digital realm. The debate isn’t just about which is better, but whether Bitcoin can carve out its own role as a digital store of value or even a future reserve asset alongside, or perhaps eventually challenging, gold. Why Do Central Banks Still Prefer Gold? Schiff correctly points out that central banks are currently buying gold, not Bitcoin. This preference for Gold reserve asset status among national banks stems from several factors: History and Trust: Gold has been a trusted store of value and medium of exchange for millennia. Central banks have vast experience managing gold reserves. Stability and Liquidity: While not immune to price swings, gold is generally less volatile than Bitcoin and has deep, established global markets for trading. Regulatory Clarity: The legal and regulatory framework around holding and managing gold is well-defined internationally. Bitcoin, conversely, faces significant regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions. Physical Control: Central banks can physically hold and secure their gold reserves within their borders, offering a sense of direct control that differs from holding digital assets distributed globally. However, the landscape is slowly evolving. Some central banks and international bodies are exploring digital currencies (CBDCs) and the potential implications of decentralized cryptocurrencies. While mass adoption of Bitcoin as a central bank reserve asset isn’t imminent, the conversation is no longer entirely off the table for some forward-thinking institutions. Actionable Insights for Investors What should investors take away from the ongoing Peter Schiff Bitcoin vs. Gold debate? Do Your Own Research: Don’t rely solely on the opinions of one person, whether they are a gold bug or a Bitcoin maximalist. Understand the fundamentals of both assets. Consider Diversification: Many investors choose to hold both gold and Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio, leveraging the unique characteristics of each. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is significantly more volatile than gold. Assess how much risk you are comfortable taking. Long-Term Perspective: Both gold and Bitcoin are often viewed as long-term stores of value. Consider your investment horizon. Schiff’s criticisms, while harsh, highlight legitimate questions about Bitcoin’s valuation and role. However, they often overlook the innovative aspects and growing adoption that make Bitcoin a compelling asset for many in the digital age. Conclusion: An Unending Debate Peter Schiff’s appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference and his subsequent remarks served as a stark reminder of the ideological chasm separating traditional finance advocates and the cryptocurrency world. His claims of Bitcoin having no Bitcoin intrinsic value , being a ‘giant cult,’ and his insistence on gold as the sole Gold reserve asset are consistent with his long-held views. While Schiff’s criticisms resonate with those skeptical of digital assets, they fail to fully capture the arguments for Bitcoin’s value derived from its decentralized network, absolute scarcity, and growing utility as a digital store of value. The Bitcoin vs Gold debate is far from over, reflecting differing views on what constitutes value and security in the modern economy. Ultimately, the choice between Bitcoin, gold, or a combination of both depends on an individual investor’s financial goals, risk appetite, and belief in the future trajectory of both traditional and digital assets. Schiff’s comments, though controversial, contribute to a necessary dialogue about the nature of money and value in the 21st century.

The latest development sparking discussion comes from Spain, where banking behemoth Santander is reportedly exploring a potential entry into the cryptocurrency market. According to insights shared by ‘Unfolded’ on the social media platform X, the initial focus of this exploration centers on early-stage plans for a stablecoin. This move by a major global bank like Santander underscores the growing trend of Santander crypto interest within established financial institutions. Why Are Giants Like Santander Eyeing Banking Stablecoins? Santander isn’t operating in a vacuum. Its reported interest in stablecoins reflects a broader trend across the financial industry. Banks and financial institutions are recognizing the potential efficiencies and new opportunities that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, can offer. But why the sudden (or perhaps not so sudden) pivot? Efficiency in Payments and Settlements: Traditional cross-border payments can be slow, expensive, and involve multiple intermediaries. Stablecoins operating on blockchain technology offer the potential for near-instantaneous, 24/7 settlements at significantly lower costs. This is particularly attractive for corporate banking and interbank transfers. Exploring Tokenized Assets: Beyond simple payments, stablecoins can serve as the foundational layer for trading and settling other tokenized assets, such as real estate, securities, or commodities, on a blockchain. Banks want to be at the forefront of this potential revolution in asset management and trading. Meeting Evolving Customer Needs: Corporate clients, especially those involved in international trade or digital businesses, are increasingly looking for faster and more flexible payment solutions. Stablecoins could provide a digital-native answer to these demands. Staying Competitive: The rise of FinTech companies and dedicated crypto platforms offering digital asset services is pressuring traditional banks to innovate. Ignoring the digital asset space is no longer a viable long-term strategy. Anticipating Regulatory Shifts: While the regulatory landscape for stablecoins and other digital assets is still evolving, banks are positioning themselves to be ready when clearer frameworks emerge. Developing internal expertise and pilot programs now is crucial for future compliance and market participation. The exploration of banking stablecoins by institutions like Santander signals a strategic move to adapt to a changing financial ecosystem. It’s not just about dipping toes; it’s about understanding how digital value transfer can integrate with existing financial infrastructure. What Could a Santander Bank Digital Currency Look Like? While details are scarce, a stablecoin issued or utilized by a major bank like Santander would likely differ in significant ways from the stablecoins most commonly used in the public crypto market (like USDT or USDC). Here are some potential characteristics: A Santander stablecoin would likely be: Fiat-Backed 1:1: Pegged directly to a major fiat currency like the Euro or potentially the US Dollar, with reserves held by the bank itself, ensuring stability. Permissioned or Enterprise-Focused: Initially, it might not be a public stablecoin accessible to everyone. Instead, it could operate on a permissioned blockchain network, limited to verified institutional clients or used internally for interbank settlements. Regulatory Compliant: Designed from the ground up to adhere to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, as required by traditional banking standards. Use Case Specific: Focused initially on specific applications like cross-border payments, corporate treasury management, or the settlement of tokenized securities, rather than broad retail adoption. This approach allows banks to explore the technology in a controlled environment, mitigating some of the risks associated with public, permissionless networks while adhering to their regulatory obligations. The concept of a bank digital currency , whether a stablecoin or a direct digital representation of liabilities, is becoming a key area of focus. Benefits of Institutional Crypto Adoption for the Financial System The potential entry of major players like Santander into the crypto space through initiatives like stablecoins carries significant implications, not just for the bank itself, but for the broader financial system and the digital asset market. This trend of institutional crypto adoption offers several potential benefits: For Banks and Institutions: Operational Efficiency: Reduced costs and time for transactions, especially cross-border. New Revenue Streams: Potential for offering new digital asset services, custody, and facilitating tokenized markets. Enhanced Risk Management: Potential for real-time settlement reduces counterparty risk in certain transactions. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Staying relevant in a rapidly digitizing global economy. For the Crypto Market: Increased Legitimacy: Participation from regulated financial giants lends credibility to the digital asset space. Potential for Increased Liquidity: As institutions engage, they can bring significant capital and trading volume. Development of Robust Infrastructure: Institutional needs drive the development of more secure, scalable, and compliant digital asset infrastructure. For Users (eventually): Faster, Cheaper Transactions: While initial focus might be institutional, the underlying technology improvements could eventually benefit retail users. New Financial Products: Access to tokenized assets and other digital-native financial services. This evolution signifies a maturation of the digital asset space, moving beyond speculative retail trading towards integration into core financial functions. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges of Stablecoin Regulation and Adoption While the potential is clear, the path for banks entering the crypto space, particularly with stablecoins, is fraught with challenges. The primary hurdle remains stablecoin regulation . Here’s a look at some key challenges: Challenge Description Implication for Banks Regulatory Uncertainty Lack of clear, harmonized global or even regional rules specifically for stablecoins and digital assets held by regulated entities. Creates legal and compliance risks, hinders development and deployment. Technical Integration Integrating new blockchain technology with complex, often legacy, banking systems. Requires significant investment, expertise, and presents operational challenges. Security Risks Threats of hacking, smart contract vulnerabilities, and cyberattacks targeting digital asset infrastructure. Requires robust security protocols and constant vigilance to protect assets and data. Competition Competing with existing public stablecoins, other banks developing similar solutions, and potential Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Requires a strong value proposition and efficient execution to gain market share. Public Perception Addressing concerns about volatility (even for stablecoins, perceived risk), scams, and the association of crypto with illicit activities. Requires clear communication and building trust with clients and the public. Overcoming these challenges requires close collaboration between banks, regulators, and technology providers. The success of initiatives like Santander’s potential stablecoin will heavily depend on navigating this complex landscape. Examples of Institutional Crypto Adoption Beyond Santander Santander’s exploration is part of a larger trend. Several other major financial institutions have already taken steps into the digital asset space, providing a roadmap and context for Santander’s potential move: JPMorgan Chase: Launched JPM Coin, a private, permissioned blockchain-based system for wholesale payments between institutional clients. This is a prime example of a bank-issued digital currency for specific use cases. DBS Bank (Singapore): Established a digital asset exchange, allowing institutional and accredited investors to trade cryptocurrencies and eventually tokenized assets. Goldman Sachs: Has been active in cryptocurrency trading and exploring tokenization of traditional financial assets. Various Banks in Pilot Programs: Many banks globally are participating in pilot programs exploring blockchain technology for interbank settlements, trade finance, and other applications, often involving forms of digital tokens or stablecoins. These examples demonstrate that institutional crypto adoption is not just theoretical; it’s actively happening. Banks are exploring different angles, from direct trading and custody to issuing their own digital currencies for specific purposes. Santander’s focus on stablecoins aligns with the payment and settlement efficiency angle pursued by many. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? While Santander’s initial stablecoin plans are likely focused on institutional use, developments like this have broader implications for the financial world and anyone interested in crypto: Watch for Regulatory Clarity: Increased institutional involvement puts more pressure on regulators to provide clear rules. Keep an eye on regulatory announcements in major financial hubs. Clearer rules could accelerate adoption. Observe Use Case Development: Pay attention to how banks like Santander plan to use stablecoins. Will it be limited to internal transfers, or will it extend to corporate payments, trade finance, or even facilitating tokenized asset trading? Understand the Difference: Recognize that a bank-issued stablecoin might operate differently (e.g., permissioned network, strict KYC) than public stablecoins you might use on a crypto exchange. Institutional Flow Matters: As more institutions engage, it can potentially bring more stability and volume to certain parts of the crypto market, particularly those related to infrastructure and regulated digital assets. The Future of Finance is Hybrid: Santander’s move reinforces the idea that the future financial system will likely be a hybrid, integrating traditional finance with elements of decentralized or distributed ledger technology. Santander’s reported exploration is a signal that major banks see a future where digital assets play a role. It’s a development worth following closely. Conclusion: Santander’s Stablecoin Step and the Future of Banking Santander’s early-stage exploration into the crypto market, specifically focusing on stablecoins, is a significant indicator of the direction traditional finance is heading. It’s not an isolated event but rather part of a larger wave of institutional crypto adoption as banks seek to leverage the potential efficiencies and opportunities presented by digital assets. While challenges, particularly around stablecoin regulation and technical integration, remain substantial, the strategic imperative for banks to innovate in the digital realm is clear. Whether Santander’s plans fully materialize and how their potential bank digital currency is implemented will be key developments to watch. What is certain is that the lines between traditional banking and the digital asset world are increasingly blurring, promising a more integrated and potentially more efficient financial future.

This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a complete pivot, signaling strong conviction in the future of a specific blockchain ecosystem. The decision involves exiting a long-held position in one of crypto’s giants to go all-in on another. Understanding the Bold Solana Treasury Shift At the heart of the news is Sol Strategies’ decision to fully allocate its treasury assets to Solana (SOL). Previously holding a position in Bitcoin (BTC), the company has now liquidated its entire Bitcoin holdings to acquire a substantial amount of SOL. Specifically, Sol Strategies announced via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it purchased 26,478 SOL for $4.7 million. This acquisition brings their total Solana treasury holdings to a staggering 420,355 SOL. To put this into perspective, based on recent market valuations, this Solana treasury is estimated to be worth approximately CAD $100 million. This isn’t pocket change; it represents a significant corporate asset base now solely tied to the performance and growth of the Solana network. Why the Bitcoin Exit? The decision to execute a complete Bitcoin exit from their treasury is perhaps as noteworthy as the move into Solana. For many companies holding crypto on their balance sheets, Bitcoin has been the default, perceived as the safest and most established digital asset. Sol Strategies’ departure from this common practice suggests a strategic re-evaluation of their long-term asset management goals and a potentially higher conviction in the growth trajectory and utility offered by the Solana ecosystem compared to Bitcoin for their specific objectives. Sol Strategies’ Vision: More Than Just a SOL Investment Sol Strategies explicitly stated that this massive SOL investment is not merely a speculative play on the price of Solana. The company articulated a clear rationale rooted in a long-term commitment to the Solana ecosystem . A key part of their strategy involves supporting validator growth within the network. By holding and potentially staking such a large amount of SOL, Sol Strategies can play a significant role in the network’s security, decentralization, and overall health. This suggests a belief in Solana’s technology, its development community, and its potential to scale and handle widespread adoption. Here’s a quick look at the key figures: Previous Treasury Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) New Treasury Asset: Solana (SOL) Recent Acquisition: 26,478 SOL Cost of Acquisition: $4.7 million Total SOL Holdings: 420,355 SOL Estimated Value of Treasury: ~CAD $100 million Stated Goal: Long-term commitment, support validator growth What Does This Mean for the Solana Ecosystem? A treasury move of this magnitude from a known entity like Sol Strategies can have several implications for the Solana ecosystem : Increased Confidence: It can signal strong institutional or corporate confidence in Solana’s technology and future prospects, potentially encouraging other investors. Validator Growth Support: By dedicating significant capital to SOL holdings, Sol Strategies can contribute to the network’s security and decentralization through staking, aligning their financial interests with the network’s operational success. Market Sentiment: Large, publicly announced purchases can positively influence market sentiment around SOL. Potential for Further Development: A company deeply invested in the ecosystem is more likely to participate in or fund further development and innovation on Solana. Is a Full Treasury Allocation Risky? While the move signals strong conviction, allocating an entire treasury to a single, volatile asset like SOL does come with inherent risks. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their price swings, and concentrating assets removes the diversification benefits that holding multiple assets (like Bitcoin and others) might offer. However, Sol Strategies’ focus on validator growth suggests they may be looking beyond short-term price movements and are focused on the yield and network participation benefits that come with staking. Looking Ahead: Sol Strategies and the Solana Treasury Sol Strategies’ decision is a bold statement in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto treasury management. It moves away from the more common diversified or Bitcoin-centric approaches and places a significant bet on Solana’s continued growth and success. The outcome of this strategy will be closely watched, not only by those interested in Sol Strategies’ performance but also by the broader crypto community keen to see how such a concentrated, ecosystem-focused treasury performs over the long term and what impact it has on the Solana ecosystem itself. This development highlights a growing trend where companies are not just holding crypto but are strategically aligning their assets with specific blockchain ecosystems they believe will drive future innovation and value.

That vision is becoming more of a reality as companies like Rain, a prominent cryptocurrency card issuer, continue to innovate. Rain is making waves with its latest announcement: expanding support for stablecoin payments specifically on the Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and Stellar (XLM) networks. This move is significant for users looking for faster, potentially cheaper ways to spend their stablecoins. The Expansion of Stablecoin Payments Rain’s decision to integrate support for stablecoins residing on the Solana, Tron, and Stellar blockchains marks a notable step in bridging the gap between the crypto economy and traditional finance. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value relative to an asset like the US dollar, are increasingly popular for transactions due to their reduced volatility compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. By enabling payments using stablecoins from these specific networks, Rain is tapping into ecosystems known for their transaction speed and efficiency. This expansion means users holding stablecoins (such as USDC or USDT, which are available on these networks) can potentially access and spend those funds more readily through their Rain debit or credit card. It simplifies the process that might otherwise involve multiple steps like sending funds to an exchange, converting them to fiat, and then transferring to a bank account. The direct spending capability via a card offers a more seamless experience. What is the Rain Crypto Platform? Before diving deeper into the network expansion, it’s helpful to understand Rain itself. Rain operates as a cryptocurrency platform that facilitates the use of digital assets in the traditional payment ecosystem. Essentially, they provide cards (both debit and credit options are mentioned) that allow users to spend their crypto holdings at merchants worldwide that accept card payments. The platform handles the backend conversion process. When a user makes a purchase, Rain typically converts the necessary amount of cryptocurrency (now including supported stablecoins on SOL, TRX, XLM) into the required fiat currency at the point of sale. This abstraction makes the transaction feel like a regular card payment for both the user and the merchant. Rain has demonstrated growth and attracted investor confidence, notably securing $24.5 million in an investment round led by Norwest Ventures. This funding indicates market belief in the potential of crypto-to-fiat payment solutions and provides Rain with resources to expand its offerings, such as this latest network integration. Connecting Your Funds: How the Crypto Card Works Using a crypto card like the one offered by Rain typically involves linking your crypto wallet or account on the Rain platform to the physical or virtual card. When you make a purchase: You swipe or tap the card at a point-of-sale terminal or use it online. The transaction request goes to the card network (like Visa or Mastercard, depending on the issuer). The request is forwarded to Rain. Rain calculates the equivalent amount of crypto (in this case, the stablecoin on the specific network) needed to cover the fiat cost of the transaction. Rain executes a conversion of the required crypto amount into fiat currency in real-time (or near real-time). The fiat is used to settle the transaction with the merchant. The equivalent crypto balance is deducted from your Rain account. This process requires robust infrastructure to handle rapid conversions and fluctuating crypto prices, although stablecoins mitigate the price volatility aspect significantly. Why Solana Stablecoin Payments? Solana has gained prominence for its high transaction throughput and low transaction costs compared to some other blockchains. These characteristics make it particularly attractive for payment applications.

Excerpts from court documents in the SEC, Binance case. Source: Eleanor Terrett Terrett shared the news via her X page, attaching an image from the legal filing, which identified the SEC as the plaintiff and Binance Holdings Limited, BAM Trading Services Inc., BAM Management US Holdings Inc., and Changpeng Zhao as the defendants. SEC, Binance credit Crypto Task Force for resolution The SEC initiated this civil enforcement action against Binance on June 5, 2023, and it filed an amended complaint on October 16, 2024 (Docket No. 282). The joint stipulation seeks to allow both parties to dismiss the ongoing lawsuit. “Whereas, in light of the foregoing, and in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter, the Commission believes the dismissal of this Litigation is appropriate,” the May 29 filing in the District Court for the District of Columbia read. Both parties hinted at the possibility of a dismissal in February when the SEC and Binance asked the judge to stay the case. Then again, in April, when the same request was filed. The parties mentioned how the establishment of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force “might impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this litigation,” in the court documents. The SEC’s Acting Chairman, Mark T. Uyeda introduced the task force on January 21, 2025, to present a regulatory framework for crypto assets in the lead up to providing regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency space. Paul Atkins’ SEC sets a precedent The SEC’s willingness to dismiss Binance’s lawsuit follows a trend that has seen the agency end its litigation against other crypto companies like Coinbase, Consensus and Kraken, which were settled earlier this year. It has also ended investigations into Circle, Immutable and several others. Sentiments on X are bullish about the SEC and Binance finally burying the hatchet, but a number of users in the reply section of Eleanor Terrett’s X post have drawn comparisons to the protracted settlement of the SEC’s case against Ripple Labs . The Ripple case is a similar high-profile case. It began in December 2020 and has seen multiple developments, including a final judgment on August 7, 2024, imposing a $125 million civil penalty on Ripple. Still, the SEC appears committed to ending aggressive enforcement actions initiated against crypto firms during Gary Gensler’s tenure with the financial watchdog.

A recent development, specifically a US Court Ruling in Washington, D.C., referencing a prior Trade Court Ruling , might seem distant from crypto at first glance, but it underscores principles of law, government action, and judicial oversight that are profoundly relevant to the Regulatory Environment crypto navigates. Let’s dive into why this seemingly unrelated court reference holds importance for anyone tracking the future of digital assets and regulated markets. Understanding the US Court Ruling and its Context According to reports, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., made a notable reference to an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade. While specific details regarding the case before the Washington D.C. court remain largely undisclosed at this time, the reference points back to a significant legal challenge concerning Government Policy – specifically, the halting of a reciprocal tariff policy enacted by the previous administration. This reference is more than just a procedural note; it signifies how legal precedents set in one area of law can be considered and applied in others. The original Trade Court Ruling was a landmark decision that challenged the executive branch’s authority in implementing certain trade measures, asserting the judiciary’s role in reviewing such actions. The fact that a different U.S. District Court is now referencing this decision suggests its principles are being considered relevant in other legal contexts, potentially broadening its impact beyond international trade disputes. What Was the Original Trade Court Ruling About? To grasp the significance of the Washington D.C. court’s reference, we need to understand the original Trade Court Ruling . This decision stemmed from challenges against a specific tariff policy. Here are some key aspects, based on public reporting about the original case: The Policy: The case involved tariffs imposed under specific statutory authority, often related to national security or trade imbalances. The Challenge: Plaintiffs, typically importers or affected businesses, argued that the implementation of these tariffs exceeded the executive branch’s delegated authority or failed to follow proper legal procedures. The Ruling: The U.S. Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs, at least in part, ruling that the administration had overstepped its bounds or improperly applied the law in imposing the tariffs. This ruling effectively halted the implementation of the specific reciprocal tariff policy in question. The Principle: At its core, the ruling was an assertion of Judicial Review – the power of courts to review the constitutionality or legality of actions taken by the legislative and executive branches of government. This original ruling was a significant check on executive power in the realm of trade, demonstrating that even policies enacted under broad statutory language are subject to legal challenge and judicial oversight. Why Does This US Court Ruling Matter for the Regulatory Environment? Now, let’s connect these dots back to the Regulatory Environment , which is of paramount concern to the cryptocurrency community. The crypto space is currently grappling with significant uncertainty regarding how existing laws apply to digital assets and whether new regulations are needed. Various government agencies – from the SEC and CFTC to the Treasury and Congress – are actively discussing or pursuing different approaches to oversight. This US Court Ruling , by referencing a significant Trade Court Ruling on Government Policy , highlights several crucial points relevant to crypto: Judicial Review is a Check on Power: The principle of Judicial Review means that government agencies, including those regulating or seeking to regulate crypto, are not beyond the reach of the law. Their interpretations of statutes, the procedures they follow, and the scope of the rules they propose can all be challenged in court. Precedent Matters: Court decisions, especially those from federal courts, create precedents. While a ruling on trade tariffs isn’t directly about Bitcoin, the legal reasoning employed by the court regarding the limits of executive authority, the interpretation of statutes, or the requirements for administrative action can be cited in future cases involving other government policies, including those targeting digital assets. Clarity Through Litigation: Sometimes, the precise boundaries of Government Policy and regulatory authority are only truly defined through legal challenges. This is a path the crypto industry is already navigating, with ongoing lawsuits against regulatory bodies seeking clarity on whether certain tokens are securities, the scope of exchange oversight, and other critical issues. Impact on Market Certainty: Legal challenges and the potential for judicial intervention can introduce uncertainty, but they can also, over time, lead to greater clarity regarding the rules of the road. A clear Regulatory Environment is something the crypto market desperately needs to foster innovation and attract mainstream adoption. Rulings like the referenced Trade Court Ruling , even in a different sector, contribute to the overall body of law that defines how government interacts with industry. Think of it this way: If a court rules that a government agency overstepped its authority in imposing tariffs based on a certain interpretation of a law, that ruling’s reasoning might be relevant if another agency is accused of overstepping its authority in regulating crypto based on a similar broad interpretation of a different law. Navigating the Complexities: Challenges and Perspectives The interplay between Government Policy , the Regulatory Environment , and Judicial Review is complex. There are differing perspectives on the appropriate role of each branch of government: Advocates for Strong Executive/Agency Power: Argue that agencies have the necessary expertise and are best positioned to respond quickly to rapidly evolving areas like technology and finance. They may view extensive judicial intervention as hindering effective governance. Advocates for Judicial Oversight: Emphasize the importance of checks and balances. They believe courts play a crucial role in ensuring that government actions stay within the bounds set by statutes and the Constitution, protecting individuals and industries from arbitrary or unlawful power. Industry Perspective (including Crypto): Often seeks clear, predictable rules. While some in crypto may chafe under regulation, many recognize that a lack of clarity is detrimental. They watch court cases closely, hoping for decisions that provide certainty and fairness, ensuring that regulations are applied correctly and don’t stifle innovation unnecessarily. The Washington D.C. court’s reference to the Trade Court Ruling is a small piece of this larger puzzle, illustrating how judicial challenges to Government Policy are an ongoing feature of the U.S. legal system and contribute to shaping the overall Regulatory Environment . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Given the indirect but relevant implications of this US Court Ruling and the underlying Trade Court Ruling , what should those interested in crypto take away? 1. Pay Attention to Legal Precedents Beyond Crypto: Don’t limit your focus only to court cases explicitly involving Bitcoin or blockchain. Rulings in areas like administrative law, securities law (even outside of crypto), and challenges to government agency actions (like the tariff case) can set precedents or offer insights into legal arguments that may eventually be applied to digital assets. 2. Understand the Principle of Judicial Review: Recognize that legal challenges are a legitimate and important part of shaping the Regulatory Environment . Support for organizations or efforts that advocate for clear, fair regulation and are willing to pursue legal avenues when necessary can be impactful. 3. Stay Informed on Government Policy Trends: The tariff case is an example of how broad Government Policy can be subject to legal challenge. Keep an eye on proposed legislation and regulatory rules related to crypto, understanding that these too can be challenged in court. 4. Advocate for Clarity: Engage with policymakers and regulators where possible, stressing the need for a clear and consistent Regulatory Environment for digital assets. Highlight how legal uncertainty hinders legitimate activity while potentially pushing bad actors underground. 5. Recognize the Long Game: Establishing a stable and predictable Regulatory Environment for crypto will likely be a multi-year process involving legislative efforts, regulatory rulemaking, and significant court battles. Developments like this US Court Ruling are reminders that the legal system moves deliberately, but its decisions have lasting effects. Conclusion: Why Legal Watchfulness is Key While a US Court Ruling referencing a Trade Court Ruling on tariffs might not generate the same buzz as a Bitcoin price surge or a major exchange listing, it’s a critical reminder of the foundational legal principles that govern government action and shape the Regulatory Environment . The principle of Judicial Review , the power of legal precedent, and the constant negotiation between Government Policy and judicial oversight are all highly relevant to the ongoing development and regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Staying informed about legal developments, even those outside the immediate crypto bubble, provides valuable context and helps anticipate potential challenges and pathways towards regulatory clarity. The reference by the Washington D.C. court serves as a small but significant signal that the legal principles tested in cases like the original Trade Court Ruling continue to resonate throughout the U.S. judicial system, influencing the legal landscape that industries like crypto must navigate.

Training and running cutting-edge AI models typically requires massive clusters of high-end GPUs, making advanced AI development and deployment expensive and resource-intensive. However, a significant development from DeepSeek is changing this narrative, particularly for those interested in accessible and **Efficient AI Models**. While their larger R1 model garnered attention, a smaller, ‘distilled’ version, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, is proving that powerful AI doesn’t always need a data center. What is DeepSeek’s New Single GPU AI Model? DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is a compact iteration of DeepSeek’s latest R1 reasoning AI model. It’s specifically designed to be significantly more efficient than its larger sibling, making it capable of running on much less hardware – potentially even a **Single GPU AI Model** setup. This is a crucial point, as it drastically lowers the barrier to entry for developers, researchers, and even smaller companies looking to experiment with or deploy advanced reasoning capabilities. The model is built upon the foundation of Alibaba’s Qwen3-8B model, released in May. DeepSeek then applied a technique known as ‘distillation.’ In essence, they used the output and capabilities of the larger, more powerful **DeepSeek R1 AI** model to train and fine-tune the smaller Qwen3-8B base model. This process allows the smaller model to inherit some of the reasoning and performance characteristics of the larger model, but in a much more compact and efficient package. How Does This Distilled AI Model Perform on Benchmarks? One of the most exciting aspects of the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is its performance relative to its size.

US Democratic lawmakers are raising significant concerns and demanding transparency regarding who is involved with this particular digital asset, specifically targeting attendees of a recent dinner hosted by Donald Trump for memecoin holders. What are Democratic Lawmakers Demanding? According to a report by The Guardian, lawmakers from the Democratic Party are calling on the project team behind the TRUMP memecoin to reveal the list of individuals who attended a private dinner event held by Donald Trump. This demand stems from worries about potential foreign influence and the opaque nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Congressman Jamie Raskin is a key figure driving this demand. He has voiced concerns that foreign governments or entities could be using purchases of the memecoin as a way to secretly funnel money to the former U.S. president, bypassing traditional campaign finance regulations. Why the Concern Over Political Donations Crypto ? The core issue highlighted by lawmakers is the potential for cryptocurrencies, particularly memecoins which can be volatile and tied to specific personalities, to be used for political financing without public scrutiny. Traditional political donations have disclosure requirements aimed at preventing illegal foreign contributions and ensuring transparency. The concern is that large purchases of a memecoin like TRUMP, especially by foreign nationals or entities, could serve as an indirect form of political support or donation that falls outside the current regulatory framework, potentially influencing U.S. politics. The Justin Sun Connection: A Case Study Congressman Raskin specifically pointed to Tron (TRX) founder, Justin Sun, as an example fueling these concerns. Sun reportedly purchased $20 million worth of TRUMP tokens. Furthermore, Sun has also invested a substantial $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another cryptocurrency project linked to the Trump family. Sun’s involvement is particularly noteworthy given his legal history in the U.S. He was indicted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on charges of fraud last year. Although the case was stayed in February of this year, his significant investments connected to Trump-related crypto projects raise questions for lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest or influence. Navigating Memecoin Disclosure and Transparency Challenges Demanding disclosure for attendees of a private dinner linked to a memecoin project presents unique challenges. While the intention is transparency in political finance, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the lack of clear regulatory guidelines around memecoins complicate such demands. The project team’s legal obligation or ability to disclose attendee lists, especially if attendees are merely token holders and not direct political donors through traditional channels, is unclear. Key challenges include: Identifying attendees who might have purchased tokens for speculative reasons versus political influence. Distinguishing between genuine retail investors and large-scale purchasers potentially linked to foreign entities. The lack of a clear legal framework classifying memecoin purchases as political donations requiring disclosure. Balancing demands for transparency with individual privacy concerns in the crypto space. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community This situation underscores the increasing intersection of cryptocurrency and politics. For crypto holders and enthusiasts, it’s important to: Stay informed about regulatory discussions surrounding crypto and political finance. Understand the potential scrutiny that projects linked to political figures may face. Recognize that the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins, is still evolving. The demand for memecoin disclosure highlights the ongoing debate about how to apply existing financial transparency rules to the novel world of digital assets. Conclusion The demand by Democratic lawmakers for the disclosure of attendees at a Trump memecoin dinner signals a growing intent in Washington to understand and potentially regulate the flow of value between political figures and the cryptocurrency market. Fueled by examples like the significant investments made by figures such as Justin Sun , these concerns about potential foreign influence and lack of transparency in political donations crypto are unlikely to subside soon. This development adds another layer of complexity to the relationship between digital assets and the political arena, emphasizing the need for clarity and potentially new regulations in the future.

Leaving large sums of money idle means missing out on potential growth and facing the erosive power of inflation. This is especially relevant in today’s dynamic financial landscape, where traditional savings yield little and alternative assets like cryptocurrencies offer different opportunities. So, what exactly should you do when you have excess cash beyond your immediate needs? Why Having Excess Cash Can Be a Problem While having cash provides liquidity and security, keeping too much of it sitting idle comes with downsides: Inflation Risk: The purchasing power of cash decreases over time due to inflation. Your dollars buy less in the future than they do today. Opportunity Cost: That cash could be working for you, generating returns through various investments. Security Concerns: Holding large physical amounts of cash can be risky due to theft or loss. Low Yield: Traditional savings accounts or money market funds often offer minimal interest rates, barely keeping pace with, or falling behind, inflation. Understanding these points is the first step in deciding what to do with dollars that aren’t needed for daily expenses or short-term goals. First Steps: Assess Your Financial Situation and Goals Before you start investing cash or making any major decisions, take a step back and evaluate your overall financial picture. This crucial assessment will guide your choices. Build an Emergency Fund: Ensure you have 3-6 months (or more) of living expenses readily accessible in a savings account for unexpected events like job loss or medical emergencies. This cash is not excess; it’s essential security. Identify Short-Term Goals: Are you saving for a down payment on a house, a car, or a vacation within the next 1-3 years? Cash or highly liquid, low-risk options are suitable for these goals. Define Long-Term Goals: What about retirement, your children’s education, or building long-term wealth? This is where strategies for managing cash for growth become important. Evaluate Debt: High-interest debt (like credit cards) often has an interest rate higher than potential investment returns. Paying down such debt can be a very effective use of cash. Once you have a clear picture of your needs and goals, you can explore options for your true too many US dollars . Traditional Avenues for Investing Cash For those looking for established ways to grow their money, traditional markets offer several options. Stocks and Bonds Investing in the stock market means buying ownership in companies. This offers potential for significant growth over the long term, but also comes with volatility and risk. Bonds represent lending money to governments or corporations in exchange for interest payments and the return of principal. Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks but offer lower potential returns. Benefits: Potential for capital appreciation (stocks), regular income (bonds), diversification, liquidity (for publicly traded assets). Challenges: Market volatility, potential loss of principal, requires research or professional advice, taxes on gains and income. Actionable Insight: Consider diversified index funds or ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) for broad market exposure with lower risk than individual stocks. For bonds, consider bond funds that match your risk tolerance and time horizon. Real Estate Investing in physical property (rental properties, REITs) can provide rental income and potential appreciation. It’s a less liquid investment than stocks or bonds. Benefits: Potential for passive income, appreciation, hedge against inflation (sometimes), tax advantages. Challenges: High upfront cost, ongoing expenses (maintenance, taxes, insurance), illiquidity, requires management (for physical property), market downturns. Actionable Insight: For smaller amounts of excess cash , consider investing in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which trade like stocks and own income-producing real estate. High-Yield Savings Accounts & CDs While not strictly investing for growth, these options offer slightly better returns than standard savings accounts and are very low risk and liquid (savings) or offer fixed returns for a set period (CDs). Benefits: Safety of principal (usually FDIC insured), predictable income (CDs), high liquidity (savings). Challenges: Returns may not keep pace with inflation, lower returns compared to riskier assets. Actionable Insight: Use these for funds you might need in the short to medium term (1-5 years) where capital preservation is key. Exploring Alternatives: What to Do with Dollars in New Markets Beyond traditional finance, alternative investments offer different risk/reward profiles. This is where many people with too many US dollars are starting to look. Cryptocurrency Investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum involves buying digital assets that operate on decentralized networks. The crypto market is known for its high volatility but also its potential for significant returns. Benefits: High potential for returns, decentralization, innovation, diversification away from traditional assets. Challenges: Extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainty, security risks (hacking, scams), complexity, requires significant research. Actionable Insight: Approach crypto with caution. Start with a small percentage of your excess cash that you can afford to lose. Focus on understanding the technology and the specific assets you’re interested in. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility risk. Gold and Precious Metals Often seen as a store of value, gold and other precious metals can be held physically or via funds (ETFs). They are sometimes considered a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Benefits: Store of value, hedge against inflation/economic instability, tangible asset. Challenges: Does not generate income (unless through funds), storage costs (physical), price volatility, performance can lag other assets during growth periods. Actionable Insight: Consider adding a small allocation (e.g., 5-10%) to your portfolio for diversification and potential hedging benefits. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Lending money directly to individuals or businesses through online platforms can offer higher interest rates than traditional savings. Benefits: Higher potential returns than savings, diversification. Challenges: Credit risk (borrower default), platform risk, illiquidity, requires careful vetting of loans. Actionable Insight: Diversify across many loans to mitigate default risk. Understand the platform’s risk assessment process. Strategic Uses for Managing Cash Beyond Investing Not all too many US dollars need to be invested for financial returns. Sometimes, the best return is on your own financial well-being. Paying Down Debt As mentioned earlier, paying off high-interest debt provides a guaranteed return equivalent to the interest rate you were paying. This is often a financially sound move before aggressive investing. Benefits: Guaranteed return (saving on interest), reduces financial stress, improves credit score. Challenges: Cash is no longer available for other uses, may not feel as exciting as investing. Actionable Insight: Prioritize paying off debt with interest rates higher than what you reasonably expect to earn from investments (e.g., credit cards, some personal loans). Funding Education or Skills Development Investing in yourself or your family’s education can yield significant long-term returns in earning potential. Benefits: Increased earning capacity, personal growth, non-taxable use of funds (in some cases). Challenges: Can be expensive, no guaranteed financial return, requires time commitment. Actionable Insight: Use excess cash to pay for courses, certifications, or degrees that can enhance career prospects. Home Improvement Using cash to improve your home can increase its value and your quality of life. It’s a different kind of investment. Benefits: Increased property value, improved living environment, can be more cost-effective than financing. Challenges: No direct financial return until sale, requires managing contractors, potential for cost overruns. Actionable Insight: Focus on improvements that add significant value or address necessary repairs rather than purely cosmetic changes if maximizing financial return is a goal. Strategic Spending or Enjoyment Sometimes, having too many US dollars means you can afford to spend some on experiences, travel, or items that genuinely improve your life or bring you joy. This isn’t about frivolous spending but intentional use of funds beyond necessities and investments. Benefits: Improved quality of life, creating memories, immediate gratification. Challenges: Reduces funds available for investment or debt repayment, doesn’t provide financial return. Actionable Insight: Allocate a specific portion of your excess cash for spending after ensuring your financial bases (emergency fund, debt, basic investments) are covered. Getting Professional Help for Managing Cash Navigating these options can be complex. If you have substantial too many US dollars , consulting a fee-only financial advisor can be beneficial. They can help you create a personalized plan based on your specific situation, risk tolerance, and goals. Conclusion: Make Your Dollars Work for You Having too many US dollars in cash is a signal to take action. Leaving it idle is a missed opportunity. By assessing your financial health, understanding your goals, and exploring the various avenues available – from traditional investments like stocks and real estate to alternatives like cryptocurrency, and even strategic uses like debt repayment or self-improvement – you can make informed decisions about what to do with dollars . The key is to create a plan that aligns with your objectives and risk comfort level, ensuring your excess cash is not just sitting there, but actively working towards building your financial future. Don’t let inflation erode your wealth; take control and put those dollars to work.

The cryptocurrency has recently been in a short-term pullback, moving slightly lower after previous gains. This type of movement is common in crypto markets, especially since XRP often mirrors Bitcoin’s price action. Current Price Movement At the moment, XRP has dropped below a key support level between $2.30 and $2.34. This breakdown means the price could fall further towards the next major support zone around $2.10 to $2.15. If selling pressure increases, XRP might test even lower areas — but holding above these support levels would be a positive sign for the bulls. XRP has important support between $2.10 and $2.15. A drop below this could push the price down to $1.79, which is a very important level to hold. If it falls under $1.79, bigger losses could follow. On the other hand, XRP faces resistance between $2.30 and $2.34. If the price moves above this, the next hurdles are at $2.44, and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Possible Bullish Pattern Forming There’s a chance that XRP might be forming a classic chart pattern called an “inverse head and shoulders.” This is a bullish (positive) sign that often hints at a price rise. But right now, this pattern isn’t confirmed yet. For this pattern to become official, XRP’s price would need to bounce from its current levels, move up towards the $2.62 mark, and break through it. If that happens in the next couple of weeks, it could spark a strong upward move — maybe even towards new all-time highs. What Could Happen Next? In the short term (next few days to a week), experts expect XRP’s price to continue cooling off while Bitcoin remains quiet. The key is whether XRP can hold above $2.10 or especially $1.79, as dropping below these levels might bring more selling pressure. If bulls (buyers) step in soon, it might see a bounce back before XRP hits those lower levels. On the flip side, if sellers stay in control, the price could dip a little more before finding strong support.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 01:42:14

Among the most talked-about recent phenomena are meme coins – cryptocurrencies often born from internet jokes, cultural trends, or community enthusiasm, rather than traditional business models or clear utility. Their explosive growth and unique characteristics have presented a significant challenge for existing financial regulations worldwide. This challenge was front and center at the recent Bitcoin 2025 Conference , where U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce offered some intriguing insights and a potential path forward for navigating the complex landscape of SEC Meme Coin Regulation . Hester Peirce Crypto Insights: A Call for Clarity Known affectionately in the crypto community as “Crypto Mom” for her often more accommodating stance towards digital assets compared to some of her peers, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has consistently advocated for clearer regulatory frameworks that foster innovation rather than stifle it. Her comments at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference underscored this perspective, specifically addressing the unique nature of meme coins. Peirce noted that meme coins, in many ways, resemble collectibles. Think of digital baseball cards, unique digital art pieces, or other items whose value is primarily driven by cultural significance, community sentiment, and scarcity rather than an underlying business venture or expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others (a key component of the Howey Test used to define a security in the U.S.). Her crucial point was that these assets, due to their nature, currently appear to fall outside the conventional protections offered by securities laws. This creates a significant gap, leaving investors potentially exposed without the disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions typically applied to securities. Why a Crypto Regulatory Committee for Meme Coins? The core of Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion is the establishment of a dedicated Crypto Regulatory Committee specifically focused on meme coins. But why is such a specialized body needed? Here are some reasons: Unique Characteristics: Meme coins often lack whitepapers, clear roadmaps, or identifiable development teams in the traditional sense. Their value is heavily reliant on community hype and social media trends. Investor Protection: Without securities law protections, investors are more vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes, market manipulation, and misleading promotions. Regulatory Ambiguity: Applying existing securities frameworks, designed for traditional stocks and bonds, to assets like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu is challenging and can lead to uncertainty. Rapid Evolution: The meme coin space moves incredibly fast, with new tokens emerging daily. Regulators need a focused approach to keep pace. Global Nature: Meme coins trade on global platforms, requiring a coordinated or at least well-considered domestic approach that considers international implications. A dedicated committee could bring together experts to study these unique assets, understand their market dynamics, and propose tailored regulatory approaches that don’t necessarily fit the mold of traditional securities regulation. Navigating the Challenges of Meme Coin Regulation Regulating meme coins is no simple task. The proposed Meme Coin Regulation committee would face numerous hurdles: Defining ‘Meme Coin’: How do you legally define a meme coin versus other cryptocurrencies or digital assets? The line can be blurry. Decentralization: Many meme coins claim a degree of decentralization, making it hard to identify responsible parties for regulatory compliance. Valuation Challenges: Traditional valuation metrics don’t apply. Value is highly speculative and sentiment-driven. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Overly strict regulation could stifle the organic, community-driven innovation that characterizes this space, while insufficient rules leave investors exposed. Jurisdictional Issues: Trading is global, while regulation is typically national. The committee would need to grapple with these fundamental questions to develop effective and fair rules. Potential Structure and Focus of a Meme Coin Regulatory Committee While Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion was high-level, one can envision the potential structure and focus areas for such a committee. It might include representatives from: The SEC Other relevant financial regulatory bodies (CFTC, FinCEN) Academic experts in digital assets and economics Potentially, representatives from the crypto industry (though this could be controversial) Their work could involve: Area of Focus Potential Activities Classification Developing criteria to distinguish meme coins from securities or other asset classes. Disclosure Exploring alternative disclosure requirements suitable for assets without traditional financials. Market Integrity Studying mechanisms to detect and prevent manipulation specific to meme coin markets. Investor Education Developing resources to help potential investors understand the unique risks of meme coins. Enforcement Identifying clear triggers and methods for enforcement actions against fraudulent activities. The goal would be to create a framework that provides necessary investor protections without trying to fit a square peg into the round hole of existing securities law designed for different types of assets. The Broader Context: Crypto Regulation in the US Commissioner Peirce’s proposal comes at a time when the U.S. is actively debating the future of crypto regulation. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has largely pursued an enforcement-first approach, classifying many cryptocurrencies as securities and taking action against platforms and projects they deem non-compliant. This approach has drawn criticism from many in the industry, including Commissioner Peirce, who argue it lacks clarity and hinders innovation. The suggestion for a specific committee for meme coins highlights the difficulty in applying a one-size-fits-all approach to the diverse crypto ecosystem. It acknowledges that assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, utility tokens, stablecoins, and meme coins may require different regulatory considerations. The discussions at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference , a major gathering for the crypto community, provide a crucial platform for these ideas to be debated and potentially influence future policy directions. Peirce’s willingness to engage with the community and propose specific solutions like a Crypto Regulatory Committee is seen by many as a positive step towards finding pragmatic regulatory solutions. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Market? For investors, the prospect of clearer Meme Coin Regulation could bring both pros and cons. On the one hand, increased regulatory clarity and potential protections against fraud could boost confidence and potentially attract a wider range of participants to the market. On the other hand, any form of regulation could be seen by some as interfering with the free-wheeling, speculative nature that attracts many to meme coins in the first place. For the market as a whole, a dedicated committee could signal a more nuanced and thoughtful approach from regulators towards specific crypto asset classes. It could potentially pave the way for tailored rules that acknowledge the unique characteristics of meme coins rather than forcing them into unsuitable existing categories. Looking Ahead: The Future of Meme Coin Regulation Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion is just that – a suggestion. Whether a dedicated Crypto Regulatory Committee for meme coins is ultimately established remains to be seen. However, her comments at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference serve as a vital acknowledgment from within the SEC that meme coins present a unique regulatory challenge that needs a specific, thoughtful approach. Addressing the regulatory gap is essential for fostering a mature and safe digital asset market. Whether through a dedicated committee or other means, clearer guidance on how assets like meme coins are viewed and regulated in the U.S. is crucial for investors, developers, and the industry’s future growth. The conversation has been started, and the path towards effective SEC Meme Coin Regulation is likely to be a long and complex one. Summary At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce highlighted that meme coins resemble collectibles and currently lack securities law protections. She proposed creating a dedicated Meme Coin Regulatory Committee to address this gap, acknowledging the unique challenges these assets pose. This suggestion signals a potential shift towards more tailored regulatory approaches for specific crypto categories, aiming to enhance investor protection and market clarity while navigating the complexities of these community-driven, often speculative assets. The path to effective meme coin regulation is challenging but necessary for the evolving digital asset landscape.

The Texas-based company now expects about $9.40 per share for the fiscal year ending January 2026. That’s higher than its earlier estimate and more than what analysts predicted. Dell is making a stunning bet on the future of computing, throwing a mountain of cash at the future of artificial intelligence and big tech collaborations. And that sharp reversal is driving, in part, a surging AI market. In the past quarter alone, the tech firm posted $12.1 billion in orders for AI servers. That is more than it shipped in all of the previous fiscal year. According to Dell COO Jeff Clarke, the demand isn’t showing much sign of slowing. The company is sitting on a $14.4 billion AI backlog, indicating more revenue will come to fruition in subsequent quarters. Clarke described it as an “unprecedented demand” from customers building large and complex AI systems. He added that some delays in delivering systems are simply waiting for new data centers, power, and cooling to go online. Sales grow as Dell taps into AI gold rush For the three months ended May 2, Dell reported $23.4 billion in revenue, a 5% increase from the comparable period a year earlier. That was more than the $23.1 billion average estimate of Wall Street analysts. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to $1.55 per share, which fell short of the $1.69 per share analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Researc h ex pected. The company said it was pleased with its performance and bullish that future quarters would be even better. Dell’s earnings per share and revenue for the current quarter, $2.25 and $29 billion, surpass average market estimates. The increase in AI server orders has been driven by leading customers such as Elon Musk’s xAI and CoreWeave, who use Dell’s high-end servers in growing data centers. The tech firm has been buying back many shares as part of a share repurchase program to add to shareholder value. This reduces the number of shares in circulation, effectively increasing earnings per share. Dell builds flagship supercomputer with Nvidia In a separate huge victory, Dell has partnered with the chipmaker Nvidia to construct a next-generation supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy. Based at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the system will fulfill the most advanced research requirements, from fusion energy to biomolecular modeling, materials design, and even fundamental physics. This move further cements Dell as a key AI and high-performance computing player. Still, challenges remain. AI server sales, which show much promise, are what Clarke referred to as “lumpy.” Outside AI, the consumer PC market continues to woes. In the three months until the end of June, Dell’s consumer PC revenues dropped 19%. Its operating income in that unit — consumer and business machines — fell 16%. Economic uncertainty and persistent tariffs from the United States also hamper parts of the tech industry. On Thursday, HP Inc., a Dell competitor, had its stock drop 8.3% after reducing its profit forecast because of tariffs and slow demand. Curiously, that same day, a United States court panel concluded that most tariffs during the Trump administration ran afoul of the law, despite which they remain in place while the legal process continues. Dell noted that its updated full-year guidance takes into account everything currently known about these tariffs.

45270594,60d74fb7-681c-4fd9-926f-10f6cce443a1,1748570014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/45270594.jpeg,Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht to Bitcoiners: ‘Freedom is Worth the Struggle’,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/29/silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-to-bitcoiners-freedom-is-worth-the-struggle,"LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht has a message for the crypto community: if you want to maintain your freedom, you must remain unified and decentralized, and you must be prepared for a struggle. In a heart-felt keynote speech closing out Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Thursday, Ulbricht, addressing the public in-person for the first time since being released from prison in January, shared a story to illustrate his three guiding principles — freedom, decentralization and unity. Ulbricht explained that, in the early days of the Silk Road, he wanted to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms to stock the darknet marketplace with, so he rented a remote cabin. The cabin, he said, was infested with wasps. He set out to deal with the wasps, using a trick his father had taught him that involved trapping the wasps’ nests under a towel. “My heart was pounding,” Ulbricht said. “I selected the nest that was furthest from the others, because I didn’t know if the other nests would come and sting me, spread out the towel, got as close as I could — ready to flee if I had to — but when I wrapped up the nest, nothing happened. It was as if the other wasps didn’t even notice.” Ulbricht said that the wasps were strong because they were free: “It was impossible to keep track of so many individual wasps, a sting could come from any direction. They were strong because they were decentralized, across seven nests."" But, Ulbricht said, the wasps were ultimately weak because they were not unified, and did not react when their fellow wasps were taken down. “Had a single wasp dared to come sting me when I reached for that first nest, I would have fled … but they didn’t. Thank god you are not wasps,” Ulbricht said. Before being pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump in January — the result of a promise Trump made on the campaign trail in 2024 — Ulbricht spent 12 years behind bars. His speech on Thursday marked the 10-year anniversary, to the day, of a New York judge sentencing the then-31-year-old Ulbricht to two life sentences, plus 40 years, for owning and operating the dark net marketplace. During his keynote speech, Ulbricht, who has been free for four months, still seemed buoyant with his newfound freedom. In a video montage ahead of his appearance on stage, clips of Ulbricht experiencing life outside prison — traveling, surfing, spending time with his wife — played on screen, each showing a beaming Ulbricht. “Winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful,” Ulbricht said, crediting the crypto community for advocating for his release. “I’m free, and it’s because of you. You made this moment possible…Thank you, thank you, thank you.” After more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht likened himself to Rip van Winkle, admitting that he was overwhelmed with all the technological advancements since he went to prison. “There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right, and thousands more I'll never have time to learn about. There's DeFi and Web3 and AI to help me navigate it all. It's nuts,” Ulbricht said. “I mean, just a few months ago, when I walked out of prison, I'd never seen a drone … It's all hitting me at once, freedom, the new technology, the fact that I have a future again.” Ulbricht closed by telling the audience about gangs and factions in prison, saying that he quickly came to understand that the prison wardens like inmates to be divided. “The only times I saw the wardens show respect to the prisoners was when we were united,” Ulbricht said. “Those that oppose decentralization and freedom love it when we’re divided, I promise you, so stay united. So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom, and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united…stay true to these principles and the future is ours.”",Policy|Ross Ulbricht|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 01:53:34
45268937,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164250,1748570113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45268937.jpeg,Exclusive: Cantor Fitzgerald Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Fund with Gold Shield,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cantor-fitzgerald-bitcoin-fund/,"BitcoinWorld Exclusive: Cantor Fitzgerald Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Fund with Gold Shield Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management, a major player in global financial services, is making a significant move with the planned launch of its first Bitcoin fund . This isn’t just any fund; it comes with a unique feature designed to appeal to cautious investors: downside protection linked to the price of gold. What Makes This Bitcoin Fund Unique? Cantor Fitzgerald’s approach stands out. While many funds offer direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, this new five-year fund incorporates a protective mechanism. Here are the key features: Gold-Backed Protection: The fund offers 1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold. This means that for every dollar Bitcoin’s price might fall, the fund aims to offset that loss with a corresponding gain (or reduced loss) tied to gold’s performance. It’s important to note this isn’t physically backed by gold held by the fund, but rather uses financial instruments to achieve a correlation-based hedge. Upside Exposure: Investors still get exposure to the potential upside of Bitcoin’s price appreciation. No Cap on Gains: Unlike some structured products, the fund does not cap the potential profits from Bitcoin’s rise. Five-Year Term: It is structured as a five-year investment vehicle. Targeting Institutions: The fund is primarily aimed at institutional investors, reflecting the growing demand from this segment. This structure attempts to address one of the primary concerns investors have about Bitcoin: its volatility. By linking protection to gold, an asset traditionally seen as a safe haven and store of value, Cantor Fitzgerald is positioning this fund as a potentially less volatile way for institutions to gain crypto exposure. Expanding Institutional Access to Institutional Bitcoin Beyond the new fund, Cantor Fitzgerald is also significantly expanding its Bitcoin financing business. The firm reportedly has up to $2 billion available for institutional clients looking for financing solutions related to Bitcoin. This includes services like: Lending against Bitcoin holdings. Providing capital for Bitcoin-related businesses. Offering prime brokerage services for large crypto trades. This expansion signals Cantor Fitzgerald’s increasing commitment to the digital asset space and its belief in the long-term potential of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Providing robust financing options is crucial for institutions, as it allows them to manage liquidity, leverage positions, and execute complex strategies within the crypto market. Why the Interest in Gold-Backed Bitcoin ? The concept of pairing Bitcoin with gold might seem counterintuitive to some crypto enthusiasts who see Bitcoin as ‘digital gold.’ However, for traditional institutional investors, gold represents stability and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty – qualities they are often seeking when diversifying portfolios. The inclusion of gold-backed Bitcoin protection in this fund is a strategic move by Cantor Fitzgerald to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the nascent crypto world. It offers a familiar concept (gold as a hedge) applied to a new, volatile asset (Bitcoin), potentially making it more palatable for risk-averse institutions or those bound by specific investment mandates. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold prices is not always consistent, and the effectiveness of this protection mechanism will depend on various market factors and the specific instruments used by the fund. However, the intent is clear: to mitigate the sharp downside risks associated with direct Bitcoin investment. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment ? Cantor Fitzgerald’s move is another strong indicator of the maturing crypto investment landscape. As more reputable financial institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald enter the space with tailored products and services, it adds legitimacy and infrastructure necessary for broader institutional adoption. The availability of sophisticated financial products, like funds with built-in protection mechanisms and large-scale financing, lowers the barriers to entry for large firms previously hesitant due to volatility, regulatory uncertainty, or lack of infrastructure. This development could pave the way for other institutions to explore similar hybrid or protected crypto investment products. It highlights the demand for solutions that offer exposure to Bitcoin’s growth potential while addressing the inherent risks in ways that align with traditional finance risk management practices. While the fund is initially focused on institutions, the trend of established financial firms creating diverse crypto products ultimately benefits the entire ecosystem by increasing liquidity, improving market efficiency, and potentially leading to more accessible products for retail investors in the future. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Crypto The actions of firms like Cantor Fitzgerald underscore a significant shift. We are moving beyond just buying and holding Bitcoin to building a comprehensive financial ecosystem around it. The availability of $2 billion in financing demonstrates the scale of capital now being directed towards the sector by major financial players. This infrastructure is vital for the next phase of growth, enabling everything from complex trading strategies to funding for innovation within the blockchain space. Challenges remain, including regulatory clarity and operational complexities. However, the commitment shown by firms like Cantor Fitzgerald suggests that institutions are actively working through these challenges to participate in what they see as a significant opportunity. The blend of traditional assets (like the gold link) with digital assets (Bitcoin) in new financial products is likely a trend we will see continue as the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) continue to blur. Cantor Fitzgerald’s new fund and expanded financing are important steps in making crypto more accessible and manageable for large investors, potentially driving further capital into the market and solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a recognized asset class within the global financial system.

While the market capitalization of Ethereum (ETH) has seen an uptick, the bank’s findings suggest this hasn’t translated into a meaningful boost in core network usage or significant inflows into potential spot ETH ETF products. What Did JPMorgan’s Analysis Reveal About Ethereum? According to details reported by The Block, the core of JPMorgan ‘s assessment revolves around a perceived disconnect between market valuation and on-chain activity. Here’s a breakdown of their key observations: Market Cap vs. Activity: The report acknowledges an increase in Ethereum ‘s market cap, suggesting positive market sentiment or anticipation. However, it notes a lack of corresponding significant growth in fundamental network activity metrics. CME Futures vs. Spot ETFs: A noticeable increase in long positions within the CME ETH futures market was highlighted. This contrasts sharply with the absence of significant inflows into spot ETH ETF s, which are still awaiting approval or broader availability in many key markets. Individual Investor Interest: The divergence between institutional-leaning futures activity and the lack of spot ETF inflows (often seen as a proxy for broader retail/individual interest) led analysts to conclude that individual investor enthusiasm for Ethereum currently remains subdued. This analysis provides a snapshot of how a major financial institution views the current dynamics within the Ethereum ecosystem, focusing on tangible market and on-chain data rather than just price movements. Understanding Ethereum Network Activity and the Pectra Upgrade When analysts like those at JPMorgan talk about Ethereum Network Activity , they are referring to a range of on-chain metrics that indicate how much the network is actually being used. These can include: Transaction Count: The number of successful transactions processed on the network. Active Addresses: The daily or monthly count of unique wallet addresses sending or receiving ETH or interacting with smart contracts. Gas Usage: The total amount of ‘gas’ (the unit of computation on Ethereum) consumed by transactions, reflecting the complexity and volume of operations like DeFi interactions or NFT transfers. Smart Contract Interactions: The number of times users interact with decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or NFT platforms built on Ethereum. A major network upgrade, such as the Pectra Upgrade (referencing the proposed Prague/Electra combination or potentially a recent one like Dencun, depending on the report’s specific timing and terminology), is typically expected to improve the network’s efficiency, scalability, or functionality. These improvements are often anticipated to lead to increased usage, lower costs, and thus, a boost in Ethereum Network Activity . JPMorgan’s report highlights that, in their view, this expected activity surge hasn’t materialized despite the upgrade’s rollout. The Puzzle: Why Low Spot ETH ETF Inflows Despite Futures Interest? The distinction made by JPMorgan between CME ETH futures and spot ETH ETF s is significant. CME futures are primarily utilized by institutional traders and sophisticated investors for hedging or speculating on price movements without holding the underlying asset. Spot ETH ETF s, on the other hand, would hold actual ETH and are often seen as a more accessible investment vehicle for retail investors and traditional financial advisors, offering exposure to the asset class through regulated brokerage accounts. The observed increase in CME futures activity suggests continued institutional interest in having exposure to Ethereum ‘s price. However, the lack of substantial inflows into available or anticipated spot ETH ETF products points to potential hurdles for broader adoption. These hurdles could include regulatory uncertainty (especially in jurisdictions where spot ETH ETFs are not yet approved), lingering caution among traditional investors regarding direct crypto exposure, or simply a lack of strong conviction among individual investors at the current price levels. This divergence supports JPMorgan ‘s conclusion that while institutional players might be engaging with ETH derivatives, the enthusiasm from the wider individual investor base, often targeted by spot ETFs, appears muted. Implications for the Ethereum Network and Investor Sentiment What does JPMorgan ‘s analysis suggest about the current state of the Ethereum Network Activity and investor sentiment? It implies that: Upgrades Alone May Not Drive Adoption: While technical improvements from the Pectra Upgrade are valuable, they might not be sufficient on their own to immediately translate into significantly increased user activity or attract widespread new investment via easily accessible products like spot ETFs. Retail Adoption Remains a Challenge: The path to bringing millions of new individual users and investors onto the Ethereum Network or into ETH investment vehicles still faces considerable obstacles, whether they are related to complexity, perceived risk, or lack of accessible investment products. Institutional vs. Retail Divergence: There appears to be a notable difference in how institutional and retail investors are currently engaging with Ethereum , with institutions seemingly more comfortable with derivatives like futures than individuals are with potential spot investment products. This perspective from a major financial institution serves as a reminder that despite positive developments like network upgrades and increasing market cap, the growth and adoption of the Ethereum Network are complex processes influenced by technology, market structure, regulation, and investor psychology. Looking Ahead: What to Watch For Given JPMorgan ‘s assessment, what should market participants and Ethereum enthusiasts monitor in the coming months? Key indicators will include: Ethereum Network Activity Metrics: Keep an eye on transaction counts, active addresses, and gas usage. A sustained upward trend in these metrics would contradict the report’s findings and signal organic growth. Spot ETH ETF Developments: Regulatory decisions and the actual performance and inflows of spot ETH ETF s in jurisdictions where they are approved will be crucial gauges of individual investor demand. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall health and direction of the crypto market significantly influence activity and investment in individual assets like Ethereum . Impact of Future Upgrades: While the report focused on the period after the referenced upgrade, the long-term effects of Pectra Upgrade features (or subsequent developments) on network usability and cost could still drive activity over time. While JPMorgan ‘s report offers a cautious view, it provides valuable data points for understanding the current landscape. The lack of immediate widespread individual investor enthusiasm via spot ETFs and network activity doesn’t negate Ethereum’s long-term potential but highlights the challenges in translating technical advancements and institutional interest into broad-based adoption. Summary: JPMorgan’s Sobering Take on Ethereum Post-Upgrade In conclusion, JPMorgan ‘s recent report presents a somewhat sobering perspective on Ethereum ‘s performance following the cited Pectra Upgrade . Despite an increase in market valuation and institutional engagement via futures, the bank found little evidence of a significant surge in fundamental Ethereum Network Activity or strong individual investor demand as reflected in spot ETH ETF inflows. This analysis underscores the ongoing journey for Ethereum to translate its technical prowess and market presence into widespread, tangible usage and broad retail investment.

Here’s what could happen next, according to historical trends. Toncoin Open Interest Has Hit Its Highest Since February In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Toncoin. The “Open Interest” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to TON (in USD) that are currently open on all derivatives platforms. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up more positions related to the asset on the market. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when new positions appear, so this kind of trend can lead to higher volatility for the cryptocurrency’s price.

On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests that investors are closing their own positions voluntarily or being forcibly liquidated by their exchange. Either way, the asset can behave in a more stable manner following such a trend due to the drop in leverage. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Toncoin Open Interest over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Toncoin Open Interest has just seen a very sharp spike, a sign that traders have opened up a large number of futures positions. More specifically, the metric’s value has gone up from $143 million to $190 million over the last 24 hours. From the chart, it’s visible that this quick 33% jump initially came as the coin’s price witnessed a rapid increase, but interestingly, it maintained its upward trajectory even as the asset saw a pullback. “Past spikes like this have often preceded corrections – worth watching closely,” notes Glassnode. The last time the Toncoin Open Interest formed this pattern was at the end of March/start of April. What followed back then was a price drawdown of about 32%.

As the analytics firm has pointed out in its latest weekly report, Bitcoin has also been observing a major rise in its Open Interest. As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin Open Interest fell to a low of $36.8 billion in April as the cryptocurrency’s price itself went down. Since then, however, the indicator has shot up by 51% alongside the bull rally, reaching the $55.6 billion mark. The report explains that this suggests “a build up of leverage is underway.” TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.34, up more than 11% in the last 24 hours.

Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, is making waves with its investment strategy. The company’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, recently shared compelling details about how Tether is utilizing its substantial profits, and it involves a major focus on the leading cryptocurrency: Bitcoin . Tether’s Profitable Strategy: Reinvesting in Bitcoin Speaking at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dropped a notable statistic: Tether has generated approximately $20 billion in profits over the past three years. This figure alone underscores the immense scale and success of Tether’s operations within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What’s even more interesting is where these profits are going. According to reports from Odaily covering Ardoino’s comments, a surprisingly small portion—less than 5%—has been allocated to shareholder dividends. This indicates a strong preference for reinvestment back into the business and strategic assets rather than immediate payouts. The vast majority of these profits, the remaining 95%, are being channeled into two primary areas: Expanding Tether’s global distribution network Significant reinvestment in Bitcoin This clear emphasis on acquiring more Bitcoin with company profits signals a bullish stance from one of the most influential entities in the crypto market. It highlights Tether’s confidence not only in its own business model but also in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. Why is Tether Investing Heavily in Bitcoin ? Tether’s decision to allocate a large percentage of its profits towards Bitcoin isn’t entirely new, but the sheer scale revealed by Paolo Ardoino is noteworthy. Tether first publicly disclosed its Bitcoin holdings as part of its reserves in May 2023. At the time, they stated they would regularly allocate up to 15% of their net operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin. This latest announcement suggests that the actual percentage of *total* profits (which would include operating profits, interest income from reserves, etc.) being directed into Bitcoin and growth initiatives is substantially higher than the previously stated 15% of *operating* profits. The $20 billion figure represents the total financial gain over three years. Several factors likely drive this strategy: Diversification: While Tether’s primary reserves back USDT and are largely held in safe, liquid assets like U.S. Treasury bills, allocating a portion of profits to Bitcoin adds a growth-oriented asset to their balance sheet. Potential Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically been a high-performing asset. Investing profits into BTC allows Tether to potentially grow its non-reserve holdings significantly if Bitcoin’s value increases. Alignment with the Crypto Ecosystem: As a cornerstone of the crypto market, holding Bitcoin aligns Tether with the broader digital asset landscape and demonstrates confidence in the technology it serves. Strategic Positioning: Large Bitcoin holdings can enhance Tether’s financial strength and strategic flexibility, separate from the assets specifically backing USDT redemptions. This approach allows Tether to benefit from Bitcoin’s potential upside while maintaining the stability and liquidity required to back the circulating supply of its stablecoin, USDT . Understanding Tether’s Profitability How does Tether generate such massive profits? The primary source of income for Tether comes from the interest earned on the reserves it holds to back the value of USDT . As the circulating supply of USDT has exploded, reaching tens of billions, the reserves have grown proportionally. A significant portion of these reserves is held in interest-bearing instruments, particularly short-term U.S. Treasury bills. With rising interest rates globally over the past few years, the income generated from these reserves has become substantial. This interest income forms a large part of the profits that Paolo Ardoino referenced. Additional revenue streams can include fees from minting/redeeming USDT, although interest income is typically the dominant factor. Here’s a simplified look at the profit allocation based on Ardoino’s statement: Profit Allocation (Past 3 Years) Approximate Amount (Based on $20B Total Profit) Percentage of Total Profit Shareholder Dividends Less than $1 billion Less than 5% Reinvestment (Global Distribution & Bitcoin ) More than $19 billion More than 95% This table clearly illustrates the strong bias towards reinvestment over immediate shareholder returns, a strategy that aligns with long-term growth objectives, including significant Crypto Investment . What Does This Mean for the Market and USDT Holders? Tether’s massive reinvestment strategy has several implications for the broader crypto market and for users of USDT : Potential Bitcoin Price Impact: Consistent, large-scale buying by an entity like Tether adds significant buying pressure to the Bitcoin market. While it’s difficult to isolate Tether’s exact impact, their accumulation is undoubtedly a bullish factor. Signal of Confidence: Tether’s willingness to hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet sends a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and its role as a store of value. Tether’s Financial Strength: By reinvesting profits into potentially appreciating assets like Bitcoin, Tether can further strengthen its overall financial position, separate from the specific assets backing USDT . This could be seen as a positive for the long-term stability of the company, though it doesn’t directly impact the 1:1 peg of USDT, which is backed by specific reserve assets. Increased Scrutiny: Large holdings of volatile assets like Bitcoin, even if held separately from core reserves, may attract increased scrutiny from regulators, who are already focused on stablecoin reserves and operations. For holders of USDT , it’s crucial to remember that the assets backing the stablecoin’s peg are kept separate from Tether’s corporate profits and investments. The value of USDT remains tied to the stability and liquidity of its stated reserves, which are primarily in cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and U.S. Treasury bills. The Bitcoin acquired with profits is part of Tether’s corporate treasury, not the direct backing for every USDT token. Challenges and Considerations While Tether’s aggressive Crypto Investment strategy, particularly into Bitcoin, highlights strong profitability and a bullish outlook, it’s not without potential challenges or points of consideration: Market Volatility: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin exposes Tether’s corporate treasury to the inherent volatility of the crypto market. While this doesn’t directly impact the USDT peg (as BTC is not a primary reserve asset for the peg), significant downturns could affect Tether’s overall financial statements and profitability in future periods. Transparency: While Tether has improved its reporting over the years, the exact timing and scale of their Bitcoin purchases from profits are not always immediately clear, which can lead to speculation.

The market is no longer rewarding coins based solely on hype or historical dominance. Instead, attention is moving toward platforms with real-world applications, modular infrastructure, and developer-friendly tools. At the center of this shift is Qubetics , which has rapidly become one of the best cryptos to buy this week for long-term utility and scalability. Unlike other Layer 1s that chase headlines, Qubetics builds for function. It simplifies blockchain adoption for enterprises, developers, and emerging markets by focusing on interoperability and real-world asset tokenization. That approach sets it apart from Aptos, which is making cautious inroads into healthcare data, and Maker, which is undergoing a rebrand with unclear traction. In an increasingly utility-driven market, Qubetics is consistently named among the best cryptos to buy this week. As the demand for cross-chain efficiency, privacy, and business-ready solutions intensifies, projects like Qubetics are no longer optional—they are essential. This article explores why Qubetics is rising as a top contender among the best cryptos to buy this week, and how Aptos and Maker are attempting to adapt in a rapidly evolving space. Qubetics: Building the Blockchain Tools Businesses Actually Use Qubetics recently secured partnerships across Kazakhstan’s government-led blockchain pilot programs, introducing tools like QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE into regional enterprise infrastructure. This agreement strengthens its positioning as a global blockchain utility provider, not just a speculative crypto asset. Presale Stats Reflect Explosive Growth Qubetics is currently in Stage 36 of its crypto presale , with the token priced at $0.3064. So far, the project has: Sold over 514 million tokens Onboarded 27,200+ holders Raised more than $17.5 million These figures demonstrate a powerful level of early adoption, especially given the project’s focus on solving real-world problems in areas like tokenized finance, privacy infrastructure, and decentralized development tools. Modular Framework, Real Impact Qubetics operates as an all-in-one blockchain development ecosystem tailored for cross-chain applications. It simplifies smart contract creation, dApp deployment, and security auditing with modular tools that require no redundant configurations. Key Highlights: Cross-chain compatible smart contract deployment Drag-and-drop IDE for developers Legal frameworks for tokenizing real-world assets Institutional wallet integrations Unlike most tokens with limited use cases, Qubetics actively helps businesses bridge Web2 and Web3 without needing custom network builds. That focus makes it more than a coin—it’s a developer suite with regulatory foresight. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: Enterprise Privacy on Blockchain Privacy is no longer a luxury—it’s a requirement. Qubetics integrates a decentralized VPN infrastructure that enhances online privacy for businesses and users alike. This system is blockchain-native, creating a revenue model for bandwidth providers while shielding users from centralized surveillance. Decentralized VPN Features: End-to-end encryption using Zero-Knowledge Proofs Monetized participation for node operators Cross-border routing to avoid censorship Integration with the native Qubetics wallet This decentralized VPN feature positions Qubetics not just as a crypto project, but as a privacy-first infrastructure provider, giving it long-term relevance in digital compliance, cloud security, and cross-border communications. Aptos (APT) Inches Up to $5.37 as Trading Volume Jumps 41%, Market Eyes Renewed Upside Potential Aptos (APT), ranked #33 by market capitalization, registered a 0.89% gain in the past 24 hours, reaching $5.37 alongside a sharp 40.88% surge in daily trading volume, which rose to $167.06 million. The project now holds a circulating supply of 632.61 million APT out of a total 1.15 billion, with a market cap of $3.4 billion and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $6.19 billion. While APT still trades 72.91% below its peak price of $19.90 set in January 2023, it has seen a strong 74.6% recovery from its December 2022 low of $3.09.

Despite the price rally, Maker’s market capitalization holds steady at $1.47 billion, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $1.74 billion. The platform’s self-reported circulating supply stands at 847.22K MKR out of a 1 million max supply, and it supports a robust Total Value Locked (TVL) of $5.51 billion—highlighting its foundational role in decentralized finance. Trading between $1,653.38 and $1,769.96 in the past 24 hours, MKR remains 72.46% below its all-time high of $6,339.02 from May 2021, yet it’s recorded a staggering 8,189% gain since its all-time low of $21.06 in January 2017. With a profile score of 74%, Maker continues to be a dominant force in the DeFi space, driving stability through its governance model and the Dai stablecoin ecosystem.

It means that a lot of people that look at Bitcoin are going to be afraid of it. They'll never touch it. They'll never benefit from it. They'll be left behind. Then others will just juggle it. They will juggle the fire. They will make fireworks with the fire. They will create trinkets with the fire. They will create magic tricks with the fire. But those that truly understand it will feed the fire. How do you feed the fire? You feed the fire by buying Bitcoin. “ Saylor — who has taken on a near-mythic status in the bitcoin community for his leadership of Strategy, a publicly-traded technology company-turned-bitcoin treasury company, which holds approximately 3% of the total bitcoin supply — said that people should trade their other, inferior assets for bitcoin. “Take your fiat currency, trade it for bitcoin. Take your long term capital, trade it for bitcoin. Sell your bonds, trade [them] for Bitcoin. Sell your inferior equity, sell your inferior real estate property, buy bitcoin,” Saylor said. “Feed the fire, and what will come of that? An extraordinary explosion in the network and [in] the power of the network, and you will have bought your ticket to prosperity.” Thus was Saylor’s third way to wealth — courage — which he said meant that wealth “favors those who embrace intelligent monetary risk.” Bitcoin, like other assets, rises in price if more people buy it, though Saylor did not mention this effect during his speech. In addition to courage, Saylor advised the audience to have conviction in bitcoin’s potential, to stay committed to one cause, to cooperate with their families and children, to embrace artificial intelligence, to consider civility when engaging with the “natural power structures of the world,” and to remember to be generous. “When you are successful — and you will be successful — get up every morning and spread happiness, share security, and deliver hope to those less fortunate than you,” Saylor said. “You found the path first, you found the way first. You should spread good karma.”",Markets|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy|Strategy|News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 02:16:57

Possible Reasons Behind The Dip Today Macroeconomic Factors: On the macro side, the market sentiment was hit after a second US court blocked President Trump’s proposed tariffs. In addition, Treasury Secretary Bessent confirmed that trade talks with China have stalled — adding uncertainty to global markets, including crypto. Fear & Greed Index Signals ‘Greed’ at 61: The crypto Fear & Greed Index remains at 61 (Greed). Historically, markets tend to cool down after extended periods of greed-driven rallies, and today’s decline fits that pattern.

Analysts said that Bitcoin is currently flashing short-term warning signals as it liquidates long positions. The market is cooling off after weeks of upward momentum, and technical indicators like the Super Trend remain green but are starting to slow in bullish momentum. Ethereum Rejected at Resistance: Ethereum faced rejection from a major resistance zone once again, pulling its price down by over 3.6% in the past 24 hours to trade around $2,609. A slowing MACD on the 3-day timeframe also hints at weakening bullish momentum, raising concerns of a possible bearish crossover in the coming weeks.

The Act proposes comprehensive registration regimes to allow digital asset firms to operate legally within the U.S. market. Lawmakers emphasize the bill’s focus on consumer protection, innovation, and institutional clarity for investors and entrepreneurs. A long-awaited effort to bring order to the murky world of U.S. crypto regulation advanced on Thursday as Representative French Hill introduced the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, also known as the CLARITY Act. The bill arrives with bipartisan support, including three Democratic co-sponsors, and seeks to finally resolve the jurisdictional tug-of-war between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The New Bipartisan Crypto Bill Seeks to End SEC-CFTC Turf War The 236-page bill is a successor to last year’s FIT21 legislation. While stablecoin regulation still leads the race to become the first comprehensive crypto law in the U.S., the CLARITY Act represents a major step forward in shaping broader crypto market structure rules. At its core, the bill gives the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over digital commodity spot markets. These would be governed by new entities registered with the agency. Source: US Congress Crypto platforms would have the option to register with either the CFTC or the SEC, depending on whether they handle digital commodities like Bitcoin or securities, or both. “Our bill brings long-overdue clarity to the digital asset ecosystem and prioritizes consumer protection and American innovation,” said Representative Hill. “It builds off our work in the 118th Congress.” The legislation introduces comprehensive registration regimes, allowing crypto firms to legally operate in the U.S. It also lays out disclosure and compliance requirements for developers and intermediaries. These include detailed project disclosures, segregation of customer funds, and conflict-of-interest mitigation. “The CLARITY Act will deliver clear rules of the road that entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers deserve,” said Representative Ritchie Torres, one of the bill’s backers. Representative Dusty Johnson, who leads the agriculture subcommittee on digital assets, added: “America should be the global leader in the digital assets marketplace, but we can’t do that without establishing a clear regulatory framework.” U.S. Lawmakers Push Crypto Reform Bill Clarifying Custody, Stablecoin, and DeFi Oversight The bill covers long-disputed areas, including the regulation of custodians and decentralized finance (DeFi). It rejects the SEC’s prior attempt to require custody firms to hold customer assets on their own balance sheets. Instead, it sets a standard for “qualified digital asset custodians,” which would be defined by the CFTC based on federal, state, or foreign oversight. NEW: Chairman @RepFrenchHill today introduced the CLARITY Act, a bipartisan bill which would establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US.

The legislation tasks the SEC, CFTC, and the Treasury Department with studying these sectors and reporting back within a year. The Government Accountability Office is also directed to prepare reports on DeFi and NFTs. The bill explicitly exempts some decentralized wallet providers and DeFi platforms from SEC oversight. It also clarifies that payment stablecoins are not securities, placing regulatory authority with whichever agency already oversees the firm engaged in the activity. All told, the CLARITY Act sets a tight one-year timeline for regulators to write and implement the rules if the bill becomes law. That schedule is viewed by some as ambitious, especially given the complexities of financial regulation. Some provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, are still not finalized. NEW: US Digital Asset Market Structure bill, the CLARITY Act: 1. Clarifies CFTC vs. SEC (defining commodities & securities). 2. Unified federal licensing and registration regime. 3. Stablecoin and DeFI carve-outs. https://t.co/ZTosDCUudA pic.twitter.com/OTShEAebrn — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) May 29, 2025 Whether the House and Senate will align on crypto regulation is still unclear. The Senate is expected to resume debate next week on its stablecoin bill , which has made procedural progress but faces partisan concerns . Some lawmakers have floated the idea of combining the stablecoin and market structure bills , though such a move could complicate passage. President Donald Trump has pushed for both bills to reach his desk by the August congressional recess, but crypto insiders in Washington view that timeline as unlikely. For now, the bipartisan CLARITY Act gives lawmakers and regulators a new framework to work with and puts renewed pressure on Congress to end the longstanding confusion over crypto regulation in the United States.

Dogecoin is eyeing a potential run toward $1, while Avalanche hovers around the $30 mark. But while traders wait for breakouts, another project is making quiet strides. BlockDAG, available at just $0.0018 during its presale, has already raised over $276 million. Market predictions point to a future price as high as $20 per coin. This massive price gap is turning heads, suggesting that this may be the most valuable entry point in the current cycle. BlockDAG is not just chasing trends. It is focused on building a reliable foundation for fast, secure, and widely usable blockchain systems. With Dogecoin and Avalanche still performing, BlockDAG echoes their early potential, offering an entry before wider market interest takes hold. AVAX Eyes $40 as Market Momentum and DeFi Growth Build Up Avalanche (AVAX) remains a strong Layer-1 project in 2025, now trading close to $30. Analysts note a solid chart formation, hinting at a possible breakout. If current volumes continue, targets up to $40 may soon be in sight. The rising optimism around AVAX comes from more than just price activity. Its ecosystem is growing steadily through new partnerships and DeFi features. While AVAX has regained some support, it still sits far below its all-time high. The upside is still there, but compared to earlier phases, it now comes with higher risk and smaller rewards. DOGE Prepares for $1 Push but Faces Limited Room to Climb Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold strong, drawing attention with its $1 price target. Recent analysis shows DOGE might be preparing for another upward swing, backed by favorable chart trends and better market sentiment. It has reclaimed the $0.25 range and looks steady before a possible move higher. Large holders are accumulating DOGE, and daily transactions are increasing. These signs point to growing momentum. Still, as a widely known name, its price rise from $0.25 to $1 represents a 4x return. This is solid, but smaller when compared to lesser-known coins trading below $0.01 with more room for growth. Why BlockDAG Is Gaining Market Traction at $0.0018 While top coins like DOGE and AVAX remain in the spotlight, BlockDAG is becoming the standout project of 2025. With over $276 million raised and 21.5 billion coins sold so far, its presale reflects strong interest. The limited-time price of $0.0018 is locked until June 13, even though Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262. This leaves room for a huge potential profit before it reaches its $0.05 launch level. BlockDAG combines DAG speed with blockchain security, making it a hybrid Layer-1 designed for global scalability. The system supports parallel transaction processing and is EVM-compatible, which helps developers move apps with ease. A low-code smart contract tool is included, helping non-technical users build on the network through simple drag-and-drop tools. Beyond software, BlockDAG uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work setup and physical mining gear. Devices such as the X10, X30, and X100 will start mining after the mainnet goes live. This makes the $0.0018 rate especially compelling. For instance, $1,000 buys more than 555,000 BDAG. If the coin reaches $1, that’s $555,000. At $20, it turns into over $11 million. These figures echo the early days of BTC and ETH, making BlockDAG one of the most discussed names this year. BlockDAG Could Lead the Cycle’s Breakout Narrative Dogecoin and Avalanche still offer gains, but their early growth phase is largely behind them. Their performance now tracks with market trends. BlockDAG, however, is just starting and offers real upside for those who act fast. With the price fixed at $0.0018 until June 13, and over $276 million already secured, BlockDAG stands out. Its strong structure, growing reach, and unique features give it a serious edge. The GO LIVE reveal will only boost visibility. For those still waiting, this may be the right moment to look closer before the market fully catches on.

XXRP uses swaps to provide leveraged XRP exposure, but carries heightened risk and volatility compared to spot products. XRP is already more volatile than other digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. So XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. Long-term investors should use the futures ETF or wait for spot XRP ETFs rather than holding leveraged products like XXRP. In my recent coverage of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( OTC:BITW ) for Seeking Alpha, I made note of how it was becoming increasingly possible to mimic the top holdings of that fund but through allocating to various ETFs and closed-end funds in a traditional a self-directed IRA. At 90% combined allocation between Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), spot ETFs are useful tools for self-directing asset weightings. Allocating the 3% exposure to Solana ( SOL-USD ) is also quite easy given the OTC market offers two different closed-end funds as well as a futures-based ETF. 5% of BITW assets are in XRP ( XRP-USD ). Despite the US market lacking spot ETFs or OTC market CEF shares, traders can get exposed to XRP through the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF ( XXRP ). In this article, we'll look at Teucrium's fund details, how it allocates XRP exposure, and why speculators with longer term time horizons should wait for spot ETFs rather than sitting in XXRP shares. Fund Details & Objective The objective of the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF is very simple; XXRP aims to double the return of XRP on a daily basis. To its credit, Teucrium is very overt about the fact that the fund will ultimately lag the performance of XRP over time. We'll detail that a bit more in the risks section later in this article. Believe it or not, XXRP is not the only 2x leveraged XRP ETF in the market today. In the time since my May 21st BITW article , we have seen a second 2x leveraged XRP fund begin trading, with the Volatility Shares 2x XRP ETF ( XRPT ) launching on May 22nd. Here's a straightforward comparison between the funds: Fund Comparison XXRP XRPT Issuer Teucrium Volatility Shares LLC Inception 04/07/2025 05/22/2025 Expense Ratio 1.89% 0.94% AUM $100.24M $1.70M Source: Seeking Alpha With respect to being first to market, the only real advantage XXRP has over XRPT at this point in time is liquidity. With just over $100 million in AUM against less than $2 million for XRPT, traders will likely have a far easier time executing orders at desirable prices through XXRP if they want to go the leveraged fund route. Since these funds are not to be held for longer than a few days or weeks (at most), the expense ratio likely doesn't matter as much as the liquidity difference. But it is worth pointing out that XXRP is roughly double the price of XRPT, purely by the fees associated with holding the funds. XRP Swaps Since there isn't a spot ETF for XRP yet in the US market, XXRP utilizes swap agreements with global financial institutions that allow Teucrium and its counter-parties to make payments based on XRP reference assets or benchmarks. Those could include the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, the CME CF XRP-Dollar Real-Time Index, or a handful of European XRP ETPs that are listed below: 21Shares XRP ETP Bitwise Physical XRP ETP Virtune XRP ETP WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP CoinShares Physical XRP ETP In addition to these 'XRP Swaps,' Teucrium may also hold XRP futures contracts and/or XRP options. But the point is, XXRP doesn't actually provide speculators with direct exposure to XRP. Which is definitely a consideration that US buyers should keep in mind if they want to minimize third-party risk to the degree that they can. That said, for this type of product, that concern is likely minimal. The larger concern is long term decay. 2x Leveraged ETF Risks As is generally the case with every leveraged ETF product in the market today, funds like XXRP are designed for short-term holding rather than long-term investment. For those seeking a tactical trading tool, 2x funds like XXRP can be great. The advantage they have over taking positions with margin is the leveraged funds limit downside. Trading with margin can result in a call to pledge more collateral. However, with leveraged ETFs, a trader can only lose what is put into the position. Furthermore, unlike something like 0DTE options, there is no expiration on leveraged ETF positions. So holding time can be as long as the idea is winning, or the trader has an ability to endure pain. On the latter, Teucrium's prospectus makes it very clear that XXRP is not designed for long-term holding and will ultimately lag the return of XRP if held for too long: The return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of its return for each day compounded over the period. The Fund’s returns for periods longer than a single day will very likely differ in amount, and possibly even direction, from the Fund’s stated multiple (2x) times the return of daily changes in the price of XRP for the same period. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if XRP’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the price of XRP increases. As I've said in my numerous articles covering at least a dozen leveraged ETFs prior to this one, it is imperative that entries and exits in these types of products are timed properly. Sustained periods of chop or sideways action will not help XXRP holders. While the trading history for XXRP is admittedly small since inception in early-April, we can already see how sideways action is bad for the fund: Data by YCharts The chart above shows the price performances of XRP and XXRP since April 28th. The price or XRP is roughly flat at 0.79% over the last month, yet XXRP is down nearly 10%. Some of this is due to the added volatility that comes with a 2x leveraged ETF - that volatility is entirely by design. But the volatility is compounded because XRP itself is also highly volatile. XRP Volatility I've covered XRP based on network fundamentals a handful of times for SA and recently updated that view back in April: For me, the chain usage data is actually pretty encouraging. We see transactions up over time, DAAs making highs, and even fees have noticeably increased in recent months. Still, price is well ahead of all of this action. However, even if one holds the view that XRP is a buy based on their own fundamental framework, it's important to keep in mind that any position in XXRP should likely be expressing more of a technical bull setup than a fundamental one. Crypto is already a highly volatile sector of the market, and when you get into the altcoins that volatility can get more intense. Such is the case with XRP. Volatility XRP BTC ETH 30D 0.61 0.35 0.92 90D 1.08 0.54 0.94 1Yr 0.98 0.49 0.73 Source: Messari The table above shows the volatility metrics for XRP, BTC, and ETH over 30 Day, 90 day, and 1 year time frames. In all but one time frame, XRP is more volatile than ETH and XRP is more volatile than BTC in all three time frames shared. Closing Takeaways Essentially, XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. XRP is already a very volatile asset over just about any time frame that you look at. Factor in leverage from a fund like XXRP, and we're talking about a financial product that must be actively managed by the trader who holds it. This is not a product that should be held for longer than a few days, in my view. Thus, timing the buy properly is imperative. For investors who want exposure to XRP without leverage, they can consider the Volatility Shares XRP ETF ( XRPI ) as an alternative. That fund utilizes futures contracts without the leverage to mimic XRP returns and was launched the same day as XRPT.",XRP-USD|XXRP,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-30 03:04:29

The total crypto market value slipped by 3.1%, now standing at $3.35 trillion. This sudden dip came after a U.S. court overturned President Trump’s trade tariffs, creating fresh uncertainty for investors. The Court of International Trade ruled that Trump had overstepped the powers granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act when placing those import tariffs. While the Trump administration has already filed an appeal, the decision rattled financial markets — and cryptocurrencies felt the impact as well. What’s Happening with XRP’s Price? Right now, XRP risks falling by another 16% to around $1.96 if it can’t stay above a key support level at $2.31, which is backed by the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This is making traders nervous because some early warning signs are showing up in the market. Bearish Signs in the Data A couple of things are raising red flags for XRP: Funding rates for XRP have been stuck around 0% since February. This means traders aren’t really bullish or bearish — they’re undecided. And when there’s no clear direction, prices often move sideways or dip. Open interest (the total value of active XRP futures contracts) has dropped by 9.66%, falling from a 3-month peak of $3.52 billion on May 13th to $3.2 billion now. This shows investors are pulling out their money and cutting risk on XRP. XRP ETPs saw their biggest weekly outflow of $37.2 million. This broke an incredible 80-week streak of steady inflows.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another decline if it fails to clear the $2.2440 level. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to clear the $0.3550 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.3000 and $0.280 support levels. The price even dipped below the $0.220 support level. A low was formed at $0.2132 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.220 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.3540 swing high to the $2.2132 low. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.2440 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.3540 swing high to the $2.2132 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.270 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance or even $2.3650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.420. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.270 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.180 level. The next major support is near the $2.160 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.160 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.080 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.180 and $2.160.

Does this dismissal, signed jointly by both sides, indicate a new era for crypto oversight under the Trump administration? The SEC’s case, filed in June 2023, had accused Binance Holdings, BAM Trading Services, BAM Management U.S. Holdings, and former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, and enabling trading in unregistered securities. SEC Dismisses Civil Case Against Binance and Changpeng Zhao The SEC voluntary dismissal , filed jointly with Binance with prejudice in Washington, D.C., means the regulator cannot revive these charges, marking a major shift in U.S. crypto policy and enforcement. Source: CourtListener According to the court document, the SEC stated, “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter, the Commission believes the dismissal of this Litigation is appropriate.” While the regulator provided no further explanation, it did clarify in its litigation release that the move does not necessarily reflect its stance on other cases. Over the past several months, the case had remained in limbo. In April 2025, the SEC and Binance requested a stay , followed by extension requests, suggesting shifting priorities and behind-the-scenes negotiations. The dismissal follows a turbulent 2023 for Binance, which included a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over Bank Secrecy Act violations. Zhao and Binance admitted to criminal wrongdoing as part of that settlement and agreed to overhaul compliance protocols. In a tweet celebrating the SEC’s decision, Binance called it “a huge win,” adding, “Thank you to Chairman Atkins and the Trump team for pushing back against regulation by enforcement.” Huge win for crypto today. The SEC’s case against us is dismissed. Thank you to Chairman Atkins & the Trump team for pushing back against regulation by enforcement. U.S. innovation is back on track – and it’s just the beginning. — Binance (@binance) May 29, 2025 Thursday’s court filing also referenced the SEC’s newly formed crypto task force , which has recently engaged with industry stakeholders. The task force indicates a potential shift in the agency’s regulatory strategy under evolving political and administrative leadership, particularly in contrast to the aggressive enforcement style seen during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. While the SEC may be recalibrating its crypto policy direction, it remains unclear how this dismissal might influence other ongoing or future enforcement actions. For Binance and Zhao, however, the end of this legal chapter marks a significant win as they explore continued global regulatory challenges. Policy Reset: SEC Retreats from Enforcement-Led Crypto Regulation The SEC’s dismissal of its lawsuit against Binance is part of the shift in regulatory posture under the Trump administration, marked by a move away from aggressive enforcement and toward more structured policymaking in the crypto space. In recent months, the SEC has either settled or dropped multiple high-profile cases involving other major industry players. Coinbase , ConsenSys , and Kraken all reached settlements earlier this year. Investigations into Circle, Immutable, and others were quietly closed without further action. The SEC officially dropped its cases against Consensys, Kraken, and Cumberland DRW as the agency shifts its regulatory approach. #CryptoRegulation #CryptoPolicy #SEC https://t.co/pn7Utn0XLL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 28, 2025 Lawsuits against Uniswap and OpenSea have also been withdrawn, significantly softening the agency’s stance.

According to a Thursday announcement, Fastex will offer spot crypto trading services of tokens including bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, Cardano ADA, Solana SOL and its native utility token, Fasttoken FTN, to both retail and institutional investors in the U.S. Fastex’s American expansion comes as the U.S. continues to overhaul its approach to crypto regulation under President Donald Trump’s administration. Since Trump took office in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has retreated from the so-called regulation-by-enforcement approach to crypto it took under former Chair Gary Gensler, dropping a host of open investigations and closing ongoing litigation against crypto exchanges. In an interview with CoinDesk at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Fastex’s Chief Legal Officer and board member Vardan Khachatryan said that the SEC’s softened stance toward crypto regulation played a major role in the exchange’s decision to expand in the U.S., though he acknowledged that there is still no concrete legal framework for crypto in the country. “There has been enough of a policy change, at least in terms of [how the U.S. government is] viewing things, that allowed us to go for this,” Khachatryan said. “It’s still kind of a risk, but it’s a lower risk.” With a host of crypto companies returning to the U.S. due to the Trump Administration's crypto-friendly policies, cities like New York are hoping to attract companies expanding to the U.S. to set up shop in their jurisdictions. But, while Khachatryan said New York would be “the right place to be in terms of headquarters,” he said that, for now, the prospect of obtaining a BitLicense — the notoriously difficult-to-obtain crypto license issued by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) — is prohibitive. “I hope that things will change a bit,” Khachatryan said. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has branded himself the “Bitcoin Mayor” in an attempt to lure crypto companies to New York, called for the end to the BitLicense regime during a speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance published a staff statement — the latest in a series from the regulator — spelling out how the regulator may evaluate proof-of-stake networks, mainly noting that covered activities do not ""involve the offer and sale of securities"" — meaning the SEC won't sue any person or company participating in those activities. Node operators and validators, custodians, delegates, nominators and entities staking assets either on their own, staking directly with a third party or staking on behalf of an asset's owners fall into this bucket, the staff statement said. In this, the SEC seems to suggest that staking will be treated identically to mining, the consensus mechanism securing networks like Bitcoin BTC, which the SEC clarified also did not implicate securities laws in a similar staff statement last month. The SEC's staff statement was ""very clear for a subject that can be a little bit complicated,"" said Lorien Gabel, the CEO of staking-focused crypto firm Figment. And its main upside appears to be saying that various activities U.S. companies might have shied away from in the past are okay now. ""They included some ancillary staking activities. For example, we provide insurance around slashing [and we also provide] modified unbonding periods ,"" he said. ""And they said that actually doesn't mean that you're a manager of assets as a staking provider."" The SEC statement said companies that want to provide those types of services, or even pooled staking, can do so, he said. Thursday's statement is an incremental but important update from the regulator, said Alison Mangiero, the head of staking policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation. ""This reaffirms that there's going to be similar treatment for stakers that there is for miners. And I think it's especially important because, given under [former SEC Chair Gary] Gensler, there were so many enforcement actions that were focused on staking as a service … we saw a lot of those cases dismissed, and the Coinbase case dismissed with prejudice,"" she said. ""We assumed that this would be the stance, but actually having a staff statement that asserts it, I think is crucially important."" The fact it came just days before the SEC faces a deadline on a number of applications to bring staking into spot ether ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is telling, she said. It's likely that the ETF providers would have received staking approvals regardless, but the SEC statement will likely start speeding up the process for securing those approvals, Gabel said. As with the SEC's previous staff statements, Thursday's included a footnote clarifying that it is very narrowly tailored and certain restrictions would apply. It is not a replacement for rulemaking done through the actual commissioners and ""has no legal force or effect,"" the footnote said. ""This statement only addresses certain activities involving Covered Crypto Assets that do not have intrinsic economic properties or rights, such as generating a passive yield or conveying rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business enterprise,"" another footnote said.",News Analysis|SEC|Staking|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 03:24:48
45271692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=761530,1748575802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45271692.jpeg,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls at $108K as Key Risk Metric Flashes Red, Is Correction Looming?",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rally-stalls-at-108k-as-key-risk-metric-flashes-red-is-correction-looming/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has recently experienced a slight slowdown after its impressive upward run, trading at $108,012 at the time of writing. Over the past week, Bitcoin has recorded a 3.1% decline, indicating a moderate pullback from recent highs. However, despite this short-term downtrend, the asset continues to hold steady above significant support levels, suggesting minimal selling pressure from market participants. Amid the current pullback phase, analysts have started to express caution regarding Bitcoin’s immediate outlook. In particular, one CryptoQuant analyst known by the handle Crazzyblockk highlighted the emergence of an elevated market risk signal through the “Standardized 60-Day Realized Cap Volatility (RCV)” metric. This indicator, frequently monitored by investors to assess risk levels, has reportedly crossed a critical historical threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Understanding the Elevated Risk Signal The 60-Day Standardized RCV, as explained by Crazzyblockk, measures the variance between Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, essentially the cumulative value at which all coins last moved, and its market capitalization. This metric is normalized to account for volatility, thus helping investors detect significant shifts in market sentiment. Currently, the Standardized RCV value has reached 1.9, surpassing the 1.5 threshold traditionally viewed as indicative of high market risk. Historically, when the 60-Day Standardized RCV exceeds values between 1.5 and 1.9, it has often preceded local market peaks or considerable corrections. According to the analyst, these elevated readings indicate periods when investor behavior, characterized by increased profit-taking and speculative activities, diverges notably from Bitcoin’s fundamental valuation. Implications for Bitcoin Investors The current Standardized RCV reading suggests that Bitcoin’s market might be approaching a point of heightened caution. Although this indicator alone is not a definitive sell signal, it does suggest investors should adopt a more conservative risk management approach, especially in regard to new positions or leveraged trades. This cautious stance aligns with historical data from other widely monitored metrics like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), both of which currently reflect similarly heightened risk levels. For investors, the present scenario necessitates careful consideration of market conditions before making strategic moves. The Standardized RCV indicator serves as a precise gauge to navigate market volatility, advising investors to consider reducing exposure, tightening stop-losses, or potentially waiting for a clearer alignment of price with underlying fundamentals before making substantial commitments. Crazzyblockk noted: Now is a time for risk management, not euphoria. Investors may consider reducing exposure, tightening stops, or awaiting a retest of fundamentals before re-entry. Standardized RCV continues to be a precision tool in navigating crypto volatility.

However, these instruments must be non-deliverable, meaning investors won’t be able to hold the digital assets; instead, they will only receive payouts based on price movements. Strict Risk Controls In a May 28 press release , the central bank confirmed that Russian financial institutions are now allowed to issue financial derivatives, digital financial assets (DFAs), and other securities pegged to cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, access to these offerings is strictly limited to investors who meet certain legal criteria, with the general public remaining excluded. The financial regulator has also adopted a conservative risk approach. Credit institutions must fully back such positions with capital and implement individual exposure limits. These measures are meant to reduce the impact of crypto price fluctuations and prevent broader financial risks, with plans of formalizing the requirements within the year. Despite this update, the Bank of Russia is maintaining its broader opposition to cryptocurrencies and will continue to advise against direct investment in them. Broader Efforts to Advance Crypto Regulation This move follows similar efforts to create a legal framework for digital assets in Russia. The government is currently reviewing proposals from the monetary authority for a pilot program that would restrict crypto transactions to certain categories of investors. To qualify, participants must hold at least $1.1 million in securities and deposits or have earned over $570,000 in the previous year. The pilot, introduced in March, is expected to run for three years if approved and could play a key role in shaping the future of digital asset use within Russia’s financial system. Similarly, the Russian Finance Ministry and the national bank have begun laying the foundation for a government-run crypto exchange that is expected to launch in the coming months. According to local media reports, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed that the initiative would support the legalization of crypto use and bring digital transactions under regulatory oversight. The exchange will operate within the country’s experimental legal framework for financial innovation and will be open only to a limited group of approved investors for conducting regulated crypto transactions. Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov also highlighted that the platform could be developed using existing financial infrastructure or by newly licensed entities. Meanwhile, Russia continues to use cryptocurrency in oil trade with India and China. Last year, Siluanov confirmed that domestic businesses have been using digital assets to work around economic sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

The regulator said that Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX and XT.COM were found to be operating without a license. All five platforms have been accused of offering trading services to Thai users without authorization through their websites. As a result, legal action has been initiated with the Economic Crime Suppression Division. This is “to protect investors and prevent illegal platforms from being used for money laundering by criminals,” the SEC said in a translated statement. The Thailand SEC announced that it will block cryptocurrency exchanges Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX and XT platforms on June 28, 2025, and initiate legal proceedings against them for being unlicensed digital asset business operators. https://t.co/VeOM7onr3M — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 Regulators Now Armed with Legal Tools to Target Offshore Crypto Operators The action follows months of increasing regulatory pressure. In response to rising concerns, Thailand passed new anti-cybercrime legislation in April. This law empowered the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society to quickly block suspicious websites and platforms. More specifically, the Royal Decree on the Prevention and Suppression of Technological Crime came into effect that month. As a result, authorities were granted broader powers to shut down unlicensed digital services targeting Thai users. Since then, the government has intensified enforcement . It is now focusing on crypto exchanges that operate outside the country’s legal framework. Crypto Platforms Face Tighter Rules as Thailand Tests Blockchain in Public Finance This move is part of a wider effort by Thai regulators to clean up the local crypto market. To support this shift, the Ministry of Finance introduced G-Token , a blockchain-based investment token, last month. It allows retail investors to purchase government bonds. Notably, the $150m issuance marks Thailand’s first attempt at tokenized public fundraising. According to, Jomkwan Kongsakul, deputy secretary-general of the SEC, the G-Token would launch through an approved initial coin offering portal. In this setup, the Finance Ministry will serve as registrar. However, the SEC has said that G-Tokens cannot be used as a medium of exchange. This restriction clearly separates regulated digital assets from the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading. At the same time, regulators have tightened rules for digital asset firms. These include stricter customer screening, faster suspension of suspicious accounts, and more support for fraud victims. Further, under the new law, the scope of accountability has widened. Banks, telecom firms and social media platforms can also be held liable if they fail to prevent cybercrime on their networks.

The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Thursday that it has designated Funnull Technology, along with its administrator, Liu Lizhi, for supporting cyber-enabled investment fraud operations, often known as “ pig butchering” scams . “Today’s action underscores our focus on disrupting the criminal enterprises, like Funnull, that enable these cyber scams and deprive Americans of their hard-earned savings,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Michael Faulkender. Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Funnull Technology Inc., a Philippines-based company that provides computer infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of websites involved in virtual currency investment scams, commonly known as… — Treasury Department (@USTreasury) May 29, 2025 US Treasury Links Funnull to Infrastructure Behind Widespread Crypto Fraud According to the Treasury, Funnull provided technical infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of scam websites. Many of these sites were tied to crypto fraud. In particular, they targeted Americans through fake investment schemes. The company allegedly bought IP addresses in bulk from cloud service providers. It then sold them to cybercriminals. These actors used the infrastructure to host scam websites and other malicious content. Moreover, investigators say Funnull’s infrastructure supported many platforms flagged in crypto scam reports to the FBI. Victims of these scams reported average losses of more than $150,000. Typically, the scams rely on false identities and scripted conversations. These are used to build trust with victims. Eventually, the victims are persuaded to invest in fake digital assets through counterfeit platforms that display falsified returns. Authorities Say True Victim Losses Likely Much Higher Than Reported The schemes are increasingly operated by criminal organizations based in Southeast Asia. Some of these groups reportedly use trafficked labor to carry out the scams. Once a victim refuses to invest more, the scammer cuts off communication. At that point, the entire investment vanishes. Meanwhile, Funnull allegedly used domain generation algorithms to create large volumes of deceptive website names. It also distributed web design templates that helped scammers quickly launch new fraudulent sites. In 2024, the company was found to have altered a widely used code repository. This modification redirected traffic from legitimate websites to scam and gambling platforms, some of which are linked to money laundering networks. In addition, the Treasury said Liu Lizhi managed internal operations at Funnull. He kept spreadsheets tracking employee performance, assigned tasks, and domain usage tied to fraudulent activity, including phishing and gambling sites. To support detection efforts, the FBI, working in coordination with the Treasury, plans to release a cybersecurity advisory. It will include technical details to help identify infrastructure linked to Funnull. Finally, authorities warn that reported losses may severely understate the true scale of damage. Many victims of online scams never report the crime.

Unlike traditional bonds secured by fiat currency, BitBonds will be backed by Bitcoin, offering potential returns tied directly to BTC’s performance. It’s still unclear if interest payments will be in Bitcoin or fiat, but the move signals a growing embrace of digital assets in mainstream finance. $552 million worth of BitBonds announced BTC-backed bonds mark a new era in municipal finance Investors can leverage Bitcoin to fund NYC projects Navigating Regulation as NYC Bets on Crypto Of course, this bold move isn’t without challenges. New York’s tough BitLicense rules could complicate the rollout, with critics arguing that such regulations stifle innovation. Adams, however, is pushing for more flexible policies to support crypto adoption. To make this happen, he’s set up a Crypto Council to guide digital asset strategies and position NYC as a global hub for crypto innovation. On the national front, crypto momentum is building. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order established a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, acquiring about 200,000 BTC to promote government-driven Bitcoin adoption.

The token has dropped over 75% from its February high near $3 and is currently sitting at $0.6894, down 6% in the last 24 hours and 15% over the week. Pi Coin Stuck In Tight Range With Bearish Trends Pi is currently stuck in a tight range between $0.688 and $0.816, and is hovering above key support levels. Despite the price dip, trading volume is up 42% in the past day to $158 million. But on-chain data reveals rising exchange inflows, a sign that more Pi is being prepared for selling as 263 million Pi coins will be unlocked in June, 233 million in July, and 132 million in August. The coin’s trend remains bearish with all key moving averages (10, 20, 50, 100-day EMAs and SMAs) sitting above the current price. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, and the MACD is negative. RSI is also neutral at 43.6. Unless the Pi breaks above the $0.75-$0.78 resistance range, the next key support levels are $0.60 and $0.50. If the buying volume picks up, it could retest the $0.85-$0.85 zone. However, on the flip side, it could stay stuck between $0.70 and $0.76 through May 31. Will Pi Rebound Above $1? As the first half of the year comes to a close, Pi could face more selling pressure if fear and doubt grip the market. This could push the price to $0.58-$0.65 in the short term. According to CoinDCX , if the buyer interest returns and volume picks up, it has a chance to rebound toward the $1.00-$1.20 level. If there is momentum, it could even finish June at $1.82 . The price of Pi will likely continue to decline until the end of August, after which it may slowly start to recover.

45275195,https://coinpaper.com/9372/institutional-interest-in-xrp-grows-with-hyperscale-lending-platform-and-cme-futures,1748583000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Institutional Interest in XRP Grows with Hyperscale Lending Platform and CME Futures,https://coinpaper.com/9372/institutional-interest-in-xrp-grows-with-hyperscale-lending-platform-and-cme-futures,"Enterprise blockchain adoption is giving XRP a fresh institutional push as two new developments spotlight the token’s growing utility in both lending and derivatives markets. US-based data center operator Hyperscale Data has announced plans to invest up to $10 million in XRP to support the launch of a blockchain-based lending platform tailored to public companies listed on major US stock exchanges. At the same time, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has seen a strong response to its recently launched XRP futures contracts, which recorded $86.6 million in trading volume during their first week, with nearly half of that activity occurring outside US trading hours. Hyperscale Data Bets on XRP With $10M Allocation for Enterprise Lending Platform Hyperscale Data, a prominent US data center operator, is making a bold leap into decentralized finance (DeFi) with plans to purchase up to $10 million worth of XRP as it prepares to launch a blockchain-based enterprise lending platform in Q3 2025. The initiative, led by its investment arm Ault Capital Group (ACG), targets publicly listed companies and represents a significant push toward integrating tokenized digital assets into traditional financial operations. A Blockchain Lending Platform for Listed Corporations At the heart of the initiative is a novel XRP-powered lending system designed specifically for US public companies listed on the NYSE, NYSE American, and NASDAQ. Initially rolling out in beta, the platform will enable eligible firms to borrow XRP on custom terms, secured either by traditional collateral or via convertible instruments tied to the borrower's registered equity. According to Hyperscale, this lending mechanism will provide corporations with an alternative liquidity option—especially appealing to firms seeking blockchain-native solutions without sacrificing the regulatory rigor and transparency demanded by public markets. The company confirmed that all lending operations will be built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a blockchain network widely known for its fast settlement speeds and low transaction costs. These technical advantages, Hyperscale believes, make XRPL uniquely suited for high-throughput enterprise applications. To manage volatility, Ault Capital Group plans to use XRP futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as a hedge. This strategic move aligns the firm with institutional-grade risk management practices, allowing them to maintain operational stability even during periods of crypto market turbulence. Conditional Rollout Based on Market and Regulatory Clarity While Hyperscale Data’s XRP acquisition signals strong confidence in blockchain finance, the company was careful to note that the platform’s launch schedule and scale remain subject to regulatory and market conditions. Any substantial shifts in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on XRP or broader crypto regulations could impact the project’s progress. The company emphasized that it is closely monitoring the regulatory environment and stands ready to adjust the scope or timing of the project as needed. Despite potential roadblocks, Hyperscale Data’s commitment to investing up to $10 million in XRP positions it among the first institutional players to bring tokenized finance directly into the public equity sphere. While other blockchain lending protocols have primarily targeted crypto-native users or retail borrowers, Hyperscale’s approach signals a shift toward enterprise-grade DeFi infrastructure. If successful, this initiative could create a new financial pipeline for public companies, offering greater flexibility in capital structuring, while also validating blockchain as a serious tool for traditional finance. Ripple Effect on XRP’s Institutional Appeal The announcement may also mark a turning point for XRP itself, which has long been associated with cross-border payments but has struggled to gain widespread institutional lending adoption amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the United States. A structured, compliant use case like Hyperscale’s platform could enhance XRP’s legitimacy in the eyes of traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, Hyperscale’s infrastructure advantage as a data center operator may enable smoother integration between off-chain enterprise systems and on-chain transactions—another potential draw for publicly listed firms wary of crypto’s technical and regulatory complexities. As the world of traditional finance and decentralized technologies continue to converge, Hyperscale Data’s XRP-backed lending platform represents a bold experiment with institutional ramifications. By targeting publicly traded firms and layering crypto-native innovation with regulatory awareness and traditional hedging strategies, the company may be laying the groundwork for a new era of blockchain-based capital markets infrastructure. CME’s XRP Futures See $86M in First Week as Global Traders Fuel Non-US Demand In related news, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has successfully launched regulated XRP futures, marking another significant step in the maturation of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. Just one week after their debut, the futures have registered $86.6 million in volume, with a notable share of activity driven by international participants outside of US trading hours, according to a CME spokesperson. This early traction shows XRP’s global utility as a cross-border payments asset and the growing appetite among institutions and traders to gain regulated exposure to it without the need to hold the underlying tokens directly. Strong Global Demand and Off-Hours Activity Data shows a total of 4,032 contracts were traded during the first six trading days, with 46% of that volume occurring during non-US trading hours. The spokesperson further emphasized that a substantial portion of the participation came from outside the US, reflecting XRP’s status as a truly international digital asset. The high levels of engagement during non-US sessions point to demand from regions such as Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, where Ripple’s technology and XRP’s use in payment corridors have seen considerable adoption. CME’s XRP futures contracts come in two formats: a standard contract representing 50,000 XRP and a micro contract representing 2,500 XRP. Both contracts are cash-settled and derive their pricing from the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time. This structure allows institutional and professional traders to gain price exposure to XRP without the operational or custodial complexities associated with owning the token directly. It also offers an opportunity to hedge existing crypto positions or speculate on future price movements within a secure, regulated environment. XRP’s Unique Position in Cross-Border Finance XRP has long been positioned as a payments-focused cryptocurrency, designed to facilitate fast, cheap, and scalable international money transfers. Ripple , the fintech firm behind its development and ecosystem support, utilizes XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in solutions like RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL)—services adopted by banks and remittance providers across multiple continents. The release of futures products on CME, the largest derivatives exchange globally, represents institutional validation of XRP’s market relevance and liquidity, despite lingering regulatory ambiguity in the US. The timing of this launch may also prove strategic, as regulatory frameworks around crypto derivatives continue to evolve in the US and abroad. With CME’s strict compliance requirements and oversight, these XRP futures provide institutions a way to access the asset class within regulated parameters, a significant factor for fund managers and corporate traders seeking risk-managed exposure. The international interest also signals broader trends in tokenized payments and blockchain-based financial rails, which continue to gain traction amid calls for faster, more transparent cross-border settlements. What This Means for XRP’s Market Dynamics The immediate success of XRP futures on CME could have broader implications for the digital asset’s market structure. Increased futures trading often correlates with improved price discovery, greater liquidity, and a more diverse participant base. It may also pave the way for future financial products such as ETFs or structured notes tied to XRP’s performance. Moreover, the global participation, nearly half of which occurred during non-US hours, reaffirms XRP’s importance beyond US borders, where regulatory hurdles have not been as pronounced.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 05:30:00

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the Division’s remarks apply to persons who self-stake certain covered crypto assets on a PoS network. Proof-of-stake network mechanisms are structured to incentivize users to voluntarily coordinate and cooperate to secure the network. The U.S SEC noted that uncertainty about regulatory views on staking discouraged Americans from doing so for fear of violating securities laws. The agency said the uncertainty also constrained participation in network consensus and undermined the decentralization, censorship resistance, and credible neutrality of PoS blockchains. U.S SEC aims to provide clarity for digital asset stakers in the U.S. 1/ Today the @SECGov issued guidance on activities involving ""staking"" / proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. As in its POW/mining guidance, the SEC affirmed that participation in protocol staking activities does not require registration under the securities laws. pic.twitter.com/zArQ5lz8KD — Rebecca Rettig (@RebeccaRettig1) May 29, 2025 The Division of Corporation Finance acknowledged on May 29 that proof-of-stake blockchain staking activities are not considered security transactions within the confines of the federal securities laws. The U.S SEC noted that the Division’s statement aims to provide clarity for stakers and staking-as-a-service providers in the U.S. The agency also mentioned that the Division’s remark applies to persons who self-stake certain covered digital assets on a proof-of-stake or delegated PoS network. The SEC’s statement also applies to non-custodial and custodial staking-as-a-service providers that facilitate PoS staking on behalf of others. According to the U.S SEC , the statement explains that pairing certain ancillary services with non-custodial or custodial staking services does not make providing staking services a securities offering. The government entity also noted that ancillary services include the provision of slashing coverage, which allows digital assets to be returned to a staker before the end of the protocol’s unbounded period. The provision also delivers earned rewards based on an alternative rewards payment schedule and in alternative amounts. The Division added that slashing coverage aggregates stakers’ virtual assets together for the purpose of satisfying a network’s minimum staking requirements. “I expect that the Division and Crypto Task Force will continue to develop views about security status for other activities, products, and services involving participation in network consensus.” – Hester Peirce , Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Chief legal officer at Jito Labs Rebecca Retting argued that the SEC’s conclusion cleared the path for crypto exchange-traded funds to include staking in their products. The SEC has been making efforts to offer more clarity to crypto regulation since the departure of former Chair Gary Gensler. During Gensler’s reign, the agency had taken issue with staking services from Kraken, Coinbase, and Metamask. U.S SEC says PoW doesn’t implicate U.S. securities laws Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the agency has dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players and re-examined rules affecting the crypto space. Republican acting Chair Mark Uyeda has also created a crypto task force to be led by fellow Commissioner Hester Pierce. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw noted that it has been four months since the launch of the agency’s Crypto Task Force, which she believes will deliver a clear regulatory framework. Crenshaw argued that the SEC’s approach doesn’t promote clarity but continues to sow uncertainty around what the law is and what parts of it the Commission is willing to enforce, which she said is bad for investors and the markets. The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance also clarified on March 20 that proof-of-work mining activities are not considered securities activities. The agency added that it’s the Division’s view that participants in mining activities do not need to register transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration in connection with mining activities. The agency referred to the Howey Test – 1945 U.S. Supreme Court case frequently cited by the U.S SEC to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and, therefore, a security – to form its conclusion on Thursday. The Commission argued that a miner’s self-mining is not undertaken with expectations of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The SEC believes that rather, a miner contributes its computational resources, which secure the network and enable the miner to earn rewards. The agency added that mining pools do not expect profits, just like mining. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Football Remains Most Popular Sport for Crypto A recent study by Sport Quake said that football made up 43% of all crypto and digital asset sponsorship for the 2024/25 season. This has resulted in a 64% year-over-year increase in the total amount of sponsorships. “All the growth is from football (soccer) and non-US spend as brands invest in global sponsorships and international markets while they wait to see President Trump’s US crypto policies,” said Matt House, CEO of SportQuake. Further, 44% of all crypto football sponsorships happen within Europe’s top five leagues, including France’s Ligue 1. PSG’s decision to venture into crypto accumulation follows a growing trend among corporations to include Bitcoin in their balance sheets. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin, Crypto is Accelerating Bitcoin has become a treasury preference for more companies and brands, following President Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve order, which helped clear the path. Dom Harz, Co-Founder of BOB (Build on Bitcoin), told Cryptonews that “ETFs have a lot to do with” the adoption. “The most interesting change we’ve seen over the last two years is the mood shift between Bitcoin once being a speculative bet and now being a strategic play for corporations,” he said via email. “From a corporate point of view, there is massive appeal. They would have a passive yield on their assets, and it offers them diversity from traditional investments.” The post Football Team Paris Saint-Germain Scores Bitcoin Treasury Strategy appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-30 05:34:35

This development aligns with the momentum behind the GENIUS Act,which is a bipartisan US bill that seeks to regulate stablecoins by enforcing 1:1 dollar backing, AML compliance, and reserve asset protections. If passed, the act could reinforce the US dollar’s dominance in digital finance. Meanwhile, India is expanding its digital rupee trials by focusing on programmability and offline use cases to increase accessibility. These global moves suggest stablecoins and CBDCs are becoming core pillars of the future financial infrastructure. Santander Eyes Stablecoin Launch Banco Santander SA, one of the world’s leading global banking institutions, is reportedly considering expanding its cryptocurrency services to retail clients, including the potential launch of its own stablecoin. The move is part of a trend among major financial institutions toward embracing blockchain-based financial products in light of a changing regulatory climate in the United States. According to a May 29 Bloomberg report , Santander is exploring both US dollar and euro-pegged stablecoins, although plans are still in early development. This latest development places Santander alongside other major US banks— like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo—that are reportedly exploring similar initiatives thanks to more favorable regulatory conditions under the administration of President Donald Trump. The shift in tone emboldened banks to consider launching fiat-pegged tokens that could accelerate payments, promote financial inclusion, and enhance global capital access for small businesses. Supporters of the trend argue that stablecoins can extend the global reach of the US dollar, streamline cross-border transactions, and democratize access to financial systems by banking the unbanked and reducing friction in traditional remittance flows. However, the broader banking industry is still quite divided on the issue. While some institutions view stablecoins as an opportunity to innovate, others fear they could erode traditional banking profits and market share, especially if these tokens begin offering interest-like yields. Overview of the stablecoin market (Source: RWA.xyz ) Banking lobbyists, supported by several US senators, have resisted legislation that will make it easier to issue or distribute yield-bearing stablecoins. This is mostly due to concerns over the destabilizing effects they could have on retail banking. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand spoke at the DC Blockchain Summit in March of 2025, and questioned whether allowing stablecoin issuers to pay interest might encourage depositors to abandon traditional banks, thus threatening their ability to provide loans to local businesses and households. NYU professor Austin Campbell argued that yield-bearing stablecoins disrupt the core mechanics of modern retail banking, particularly the low-interest deposit model that is foundational to the fractional reserve system. Campbell criticized efforts to curtail such products, and suggested that only entrenched interests stand to gain from blocking innovation. Stablecoin Bill Could Cement Dollar’s Digital Role The GENIUS Act is a pivotal piece of US legislation that is focused on stablecoins, and it could soon play a central role in boosting the US dollar’s dominance in the digital asset landscape. Short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, the bill seeks to provide regulatory clarity on how stablecoins are issued, backed, and governed, with particular focus on one-to-one collateralization with US dollars and strict compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. According to a May 29 report from Foresight Ventures, the act has the potential to cement the dollar’s status as the world’s preferred settlement currency in the Web3 era, as well as empower fintech companies to build secure, compliant financial tools. The bill advanced past a procedural vote in the US Senate on May 20 with a 66–32 margin, which suggests that it has good bipartisan momentum. However, it still awaits a full floor vote, and its final passage is not guaranteed. Earlier in May, the legislation encountered some resistance from key Democrats, prompting cautious optimism in the crypto industry. The GENIUS Act’s potential extends beyond the borders of the United States. Some industry leaders believe its implementation could serve as a global benchmark for digital asset regulation. Andrei Grachev , managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance, said that when the US takes a definitive step on stablecoin policy, the rest of the world tends to follow suit. Stablecoins are no longer viewed as experimental tools in the crypto ecosystem but as superior alternatives to traditional fiat money as they are faster, more efficient, and more transparent. The goal of the GENIUS Act is to safeguard that utility by introducing protective measures around reserve assets. The legislation will prohibit issuers from using reserves for purposes beyond redemption and a narrow list of low-risk investments, like US Treasury repos. These provisions are designed to prevent systemic risk and guard against the emergence of shadow banking practices in the stablecoin sector. If passed, the GENIUS Act could lay the foundation for a more stable and regulated digital dollar infrastructure. India Expands Digital Rupee Trials CBDC’s developments are also increasing around the globe. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to expand the scope of its digital rupee pilots by introducing new use cases and features to both the retail and wholesale versions of its central bank digital currency (CBDC). According to the RBI’s Annual Report for 2024–25 , the central bank is particularly focused on exploring programmability and offline functionality, which could make the digital rupee more versatile in regions with limited internet connectivity. These enhancements are expected to support use cases like government subsidies and corporate expenditure limits, helping to tailor digital payments to specific economic needs. Currently, the retail CBDC pilot is being tested with select customers and merchants through a network of participating banks and has already reached 600,000 users. To scale adoption even more, the RBI allowed certain non-bank entities to offer CBDC wallets. Meanwhile, the wholesale pilot is gaining traction within the interbank market and has recently expanded to include four standalone primary dealers. The growth of India’s broader digital payments ecosystem further supports this push into CBDCs. During the 2024–25 financial year, the country saw a 34.8% increase in the volume and a 17.9% rise in the value of digital payments. India also maintained its global leadership in real-time payments, with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) accounting for 48.5% of global transaction volume. (Source: RBI ) Among its other recent innovations, the RBI pointed out the “Delegated Payments” feature, which allows a primary user to authorize another individual to make UPI transactions in a preset limit. The goal of this initiative is to widen digital payment access. India’s Supreme Court also renewed calls for comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. On May 20, Justice Surya Kant criticized the government’s delayed action, despite the existence of a 30% tax on crypto profits since April of 2022.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 05:43:07

Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded an incredible net inflow of $433 million. That inflow extends the run of consecutive daily inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs to an impressive ten days. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs maintained their own strong momentum, too, registering a net inflow of $84.89 million. Ethereum spot ETFs have now seen their own consecutive daily inflow run extended to an impressive eight days. The inflows into these ETFs reflect a developing institutional inclination toward digital assets and a newly discovered adoption of cryptocurrency investment vehicles that combine traditional finance with the nascent blockchain ecosystem. Spot ETFs are increasingly being viewed by market participants as accessible and regulatory-compliant ways of achieving exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum while avoiding the direct custody of assets. Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Ten Straight Days of Net Inflows Over the last ten days, capital has accumulated in Bitcoin’s spot ETFs with stunning consistency. On just May 28 alone, they attracted a net inflow of $433 million. That’s a clarion call from both institutional and retail investors, and it’s one of the main reasons I think the SEC may be close to approving a Bitcoin spot ETF. On May 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $433 million, marking 10 consecutive days of net inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million, extending their streak to 8 consecutive days. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 In the previous three months, we have seen inflows of Bitcoin. These inflows have continued and actually even picked up pace in the last month. The latest data we have indicates that in August, we saw capital inflows, net capital inflows into Bitcoin, to the tune of $107 million. Spot ETFs serve as a vital link between traditional investment structures and the world of cryptocurrencies. They present an investment vehicle that is both familiar and regulated, thus reducing the entry barriers for many investors who might prefer to stay on this side of the bridge. And the bridge has been holding up well, with strong inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past few months. Ethereum Spot ETFs Extend Their Winning Streak Ethereum spot ETFs have similarly enjoyed a sustained wave of capital inflows. On May 28, right around the time of the latest annual Divergence Strategic Summit, Ethereum contents of spot ETFs received capital inflows of $84.89 million. This extended the streak of daily gains for Ethereum-backed ETFs to eight consecutive days. The primary programmable blockchain, Ethereum continues to draw institutional investor interest as a result of forthcoming improvements in scalability and network performance. The current inflow of exchange-traded-fund capital suggests that investors believe Ethereum’s ecosystem is developing favorably and that they will secure some appreciable delta by holding that which is most likely to be a more valuable token in the years to come. ETH ICO Whale on the Move Again: Another Sell-Off Begins The legendary “1 Million #ETH ICO Whale” has resumed selling — and the numbers are massive. Just 8 hours ago, this wallet recharged 956.7 ETH (worth $2.53M) to #OKX , raising fresh sell-off alarms. Details: pic.twitter.com/y03d4FL9dL — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) May 29, 2025 Capital has been coming into Ethereum ETFs steadily, which fits into a broader market trend we see. And this trend is that investors are looking to get diversified exposure to major blockchain networks beyond just Bitcoin. The way I see it, and I think a lot of people in our industry see it, this is a trend reflecting confidence in Ethereum. And their confidence isn’t unfounded. A lot of things are happening on Ethereum, to Ethereum, and with Ethereum. Whale Activity Sheds Light on Ethereum Market Dynamics While institutional investments in Ethereum ETFs appear to show an accelerating interest in the markets, it is the notable individual investment activity that provides a wealth of further insight. One of the most prominent Ethereum whales, operating from wallet 0xC8d6C156c13AC68ADA3f03B80fc201ae4867A57d, continues to make waves. This investor holds some 51,663 ETH, or $140 million worth of the digital asset, at very low basis costs: about $0.31 per ETH. Interestingly, this whale has just received an additional 24,000 ETH three days ago, which is quite the addition to their already hefty pile of ETH. Despite that, it’s good to note that this whale was just gifted 24,000 ETH three days ago. Investor actions on such a large scale send very valuable signals to the market. When savvy traders who are long-term holders of an asset accumulate it, that tends to signal to us that they are quite confident in the asset’s future trajectory. And such accumulation seems to be happening now in the Bitcoin market. This is—again—adding to the support of the price increases we are seeing. A Growing Narrative of Institutional Adoption Continued inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs and strategic activity by large holders are evidence of a maturing cryptocurrency market. Institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals see these assets as central to their portfolios, now that regulated products allow for a more straightforward and secure investment process. While the crypto ecosystem is still in its infancy, ETFs will likely help it evolve. They will help the whole ecosystem maintain compliance with financial regulations while enabling a much broader base of participation. They will also make Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens (or at least those that have passed muster) much more accessible on a risk-adjusted basis to a much wider variety of investors. Not too bad for something that wasn’t even on the horizon a year or so ago. For investors and observers, the steady influx of capital and strategic accumulation make clear that there is a consensus forming around the idea that digital assets are here to stay—not that they are merely ephemeral, like a fad, but that they are something much more fundamental, like a building block of the future financial system.

Beijing’s markets fell hardest after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said talks with China had stalled recently, hurting hopes for a lasting tariff deal. Bloomberg reported that Shanghai’s Composite Index and the CSI 300 both slipped by around 0.6%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.5%. Bessent, speaking at a financial conference, acknowledged that high-level negotiations had lost momentum but said he remained “confident that talks will pick up again.” His remarks, however, added to worries that Washington and Beijing might struggle to secure a more permanent trade deal. China objected to U.S. chip restrictions, while the U.S. added new export limits on major Chinese tech firms. Earlier this month, the two sides agreed to pause their tit-for-tat tariff increases for 90 days, a truce set to expire in early July. Despite the temporary hold, high tariffs on Chinese goods kept imports expensive for U.S. buyers. Regional stocks followed Wall Street , where markets closed well below their intraday peaks after the appeals court’s ruling. President Trump denounced the initial decision that halted his tariffs and said he was “confident the Supreme Court will allow [the tariffs] to proceed.” He also hinted at exploring alternative legal routes to enforce the tariffs, many of which are slated to begin in July. In Asia, S&P 500 futures eased 0.3% as traders prepared for the Fed’s preferred inflation report due later. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 slid 1.3% and the Topix index dropped 0.7% after city data showed consumer prices climbed more than expected in May. This inflation figure could give the Bank of Japan added reason to consider raising interest rates. Many analysts are now eyeing a 25-basis-point rate increase as soon as July. Other data showed Japan’s economy remained firm Industrial output fell 0.8% in April, less than economists had forecast, while retail sales rose 1.2%, outpacing predictions. The stronger data helped push the yen higher, a move that weighed on exporters and further pressured equity markets. In other parts of Asia, tech stocks fell as the initial boost from NVIDIA’s strong quarterly report wore off. South Korea’s Kospi declined 0.5% as local chipmakers and other tech firms reversed course. Singapore’s Straits Times dipped 0.3%. Australia’s ASX 200 finished flat after weak retail sales led some to expect more RBA rate cuts. In India, Nifty 50 futures rose 0.1%, pointing to a stronger open as the index held just below 25,000.

This ascent represents a rise of $25.8 billion from the recent lows and highlights a developing demand among traders and investors for the more refined vehicles that serve to hedge risk and implement relatively advanced trading strategies. The open interest in options has been increasing much more rapidly than that in futures, a sign of the evolving nature of the Bitcoin derivatives market. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 A broader shift in how market participants approach Bitcoin is clearly reflected in the rising interest in options. Instead of exclusively buying and holding, or trading in the spot market, more and more investors are turning to Bitcoin options to manage risk, make speculative bets on price movements, and set up intricate (and sometimes not-so-intricate) derivatives trades. This signals, if nothing else, that the Bitcoin ecosystem is maturing, and options are a part of that maturation. Short-Term Holder Profitability Shows Healthy Market Dynamics In tandem with the thriving options market, on-chain metrics offer intriguing glimpses into the actions and gains of short-term Bitcoin holders. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR), taken as a 30-day moving average, recently reached a local high. This metric can be understood as tracking the average profit or loss realized by investors who have held (and then spent or sold) their Bitcoin for a short duration (less than a now-treasured four-year hold period). The STH SOPR (30DMA) metric, which measures the average profit or loss realized by short-term investors when spending coins on-chain, recently hit a local high STH realized profit rose noticeably. Nevertheless, demand for coins remains strong enough not to hinder the bullish… pic.twitter.com/dsE8toaEin — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 29, 2025 The increase in STH realized profits indicates that short-term holders more frequently are capturing gains, and this reflects an environment where buying opportunities exist, and traders are effectively timing their exits. It is vital to note, however, that despite this uptick, the STH SOPR has not yet hit the euphoric levels we witnessed during previous Bitcoin price tops. This indicates that while profits are being taken, the market is not yet overheated or showing signs of excessive exuberance. A positive feedback loop is sustained by the short-term investors’ steady profitability: Profits can be reinvested and used to support trading activity, which keeps the liquidity flowing and the prices moving in the right (upward) direction. The SOPR indicator is a pretty reliable way of gauging the presence or absence of euphoric speculative bubbles in a market. And right now, it is not showing any signs of those kinds of bubbles being present. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Steady Capital Inflows In addition to the burgeoning activity in derivatives markets and on-chain metrics, there is now clear evidence that investor demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs is also growing rapidly. On May 28, for instance, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $433 million. This follows nine straight days of inflows into these regulated investment products. Compared to other vehicles of exposure to Bitcoin, the appetite for ETFs not only continues to but also appears to be speeding up. Spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin are now comparable with inflows into gold ETFs by this point in their adoption. On May 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $433 million, marking 10 consecutive days of net inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million, extending their streak to 8 consecutive days. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 Funds holding Bitcoin are now under the same regulatory regime as funds that hold gold, and that’s a big deal. Trust and acceptance as an asset class are now coming at us like the floodgates have opened, and the ETF is the vehicle of choice across our bridge to traditional finance. These inflows also reinforce the bullish trend in Bitcoin’s price. Increased demand from ETFs can translate into upward price pressure. Inflows occurring over several days also say something about investor confidence. They say that confidence is strong and that market participants see value in maintaining or increasing their Bitcoin exposure. A Growing Ecosystem of Sophistication and Confidence When we look at all these data points together, they show us a very clear picture: The Bitcoin market is moving into the next stage of its maturity. This next stage is marked by not just the appearance but also the substance of increased player sophistication; as for profitability, the short-term holders of Bitcoin (i.e., the folks who buy and sell it under the one-year window of the capital gains tax) are sitting on plenty of it, with the STH SOPR being a very nice leading indicator of that realm. And as for price discovery, things are looking really good. At the same time, uninterrupted net inflows into spot ETFs highlight growing institutional confidence and adoption. They further reinforce the narrative that Bitcoin is moving, in a very controlled way, toward the kind of mainstream acceptance that assets like gold enjoy. Bitcoin is always developing, and these trends point out how critical it is to keep an eye on derivatives activity, on-chain metrics, and capital flows if you want to understand the market’s underlying strength and direction. For investors and spectators, the expanding toolkit of financial instruments and the plethora of positive market signals make for a pretty good reason to be cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin’s next growth and adoption phases.

45275853,https://nulltx.com/?p=150047,1748584399,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Polymarket Predicts High Odds for Spot ETF Approval Among Major Altcoins in 2025,https://nulltx.com/polymarket-predicts-high-odds-for-spot-etf-approval-among-major-altcoins-in-2025/,"With ongoing interest in cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , Polymarket—a well-known decentralized prediction market platform—has now weighed in with some fresh, highly sought-after insights. These focus on the probabilities placed by the Polymarket platform on recent applications for spot ETFs tied to some of the most recognizable altcoins being approved by regulators. According to Polymarket, of the six major altcoins nominated for spot ETF approval, five have probabilities exceeding 68%. This translates to strong market optimism that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will give the go-ahead sometime in the next year. This list includes top projects which are such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Litecoin (LTC) which is each capturing significant investor interest and signaling the increasing appeal of the altcoins which are beyond Bitcoin and towards the mainstream. Meanwhile, Pepe (PEPE), which is a newer token and much less established, trails very far behind with only a 9% chance of ETF approval, which really underscores a divide that participants in the market see between established projects and speculative newcomers. XRP Leads the Pack with an 83% Approval Probability Among the top contenders, XRP currently enjoys the highest odds of securing a spot ETF approval in 2025, with its chances weighing in at a commanding 83%. This strong optimism simply reflects the ongoing favorable development that Ripple’s regulatory environment is undergoing, which in turn largely hinges on the protracted federal legal entanglement that the firm finds itself in. That also affects the XRP price. XRP’s leadership position on Polymarket likely shows confidence among investors that the cryptocurrency’s long-standing legal wrangling with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is headed for a favorable resolution, one that would allow the kind of regulatory sign-off that would make an ETF possible. And the XRP community and its investors have a close watch on these developments because, if nothing else, an ETF approval would be a massive milestone in making XRP a legitimate investment vehicle. Solana maintains a strong position in the realm of prediction markets, with a probability of around 80% that it will be approved. This remarkably steady outlook suggests that market participants are not only optimistic but also increasingly confident about Solana’s expansion; its ever-maturing ecosystem, network scalability, and very much seemingly real increasing adoption make it feel ETF inclusion is definitely within reach. Growing Momentum for Cardano, Dogecoin, and Litecoin Data from Polymarket also shows that Cardano, Dogecoin, and Litecoin have experienced substantial increases in the likelihood of ETF approval over the last few months. When the initial Altcoin ETF predictions were released, all three of these altcoins were projected to have probabilities well below the 50% mark. However, in the time since, all odds have improved by considerable margins, with each altcoin now projected to have an approximately 70%-80% chance of being approved for an ETF. Polymarket Odds for Spot ETF Approval on Major Altcoins According to @Polymarket , 5 out of 6 major altcoins nominated for ETF approval — $XRP , $SOL , $DOGE , $ADA , and $LTC — each have over a 68% chance of receiving spot ETF approval in 2025. $XRP currently leads with an 83%… pic.twitter.com/Lg7yJfub4c — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 28, 2025 This upward trend reflects an altering set of regulations and a coming-of-age for these projects. Cardano, with its ever-evolving smart contract capabilities, strikes me as an ecosystem that might consider itself next-gen. I don’t know if it’s Dogecoin’s 5 million-plus holders, or the ears it has to the ground in the way of endorsements, that give it a fighting chance in this world of vogue and trust. In my eyes, Litecoin remains near the top of the totem pole of trust, in large part because of its consistent steady upward path. The continued increase in the probabilities of approval for these altcoin ETFs suggests that there is a growing belief that the regulatory agencies might soon start allowing a wider array of investment products based on cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Pepe Coin Trails Far Behind Amid Speculation In contrast, Pepe (PEPE), even with the recent buzz and popularity it’s enjoyed in certain crypto communities, stands a very low chance—just 9%—of achieving spot ETF approval next year. This pretty much illustrates how the market views newer, speculative tokens that grab quick hype but seem to lack the necessary institutional infrastructure, regulatory clarity, or widespread adoption to appeal to the kinds of regulators that sign off on these things. How investors and the market are differentiating between: 1. Blue-chip altcoins having established use cases, and 2. Speculative “meme” coins that face greater hurdles on the road to regulatory acceptance. PEPE’s low odds are a potential indicator of this differentiation. What This Means for Crypto Investors and Markets Polymarket gives us a rare peek into how people are pricing the regulatory risk and opportunity landscape for major altcoins in 2025. That is, it lets us see in real-time how market participants are potentially calibrating that risk and opportunity landscape. And what it’s showing us, for the most part, is a scene of relative calm—at least over the near term. Altcoins such as Cardano, Dogecoin, and Litecoin are now seen as far more likely to gain regulatory blessings than they were just a few months ago. This is part of a much bigger trend in the crypto space in which many coins and tokens are now seen as far more likely to be deemed legally permissible because they are distinct from securities. This trend could, by extension, make those coins and tokens more permissible as parts of legal businesses, too. Monitoring these changing probabilities is valuable for investors. It provides insight into the sentiment of the market and the regulatory environment, which helps investors navigate risk and identify potential catalysts for price movement. The saga of trying to get spot ETFs approved is one of the crypto industry’s best storylines right now. And based on data from the prediction market Polymarket, it seems that the appearance of regulatory breakthroughs on that front for the top altcoins is looking more and more likely—at least in the relatively near future.

This makes us a very interesting protocol, not only because we offer this thing called a nearly cross-chain liquidity pool (which should give some users a way to earn yield across different blockchains, while also increasing swap efficiency), but also because we are on a path towards adopting more DeFi features. What is more, we have been experimenting with using LP tokens as collateral and offering some of those LP tokens as prizes in a game that some of our friends at BlockZero are helping us design. Everything else seems to be happening in Hyperliquid. And yet most people have not heard of us. We saw an opportunity here and took it. As the ecosystem keeps receiving investments, a new top 10 list of projects ranked by their 30-day growth in total value locked reveals just how quickly DeFi protocols built atop Hyperliquid are scaling. The list isn’t populated by established DeFi blue chips. From lending and stablecoin yield optimizing to next-gen automated market makers and liquid staking platforms, the Hyperliquid DeFi ecosystem is teeming with experimentation—and investor attention. Valantis, Magpie, and Upshift Lead TVL Growth Rankings The project that has appeared this month as the biggest TVL gainer is Valantis Labs. Its TVL increased a breathtaking 590 percent in the last month. While the details of Valantis’ strategy are not public, its rapid TVL growth suggests that the project is either employing some innovative DeFi primitives that we just don’t know about yet or is offering some highly competitive yield farming incentives. In second place comes Magpie, a name that is well-known in DeFi circles, and which registered a 413 percent leap in its TVL. Magpie’s main business seems to be making stablecoins less stable in a DeFi sense, and fixing superliquid routing in ways that keep DeFi users from tripping over themselves while seeking capital-efficient strategies in an increasingly competitive DeFi landscape. Upshift, a rising star on Hyperliquid, has posted an impressive 299 percent growth in its TVL. Ascending swiftly, it is now capturing the attention of risk-oriented DeFi users. Its appeal can be traced to its supply of unique leveraged yield and structured product options. These offerings are enticing nearly-conservative DeFi users to take on more risk and to explore downside-protected options that, in a bull market, could help them amplify on-chain returns. Top 10 Projects on Hyperliquid by 30D TVL Growth The @HyperliquidX ecosystem continues to expand its presence, not only driven by the growing popularity of the Hyperliquid derivatives exchange, but also by the increasing number of projects launching on its chain, creating… pic.twitter.com/v9gh8KGAyK — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 28, 2025 The figures showing triple-digit growth hint at an even wider spectrum of investors who are keen on the new, uncorrelated opportunities that the Hyperliquid chain presents. This is a trend that we see right now very much mirroring the early growth phases of other successful Layer 1 ecosystems. Emerging Protocols Show Ecosystem Depth Apart from the top three, several newer or lesser-known projects are building some real momentum. Hyperlend’s total value locked (TVL) went up a staggering 247 percent, thanks to the surging demand for permissionless on-chain lending markets. Hyperlend, whose name seems more close to a completed streetname than the kinds of projects one might find in DeFi, is gaining popularity because of its “lightweight interface” and “efficient borrowing mechanisms,” especially for smaller-cap assets. Wet HypurrFi saw a jaw-dropping 171 percent growth in its total value locked (TVL) to follow up. The modular yield vaults it offers are deep and shallow, with the kinds of risks associated with each that you can kind of tower over when you carve out a niche and think really hard about risk-adjusted returns foam. And what we’re hinting at when we talk about risk-adjusted DeFi, and why it’s becoming a fast-growing interest among DAOs and even buying interest from some institutions. Sentiment increased by 162 percent and Looped saw 140 percent growth — both projects work in areas that could become the next big trend in DeFi. They are concentrated in two areas: programmable credit markets (Sentiment) and staking incentives (Looped). Programmable credit markets — that’s just a really cool term for saying that we have a way to use smart contracts to do something other than just ‘money transfers.’ At the older end of the spectrum, HyperSwapX and Felix Protocol notched respectable increases in 30-day total value locked (TVL) of 93.7 percent and 32.3 percent, respectively, indicating that even the more established of DeFi platforms are enjoying a pretty serious resurgence when it comes to attracting fresh capital and new users. The core protocol of Hyperliquid itself registered a 73.8 percent increase in total value locked, an increase that underlined the fact that the native infrastructure of the chain continues to pull in users and their user-responsive liquidity in the midst of a more generalized ecosystem boom. Hyperliquid’s Evolution: From Derivatives to DeFi Hub Once hailed for its high-speed, gas-free decentralized derivatives exchange, Hyperliquid today is something much larger—a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem that looks every bit the rival of more established Layer 1s when it comes to innovation and total value locked (TVL) growth. The platform has made it, particularly for new project teams looking to experiment with capital efficiency and modular finance, a user-centric, fast, and gasless environment. But even for this relatively small number of teams, the platform’s natural integration of tokens, governance models, and interoperable protocols is moving a step closer to liquidity and composability. With the advent of Hyperliquid, the next several months could become a decisive period as more developers launch on the protocol, driving user adoption amid a burgeoning ecosystem. If growth trajectories hold, Hyperliquid could soon transition from an emerging protocol to a core DeFi chain. As total value locked surges across a diverse range of projects, the Hyperliquid ecosystem is demonstrating that it is more than simply a derivatives venue—it’s a full-stack financial playground where the next generation of real-time decentralized finance is being built.

45275953,https://nulltx.com/?p=150045,1748584600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Solana Accelerates Ecosystem Growth with NYC Conference, New Integrations, and Seeker Phone Launch",https://nulltx.com/solana-accelerates-ecosystem-growth-with-nyc-conference-new-integrations-and-seeker-phone-launch/,"Solana experienced a vibrant week underscored by important announcements, expansion of its ecosystem, and a very noticeable uptick in its market performance. From important events around the integration of real-world assets (RWA) to the unveiling of new DeFi and hardware products, the Solana ecosystem keeps pushing the envelope. And for all this momentum, the Solana Accelerate conference in New York City on May 22–23 was the perfect backdrop—a chance for the network and its partners to show off some serious innovations that emphasize Solana’s growing role in both TradFi and DeFi. The infrastructure of Solana is spreading. So is institutional interest. Solana is now going after retail, with its ecosystem growing fast. All this paints a promising picture of the Solana blockchain as the next phase of Web3.Growth. But things within that pretty picture—ahem—might not be as rosy as they seem to be. Verdict: Solana paints a promising picture of next-phase growth, but is it real? Market Performance and Capital Inflows Highlight Growing Confidence The native token of Solana, SOL, swelled 5% and hit $176, driven by the week of the Accelerate conference. The larger Solana ecosystem saw its total market capitalization rise by 3%, an almost unbroken string of up days in its price. But the trading volume of SOL fell by 15%, signaling that we are now in a period of less short-term trading and speculation on the price of SOL, but with an almost unchanged level of long-term interest. No one is abandoning ship, and the interest shown in the price of SOL hasn’t markedly changed. One of the more notable signs of Solana’s burgeoning appeal is the $175 million in assets bridged to the network over the past week. This influx of capital from other blockchains underscores Solana’s emerging position as a multi-chain hub for DeFi, NFTs, and now real-world asset trading. In the meantime, Bitcoin set a new record high, approaching $112,000, and pushed up right by a huge $427 million buying spree. And even though none of this is directly related to Solana, a rising crypto tide helps all boats, including Layer 1s like Solana, to pull in both institutional and retail cash. Solana Tackles Traditional Finance and DeFi with Bold Moves A prominent announcement emerged from Kraken, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges across the globe, which disclosed its plans to allow for trading of U.S. stocks on the Solana blockchain. This new offering will be directed toward non-U.S. users and marks a daring attempt to bridge the gap between conventional finance and blockchain tech. As market participants from all over the world seek quicker, cheaper, and more reliable (i.e., permissionless) pathways into the U.S. markets, enabling such a pathway via Solana would seem to place the net gain squarely in Kraken’s corner. The Accelerate event also saw innovative developments in DeFi, with Jupiter revealing its new lending protocol, created in collaboration with Fluid. This partnership looks to deliver increasingly efficient lending and liquidity solutions to the growing, multifaceted DeFi sector of Solana. Meanwhile, Kalshi, a regulated prediction market platform, has begun allowing its customers to make deposits on Solana through the Zero Hash service, using cash. They can now transact in the way that’s most comfortable and familiar to them. Total value locked (TVL) on the Solana network increased 2% to reach $10.997 billion. This growth helps Solana keep ahead of BNB Chain in the TVL race. However, DEX volume on Solana fell 14.62% to $21.28 billion, ending a multi-week streak of increasing volume. That said, Solana is still far and away leading all blockchains in weekly DApp revenue. Week in Solana: Accelerate in NYC, Seeker Phone in August. SOL climbs 5% to $176! Kraken brings stock trading to blockchain! Jupiter launches lending with Fluid! $175M bridged to network! Let's explore Solana's ecosystem expansion week 1/6 pic.twitter.com/uFyleVtDsN — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 28, 2025 Hardware Expansion and Security Efforts Intensify This week also brought a focus on hardware, with the announcement that the eagerly anticipated Solana Seeker Mobile phone will begin shipping in August. The device has SKR token integration and uses the decentralized TEEPIN architecture, purportedly making it much more private for on-chain use. Bringing Web3 into the hands of the everyday user is something Solana is very much about, and the Seeker phone is a step—in hardware, not just software—toward that goal. Staying a top priority is security, and in a high-profile incident featuring Solana co-founder Raj Gokal, the hacking of the Migos Instagram account was used to try to extort 40 BTC from Gokal. The incident ultimately remained a failed attempt at high-dollar extortion, but it does shine a light on the ongoing need for top-tier security as Solana and its leadership keep hitting the headlines. Ledger made a big splash when it came out with a Solana-specific version of its Flex hardware wallet, providing users with a tailored solution for optimal storage and management of Solana-based assets. Looking Ahead: A Chain That’s Not Slowing Down Across the financial, mobile hardware, DeFi infrastructure, and security sectors, Solana is making it clear that its ambitions extend far beyond being just another Layer 1. Progress at Solana has been meaningful and multifaceted. This positions the blockchain as a potentially powerful player in the next wave of Web3 adoption. With the Solana phone launch on the horizon and new financial integrations underway, Solana’s week of announcements reflects not just momentum but maturity. It’s a chain that’s actively building, actively growing, and actively preparing for the future — one real-world asset, mobile device, and protocol at a time.

The post highlights a specific reference within the IMF’s report that connects the R3 enterprise blockchain platform to the XRP Ledger , stating that the IMF explicitly confirmed that “R3 is based on the XRP blockchain.” The tweet adds the word “Documented,” emphasizing the official nature of the reference. Even as recent as 2024, the IMF confirmed that “R3 is based on the XRP blockchain.” Documented. https://t.co/JLuIZBBMgf pic.twitter.com/gHgIu6apN0 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 27, 2025 Palau’s Sovereign Stablecoin Initiative The IMF paper includes an annex focused on Palau, detailing the country’s financial infrastructure and digital currency initiatives. According to the table, Palau has no central bank and uses the US dollar as its legal tender. The nation also lacks a domestic central bank-operated payment infrastructure, relying instead on systems provided by U.S. banks for clearing and card issuance. As part of its modernization efforts, Palau launched a digital identification system in 2022 and has been exploring sovereign stablecoin issuance. One section of the table reads, “There is a plan to issue sovereign stablecoins by late 2022 (based on R3 XRP blockchain).” This phrasing has gained attention in digital asset circles due to its specific mention of both R3 and the XRP blockchain in the context of a government-backed stablecoin project. While R3’s Corda platform is widely known for its enterprise blockchain capabilities, this IMF citation appears to affirm a more direct integration with the XRP Ledger than previously emphasized in public-facing institutional reports. Community Reactions and Clarifications In a reply to SMQKE’s tweet, X user Rodrigo Siqueira offered additional context, clarifying that while R3’s Corda does not have a native cryptocurrency, it is capable of integrating with multiple crypto assets, including XRP, XDC, Solana, and Ethereum (via Obscuro). According to Siqueira, such integrations are used for specific purposes such as decentralized finance (DeFi) operations and asset tokenization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Digital Infrastructure in Palau The original IMF report was prepared by a multi-departmental team and includes insights from the Asia and Pacific Department, the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, the Legal Department, and others. The February 2024 publication explores how digital money innovations are impacting the financial landscapes of Pacific island countries, many of which face unique challenges due to geographic isolation and limited financial infrastructure. Palau’s engagement with blockchain-based solutions, particularly in the issuance of a sovereign stablecoin, is a noteworthy example of how smaller jurisdictions are adopting digital finance technologies. The IMF document acknowledges this trend, even referencing Palau’s Digital Residency Law, which enables individuals worldwide to claim blockchain-based residency status with the backing of a sovereign government. Implications for Blockchain and Policy Integration The citation of the XRP blockchain as part of Palau’s stablecoin initiative , as documented by the IMF, remains a point of interest for those tracking the intersection of public policy and blockchain technology. The involvement of R3 and its potential interoperability with crypto assets, such as XRP, adds further dimension to ongoing discussions about how traditional financial institutions and emerging blockchain platforms are integrating in practice.

45276063,https://nulltx.com/?p=150044,1748584736,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,AI Agent Markets Hold Ground as Microcaps Steal the Spotlight,https://nulltx.com/ai-agent-markets-hold-ground-as-microcaps-steal-the-spotlight/,"Over the last 24 hours, the Virtuals ecosystem continued to be lively. The focus, however, was not on the major tokens, which pulled back slightly. Instead, investors turned their attention to high-upside microcaps. Even so, the total market capitalization dipped only a little and seemed to be holding up just fine. The real surprise was with the total trading volume, which continued at a healthy pace. If anything, the market seemed ripe for the re-emergence of AI agents. The minor price drop experienced by the $VIRTUAL token, which holds down the Virtuals ecosystem, did nothing to lessen its prominence in the much broader AI agent market. If anything, all that did was call my attention to the price chart for SANTA, which notched a price rise of more than 200%, and got me wondering how many more wild price rides lesser-known tokens might take in the emerging AI ecosystem. Speculative plays, anyone? Market Snapshot: Consolidation Amid Microcap Momentum As of May 29, 2025, the total market cap for AI agent-related projects sits at $11.59 billion, reflecting a slight 0.22% decline over the past day. The Virtuals ecosystem specifically accounts for $2.76 billion of that value, down 3.76% over the same period. The $VIRTUAL token, central to this ecosystem, currently trades at $2.3452, having dipped 4.11%. The overall mindshare for AI agents climbed to 40.09%, showing that investor attention is still mostly directed toward the sector, even amid some minor price corrections. Virtuals’ mindshare saw a slight dip of 0.25%, settling at 20.51%, which still puts it in a commanding position. These numbers make it clear that even though the market cap regressed a bit, users and investors are not necessarily leaving the space. They are funneling their resources into newer, more flexible projects that have a better chance of growing quickly in the near term. Santa Leads Microcap Rally with Explosive 212% Surge The performance of SANTA (@santavirtuals) clearly stole the show today, with its market cap having shot up 212.5% over the past 24 hours. What seems to be the community-driven momentum of this crypto seems fully in play here, and appearances in virtual spaces seem to be really working for SANTA. Integrating with nearly 100% of blockchain protocols seems like a near-foolproof pathway to growth. SANTA does all of the above. SANTA’s surge set the stage for a much bigger rotation into microcap assets, with many of those posting double-digit gains. WAI climbed 15.24%, BRAIN rose 14.95%, LEO added 13.37%, and HANA followed closely with a 13.35% gain. Virtuals Daily Update | May 29th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/OP2eqn2YVK — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 29, 2025 Investors seem to be gravitating toward the AI agent space, which many seem to regard as the next big thing. This is evident in the growing interest and upside that’s being demonstrated in many early-stage projects. Clearly, something is stirring these very market participants to engage more actively in a portfolio rebalancing phase. This is also reflected in a pretty clear downward slide that many more mature tokens have been taking of late. Ecosystem Outlook: Volatility Ahead but Fundamentals Remain Strong Although price shifts in the ecosystem of virtual assets may be becoming more pronounced, the virtual assets ecosystem remains fundamentally strong. With more than 40% of the decentralized market occupied by AI agents, the virtual assets ecosystem is definitely not short on interest in AI-driven on-chain entities. The slight drop in the $VIRTUAL token price isn’t likely a bad omen but rather the latest step in the broader diversification of interest among core ecosystem tokens. As maturing market cores consolidate, they’re often prone to the pullback we’re seeing in Virtuals. However, that’s not bearish for Virtuals as a whole. Quite the opposite: the interest redistribution could be a precursor to a more well-rounded core and could actually lead to a breakout rather than a breakdown. In the future, the microcaps in the Virtuals community—and investors too—will be watching for upward performance from our key tokens. Will they reach new heights? And how about the chance they might reach those heights via fresh protocol upgrades, new integrations, or ecosystem grants? There’s clear demand for new playthings like experimental and early-stage AI agents. That puts the Virtual ecosystem in a prime spot to capitalize on the next growth surge—one powered by the intersection of experimental AI and emerging decentralized technologies. The Daily Update of Virtuals gives an account of a market that is dynamic and in evolution, which, while it has slightly cooled at the top, is generating growth and innovation from the bottom up. It is uncertain whether the momentum this market is building among microcaps can be sustained or whether it will rotate back into larger microcaps like $VIRTUAL, but this update tries to give an account of where things might be headed next.

In the past 24 hours, Toncoin perpetual futures open interest (OI) surged by 33%, climbing to $190 million — the most since February 18. The $47 million surge in open interest was driven by large buying on the futures market, even as the price was pulling back. Analysts and traders are watching the situation closely — a rise in open interest even as the price is pulling back is being interpreted as a potential setup for volatility in either direction. Over the past 24h, $TON perpetual futures OI surged +33% from $143M to $190M – its highest level since Feb 18. Interestingly, OI stayed elevated even after the price pullback. Past spikes like this have often preceded corrections – worth watching closely: https://t.co/wXpcaQoKul pic.twitter.com/IwbflHdkwZ — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 At the same time, on-chain data reveals that a substantial support level is coalescing at $3.24. There, a vast contingent of Toncoin holders has recently arrived in the marketplace. Coupled with some fresh technical developments and an ever-expanding utility—thanks to its ongoing integration into Telegram—that Toncoin seems to be entering a new, attention-grabbing phase is, in our view, a matter of not just possibility but also likelihood. Futures Open Interest Surges as Traders Pile In In the current trading cycle, one of the most noticeable developments is the rapid increase in open interest on Toncoin perpetual futures. Open interest measures the total number of open futures contracts, and a single-day jump of 33% means a lot more contracts are now open. That kind of movement—very much in the range of what you would call a “speculative” price advance—frequently reflects rising trader enthusiasm, engagement, and a certain level of leverage. Increases in open interest — especially those that coincide with gains in prices — tend to be associated with short-term corrections. During these instances, it seems that the lava in the layers beneath a volcano has heated up. In contrast, high open interest in Toncoin and a modest pullback in its price suggest the opposite: that even if ton traders took a minor hit, they might be braced for a major event in the near term. This is a configuration that warrants close oversight. The reaction from the market over the next few days could establish the overall direction of Toncoin in the short term. This is especially true should additional buying or selling occur or if any overzealous traders begin to cover their short positions. Strong On-Chain Support Around $3.24 A key demand zone around $3.24 is currently supporting Toncoin’s price. On-chain data from SentoraHQ shows that roughly 1.21 million wallets have close to 740 million TON at this level. That makes $3.24 a pretty solid support level. A large number of holders down there are very likely to be defending their positions against any further downside. #Toncoin is holding above a major demand zone at $3.24, where 1.21 million wallets scooped up nearly 740 million $TON , shows on-chain data from @SentoraHQ . This level could act as strong support! pic.twitter.com/2wkq8m4CnD — Ali (@ali_charts) May 29, 2025 Significant accumulation areas like this serve as not just psychological support but also as technical support for a token when it is traversing the kind of volatile price waters we have seen recently. The $3.24 level is particularly noteworthy for not just the sheer volume of tokens held there but also for the number of individual wallets involved — a very robust signal of interest amongst both retail and smaller institutional investors. Provided that Toncoin can keep its price action above this zone, the bulls could remain in control, and the token might be ready to stage a rebound if the overall market mood brightens again. Adoption Grows as Telegram Integrates TON The Toncoin ecosystem is experiencing a real-world utility boost beyond just market metrics and technical levels, and it’s no small integration we are talking about. Telegram, one of the most popular messaging platforms in the world, has just started incorporating Toncoin into its app, allowing in-app payments and broadening other use cases for this cryptocurrency. Telegram has officially begun to make Toncoin not only a messaging platform currency but a payment currency within its massive global user base. Integrating Toncoin into Telegram can change the token’s game for the better. It exposes the token to a massive audience. There are 700 million people using Telegram. These users are not just hanging out, though. In Telegram, users are increasingly engaging in interactions that can be monetized, be it through businesses or through various social and even political means. Telegram is not just a website with a whole bunch of people; it’s a place where a lot of real stuff goes on. Also, Toncoin has recently broken out of a lengthy downtrend and added a technical tailwind to its fundamental momentum. The market is still in the early stages of digesting these changes, but Toncoin’s combination of rising interest from traders, clear support from on-chain participants, and newfound integration into Telegram’s infrastructure suggests that it’s laying the groundwork for a new chapter. Currently, the $3.24 support zone and futures activity are the main focus. How Toncoin behaves in the next few days—in terms of consolidating, correcting, or climbing—will likely depend on how these two intersecting forces play out.

A US court ruling from a federal circuit court of appeal has temporarily paused a previous decision that went against these reciprocal tariffs. This unexpected halt signals a period of deliberation by the court, as reported by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, leaving businesses and economists pondering the potential economic impact and future of trade policy . What Were the Trump Tariffs and Why the Challenge? To understand the significance of this US court ruling , we need to rewind slightly. The tariffs in question were largely imposed during the administration of former President Donald Trump, often targeting goods from countries like China, citing concerns over unfair trade practices, national security, or as leverage in trade negotiations. These weren’t just minor adjustments; they represented a significant shift in U.S. trade policy , moving towards a more protectionist stance. These tariffs, applied to various imports ranging from steel and aluminum to a wide array of Chinese goods under Section 301 investigations, were met with mixed reactions. While proponents argued they protected domestic industries and jobs, critics highlighted increased costs for consumers and businesses, retaliatory tariffs from other nations, and disruptions to established supply chains. The legal challenges against these tariffs often centered on the authority under which they were imposed, questioning whether the executive branch overstepped its powers or failed to follow proper administrative procedures. A ruling against the tariffs, as was temporarily reversed, would have potentially invalidated some of these measures, leading to significant refunds for importers and a reshaping of trade relationships. Decoding the US Court Ruling: What Does “Temporarily Halted” Mean? The core of the recent news is the federal circuit court’s decision to temporarily halt the ruling that found fault with the Trump tariffs . What exactly does this mean? It’s a Pause, Not a Reversal: The court has not overturned the previous ruling on the merits. It has simply put it on hold. Time for Consideration: The court stated it needs time to review ‘related filings’. This could include appeals, briefs from involved parties (like the government defending the tariffs or importers challenging them), or requests for clarification. Status Quo (for now): While the halt is in place, the tariffs that were challenged and found unlawful in the lower ruling likely remain in effect. Businesses cannot currently rely on the invalidated ruling to avoid paying the tariffs or seek refunds based on that specific decision. Uncertain Duration: The term ‘temporarily’ is key. The halt could last days, weeks, or potentially months, depending on the complexity of the filings and the court’s schedule. This temporary halt introduces a layer of uncertainty. Businesses that might have been preparing for the potential removal or invalidation of certain tariffs based on the previous ruling now face ambiguity. Will the original ruling be upheld after the court’s review, or will the halt be made permanent, or will the court issue a new decision? Crucial Economic Impact: Who Feels the Effects of This Trade Policy Uncertainty? Any shift, or potential shift, in trade policy carries significant weight for the economy, and this US court ruling is no exception. The uncertainty surrounding the future of these tariffs has a crucial economic impact that resonates across various sectors: Challenges for Businesses: Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies that import goods subject to these tariffs face unpredictable costs. This makes long-term planning difficult. Do they absorb the cost, pass it to consumers, or try to find alternative suppliers? Increased Costs: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imports. These costs can increase operating expenses for manufacturers, retailers, and other businesses relying on imported components or finished goods. Investment Hesitation: Uncertainty about trade rules can make businesses hesitant to invest in new projects, expand operations, or commit to long-term contracts that depend on stable import costs. Competitive Disadvantage: U.S. companies using tariffed imports might be at a disadvantage compared to international competitors who do not face these costs. Impact on Consumers: Higher Prices: Businesses often pass increased costs from tariffs onto consumers in the form of higher prices for goods ranging from cars and appliances to clothing and electronics. Reduced Variety: Some imported goods might become too expensive to stock, potentially reducing consumer choice. Broader Economic Effects: Inflationary Pressure: Tariffs contribute to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods and reducing competition. Strained International Relations: Ongoing disputes over tariffs can strain diplomatic and trade relationships with key partners, potentially leading to retaliatory measures. Impact on Global Trade Flows: Uncertainty in a major economy’s trade policy can influence global trade patterns as countries and companies seek stability. While the direct beneficiaries of tariffs are intended to be domestic industries gaining protection, the broader economic impact often involves a complex web of winners and losers, with uncertainty being a net negative for overall economic stability and growth. Navigating the Waters of Global Trade Amidst Tariff Disputes The temporary halt on the ruling against Trump tariffs underscores the volatile nature of global trade in the current geopolitical climate. Trade relationships are not static; they are influenced by political shifts, economic pressures, and legal challenges. Examples of Affected Areas: Historically, the Trump-era tariffs impacted a wide range of goods. For instance: Steel and Aluminum: Tariffs were applied globally based on national security grounds (Section 232). Chinese Goods: Extensive tariffs were placed on thousands of products under Section 301, covering everything from machinery and electronics to furniture and plastics. Goods from Allies: At times, tariffs or the threat of tariffs were used in negotiations with traditional allies over issues like automobile imports or digital services taxes. Each of these categories involves complex international supply chains. A legal challenge and subsequent temporary halt create ripples through these networks, affecting manufacturers in multiple countries, shipping companies, logistics providers, and ultimately, the end consumers. Actionable Insights (for businesses/stakeholders): Given the ongoing uncertainty stemming from the US court ruling and the broader landscape of trade policy : Monitor Developments Closely: Stay informed about the court’s decision and any related government actions. Assess Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Identify dependencies on goods subject to potential tariff changes. Explore diversification options. Engage with Trade Experts: Consult with legal and trade policy experts to understand potential outcomes and plan accordingly. Advocate: Businesses impacted by tariffs can engage with industry associations and policymakers to voice their concerns. The situation highlights the intricate link between domestic legal processes and international commerce. A decision made in a U.S. courtroom can have tangible effects on factories in Asia, shipping lanes across oceans, and prices in shops worldwide. What’s Next After This US Court Ruling? The temporary halt is just one step in a potentially lengthy legal and political process. What could happen next? Court’s Final Decision: The federal circuit court will eventually issue a decision on the merits of the appeal or the filings it is considering. It could uphold the previous ruling against the tariffs, reverse it, or send it back to a lower court for further review. Government Response: Regardless of the court’s final decision, the executive branch (the current administration) has options. They could choose to maintain, modify, or remove tariffs based on their own policy goals, potentially independent of the specific legal challenge, or respond to the court’s directives. Further Appeals: Depending on the outcome at the circuit court level, either party could potentially seek further review, possibly petitioning the Supreme Court, although this is not guaranteed. Political Considerations: Trade policy is often a political hot potato. The upcoming political landscape will undoubtedly influence the long-term trajectory of tariffs, regardless of judicial outcomes. For those watching the broader markets, including the cryptocurrency space, events like this, while not directly tied to crypto, contribute to the overall climate of economic uncertainty. Major shifts in global trade and potential impacts on inflation, corporate earnings, and investor confidence can indirectly influence sentiment and capital flows across all asset classes. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Trade Uncertainty The temporary halt by a US court ruling on a decision challenging Trump tariffs serves as a potent reminder of the complexities and uncertainties inherent in modern trade policy . It underscores how legal battles over past executive actions can continue to shape the present and future of the economy. The crucial economic impact of tariffs, affecting everything from corporate balance sheets to household budgets, means that developments like this are closely watched by businesses, investors, and governments worldwide. While the final outcome of this specific legal challenge remains to be seen, the period of temporary halt highlights the ongoing volatility in global trade . Businesses must remain agile, prepared for potential shifts in costs and market dynamics. For the wider public and market participants, it’s a signal to continue monitoring the intersection of law, politics, and economics, as decisions made in courtrooms and government offices can have far-reaching effects on the global financial landscape.

Bitget is a post-trade platform for dealing with assets in the crypto-space. It allows users to serve their financial needs in an adequately integrated crypto ecosystem. The launch of RLUSD here marks an effort to make Ripple’s stablecoin as accessible to everyone as possible. At the launch, Ripple’s senior vice president of business operations, Monique Morrow, appeared in a live video stream to present Ripple’s stablecoin, as well as the basic post-trade concepts of the Bitget trading platform. To commemorate going public, Bitget is conducting a lottery for 500 RLUSD. This is a likely attempt to entice traders of all stripes to experiment with the coin. Retail users, as well as institutional traders, are urged to explore RLUSD’s functionalities. And what are those, exactly? Well, for one, the stablecoin is genuinely stable. It has a solid foundation, is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and is natively issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as well as on Ethereum, giving it a unique dual-chain structure. @Ripple USD $RLUSD has been listed on @Bitgetglobal 's spot trading platform Bitget lists #RLUSD , an enterprise-grade USD-backed stablecoin issued by Ripple. The exchange will also give away 500 RLUSD to celebrate the launch. As a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar,… pic.twitter.com/riSe7WQpNP — CryptoDep #StandWithUkraine (@Crypto_Dep) May 29, 2025 RLUSD Aims to Redefine Stablecoin Standards The market entry of RLUSD is underscored by three foundational principles: trust, liquidity, and compliance. Being a product of Ripple—one of the most established firms in the crypto payments sphere—the stablecoin is deeply embedded in Ripple’s existing infrastructure, which gives it a strategic advantage over somewhat riskier, independent stablecoin projects, most of which are just that: projects. RLUSD has an immediate path to adoption in real-world finance through Ripple’s global payment networks and enterprise relationships. Regulators and market participants are meant to see the coin as reliable and transparent, because it’s fully backed by dollar reserves and issued by a trusted party. RLUSD supports both XRPL and Ethereum, giving developers an excellent deal of freedom to create cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps) or payments solutions. This freedom is crucial in fintech, where blockchain interoperability is vital for businesses that want to bridge traditional finance with decentralized protocols. Bitget Expands Its Stablecoin Offerings Bitget is attempting to make stablecoin trading an important part of its business. It has chosen to list RLUSD among the products it offers on its trading platform to achieve that aim. RLUSD joins other stablecoins that Bitget supports, such as the USD1, in trading pairs with top cryptocurrencies (including BTC and ETH) that serve as the foundation for the versatile digital asset platform that makes Bitget the rebel among crypto exchanges. RLUSD’s listing coincides with Bitget’s recent drive to back fresh financial crafts, especially those that hit the mark in functionality for enterprise uses. The exchange’s watertight infrastructure, packed with Bitcoin and layered with high-grade deposit security, makes it a secure and compliant place for anyone to try their hand at trading RLUSD. Adding RLUSD to Bitget Savings, the platform’s interest-earning product, seems to be under consideration. If this integration takes place, it could elevate RLUSD’s appeal as well as its traction in trading. More importantly, it could mean demand for RLUSD will become significant enough to resemble a “savings stablecoin”—one that earns interest even when saved, as opposed to being spent or traded. Bridging Traditional Finance and Decentralized Innovation RLUSD’s debut on Bitget means more than just another stablecoin getting listed on an exchange; it signifies a larger movement afoot in the cryptocurrency world where tried-and-tested, payment-related financial infrastructure is merging with payment-related decentralized infrastructure. Ripple’s long history as a payment-focused blockchain company gives RLUSD a kind of institutional credibility that most stablecoin issuers lack and that at least some enterprises looking to use a stablecoin might find appealing. Additionally, the issuance of RLUSD on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum highlights Ripple’s strategic, forward-looking vision of the multi-chain future of finance. With this reality in mind, Ripple is pursuing a strategy that gives RLUSD the best chance of becoming a meaningful tool in the real world across different use cases. In essence, RLUSD will be able to achieve those aims better because it involves cross-chain issuance. As global regulatory talks about stablecoins keep moving, the push for compliance and transparency can also help RLUSD win early trust in places that are tightening the rules on digital assets. Users and developers searching for not just reliable but also adaptable stablecoins should find RLUSD a good contender. In the upcoming months, everyone will be watching to see how RLUSD performs in terms of adoption, trading volume, and integration into payment and DeFi ecosystems. With Bitget providing a powerful platform for it to gain exposure and Ripple’s enterprise backing to lend it legitimacy, RLUSD might very well emerge as a strong entity in the next chapter of the stablecoin evolution.

The “Percent of Total Supply in Profit” metric tracks how much of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply was acquired at a price lower than its current market value. Right now, it seems that a lot of top coins are seeing a historically high amount of profit among their holders. Here are the figures for some of the major coins: Bitcoin (BTC): 73.1% Ethereum (ETH): 79.6% Litecoin (LTC): 83.5% Chainlink (LINK): 92.3% Ripple (XRP): 90.5% Polkadot (DOT): 91.5% Cardano (ADA): 87.9% Solana (SOL): 95.4% The figures for Chainlink, Ripple and Solana are especially impressive. The data indicates that the market has experienced widespread increases in the prices of assets, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin. This could be seen as a sign that the market is quite strong. But it could also mean that the market in general is due for a correction, as people might be tempted to take profits after the long, nearly uninterrupted upward trend we’ve seen. Bitcoin, XRP Lead the Pack in Holder Profits New data shows that Bitcoin has the highest amount of its supply in profit. Currently, 98.4% of circulating Bitcoin is worth more than it was worth when it was acquired. This reflects the long-term bullishness of Bitcoin. It also reflects the conviction held by many who hold Bitcoin. XRP is closely behind with 98.3 percent of its supply in favorable territory for holders. This is a surprising figure given all the regulatory and legal trouble XRP has faced, including a lawsuit from the SEC. XRP is now almost completely in profitable territory thanks to its recent price recovery. Pretty much all XRP holders are now making money, which confirms that the market has pretty much shaken off the earlier uncertainty it had with regard to this token. Other significant assets are likewise registering stout profit rates. Chainlink counts 80.5 percent of its supply in profit; Dogecoin, 77.9 percent; Ethereum, 71.5 percent; and Cardano, 71.0 percent. Not on par with Bitcoin or XRP, these numbers nonetheless suggest a large swath of token holders in these networks is seeing returns on its investments. Percent of Total Supply in Profit is a straightforward metric that shows how much of a cryptocurrency’s current circulating supply is held at a profit—meaning the coins were bought at a lower price than they’re worth today. Currently, some notable top caps' supply in profit… pic.twitter.com/QU3sGrtV07 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 28, 2025 What This Metric Tells Us About Market Sentiment The Percent of Supply in Profit is a metric that is simple and direct. A token is either in profit or it isn’t, with the profit margin being minimal for some. This offers a simple yet effective way of viewing how positioned in the market investors are. Of course, when large amounts of a coin’s supply are in profit, it more often than not indicates that the price has been moving in a positive direction recently and that the holders themselves are exhibiting bullish sentiment. Yet this trend can also signal something more ominous. When a token becomes overbought—as indicated by the variety of signals described above—its price is probably at or near an unsustainable peak. Although this peak may persist for a time, it will inevitably be followed by a cooldown phase. Since this is the typical life cycle of overbought tokens, these sorts of price trends represent the kind of living danger signs that traders should be wary of. Conversely, when most of a coin’s supply is losing money, this usually signals that the market is awash with pessimism and fear. Historically, these moments of low sentiment have often coincided with buying opportunities. They tend to mark the moments when a coin is way undervalued and is just about to recover in price. To gain a better overall understanding, this metric is frequently examined together with other ones such as the Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Network Realized Profit/Loss. When looked at together, they offer insight into whether or not the market is in an overbought or oversold condition, or somewhere in the middle. Rising Profits: Opportunity or Warning? With the continual evolution of cryptocurrencies and the emergence of new coins, it’s anticipated that an increasing portion of the supply of individual assets will be held in profit. But looking at percentages instead of actual numbers gives us a clearer, inflation-adjusted picture of the current market. This allows us to reach conclusions that aren’t misled by simple volume comparisons. At present, the profits being made by the holders of Bitcoin, XRP, and other major coins are nearly universal. That is an unambiguous thumbs-up for the kind of upward momentum we like to see. And yet, it also makes us think about being cautious. At least, it should make us think about being cautious because crypto’s cyclical nature means that periods of high profitability often lead to market resets—consolidations or corrections. The percentage of supply in profit isn’t predictive by itself, but combined with larger market analysis, it becomes a pretty nifty gauge of investor sentiment. Whether this current round of nice moves turns out to be the prelude to sustained new highs or just the thing that kicks off the next wave of profit-taking, the fact is that right now the entire crypto market is in a nice phase, and everyone is watching to see what happens next.

One of the most popular decentralized exchanges in the world of crypto is back to proving its dominance, by not only racking up user activity but also by being profitable.

One exceptional example of this mounting momentum is that of a shrewd whale investor who has held the Uniswap (UNI) token since 2020. This investor is presently raking in the rewards from a smart purchase made three years ago. Meanwhile, another development that could very well bolster Uniswap’s position in DeFi, the recent deployment of Uniswap v4 on Arbitrum, has achieved some level of success in a very short period of time.

This investor, known for holding assets through thick and thin (exactly what “diamond hands” means), has now seen profits ripple up to around $994,000. He began amassing the UNI tokens when they were valued at $5.99. As of now, the market price hovers just above $7.47. It seems that the valor and wisdom of this whale in going long are paying off handsomely.

That is a figure—calculated by @wojaknft—that most investors would be pleased to show their mothers. This case illustrates the kinds of rewards that can accrue from an investor truly understanding market cycles and the potential of protocols. While many traders skedaddle early or follow the kind of hype-driven, at-the-moment trends that usually die down shortly after they peak, this investor has shown that positioning consistently in a relatively new asset like UNI can pay off handsomely if you understand what you’re holding and why. Uniswap v4 on Arbitrum: Adoption Accelerates Uniswap v4 on Arbitrum is now not far short of four months since its launch, and it is gaining significant traction. The protocol has pulled together a total of 1,823 liquidity pools, 427 of which are what the developers now call “hooked pools”—those custom pools that integrate additional logic or functionality. And yes, there is now enough enthusiastic development activity around Uniswap v4’s modular design for 182 individual hooks to be listed as deployed. Less than 4 months since @Uniswap v4 launched on Arbitrum: 1,823 pools 427 hooked pools 182 hooks deployed Uniswap is cooking pic.twitter.com/nRQGkNNpko — Entropy Advisors (@EntropyAdvisors) May 28, 2025 Among its most innovative features, Uniswap v4 introduced “hooks,” allowing developers to create custom liquidity pool behavior. Uniswap v4’s hooks are now enabling a sharp uptick in experimentation and new decentralized trading strategies that the protocol’s developers believe will soon be visible on Arbitrum’s lower-fee, faster-execution Layer 2 network. Uniswap v4’s success on Arbitrum is part of a much broader trend. DeFi apps are leaving the high gas fees on Ethereum’s mainnet behind and are migrating toward Layer 2 solutions. Arbitrum, the best Layer 2 alternative to Ethereum, offers a scalable, cost-efficient environment in which to build DeFi primitives. And Uniswap is, by far, the leading DeFi app on that platform. A Protocol That Keeps on Cooking From record-breaking profits for whale investors to a tidal wave of developer energy on Arbitrum, Uniswap is showing that it’s not some kind of legacy protocol coasting on past glories. Instead, it’s changing, growing, and energizing as ever. The return of significant investors and the increasing value of the UNI token suggest that confidence in the protocol’s future is growing. At the same time, the launch and rapid expansion of Uniswap v4 on Arbitrum demonstrate that the team and ecosystem remain at the cutting edge of DeFi innovation. Investors and smart investor behavior, coupled with state-of-the-art technology, might very well be setting Uniswap up for a fantastic next chapter. While other protocols compete in the DeFi space, Uniswap not only occupies a premier position but, in its way, also demonstrates leadership. Uniswap is building with intention, attracting serious venture capital, and providing a platform where developers can experiment and offer what we should think of as the future of finance. In a quickly changing market, few projects keep their relevance intact while also pushing the limits. Uniswap, it appears, does both. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45276309,https://nulltx.com/?p=150039,1748585322,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Arbitrum DAO Surges Toward Record-Breaking Profitability in May,https://nulltx.com/arbitrum-dao-surges-toward-record-breaking-profitability-in-may/,"Arbitrum DAO is on a path that could see it deliver its most profitable month to date, with a projected Gross Profit Margin of 98% for May. This is a rather stunning milestone that highlights something we suspected all along: Arbitrum’s economic strength is growing, along with its operational efficiency. Arbitrum DAO is on pace for its highest-ever Monthly Gross Profit Margin, hitting 98% in May. For context: Gross Profit Margin = Blockspace Revenue (Tx Fees, Timeboost, Orbit License) – Associated Costs (Developer Guild, DA) With Pectra reducing the cost of Blobs and Timeboost… pic.twitter.com/IW543oYiyb — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) May 28, 2025 Profits have jumped because revenue streams are shooting up and costs are pretty stable. Arbitrum makes money from transaction fees, Timeboost auctions, and Orbit licensing fees. At the same time, costs tied to the Developer Guild and DAO operations have stayed within reasonable limits, allowing the DAO to act more like a business with decent margins that is also spending enough to ensure that it will grow. The DAO now seems to be walking a tightrope very efficiently. Pectra and Timeboost: Driving Efficiency and Revenue This movement toward leaner operations is being driven by two major forces. One is Pectra, an upgrade of Ethereum that is coming soon and expected to lower the price of data blobs. Data blobs are core to Arbitrum, which requires Ethereum for data availability. The Avatar DAO has operational expenses that are tightly tied to the cost of those blobs. So better Ethereum translates to a lower cost of Arbitrum. Timeboost is the other significant new feature introduced. It is a bidding mechanism, whereby users and protocols can pay for priority access to blockspace. Arbitrum has become the first Rollup to offer this as a feature, and it has quickly evolved into a significant revenue-generating machine for the protocol. Pectra and Timeboost, together, signal a far-reaching pivot in the Arbitrum ecosystem. The DAO is not just adding new revenue streams; it is doing so in a way that doesn’t throw new bolts of complexity into the system or add overhead, which means a healthier financial model. Weekly Protocol Revenue Shows Clear Market Leaders In the previous week, protocols based on Arbitrum brought in a total of $1.18 million. That represents a 12 percent increase from the week before. This revenue performance definitely puts the decentralized layer-2 platform, which sits atop Ethereum, in the spotlight as far as demand and usage go. The largest revenue generator was GMX, a decentralized exchange focusing on perpetual trades, which generated $500,000. GMX remains a powerhouse on Arbitrum, where it provides high-leverage trades with low slippage. The strong revenues it produces almost certainly confirm its place at the top of the list of applications on the Arbitrum network. Gains Network finished in the second position, providing $140,000 of weekly revenue. It is an increasingly popular platform where synthetic assets are the main attractions. User scores on Smoothness, Mainstream appeal, and Friendship suggest it is a very user-friendly and appealing platform to use. Ostium Labs had revenue of $90,000, giving it the third-highest total among the top earners. Of note: Ostium is a newer protocol that’s gaining momentum and emerging as a serious competitor. Penpie and Uniswap tied for the fifth spot, each earning $74,000. Uniswap’s presence, as a major DeFi protocol, underscores the network’s appeal to not just native Arbitrum applications but also well-established projects from other ecosystems. Last week, @arbitrum protocols generated $1.18M in revenue (+12% WoW). One exchange, half a million in revenue. GMX is dominating the leaderboard. @GMX_IO : $500k @GainsNetwork_io : $140k @OstiumLabs : $90k @Penpiexyz_io : $74k @Uniswap : $74k pic.twitter.com/s1GEq6ZYj4 — Entropy Advisors (@EntropyAdvisors) May 28, 2025 A Leaner, Profitable DAO with a Strong Outlook The numbers tell a clear story: Arbitrum DAO is attaining a level of profitability and operational odds-and-ends that sets it apart. Its ability to grow revenue through tools like Timeboost and Orbit licensing, while keeping operational expenses under control, spotlights the clear power of decentralized coordination, when properly aligned with economic incentives. In the future, Arbitrum is set to keep up this momentum. With reductions in user costs from Ethereum upgrades and a continually expanding ecosystem, the DAO has now laid down the groundwork for long-term, sustainable financial health. If current trends continue, May could prove to be a real turning point—not just for Arbitrum, but also for the more general conversation around sustainable, profitable DAO governance. The Layer 2 landscape is competitive, but Arbitrum is not merely expanding within it; it is demonstrating that decentralization and efficiency can coexist and even, in this case, potentially set a new standard for what successful blockchain ecosystems might look like.

The regulator sought to protect investors and prevent the use of unauthorized digital asset trading platforms as a means of money laundering by criminals. Thailand’s regulatory agency warned investors using the pinpointed platforms to consider taking action regarding their assets on the platform before the platform’s closure date. At the same time, the regulator cautioned the public and investors to be careful when using services from unlicensed digital asset business operators, as they would not be protected by law. Both were at risk of being scammed by offenders who either wanted to steal their digital assets or get help with moving funds illegally. However, OKX spokesperson told Cryptopolitan that the company was aware of the recent announcement by the Thailand SEC regarding restricted access to certain digital asset platforms, including OKX, and they reaffirmed that the exchange was strongly committed to maintaining standards of regulatory compliance and to supporting a safe, transparent, and responsible trading environment. “We respect the legal frameworks of applicable jurisdictions and work proactively with regulators around the world. As a firm, we are fully committed to engaging with governments and law enforcement agencies to prevent illicit activities such as money laundering.” -OKX Spokesperson Thailand’s SEC directed investors to check and confirm the list of licensed business operators at the regulator’s official website and the SEC Check First application.

Ltd., the parent company behind the crypto exchange platform OKX, and nine individual supporters who promoted unlicensed services through different social media channels. The defendants were allegedly in violation of the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 (2018). Evidence-based on a referral and the SEC’s further investigation found that on 15th October 2021, OKX provided services for a digital asset trading system, facilitating the trading and exchange of digital assets while charging a fee of 0.1% of the trading value. Additionally, OKX solicited and promoted its services through its website and various social media channels, including Telegram under the account name “OKX TH,” Twitter (now X) through the handle “OKX Thai Community,” and Line OpenChat under the name “Thai Community.” The OKX activities were liable to be an operation of digital asset exchange business under Section 3 of the Emergency Decree, for which OKX had not obtained a license, in violation of Section 26, and subject to offenses and penalties under Section 66 of the Emergency Decree. OKX also received assistance and support in promoting its services and sales promotion activities from nine individuals, including Mr. Sarun Boonmesrisanga, Mr. Nut Joongwong, Mr. Kritsana Kritsananuwat, Mr. Smithi Charoenmin, Mr. Kittithat Benchacharoenpat, Mr. Saurawit Sanguanphokai, Mr. Akarawath Rujiruangchai, Mr. Rachata Chuesaibua, and Mr. Varut Vanichayakosol.

For those tracking innovation across technology sectors, including the decentralized space often discussed in the crypto community, the convergence of AI and hardware presents exciting possibilities. Leading AI development platform Hugging Face is making a notable move in this direction, recently unveiling two new Humanoid Robots aimed at democratizing access to advanced robotics. Exploring the New Hugging Face Robots Hugging Face, known primarily for its work in natural language processing and open-source AI models, has been steadily expanding its focus into robotics. Their latest announcement introduces two distinct, open-source robotic platforms: HopeJR and Reachy Mini. This release signifies a concrete step in making sophisticated hardware more accessible for AI development and research. Let’s take a closer look at what these new Hugging Face Robots offer: HopeJR: This is a full-size humanoid robot designed for complex physical interaction. It boasts 66 actuated degrees of freedom, allowing for a wide range of movements, including walking and detailed arm manipulation. The goal is to provide a robust platform for developing and testing advanced robotics algorithms in a human-like form factor. Reachy Mini: A smaller, desktop-sized unit. While not capable of full-body locomotion like HopeJR, it is highly interactive. Reachy Mini can move its head, talk, and listen, making it an ideal tool for testing AI applications focused on interaction, communication, and basic manipulation in a controlled environment. Both robots are designed with the developer and researcher in mind, aiming to lower the traditional barriers associated with high-end robotics hardware. The Power of Open Source Robotics A core philosophy behind Hugging Face’s approach is the commitment to open source. This principle is central to their AI models and platforms, and they are extending it to their hardware initiatives. Making these new robots open source means that the designs, software, and potentially even hardware specifications are available for anyone to study, modify, and build upon. As Hugging Face co-founder and CEO, Clem Delangue, emphasized, the goal is to prevent the robotics field from being dominated by a few large entities using proprietary, ‘black-box’ systems. Open Source Robotics fosters collaboration, accelerates innovation, and allows for greater transparency and understanding of how these complex systems work. This mirrors the open-source movement seen in software development and even aspects of the decentralized technology space, where shared knowledge drives progress. Making Robotics Accessible with Affordable Robots Beyond being open source, a critical factor in lowering the barrier to entry is cost. Robotics hardware has historically been prohibitively expensive for many researchers, students, and smaller development teams. Hugging Face is tackling this head-on with aggressive pricing targets for their new units. The full-size HopeJR is estimated to cost under $3,000 per unit. The desktop Reachy Mini is even more accessible, projected to cost between $250 and $300, depending on factors like tariffs. These price points position them as significantly more Affordable Robots compared to many existing professional or research-grade platforms. This affordability can open up robotics research and development to a much wider audience, potentially leading to a surge in creative applications and advancements. Hugging Face’s Broader Push into AI Robotics The release of HopeJR and Reachy Mini is not an isolated event but part of Hugging Face’s broader, multi-year strategy to become a key player in the AI robotics space. Their efforts began gaining significant momentum with the launch of LeRobot in 2024. LeRobot is an initiative providing a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools specifically curated for building robotics systems. This year, Hugging Face has continued to build out its AI Robotics ecosystem. They released an updated version of their 3D-printed robotic arm, the SO-101, developed in partnership with The Robot Studio. They also expanded the training data available on the LeRobot platform through a collaboration with AI startup Yaak, adding valuable data for training systems like self-driving machines. The recent acquisition of humanoid robotics startup Pollen Robotics in April provided Hugging Face with essential expertise and capabilities needed to develop the new humanoid platforms, according to CEO Delangue. What This Means for the Future The introduction of affordable, open-source humanoid robots like HopeJR and Reachy Mini has significant implications for the future of AI and robotics development. By providing accessible hardware platforms alongside their open AI software tools (like LeRobot), Hugging Face is creating an integrated ecosystem that empowers a diverse community of developers. This accessibility can accelerate experimentation, education, and the development of novel applications for robots in various fields. It aligns with a broader trend towards democratizing technology, moving power and innovation from centralized entities to a wider, distributed network of creators. Availability While an exact shipping timeline is still being finalized, Hugging Face anticipates shipping the first units of these robots by the end of the year. A waitlist is currently open for those interested in acquiring either HopeJR or Reachy Mini to begin their own AI Robotics projects. Conclusion Hugging Face’s unveiling of HopeJR and Reachy Mini marks a pivotal moment in making advanced robotics more attainable. By focusing on Open Source Robotics and delivering truly Affordable Robots , they are actively working to lower the barriers that have traditionally limited participation in this field. These new Humanoid Robots , supported by Hugging Face’s growing AI Robotics platform, represent a revolutionary step towards a future where sophisticated robotic hardware is accessible to a much wider global community of innovators and developers.

In fact, both these crypto coins have seen double-digit increases on the monthly charts, which came as BTC reached a new ATH. Despite this, many whales are now turning to Unilabs (UNIL) – a phase two presale star. This crypto ICO event has been great so far, having raised over $1M and potentially soaring to $2M before June ends. Early buyers of the UNIL crypto coin are now enjoying nearly a 30% return. As Unilabs also made headlines by launching the first AI-powered DeFi asset manager, many whales think that UNIL has the most room for growth in the long run. Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Picks Up Steam With Over $1M Raised While the price of ADA and the DOGE price have been seeing good growth on the weekly charts, all eyes seem to be on Unilabs (UNIL) . Whales are interested in this crypto coin as they have noticed early buyers of it are now enjoying nearly a 30% return. Interest is high as nearly 300M UNIL tokens have been sold in the second presale round alone, helping Unilabs raise over $1M. This project was already gaining attention because it introduced something new to the DeFi market. It launched the first AI-driven DeFi asset management platform with over $30M AUM. In addition to their asset management, users can access the Unilabs Launchpad, which uses AI to forecast the most promising crypto coins long before they become popular. Thus, Unilabs could become a fan-favorite among millions. Anybody looking for governance voting rights on the platform and a share of its total fees is buying up the UNIL crypto coin during its presale. It is now in its second stage and costs just $0.0051 – nearly a 30% increase from its starting value of $0.004. But, this value will continue rising to $0.0062 after the third presale starts. Given that Lido and Yearn Finance skyrocketed post-launch, the AI integration of Unilabs makes it one of the top projects to watch this year. Sssebi: The Price of ADA May Soar to $0.80 Cardano (ADA) is one of the best cryptos and has seen some growth. CoinMarketCap shows its value has increased nearly 10% in the past 30 days. During that time, the price of ADA grew from around $0.70 to over $0.75. Market expert Sssebi thinks this bullish momentum will continue for Cardano (ADA). According to his X post, this altcoin consolidates within a symmetrical triangle. With buy pressure in the $0.70 area, he foresees a breakout for the price of ADA to $0.80 soon. Although this Cardano price prediction has turned some heads, many investors are still skeptical. Since the price of ADA has already soared over 60% on the YTD chart, its highest growth may be behind it. Therefore, traders are turning to crypto coins like UNIL instead. Experts Claims a Bullish Trend Is Coming for the DOGE Price Dogecoin (DOGE) is another crypto coin riding a bullish wave. On the one-month chart, the DOGE price surged from around $0.18 to over $0.22, as per CoinMarketCap. In other words, nearly a 25% jump for this meme coin in just a few weeks. The community is watching this token because of the analyst CEO’s bold Dogecoin price prediction. In a recent post, CEO told his X followers that history is repeating for this meme coin as its current chart is very bullish. He foresees the DOGE price potentially soaring past $1 soon. But, some traders are cautiously optimistic about Dogecoin (DOGE). It is worth noting that this meme coin has not yet reached the $1 mark, although it was launched in 2013. Since it also has a high market cap of around $35B, a lot of new money must come in for the DOGE price to soar. As a result, investors are focusing more on UNIL. What Makes Unilabs (UNIL) Stand Out From Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE)? Unilabs (UNIL) is becoming a huge hit among whales, although the price of ADA and the DOGE price may continue their growth. It will have more utility than the hype-based DOGE meme coin while boasting a smaller market cap than ADA. Thus, the adoption rate of the UNIL crypto coin will be faster. As a result, traders rush to get this token before its value skyrockets after a major crypto exchange listing.

These crypto coins experienced a double-digit increase thanks to the market-wide rally after BTC soared past $110K. Even market experts like Kaleo and Henry excited traders with their bullish Ethereum and Solana predictions. Meanwhile, one crypto coin in its second presale round is also going viral – Unilabs (UNIL) . This project has already crossed the $1M funds raised milestone in its presale and could reach $2M before June ends. Since it also redefined the market with its unique AI-driven DeFi asset management platform, traders are looking at UNIL as one of the best cryptos to buy for fast returns this year. Unilabs (UNIL) Smashes the $1M Milestone in Initial Coin Offering Unilabs (UNIL) has been stealing the spotlight while the ETH price and the Solana price are seeing growth. This is all thanks to its great initial coin offering performance, which has already raised over $1M and provided early buyers with a 30% return. Nearly 300M UNIL tokens have been bought in the second presale phase alone. All these numbers are guaranteed to increase soon since this crypto ICO event is still in its early stages. Interest in Unilabs is rising as it recently launched the first DeFi asset manager, which uses AI technology to its advantage. On it, users get access to cutting-edge features that help them maximize their profits. For instance, Unilabs Launchpad uses AI-powered insights to locate the best cryptos regarding growth potential. This will let users buy them before they explode in popularity. By holding the UNIL crypto coin, traders will get many perks. Notably, Unilabs will take up to 30% of its total generated fees and redistribute them back to UNIL holders. This will be done in a five-tiered system that rewards people who hold the most UNIL. Now is a good time to buy this crypto coin since it costs just $0.0051, but its value will soar to $0.0062 after the third presale stage begins. Plus, a Tier-1 CEX listing will trigger a massive spike. Kaleo: The ETH Price Looks Ready To Reach $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) is one of the best cryptos at the moment. CoinMarketCap shows that the ETH price increased from around $1,800 to over $2,600 in the past 30 days. In other words, Ethereum experienced nearly 50% growth in a few weeks. Market expert Kaleo thinks this bullish uptrend will continue for Ethereum (ETH). In a recent X post, Kaleo said he is incredibly bullish on this crypto coin. He even foresees the ETH price potentially soaring to $4,000. Despite this bullish Ethereum price prediction, some traders are still skeptical. Since it has a high market cap of around $320B, much new money must come in for the ETH price to rise. Therefore, traders are focusing on UNIL, which could see faster growth than the ETH price. Analyst Claims the Solana Price May Pump to $300 Solana (SOL) is another crypto coin that is turning some heads now. On the one-month chart, the value of Solana increased by over 15%, as per CoinMarketCap. The Solana price grew from around $150 to over $170 in that period. The community is also excited about this token because of analyst Henry’s bullish Solana price prediction. According to his X post, this crypto coin is seeing a classic range-bound accumulation that comes before an explosive uptrend. Thus, he foresees the Solana price potentially soaring to $300. Although this statement has made some waves for Solana (SOL), many investors still put it on the sidelines for UNIL. This could be because the Solana price has only managed to grow around 5% in the past year alone, which suggests it may have trouble maintaining a long-term bullish rally. Can Unilabs (UNIL) Gain More Traction Than Crypto Coins Like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL)? While the ETH price and the Solana price could continue their uptrends, Unilabs (UNIL) is also making a name for itself. The opportunities for passive income thanks to this crypto coin are outstanding. For instance, it offers up to 122% APY in staking rewards. This factor and its redistribution model could make it more appealing than Ethereum and Solana. Its smaller market cap also ensures faster price growth than these crypto coins. As a result, investors are stocking up on UNIL as it could be one of the best cryptos to buy this year.

French football powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has reportedly made a groundbreaking move, establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve . This development, initially reported by BeInCrypto, positions the Ligue 1 champions at the forefront of integrating cryptocurrency into traditional institutional finance within the sports sector. While many sports teams and leagues have dipped their toes into the crypto space through fan tokens, sponsorships, or NFTs, PSG’s reported decision to hold Bitcoin directly on its balance sheet is a distinct and potentially transformative step. It signals a level of confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a strategic asset. What Exactly is a Sports Team Bitcoin Reserve? In traditional finance, companies and institutions often hold reserves in various assets, primarily fiat currency, but also potentially in gold, real estate, or other stable investments, to manage liquidity, hedge against inflation, or diversify their holdings. A Sports Team Bitcoin reserve means the club is choosing to allocate a portion of its treasury funds directly into Bitcoin. This differs significantly from other crypto activities we’ve seen in sports: Fan Tokens: These are cryptocurrencies specifically for fans, offering voting rights, rewards, and access to exclusive content. They are primarily a fan engagement and revenue-generating tool, not a treasury management strategy. Sponsorships: Crypto exchanges or projects sponsoring teams provides marketing for the crypto entity and revenue for the team, but the team doesn’t necessarily hold the sponsored cryptocurrency. NFTs: Non-fungible tokens representing digital collectibles are another revenue stream and fan engagement method, not a direct investment in a core cryptocurrency like Bitcoin for treasury purposes. By establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve , the club is making an investment decision about its own corporate treasury, similar to how some major corporations have started holding Bitcoin. Why Would a Football Club Embrace Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? PSG’s move into holding Institutional Bitcoin is likely driven by several strategic considerations: 1. Inflation Hedge: Like many corporations exploring Bitcoin, PSG may view BTC as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of traditional fiat currencies. Holding a scarce digital asset could preserve purchasing power over the long term. 2. Asset Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to their treasury diversifies their holdings beyond traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing crypto-specific volatility). 3. Innovation and Brand Image: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like Bitcoin can enhance PSG’s brand image as innovative and forward-thinking. This resonates with a younger, globally connected, and tech-savvy fanbase. 4. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term appreciation potential. A successful investment could directly benefit the club’s financial health. 5. Attracting a Global Digital Audience: Embracing Bitcoin connects PSG with the vast and growing global cryptocurrency community, potentially attracting new fans and commercial opportunities in digital markets. This step into Institutional Bitcoin by a major football club is a powerful signal to the market and other traditional institutions. Is PSG Truly the First Crypto Sports Pioneer in This Way? The claim that PSG is the first sports organization to introduce a Bitcoin reserve needs careful consideration. While many sports entities are involved with crypto, holding Bitcoin directly on the balance sheet for treasury purposes is indeed less common than fan tokens or sponsorships. Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pioneering the ‘corporate treasury’ use case. PSG appears to be the first major professional sports *team* to publicly announce such a move specifically for Bitcoin reserves. Other sports entities might have exposure to crypto through investments in blockchain companies or receiving payments in crypto, but a dedicated ‘Bitcoin reserve’ signals a deliberate strategy to hold BTC as a primary treasury asset. This distinction is crucial and positions PSG as a notable pioneer in the intersection of Crypto Sports and corporate finance. Benefits and Challenges of a Football Club Crypto Strategy Adopting a Football Club Crypto strategy, particularly one involving holding volatile assets like Bitcoin, comes with potential rewards and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Financial Upside: If Bitcoin appreciates, the value of the reserve increases, boosting the club’s assets. Enhanced Reputation: Seen as innovative and aligned with future technology trends. New Revenue Streams: Opens doors for crypto-related partnerships and fan engagement initiatives. Global Reach: Connects with the worldwide crypto community. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the reserve. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires robust security measures against hacking and theft. Public Perception: Fluctuations in the reserve’s value could attract negative media attention or fan scrutiny. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex under current standards. Any Football Club Crypto strategy involving treasury reserves requires careful risk management and a long-term perspective. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Sports ? PSG’s reported move could be a watershed moment for Crypto Sports integration. If successful, it could inspire other major sports clubs and organizations across football, basketball, baseball, and other leagues to explore similar strategies. We might see a trend where: More teams consider holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury management. Crypto assets become more integrated into sports finance beyond just marketing and fan engagement. Competition increases among teams to be seen as technologically advanced and appealing to the digital generation. New financial products and services emerge specifically for sports organizations dealing with crypto. This development underscores the increasing convergence of the traditional financial world, institutional investment, and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, now reaching into the mainstream world of global sports. Actionable Insights for Fans and Investors For fans, this news highlights PSG’s commitment to innovation and potentially offers new ways to engage with the club in the future, perhaps through crypto-enabled platforms or services tied to the club’s digital strategy. For crypto investors, PSG’s move is another data point indicating growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While one team’s investment is not a guarantee of future price movements, it adds to the narrative of Bitcoin gaining acceptance as a legitimate asset class among diverse institutions. It’s a reminder that the integration of crypto into mainstream sectors is accelerating, creating both opportunities and the need for continued education and careful consideration of risks. A Bold Step into the Digital Future Paris Saint-Germain’s reported establishment of a PSG Bitcoin Reserve marks a bold and significant step. As potentially the first major sports team to directly hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset, they are navigating uncharted territory within the sports industry. This move reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin among institutions and signals a potential shift in how major sports organizations manage their finances and engage with the digital economy. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of diversification, inflation hedging, and brand innovation are clear. The world will be watching to see if other clubs follow PSG’s lead, further solidifying the link between Crypto Sports and the future of finance.

As of press time, ETH is trading at $2,631, down 3.79% in the past 24 hours, suggesting short-term selling pressure. But beneath the surface lies a classic technical setup that could decide the next big move to its resistance around $2,700–$2,800. Liquidation Cluster: A Trouble or an Opportunity? According to a post analyst, “The Kingfisher” , there’s a significant concentration of long liquidations between $2,600 and $2,700. This creates a liquidity “magnet” meaning, if ETH dips into this zone, we could see a domino effect of liquidations. With price currently near $2,631, ETH is closer to is crucial zone. The thesis highlights that the short liquidations above are comparatively light. This asymmetry suggests a steeper downside risk, especially if market sentiment flips bearish. A slip could trigger a flush toward $2,510, or even $2,319 if panic sets in. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Ethereum’s 1-D chart shows an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern, with resistance holding near $2,800. A strong daily close above $2,800 would confirm the triangle breakout. In that case, ETH could rise above the $3,000 psychological resistance to surge toward $3,100–$3,300, backed by short squeezes and breakout momentum. Conversely, If ETH fails to break out and drops below $2,510, it would invalidate the bullish pattern. A further breakdown below $2,320 would open the gates to $2,200, where the next major support lies. Read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term targets!

On Wednesday, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled that many of Donald Trump’s tariffs exceed the authority granted to the president by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The federal court struck down Trump’s April 2nd executive order establishing tariffs against 57 countries worldwide and several follow-up executive orders modifying the duties’ rates and start dates. The CIT also axed a slew of earlier tariffs Trump had applied to Mexico, Canada and China, which he claimed were retaliation for failing to stop the flood of illegal narcotics into the US. The Trump Administration immediately appealed the CIT’s ruling and requested a stay on the judgment, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted . White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the CIT’s ruling on Thursday, arguing that Trump’s “sensitive diplomatic and trade negotiations” were being “derailed by activist judges.” Equities largely tracked sideways throughout the legal drama, with the S&P 500 ticking up 0.4% on Thursday and the Nasdaq Composite jumping by 0.39%.

The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and finding opportunities for Bitcoin Yield is becoming increasingly sought after. Traditionally, earning yield on crypto often involved lending platforms that required you to give up custody of your assets. But what if you could earn yield while keeping your Bitcoin safe and sound in your own wallet? That’s where a new development on the Lightning Network is making waves. What is Amboss Rails and How Does it Offer Bitcoin Yield? Amboss, a well-known name in the Lightning Network ecosystem for analytics and node management, has launched a service called Rails. This innovative platform is designed to allow users to earn Bitcoin Yield directly on the Lightning Network. Unlike some other yield-generating methods, Rails operates on a self-custodial basis, meaning you retain control of your private keys and your Bitcoin throughout the process. Rails achieves this by facilitating two primary activities on the Lightning Network: Payment Routing: By running a Lightning node connected to Rails, users can earn small fees by routing payments across the network. When someone sends a Lightning payment, it travels through a series of nodes. Your node can earn a small fraction of the transaction fee for participating in the route. Liquidity Leasing: The Lightning Network relies on ‘channels’ filled with liquidity (Bitcoin) to route payments. Rails allows users to lease out their channel liquidity to other nodes or businesses that need it. In return for providing this crucial liquidity, users can earn yield. This dual approach leverages the fundamental mechanics of the Lightning Network to create earning opportunities directly tied to network activity and infrastructure needs. Boosting Lightning Network Activity Through Amboss Rails One of the key goals behind Amboss Rails is not just to offer users a way to generate Passive Bitcoin Income , but also to significantly boost the overall health and liquidity of the Lightning Network itself. A more liquid network is a more efficient and reliable network for payments. Think of it like a road network. The more well-maintained roads with sufficient capacity there are, the smoother traffic flows. Similarly, the more liquidity available in Lightning channels, the easier and more reliable it is for users to send and receive payments quickly and cheaply. By incentivizing users to provide liquidity and run well-connected nodes through yield generation, Rails directly contributes to making the Lightning Network a more robust and attractive platform for everyday transactions. This could play a crucial role in driving wider adoption of Bitcoin for payments. Who Can Benefit from Amboss Rails and Crypto Earning? Amboss Rails is designed with a variety of users in mind, particularly those who are serious about participating in and benefiting from the growth of the Lightning Network . The platform is targeting both institutions and businesses, recognizing their potential to contribute significant liquidity and benefit from reliable Crypto Earning opportunities. Early partners like CoinCorner, a prominent Bitcoin exchange, and Flux, a decentralized infrastructure provider, are already integrating with Rails. This indicates interest from established players in leveraging the service for their operations and potentially offering it to their users. While the service is sophisticated and likely requires some technical understanding to set up and manage a Lightning node effectively, the concept of earning Passive Bitcoin Income without handing over custody is appealing to a broad range of Bitcoin holders, from individuals with larger holdings to companies looking to optimize their treasury assets. Understanding the Mechanics: Payment Routing and Liquidity Leasing To truly grasp how Amboss Rails enables Bitcoin Yield , let’s look a bit closer at the two core mechanisms: Payment Routing: When a Lightning payment is initiated, the network finds a path of connected nodes with open channels and sufficient balance to route the payment. Nodes along the path earn a small fee (routing fee) for forwarding the payment. The amount earned depends on the volume of payments routed and the fees the node charges (which can be adjusted). Liquidity Leasing: Nodes or businesses needing more capacity in their channels to send or receive larger payments can ‘lease’ liquidity. Through Rails, users can offer their channel capacity for lease. The leasing terms (duration, yield rate) are agreed upon, and the provider earns yield for the period the liquidity is locked in the leased channel. Both methods are integral to the functioning of the Lightning Network and provide legitimate ways to earn a return based on providing essential network services. Challenges and Considerations for Earning Passive Bitcoin Income While the prospect of generating Passive Bitcoin Income through Amboss Rails is exciting, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Technical Complexity: Running a reliable Lightning node and managing channels effectively requires technical knowledge. Users need to understand channel management, balancing, and maintaining uptime. Variable Yield: The amount of Bitcoin Yield earned through routing fees can fluctuate significantly based on network activity and payment volume. Liquidity leasing might offer more predictable returns but depends on demand for liquidity. Capital Requirements: Earning meaningful yield typically requires dedicating a reasonable amount of Bitcoin to channels for routing and leasing. Channel Management: Actively managing channels, opening and closing them strategically, and ensuring they are well-connected is crucial for maximizing earning potential. Rails aims to simplify some aspects of this, particularly on the leasing side, but users should still approach it with a clear understanding of how the Lightning Network operates. The Future of Bitcoin Yield and the Lightning Network Amboss Rails represents a significant step forward in making Bitcoin Yield accessible on the Lightning Network in a self-custodial manner. By creating incentives for users to provide essential network services like routing and liquidity, it not only offers earning potential but also directly contributes to the network’s growth and efficiency. As the Lightning Network continues to mature and adoption increases, services like Rails could become increasingly popular, providing a virtuous cycle where earning opportunities grow alongside network usage. This could solidify the Lightning Network’s position as the premier layer-2 solution for fast, cheap Bitcoin transactions. For anyone interested in earning yield on their Bitcoin while supporting decentralized network infrastructure, exploring Amboss Rails and understanding the mechanics of Crypto Earning on the Lightning Network is a compelling prospect. Summary: Amboss Rails Opens New Doors for Bitcoin Earning In conclusion, Amboss has launched Rails, a self-custodial service enabling users to earn Bitcoin Yield on the Lightning Network . Through payment routing and liquidity leasing, Rails offers a novel way to generate Passive Bitcoin Income while maintaining control of your assets. Targeting businesses and institutions initially, with partners like CoinCorner and Flux on board, the platform aims to boost Lightning Network liquidity and adoption. While requiring some technical engagement, it presents a significant opportunity for those looking to participate in the network’s growth and benefit from Crypto Earning directly on layer 2.

In a filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, Georgia-based data broker giant LexisNexis Risk Solutions (LNRS) says that it discovered a breach affecting 364,333 people. “We learned that on December 25, 2024, an unauthorized third party acquired certain LNRS data from a third-party platform used for software development. The issue did not affect LNRS?s own networks or systems… The types of impacted personal information varied by affected individual, and could have included name, contact information (such as phone number, postal or email address), Social Security number, driver’s license number or date of birth. No financial or credit card information was affected.” LNRS says it immediately sent letters to affected customers to inform them of the breach, while offering free identity monitoring services to affected individuals for two years. LNRS also says it has not yet detected any instance involving the misuse of the stolen customer data. The firm is urging customers to stay vigilant and report any suspicious activity related to their financial accounts. LNRS says it has “launched an investigation with the assistance of leading external cybersecurity experts, notified law enforcement and took steps to review and further enhance our security controls.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

45278258,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=737590,1748589019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45278258.jpeg,China’s tech giants are moving away from Nvidia,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-tech-giants-build-ai-without-nvidia/,"Chinese tech giants are tearing themselves away from Nvidia after being backed into a corner by the White House. Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu have started moving their AI development onto Chinese-made chips, as Donald Trump’s new export restrictions slam the brakes on Nvidia’s sales to China. These companies have no choice, as their remaining stock of Nvidia processors is drying up fast, and the next batch may never come. According to the Financial Times , the trigger came last month when Trump’s administration tightened export rules again. This time, it blocked Nvidia’s already weakened H20 chips, the only model the company had tweaked to barely stay legal under earlier restrictions set under Joe Biden. Now that option’s dead too. Chinese firms are being forced to plan around a complete cutoff, with insiders saying their current Nvidia inventory might only carry them through to early 2026. And even if new chips get approved, they take three to six months to arrive … if they ever do. Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu test Chinese chips instead Baidu’s head of its AI cloud division, Shen Dou, told analysts last week that his company is already experimenting with other chips. He said Baidu sees “domestically developed self-sufficient chips, along with increasingly efficient homegrown software stacks” as a future-proof base for their AI ecosystem. Shen also said that their team is especially focused on finding chips that can take over inference tasks—basically, the part of AI that does the thinking after a model is trained. Eddie Wu, who leads Alibaba, said earlier this month that his company is now “actively exploring diversified solutions to meet rising customer demand.” That means they’re testing replacements, knowing their reliance on Nvidia can’t continue. At Tencent, Martin Lau told analysts they still have enough powerful chips to train models for “a few more generations,” but added they’re now being more cautious with how chips are used and said the company might “potentially make use of other chips” to handle future needs. Beijing’s own security research arm is paying close attention too. The China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, which works under the state security ministry, posted that while the US restrictions were damaging, they had led to more Chinese innovation in the AI chip sector. They specifically pointed to Huawei’s Ascend series, saying demand for those chips is rising fast. So far, buyers have mainly been big state-owned operations like China Mobile and industries like defense, finance, and health. But now, tech firms like Baidu and Alibaba are getting in line to grab whatever is available. Huawei chips bring legal risk but growing demand There’s one huge problem though. Washington is still watching Huawei closely. US authorities issued a warning this month saying that using Ascend chips anywhere in the world could lead to criminal charges. That’s why companies testing them are staying quiet, even though everyone knows what’s going on behind the scenes. Still, analysts at GF Securities believe Nvidia might try to release another chip that fits the new US rules. They expect something around early July, and say it’ll likely be built on Nvidia’s Blackwell platform. But it won’t come with high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, which is a critical piece of fast data processing. It’s also unclear if it will have NVLink, which lets Nvidia chips communicate faster with each other. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, admitted during the last earnings call that there’s nothing on the table right now. “We don’t have anything at the moment,” Huang said, leaving companies like Alibaba and Tencent in limbo. If they want to ditch Nvidia, they’ll have to rebuild their entire system around something else. The code they currently run is built on Nvidia’s CUDA software. Porting it to Huawei’s CANN platform takes months and usually requires help from Huawei engineers to make sure everything runs properly. Huawei is trying to step up production, working with partners and even launching its own chip-making plant. But still, demand is already outpacing supply. Other Chinese chipmakers like Cambricon and Hygon are also being pulled into the ring. Baidu and Alibaba have even started building their own processors to make sure they don’t run out of options.

Maintaining transparency around its reserves is crucial for user trust and the stability of the broader cryptocurrency market. Recent disclosures from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas offered a significant update on the composition of the company’s Tether reserves, highlighting substantial Bitcoin holdings and considerable Gold reserves. What Exactly Did Tether Disclose About Its Crypto Reserves? Speaking to attendees, Paolo Ardoino confirmed that Tether holds over 100,000 BTC. At the time of the announcement, this Bitcoin holdings position was valued at more than $10 billion, underscoring Tether’s significant stake in the leading cryptocurrency. Beyond digital assets, Ardoino also revealed that Tether possesses over 50 tons of physical gold as part of its Tether reserves, adding a traditional safe-haven asset to its portfolio. This announcement, reported by CoinDesk, provides a more granular look at the assets underpinning the USDT stablecoin, which aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. While Tether regularly publishes attestations regarding its reserves, specific details like the exact amounts of particular assets like Bitcoin and gold offer valuable insight into their strategy and the depth of their backing. Why Are Strong Stablecoin Reserves So Important? The stability and trustworthiness of a stablecoin like USDT are directly tied to the quality and accessibility of its underlying reserves. These reserves are the assets that stablecoin issuers hold to back the value of the tokens in circulation. When a user wants to redeem their USDT, Tether is expected to be able to provide them with the equivalent value in U.S. dollars or other assets. Key functions of robust stablecoin reserves include: Maintaining the Peg: Sufficient reserves allow the issuer to manage supply and demand, buying back tokens if the price dips below the peg or issuing new ones if demand drives the price above. Enabling Redemptions: Users need confidence that they can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying asset (in USDT’s case, USD) at any time. Strong, liquid reserves ensure this capability. Building Trust: Transparency and strength in reserves are fundamental to building and maintaining user trust in the stablecoin issuer and the token itself. Tether’s disclosure of specific, large crypto reserves like Bitcoin holdings and Gold reserves is intended to reinforce this trust by demonstrating tangible asset backing. What Do These Massive Bitcoin Holdings Signify? Tether has publicly stated its strategy to allocate a portion of its profits into investments, including Bitcoin. Holding over 100,000 BTC makes Tether one of the most significant non-public company holders of Bitcoin globally. This indicates: Confidence in Bitcoin: Tether views Bitcoin as a valuable asset class and a potential store of value, suitable for inclusion in its Tether reserves. Diversification Strategy: Including Bitcoin diversifies the reserve portfolio beyond traditional assets like Treasury Bills, potentially offering different risk/reward characteristics. Market Impact: While these holdings weren’t acquired overnight, Tether’s continuous accumulation has likely been a factor in Bitcoin’s market dynamics, positioning them as a major player in the crypto reserves space. This level of Bitcoin holdings adds a substantial, albeit volatile, component to the stablecoin reserves. Is Gold Reserves Tether’s Play for Traditional Investors? The inclusion of over 50 tons of physical gold is a notable aspect of Tether’s Tether reserves strategy. Gold has historically been seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. By holding physical gold, Tether is adding a tangible, widely recognized store of value to its backing assets. This could potentially appeal to a broader range of investors, including those more comfortable with traditional assets than purely digital ones. The decision to include Gold reserves suggests a move towards a more diversified and perhaps more conservative element within the crypto reserves mix, balancing newer digital assets like Bitcoin with established traditional assets. How Does This Disclosure Impact Confidence in the USDT Stablecoin? Transparency regarding stablecoin reserves has been a major point of discussion and sometimes contention in the crypto industry. By publicly stating the specific amounts of significant assets like Bitcoin and gold, Tether aims to increase confidence in the backing of the USDT stablecoin. For many users and market participants, knowing that tangible and high-value assets form a significant part of the Tether reserves provides reassurance. While discussions about the full auditability and liquidity of all reserve components continue, this direct disclosure from the CEO at a major industry event is a step towards greater openness regarding their stablecoin reserves. Key Takeaways for Readers: Tether holds significant amounts of both Bitcoin (over 100k BTC) and physical gold (over 50 tons) in its reserves. These assets form a substantial part of the backing for the USDT stablecoin. Holding Bitcoin reflects a strategic investment and diversification into digital assets. Holding gold adds a traditional, tangible store of value to the Tether reserves. These disclosures aim to increase transparency and confidence in Tether’s ability to back USDT. Paolo Ardoino’s announcement at Bitcoin 2025 provides a clear snapshot of two major components within the Tether reserves: massive Bitcoin holdings and substantial Gold reserves. This revelation underscores Tether’s strategy to diversify its backing assets and reinforces its position as a major player not just in stablecoins but also as a significant holder of key traditional and digital assets. For users of the USDT stablecoin and observers of the crypto reserves market, this transparency is a crucial factor in evaluating the stablecoin’s reliability and the overall health of the stablecoin reserves landscape.

Are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/QKR8YgcyPP — André Dragosch, PhD (@Andre_Dragosch) May 29, 2025 Highlighting a chart titled “Rolling Correlation: 10-Year UST Futures”, Dragosch has revealed that the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin and the US 10-Year Treasury Futures has plummeted to its lowest level ever recorded. The revelation has triggered a serious discussion on ‘are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy Bitcoin?’ US 10-Year Treasury Yield: A Simple Analysis At the start of April, the US 10-Year Bond Yield was 4.213%. Though at a point on April 4, it slipped as low as 3.859%, between April 7 and 11, it climbed steeply by 15.44%. On April 11, it hit the month’s peak of 4.590%. After hitting the peak, the market witnessed two minor corrections that month: a 4.48% correction b/w April 14 and 16 and a 4.34% correction b/w April 24 and 29. In the early half of this month, the US 10-Year Bond Yield saw a steady rise. Between May 1 and 21, it surged by 9.99%. At one point on May 22, it reached a peak of 4.629%. Currently, the yield sits at 4.420% – at least 4.49% below the peak of the month. Bitcoin Price Action: An Overview At the beginning of April, the Bitcoin price was $82,497.20. Although between April 1 and 8, the price dropped by 10.27%, between April 9 and 30, it almost steadily grew by 23.34%. In the early half of this month, the Bitcoin market also witnessed a steep increase. Between May 1 and 22 alone, the market jumped by 18.63%, from $94,123.24 to a peak of $11,653.95. Since May 23, the market has dropped by over 5.16%. A Final Note During May, both US 10-Year Treasury Yield and Bitcoin price saw significant increases, indicating a risk-on environment where both traditional safe assets and riskier assets were bought. However, Bitcoin’s initial April drop while yields also fluctuated, then its subsequent strong recovery coinciding with rising yields, hints at some capital rotation into Bitcoin as bond attractiveness waned. The subsequent minor corrections in both assets at the end of April and May suggest some profit-taking or shifting market sentiment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $358 Million Net Outflow: 10-Day Inflow Streak Ends BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the exception of the day, recording net inflows of $125 million alone, according to data provider SoSoValue.

Investment strategies are constantly evolving, and Pantera Capital, a prominent name in cryptocurrency investment, recently revealed a fascinating approach. They are looking beyond direct investment in digital assets and putting capital into publicly listed companies that hold significant crypto reserves on their balance sheets. This move signals a growing trend in how institutional players view and interact with the digital asset ecosystem. Why are Companies Building Crypto Reserves ? The idea of a company holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum as part of its corporate treasury might seem unconventional to some, but it’s a strategy gaining traction. Companies adopt this approach for various reasons: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about fiat currency devaluation, some companies see assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value that can appreciate over time, preserving purchasing power. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class like crypto can diversify a company’s holdings beyond traditional cash, bonds, and stocks. Alignment with Future Technologies: For companies operating in or adjacent to the tech sector, holding crypto can align their balance sheet with the decentralized future they might be building or interacting with. Attracting Talent and Investors: For some, having crypto reserves can signal forward-thinking leadership and potentially appeal to employees and investors interested in the digital asset space. This trend of companies accumulating crypto reserves provides a new avenue for investors like Pantera Capital to gain exposure to the digital asset market indirectly. Exploring Pantera Capital’s Investment Choices Pantera Capital, in a note to its investors, highlighted specific companies they have invested in due to their strategic decision to hold cryptocurrencies. This provides concrete examples of their strategy in action. According to reports, these include: Twenty One Capital: Described as a cryptocurrency venture company with a focus on Bitcoin investments. Investing here provides Pantera exposure to a company whose core business revolves around the leading cryptocurrency. DeFi Development: This entity has reportedly adopted Solana (SOL) as a strategic reserve asset. This investment gives Pantera exposure not just to a specific altcoin, but to a company actively involved in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, utilizing SOL within that ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming: This company has chosen to hold Ethereum (ETH) as a reserve asset. Investing in SharpLink Gaming offers Pantera exposure to a company in the gaming sector that sees value in holding the second-largest cryptocurrency, likely recognizing its importance in areas like NFTs and decentralized applications. These examples showcase Pantera’s diversified approach, targeting companies holding different key cryptocurrencies, reflecting varying strategic decisions by those companies. Is This a Smarter Institutional Investment Strategy? Pantera Capital articulated a clear rationale for investing in these companies rather than just buying the underlying cryptocurrencies directly. They believe this approach can offer greater upside potential . But why might that be the case? Investing in a public company holding crypto reserves means you are not just betting on the price movement of the crypto asset itself. You are also investing in the company’s core business, its growth prospects, management, and operational efficiency. If the company is successful in its primary business while also benefiting from the appreciation of its crypto holdings, the investment’s return could potentially outperform a simple direct investment in the crypto asset alone. Consider a scenario where a company uses its crypto reserves strategically, perhaps leveraging them for financing, integrating them into services, or simply benefiting from their balance sheet value while its main operations generate significant profit. The value derived from the successful core business combined with the crypto appreciation could provide a compounding effect not available through direct crypto ownership. Furthermore, investing in publicly listed companies often comes with layers of regulation, reporting requirements, and corporate governance that might appeal to large institutional investment firms seeking structures they are familiar with. What are the Potential Benefits of This Approach? For an investor like Pantera Capital, and potentially for other institutional investment firms considering similar strategies, the benefits can be numerous: Indirect Exposure with Structure: Gaining exposure to crypto price movements through regulated, publicly traded entities. Potential for Compounded Returns: Upside from both the underlying crypto asset’s performance and the company’s business growth. Access to Specific Sectors: Investing in companies allows targeted exposure to sectors like gaming, DeFi, or venture capital that are actively using or focused on specific cryptocurrencies. Familiar Investment Vehicle: Public stocks are a traditional asset class, making this strategy potentially easier to integrate into existing portfolios and risk management frameworks compared to direct crypto holdings. Regulatory Clarity (Relative): While crypto regulation is evolving, investing in a regulated public company provides a degree of familiarity and existing legal frameworks. This method provides a nuanced way to participate in the crypto market’s growth, blending traditional equity investment with digital asset exposure. Are There Downsides or Challenges? No investment strategy is without its risks. Investing in companies with crypto reserves introduces unique challenges: Double-Edged Sword of Volatility: The company’s stock price can be affected by both the volatility of its core business and the extreme volatility of its crypto holdings. Company-Specific Risk: You are exposed to the operational risks, management decisions, and financial health of the specific company, independent of the crypto market. Valuation Complexity: Valuing a company with significant, volatile crypto assets on its balance sheet can be more complex than valuing a traditional company or simply valuing the crypto asset itself. Correlation Risk: In market downturns, both the company’s stock and its crypto reserves might fall in tandem, amplifying losses. Tax and Accounting Issues: How companies manage and report their crypto reserves can introduce accounting complexities that might impact their financial statements. Investors must carefully evaluate both the company’s fundamentals and the potential impact of its crypto holdings. How Does This Differ from Direct Crypto Investment? Directly buying Bitcoin , Ethereum , or Solana means you own the asset itself. Your investment performance is directly tied to the price fluctuations of that specific cryptocurrency. Investing in a company with crypto reserves adds a layer of indirection. With direct crypto, you manage your own wallets, keys, and security. With company stock, you rely on the company’s management to handle the custody and strategic use of the crypto assets. Direct crypto offers pure exposure to the asset’s price. Investing in a company offers exposure to the asset’s price *plus* the performance of the company’s business. For large institutional investment firms, the infrastructure, regulatory environment, and reporting requirements around public equities are often more established than those for direct crypto holdings, making the company-based approach potentially more accessible or preferable for certain mandates. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Investment ? Pantera Capital’s strategy is indicative of a broader trend: institutional capital is finding increasingly sophisticated ways to enter the crypto market. While direct investment in Bitcoin ETFs and other funds is growing, strategies involving equity in crypto-exposed companies offer alternative risk/reward profiles. As more companies adopt crypto reserves, either as a treasury strategy or because their business involves digital assets, the universe of investable public companies with significant crypto exposure will likely grow. This provides traditional investors and crypto-focused funds like Pantera more options beyond simply buying crypto directly. This evolution suggests that the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world will continue to blur, creating new hybrid investment opportunities and strategies for sophisticated investors. Conclusion: A Strategic Evolution in Crypto Exposure Pantera Capital’s investment in publicly listed companies holding crypto reserves represents a notable strategic move in the institutional investment landscape. By targeting entities like Twenty One Capital, DeFi Development, and SharpLink Gaming, which hold assets like Bitcoin , Solana, and Ethereum , Pantera aims to capture potentially greater upside than direct crypto investment alone. This approach leverages the growth potential of both the underlying digital assets and the companies’ core businesses. While this strategy introduces unique complexities and risks compared to direct crypto ownership, it offers a structured, potentially more familiar pathway for large investors to gain exposure to the burgeoning digital asset class. It underscores the maturing of the crypto market and the innovative ways institutional capital is finding to participate in its future.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin’s unstoppable ascent showed a nice and steady rise. This recovery was possible due to easing tensions from the trade tariffs war, which led BTC to surge to a new all-time high of $112K. The price fell back recently as a post by Donald Trump brought back the trade tensions with european union this time, which led to a brief dip to $108K. But, 48 hours later he paused the recent impose with EU until June 9th.This move stopped the situation to get worsened. However, despite that, bears took it down to $105K, and recently it is taking 20-day EMA support. When the pause was announced, it seemed like the positivity and bullish narratives would quickly return to the table from crypto traders, and it would take out the $112K resistance, but the bulls’ strength felt short to flip $112K.. Now, in the past couple of days, its price action is withdrawing back from its all-time high level, and it seems like it is on the verge of falling to the 50-day EMA band in the short term, around $ 100 K. Also, the Market sentiment has shifted from optimistic to pessimistic. The BTC long/short ratio currently stands at 0.9501, which has declined from 1.0288, indicating that bulls have weakened. This shows that bullish forces have halted the momentum in the short term, and bears are not on the sidelines anymore; they are kicking in to push the price lower. However, if a situation changes in the short term and bearishness wanes, then the newly formed all-time high must be taken out. If it does, then it will enter price discovery mode. In that condition, BTC could target a near-term target of $120,000, with the potential for even higher levels in the coming months. However, if bulls fail toreignite momentum then a pullback to $100,000 or lower, could be likely. Supporting this cautious view, on-chain data reveals that a substantial amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 1 to 2 years, 180-days to 1year, and 90-days to 180 days has recently become active. This kind of movement is often interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting that short-term holders below 2 years might be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

As interest builds up around Solana’s performance, newer alternative coins like Mutuum Finance are also entering into the fray among investors on the lookout for the next huge crypto. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built not to fall to the collapse risk of its algorithmic counterparts. This transparent and secure architecture, supported by open-source smart contracts and now formally attested through the completion of a Certik audit, guarantees healthy financial transactions. With the intersection of next-generation lending technology and robust infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is reshaping the future of decentralized finance. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.5 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,400 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with a preset price of $0.06, profits will be 100%. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. Solana may be eyeing $1,000, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight with a potential 8000% ROI. With over $9.5 million raised, 11,400+ investors, and a current presale price of $0.03 ahead of a $0.06 launch, early buyers could multiply their money fast. Backed by a Certik audit, stablecoin launch, and strong DeFi utility, MUTM is one of the top cryptos to watch now. Don’t miss out—join the presale.

While crypto enthusiasts often focus on blockchain developments and digital asset news, macroeconomic factors, like the progress of a significant trade agreement , play a crucial role in shaping the overall economic outlook and influencing investor sentiment. A recent statement from the White House has brought this into sharp focus. White House Confidence in a Swift Trade Agreement According to a report from Jin10, White House National Economic Council (NEC) Director Kevin Hassett has expressed optimism regarding the timeline for reaching a significant trade agreement . Director Hassett indicated that he anticipates a deal could be finalized within the next one to two weeks. This projection, coming directly from a senior economic advisor within the White House , signals a potential breakthrough in ongoing negotiations and could have substantial implications for the global economy . For market participants, including those in the crypto realm, such pronouncements are carefully watched. They offer insights into potential shifts in global economic policy and stability, factors that indirectly but significantly affect the flow of capital and risk appetite across various asset classes. Understanding the Significance of a Global Trade Agreement Why does news about a trade agreement matter so much, especially for those interested in digital assets? Trade deals between major economic blocs or nations are not merely about tariffs and quotas; they are foundational pillars of the global economy . Here’s why they hold such weight: Economic Stability: Agreements reduce uncertainty for businesses involved in international trade, encouraging investment and long-term planning. Growth Potential: By opening markets and streamlining processes, trade deals can stimulate economic growth for participating nations. Supply Chain Resilience: Well-structured agreements can help diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on single points of failure. Currency Dynamics: Trade balances and capital flows influenced by agreements can impact currency valuations, which in turn affect international investment and asset prices. A positive resolution to trade discussions, as hinted by the White House , is generally perceived as a boost to the economic outlook , potentially leading to increased investor confidence and liquidity in global markets. Potential Market Impact: What Could Happen? The anticipation of a finalized trade agreement within a specific, short timeframe can trigger various reactions across financial markets. The market impact is multifaceted: Stock Markets: Typically, progress or resolution in trade disputes is viewed positively by stock markets, particularly for companies with significant international exposure. Reduced uncertainty can lead to rallies. Commodities: Prices of key commodities, especially those heavily traded between the involved parties, can react significantly. Agricultural products and industrial metals are often sensitive. Currencies: The currencies of the nations involved may strengthen if the agreement is seen as economically beneficial and stabilizing. Bond Yields: Increased optimism about the economy can sometimes lead to a rise in bond yields as investors shift towards riskier assets. For the crypto market, the connection is often indirect but noticeable. Positive macroeconomic news, like a beneficial trade agreement , can contribute to a broader ‘risk-on’ sentiment, where investors feel more comfortable allocating capital to assets perceived as higher risk, like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, unexpected hurdles or negative outcomes could fuel ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially leading to sell-offs in volatile assets. The overall economic outlook heavily influences this sentiment. Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to a Trade Agreement While the White House Director’s comments suggest optimism, the path to a final trade agreement is rarely without its challenges. Complex negotiations involve numerous details, potential sticking points, and domestic political considerations for all parties involved. Key challenges often include: Specific terms on tariffs and market access. Intellectual property rights and technology transfer. Enforcement mechanisms for the agreement. Addressing existing trade imbalances. Despite these potential hurdles, the opportunity presented by a successful agreement is substantial. A finalized deal could unlock new markets, reduce costs for consumers and businesses, and foster greater international cooperation, all of which contribute to a healthier global economy and potentially, a more robust environment for investment across all asset classes, influencing the overall market impact positively. Navigating the Economic Outlook: Actionable Insights Given the potential for a trade agreement within the coming weeks, what should market watchers, including crypto investors, consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official announcements from the White House and other negotiating parties. Details matter. Assess Broader Market Sentiment: Observe how traditional markets (stocks, bonds, commodities) react to trade news. This often provides clues about overall risk appetite. Understand Correlation: Recognize that while crypto has its unique drivers, it is not immune to macroeconomic forces and the prevailing economic outlook . Evaluate Your Portfolio: Consider how your investment strategy might be affected by potential shifts in the global economy and market impact from trade developments. The next one to two weeks could be pivotal, not just for international trade relations, but for understanding the potential shifts in the global financial landscape and their subsequent market impact . Conclusion The statement from the White House National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett, suggesting a trade agreement could be reached in 1-2 weeks, introduces a notable element of optimism into the current economic outlook . While the specifics of the potential deal remain under wraps, the prospect of resolving significant trade tensions carries the potential for positive market impact across the board, bolstering confidence in the global economy . For participants in the cryptocurrency market, understanding these broader macroeconomic signals is key to navigating the interconnected world of finance and making informed decisions.

An emotional Ross thanked the Bitcoin community for its continuous support. On 29 May 2015, a federal judge had sent Ross to serve a double-life sentence plus 40 years in prison without the possiblity of parole. Silk Road founder reflected on his time in prison saying, “there were days when I thought I would die in that awful cage,” but he fought to find joy even in the darkest time. Addressing the attendees, Ross said that the idea he risked his life and lost freedom for, grew into a movement. A movement so big that a decade later it came back around to free him, he added. “There is still more freedom to be won” Ross revealed that after he appeared at Bitcoin conference in 2021 through a phone call from prison, he was thrown into solitary confinement and put under heavy surveillance. But he said it was worth it and it made him feel like that for a moment he broke through the prison. “Today is the mirror image of that,” he noted. Talking about winning back his freedom, he said, “winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful.” Ross declared from the stage that we’re not there yet, there is still more freedom to be won and there’s still more work to be done. “Freedom is worth the struggle,” he added. Ross is catching up with latest technology Ross Ulbricht is still catching up with the technology after coming out of a “time capsule.” He noted: “I effectively went into a time capsule in 2013 and now I’m coming out like Rip Van Winkle. I mean, just a few months ago when I walked out of prison, I’d never seen a drone. I had never experienced VR or chatted with AI.” Talking about the developments in the crypto industry since he went to prison, Ross said, when he launched Silk Road there was just one exchange you could buy bitcoin on. “Now, it seems like every app I download has a built-in wallet with one-click buying options.” He added that There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right. “There’s DeFi and Web 3 and now there’s AI to help me navigate it all. It’s nuts.” In a heartfelt video montage that played before he took the stage, scenes of Ulbricht adjusting to life beyond prison filled the screen. He was seen walking on the beach, learning to surf, sharing quiet moments with his wife and enjoying the newfound freedom. “Freedom, decentralization and unity” Ross concluded his speech by reminding the bitcoin community about the three core principles that they should stick by to grow further – freedom, decentralization and unity. Recalling his time in prison, Ross said that guards and administration like when prisoners are divided, that way it’s easier to rule them. But when the prisoners were united, the administration listened, he added. “When we all went on hunger strike together, they showed up and listened.” Ross urged the crypto community to not see each other as enemies. “So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united, we can have each other’s backs, just like you had mine, freedom, decentralization, unity. Stay true to these principles and the future is ours.” The post Ross Ulbricht Gets Hero’s Welcome at Bitcoin 2025, Says ‘Fight for Freedom isn’t Over’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Ross Ulbricht,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-30 07:30:47

Morgan, has drawn attention to the banking giant’s historical recognition of Ripple as a potential disruptor in the field of global cross-border payments. The tweet, accompanied by two slides bearing J.P. Morgan’s branding and content, emphasizes Ripple’s capabilities in transforming traditional banking operations through blockchain-based processing. The material cited comes from a J.P. Morgan research document discussing banks’ involvement in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. It outlines key areas where blockchain is expected to have a transformative impact, including payments, clearing, settlement, and compliance processes such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). A specific focus is given to Ripple as an example of a blockchain solution with the potential to “disrupt cross-border payments processing across the industry globally.” Remember, JPM knows. “Ripple has the potential to disrupt cross border payments processing across the industry globally.” *just reading up on Mr. Morgan today and a few documents came to mind. pic.twitter.com/vFqaq467Sm — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 27, 2025 Ripple Positioned as a Notable Blockchain Use Case The first image from the shared documentation elaborates on the various transformational areas enabled by blockchain, with a visual reference listing cross-border payments, KYC/AML synergies, trade finance, and syndicated lending among others. Ripple is mentioned by name in the context of blockchain-based payment systems that aim to reduce the time needed for cross-border transfers from days to seconds, at lower costs. The analysis notes that although banks have traditionally shown limited involvement with direct cryptocurrency trading due to regulatory concerns, they continue to explore blockchain’s broader application in infrastructure and enterprise-level systems. Ripple is highlighted as a blockchain initiative capable of reshaping the processing of international payments by addressing legacy inefficiencies. Interoperability and Infrastructure Integration The second slide included in the tweet presents Ripple as a representative example of blockchain-based crypto-processing. It illustrates a network involving cloud-based ledger technology connecting financial institutions across different regions. The diagram emphasizes Ripple’s function in enabling the international movement of funds while utilizing existing financial infrastructure. The process illustrated involves a sender, a receiving financial institution, and a market maker that facilitates currency exchange and payment finality. According to the slide, the value proposition lies in secure, inexpensive, and fast fund transfers in any currency, positioning Ripple as an interoperability layer for the fragmented global financial ecosystem. It outlines the basic flow of payment and currency conversion managed through Ripple’s system, showcasing the model as an alternative to conventional banking structures.

Morgan’s Recognition of Emerging Fintech Models SMQKE’s tweet underscores the fact that major institutions such as J.P. Morgan have long been aware of the potential for blockchain projects such as Ripple to impact traditional finance. The referenced material reflects an assessment that blockchain platforms, especially those focused on payments, could lead to significant cost reductions and operational efficiencies for banks. J.P. Morgan’s document specifically mentions cost-saving projections derived from blockchain adoption, including reductions in reporting, onboarding, and business operation costs. Furthermore, it highlights that regulatory encouragement, particularly from central banks and financial oversight bodies, could accelerate this transition and further validate the integration of distributed ledger technologies. As crypto researcher SMQKE notes, this documentation provides a clear indication that Ripple’s role has not gone unnoticed within leading financial entities, and that it is considered among viable blockchain solutions capable of reshaping global financial processes.

Announced on Thursday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, the investment vehicle will offer uncapped BTC exposure with “downside protection” tied to gold. Per an official release , the fund is set to run for 5 years and aims to provide uncapped upside participation in Bitcoin. The fund will offer 1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold. Fund Would Address Investors’ Fears Over Bitcoin’s Sudden Price Drops At Cantor, we are focused on delivering innovative products that support clients seeking exposure to digital asset investments,” said Brandon G. Lutnick, Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald. He called it a “ground breaking investment vehicle” that helps investors tap into Bitcoin’s potential growth with downside protection based on the price of gold. Speaking at the conference, Lutnick addressed investors, noting that the fund Balances Bitcoin’s volatility with the precious metal’s stability. “There are still people on the earth that are scared of Bitcoin, and we want to bring them into this ecosystem,” he said. The fund will be available to investors in the coming weeks, the company added.

Following a string of corporate implosions in 2022, including Celsius and BlockFi, there has been a surge in crypto-backed lending. For instance, in March, Bitcoin software firm Blockstream Corp. secured a multi-billion dollar investment in its crypto lending funds. David Mercer, chief executive of the institutional trading platform LMAX Group, told Bloomberg that the new lenders will be “much more institutional in nature.” “More banks will enter the space and provide credit mechanisms to some of the largest institutions you can imagine to trade these assets.” The post Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management to Launch Gold-Hedged Bitcoin Fund appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Gold,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-30 07:39:52

Ethereum (ETH) This week, the broad market entered into a pullback, and Ethereum also closed with a 2% loss. This is nothing to be concerned about as long as ETH stays above $2,400, which is a key support. At the time of this post, the price was hovering around $2,650. While the momentum on higher timeframes remains bullish, the current price action shows a loss of strength for buyers, who were unable to push the asset to the key resistance at $2,800. Hopefully, this happens once the ongoing pullback is over. Looking ahead, the second-largest cryptocurrency can make new highs as soon as it breaks the resistance at $2,800. That will open the way for a price above $3,000 next. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) XRP appears to be returning towards $2 after closing the week with a 9% loss. This fall comes after the price failed to break the $2.6 resistance earlier this month. Since then, sellers have dominated the price action. On May 20th, the daily MACD also did a bearish cross, which hinted at this correction to come. At this time, the price is bouncing on the $2.2 level, but if buyers don’t return anytime soon, sellers are likely to take the asset to $2. Looking ahead, XRP is still stuck in the $2 to $2.6 range and is bouncing between these two key levels. Until a clear breakout happens, it is unlikely to see a major move from this cryptocurrency. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA did not manage to test the resistance at $0.9 since sellers came early to reverse the price action at $0.85. Since then, this cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend and closed the week with a 14% loss, the biggest on our list. Even if Cardano remains bearish, it has strong support at $0.7 and $0.64, where buyers returned in the past. Since the price is now testing the $0.7 support, a bounce here appears likely. Looking ahead, ADA failed to make a higher high in the past two months. This is concerning because it may be an early sign of weakness and a possible continuation of the downtrend that started back in December 2024. A loss of the $0.64 support would confirm this. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana was sharply rejected by the resistance at $186, and the price entered a pullback, which saw it lose 9% of its valuation this week. Sellers can continue to maintain the pressure, considering that the most important support is found at $152, and there is quite some distance left until there. The volume is also in decline since January, with no sign of a reversal. This supports a bearish bias despite the recent rally since April. Moreover, if SOL fails to break the resistance at $186 later on, then this could be interpreted as a lower high in a major downtrend. Looking ahead, Solana may stay bearish in the coming days. This can change if the support at $152 stops sellers and reverses the downtrend. This level is critical for where Solana will go next this year. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) HYPE appears to have topped at $40, at least for the time being. This comes after an impressive rally that saw the price increase by 330% since its bottom at $9.5 back in early April. However, sellers are dominating at this time, and they managed to push HYPE down by 8% this week. This corrective move was expected after such a rally and may last for quite a while before buyers will return. Key support levels are found at $30 and $27. For this reason, best to be patient and let this downtrend find a bottom before considering an entry. Looking ahead, HYPE remains a very strong contender in the altcoins space as one of the few tokens to make a new all-time high this year. As soon as this correction is over, buyers could return in force towards new highs.

This puts an end to one of its most high-profile enforcement actions in the crypto space. Joint Dismissal Motion “Huge win for crypto today. The SEC’s case against us is dismissed,” Binance revealed in a May 30 X post . The company also thanked SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and President Trump’s team “for pushing back against regulation by enforcement,” adding, “U.S. innovation is back on track – and it’s just the beginning.” The dismissal follows a joint motion filed on May 29 by the SEC, Binance, and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao. The petition, submitted to a federal court in Washington, D.C., requested that the agency’s original complaint be dropped. The regulator stated that dropping the case was appropriate “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter,” and clarified that the decision does not reflect its views on other cryptocurrency-related litigation. The lawsuit was also dissolved with prejudice, meaning it cannot be reopened. This ruling comes after the lawsuit was paused twice earlier this year, in February and April. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, created under Acting Chair Mark T. Uyeda, played a key role in the decision to move forward with the action. The financial watchdog first sued Binance, Zhao, and its U.S.-based arm in June 2023. The lawsuit accused them of violating securities laws by offering unregistered securities to U.S. investors, mishandling customer funds, and misleading investors. The agency also claimed the exchange had failed to put in place proper financial controls. It was the last major regulator still pursuing Binance after a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. government last year, in which Zhao pleaded guilty and stepped down as CEO. A Changed Approach The SEC has been reversing its approach to crypto regulation under President Donald Trump’s second administration. The development is the latest in a string of enforcement actions that the agency has since dropped. In earlier months, it abandoned or settled complaints against Coinbase, Ripple , and Kraken. Additionally, the agency closed its investigations into Robinhood Crypto, Uniswap Labs , and OpenSea. Paul Atkins has since taken over as SEC Chairman, bringing a pro-crypto stance and a commitment to create a framework for digital assets.

Burwick Law has requested the freeze of LIBRA assets in wallets linked to Hayden Davis. The law firm, one of the main drivers of class-action lawsuits for meme tokens, has requested the additional freezing of LIBRA tokens in wallets linked to the initial team and influencers. The New York Southern District Court has granted an order to limit the trading or transfers of assets from LIBRA team wallets. The main problem with LIBRA is that even defunct tokens can be active on-chain. LIBRA is entirely permissionless and even continues to trade with vestigial volumes on several exchanges. However, the volumes are not enough to absorb any of the holdings without tanking the price. LIBRA never recovered, but retail investors seek the proceeds from the initial team sale in the first hours after the launch. | Source: CoinGecko In the case of LIBRA, the token led to over $250M in user losses, and never recovered from its initial crash. Unlike other meme tokens, LIBRA has lost all confidence, and traders are not touching it even for an irrational pump. The low volumes mean even the team and initial investors are technically incapable of shedding their assets, unlike other more liquid memes. Additionally, the wallets of Kelsier Ventures have mostly divested their LIBRA, instead holding SOL and USDC, as well as other assets that cannot be frozen. The request arrives just a day after Circle froze $57M in USDC tokens, making them unmovable on-chain. Further requests have been sent to freeze any remaining USDC in the team and influencer wallets linked to early LIBRA traders. The requests by Burwick Law also targeted the same USDC wallets which also received a request from an Argentinian court. In that case, Circle was directly contacted and performed the freezing transaction. Circle can then re-issue the USDC, to be used in trader compensation. The Libra Team 1 wallet was one of the affected wallets with a freeze of 13.06M USDC. LIBRA has a total of 24,519 holders as of May 2025, though most of the tokens are still concentrated in team wallets. Burwick Law aims to block LIBRA by court order The request by Burwick Law does not involve any on-chain actions. Instead, the firm has obtained a court order against the usage of crypto held in the wallets of the LIBRA team and associates. In the case of Hurlock v. Kelsier Ventures et al, Burwick Law obtained a Temporary Restraining Order. For now, it remains uncertain how this order can be implemented on-chain, as the movement of Solana assets is still unrestrained. The restraining order affects any remaining LIBRA in the team’s wallets, as well as the identified $110M in proceeds, which Burwick Law links to other wallets belonging to Hayden Davis’s Kelsier Ventures. The court order to ban further transactions is one of the first attempts at recovery for the victims of the meme token. The high profile of LIBRA and its connections to Argentina’s President Javier Milei meant the asset was treated as more than just another meme. LIBRA launched during the peak craze for celebrity and official tokens, managing to bring in up to $250M in investments, before erasing over 90% of its value in minutes.

The conference, filled with optimism and new ideas, has set a hopeful tone. But now, with more than $11 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiring today, traders are worried that this will lead to massive volatility ahead. $9.8B Bitcoin Options Expiry Today According to data from Deribit , a leading crypto derivatives platform, around 92,459 Bitcoin contracts will expire today. These contracts are worth nearly $9.8 billion, a significant jump from last week’s figures. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $105,982, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The maximum pain price, the level where most options lose money, is $100,000. Although this is below the current price, analysts think Bitcoin won’t drop all the way to that level. Traders have set a put-to-call ratio of 0.89, showing more bets on price gains. $1.6 Billion Ethereum Options Expiry Ethereum is also seeing a big expiry day, with 623,949 contracts worth about $1.6 billion set to expire today, again according to Deribit data. Ethereum’s price is currently at $2,600, down about 4% in the past 24 hours. Its maximum pain price is $2,300, while the put-to-call ratio of 0.81 suggests that traders still believe prices could go higher. How the Crypto Market Could React Today This week’s Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry is much bigger, covering the whole month. Historically, big monthly expiries like this can lead to short-term volatility, as traders adjust their positions or hedge against sudden price swings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traders seem split, as some hope for a price rise, while others are cautious and ready to protect themselves. On the other hand Ethereum’s market looks balanced, with chances to grow but also some caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Some analysts suggest that ETH’s rally could target its Macro Range high area in the coming weeks. Ethereum Resembles 2024 Setup After struggling to break past the $2,600 mark, Ethereum has reclaimed this level as support. Over the past two days, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has held this key level while attempting to break above the $2,700 mark. Since recovering from its sub-$2,000 dip earlier this month, ETH hovered between $2,400 and $2,600, failing to reclaim the range’s upper zone despite its $2,738 multi-month high on May 10. Nonetheless, this week’s rally has seen the cryptocurrency rise above its local range and attempt to gain more strength to stop its sideways trajectory and continue its 50% recovery rally. Analyst Titan of Crypto noted that ETH just broke out of a two-week bullish flag, leading to today’s surge to the $2,788 level. He suggested that if the breakout is confirmed, the pattern’s target sits around the $3,800 level. Crypto Jelle pointed out that Ethereum is “still moving as planned, pushing deeper into the resistance area” around the $2,850 mark. Several analysts have named this level as the resistance before the $3,000 mark, and the wall “standing in the way of altseason.” Rekt Capital highlighted that Ethereum has been successfully retesting a crucial horizontal level since re-entering its $2,220-$3,900 Macro Range. Notably, Ethereum has been closing above the $2,468 mark for the past four weeks, setting up the stage for a “lift across the range.” With this successful retest, the King of Altcoins is “repeating early 2024 history.” Notably, ETH recorded a 50% four-week breakout after smashing the $2,486 resistance and retesting it as support. However, “the only difference is that it has just taken longer this time,” the analyst added. ETH Gains Momentum Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows considers that ETH is showing strength as its trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC) gains momentum and BTC dominance motion seemingly fades. The analyst also noted the ETH’s Weekly MACD bullish cross and reclaim of its multi-year support trendline. Based on this, he forecasted that Ethereum could soon soar to the $4,000 resistance. It’s worth noting that Ethereum is outperforming the flagship cryptocurrency this quarter for the first time since 2022, registering a 45% increase since April 1. Additionally, ETH continues to hold above its key level despite BTC’s dip below the $106,800 support.

Merlijn The Trader highlighted ETH’s price action after its golden cross, which appears to resemble its performance from the last time the setup occurred. According to the post, during the November 2024 setup, Ethereum saw a small dip before a “massive pump” on the eleventh day. “This time? Pump already started.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Arthur Hayes predicted that Ethereum could reach $5,000 this year. Hayes argued that Ethereum could potentially reach a new all-time high despite its recent underperformance compared to rival cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana (SOL). The celebrity said that ETH is currently the most hated layer-1 blockchain and that historically the most disliked assets tend to provide the best returns when market cycles turn. According to Hayes, this suggests that ETH could double and outperform. “I think ETH could go to $4,000 or $5,000 this year. “I think ETH is the most hated tier-1 asset right now. And usually at some point in the cycle you want to be in the most hated asset, so I think ETH could outperform.” Apart from Hayes, Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets at Standard Chartered, also stated that he has an bullish expectation for Etheruem and shared that he has a price target of $4,000 for 2025 and $7,500 for 2029. As a result, a jump to $4,000, which is seen as the common denominator and lower bound of Kendrick and Hayes’ price prediction range, would represent a jump of approximately 50% from ETH’s current price of $2,640. *This is not investment advice.

In 2023, that moment belonged to Official Trump. Those who entered early watched in disbelief as the token rocketed past $75, multiplying investments. Now, with many looking back and regretting their hesitation, a new meme coin is emerging with a similar, and potentially bigger trajectory: Punisher Coin ($PUN). With more than $30,000 secured in its first hour, a projected $0.045 listing price, and built-in staking plus referral incentives, Punisher Coin is quickly gaining traction as the next breakout meme coin for traders chasing high-upside opportunities. Punisher Coin Launches With a Mission, And $50K Raised Instantly Unlike its predecessors, Punisher Coin isn’t relying solely on meme power, it’s backed by a tactical roadmap. In just the first stage of its presale, it pulled in over $50,000 within stage 1. This kind of early support sends a clear message: the community is tuned in and ready to rally. That’s exactly what makes it one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy right now. The presale operates in tightly controlled phases. With a total token supply of 2 billion and a deflationary burn model, every unsold allocation is permanently removed from circulation. The price is set to climb in each phase, encouraging early entries while maintaining scarcity. These aren’t just coins to hold and hope. Punisher Coin’s presale is structured to build utility, not just hype, making it a smarter entry point for those who missed their shot with Official Trump. Official Trump: From Punchline to Power Player The early days of Official Trump were filled with skepticism. With its bombastic branding and unapologetic meme politics, few believed it would gain traction beyond a core community. Yet, as social media engagement exploded and speculative energy took hold, Official Trump began climbing. Initial supporters who held firm through the noise found themselves sitting on extraordinary gains. From sub-cent pricing to highs exceeding $0.075, the token proved that viral culture, when paired with aggressive marketing, could yield life-changing returns. But not everyone was lucky enough to catch it in time. And for those still hoping for the next big break, Punisher Coin is now under the spotlight. Punisher Energy: The War Tactic Turning Heads What separates Punisher Coin from the typical meme playbook is its Punisher Energy system, a daring mechanic that encourages holders of struggling meme tokens to abandon ship and join the Punisher movement. When converted, those users receive bonus $PUN tokens, while simultaneously draining liquidity from less effective tokens. It’s bold. It’s aggressive. And it’s working. Add to that a community engagement engine powered by real-money missions, where users earn $PUN or USDT for participation. Combine that with a referral system paying 5% in ETH and 10% bonus tokens to referred buyers, and the entire ecosystem begins to look more like a military campaign than a meme coin drop. This battle-ready strategy is a major reason why Punisher Coin is rapidly being seen as one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy before the next wave begins. Conclusion Not everyone bought Official Trump before it made headlines, and many still wish they had. But the next opportunity is already live. Punisher Coin is rewriting the meme coin narrative with its unique mission model, community-first perks, and lightning-fast presale growth. With $50K raised in hours and a system built for strategic expansion, the window to act is narrowing. For anyone serious about catching the next breakout, Punisher Coin is one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy, before its chart starts to look like another missed opportunity.

Having already taken a pro-crypto stance, Vance believes the U.S. stands to leap big if it moves with haste in this sector. He noted, “The People's Republic of China doesn't like Bitcoin. Well, we should be asking ourselves, why is that? Why is our biggest adversary such an opponent of bitcoin, and if the communist Republic of China is leaning away from Bitcoin, then maybe the United States ought to be leaning into Bitcoin.” Having risen to presidency on the crypto wave, Donald Trump has steadfastly aired his commitment to promote growth in the crypto industry by enhancing adopting and easing regulations. For instance, Senator Cynthia Lummis announced at the same conference that President Trump was in high gear to support the BITCOIN Act, which could see the U.S. government purchase one million Bitcoin. Bitcoin Being Part of the Mainstream Economy Already a crypto investor with Bitcoin worth between $250,000 and $500,000 , Vance believes that the apex cryptocurrency should be entrenched in the mainstream economy. While addressing the crowd at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, he acknowledged that crypto is here to stay and they should be seen as a hedge against bad governance and policy making. He added, “It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.” Vance also touched on the significance of the stablecoin market, highlighting that the Trump administration does not perceive it as a threat to the U.S. dollar, but sees it as an economic force multiplier. In this case, he urged Congress to roll their sleeves and okay the GENIUS Act , which could clear the air about stablecoins’ regulatory framework Why the U.S. Wants to Take the National Bitcoin Reserve Route Establishing a national Bitcoin reserve would not only safeguard U.S. financial sovereignty but also position the country at the forefront of the digital monetary era. First and foremost, Bitcoin is emerging as a globally recognized store of value. Much like gold, Bitcoin is scarce—capped at 21 million coins—making it resistant to inflationary pressures that plague fiat currencies. In a world where central banks are printing unprecedented amounts of money, holding Bitcoin can act as a hedge against devaluation of the U.S. dollar, especially in times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical tension. Second, Bitcoin can serve as a geopolitical tool. Nations like El Salvador and institutions around the world are already integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. If adversarial or competing countries were to accumulate substantial Bitcoin reserves first, they could gain significant leverage in global financial negotiations. A U.S. Bitcoin reserve would mitigate this risk and strengthen the country’s economic position in an increasingly multipolar financial system. Furthermore, Bitcoin promotes financial transparency and decentralization. Unlike traditional reserves such as gold or foreign currency, Bitcoin holdings can be publicly audited on the blockchain. This transparency could increase public trust in national monetary policy and help reduce inefficiencies and corruption. Economically, investing in Bitcoin has the potential for long-term capital appreciation. Early adoption could yield significant returns, helping to offset national debt or fund future technological innovation. It would also signal the U.S.’s commitment to supporting Web3 innovation and digital financial infrastructure, encouraging startups, attracting talent, and reinforcing the country’s leadership in technology. Finally, a national Bitcoin reserve would act as a strategic insurance policy against the decline of traditional fiat systems. As trust in legacy institutions erodes, the ability to pivot to decentralized monetary alternatives could become crucial for national resilience. In short, a national Bitcoin reserve is not merely a financial decision—it’s a strategic imperative. It ensures the U.S. remains adaptive, secure, and competitive in the digital age. Delay could mean ceding economic leadership to nations better prepared for a decentralized financial future.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 08:08:03

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $105,804 (-2%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $108,910.55 24-hour low $104,684.72 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $110,019 Price Prediction $119,922 (+8.01%) Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility (30-day variation) 5.04% Green Days 17/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $93,698 200-Day SMA $86,424 14-Day RSI 77.24 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a rejection around $109K and triggered a decline. Resistance for BTC is at $108,944 Support for BTC/USD is at $104,718 The BTC price analysis for 30 May confirms that BTC faces a surge in bearish volatility as the price rejected the $109K level. As a result, sellers pushed the price toward immediate support channels below $106K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price hovers below $106K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a surge toward $109K. However, sellers strongly defended further surges, resulting in a bearish correction below Fib channels toward $105K. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.3 billion, showing a rise in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $105,804, declining by over 2% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows bearish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades above the midline at 54, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buyers strongly defend $105K support The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the $105K level. However, buyers strongly defended the decline below $105K, holding the price around EMA20 trend line. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.42, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $108,944, it will fuel a bullish rally to $112,255. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $104,718, beginning a bearish trend to $102,183. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure after the price peaked at $109K. This triggered short-term holders to exit their positions, resulting in the recent decline. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063.

Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

Dark Defender has previously predicted a move to $18.22 , adding credence to his confidence in the asset’s potential. This projection aligns with the wave patterns previously outlined by the analyst. Hi there. #XRP is forming another Wave Structure in the weekly frame, creating the upcoming surge to $23. This new wave structure aligns with our previous targets and our historical pattern in November 2024.

The asset recently completed wave 1 and is consolidating in the second wave. The chart shows that the third wave, which is often the largest, could hit double-digits with a highlighted mid-level target zone between $5.85 and $6.39. The analyst points out that the 261.8% Fibonacci extension level corresponds closely with this zone, reinforcing its importance as a technical milestone. Historical Pattern Reappears The technical setup references a pattern that previously emerged in November 2024. Shortly after Donald Trump’s election victory and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement , XRP began a remarkable surge, climbing over 500% to a multi-year peak of $3.39. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts have consistently drawn parallels to the November breakout , as XRP appears to be mirroring crucial technical patterns from that period. Dark Defender’s chart highlights a long-term weekly resistance line, which XRP has remained below for weeks. His analysis suggests that a breakout above a similar resistance trendline contributed to this price surge, and the chart shows that wave three will break above the current trendline. Long-term XRP Targets Looking forward, Dark Defender expects the asset’s journey to culminate in a target range between $18.22 and $23.20, close to the 361.8% Fibonacci extension level. The Elliott Wave pattern shows a correction in wave 4, but the chart suggests that the asset will remain above $6.39 before resuming its bullish journey and reaching the ultimate target range. XRP is currently trading at $2.26, up 0.51% from yesterday. Analysts believe that the digital asset has spent enough time consolidating , and while Dark Defender did not provide a specific timeline for this price surge, the asset is very close to the resistance level, and the breakout to kickstart wave 3 could occur anytime from now.

45280119,https://coinpaper.com/9375/cme-data-shows-nearly-half-of-xrp-futures-volume-happens-offshore,1748593089,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,CME Data Shows Nearly Half of XRP Futures Volume Happens Offshore,https://coinpaper.com/9375/cme-data-shows-nearly-half-of-xrp-futures-volume-happens-offshore,"With almost half of CME’s XRP futures trading happening outside U.S. hours, the XRP Army continues to make its global footprint. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has unveiled that 46% of its regulated XRP futures volume was recorded after U.S. trading hours, highlighting the magnitude of global participation. XRP Community Cuts Across the Globe Per CME data, its XRP futures trading volume hit 4,032 contracts, with the transaction amount skyrocketing to $86.6 million in the first 6 days of inception, showcasing XRP’s international appeal. The CME’s standard and micro XRP futures contracts—sized at 50,000 XRP and 2,500 XRP, respectively—are cash-settled and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which tracks the cryptocurrency’s price daily at 4:00 p.m. London time. XRP futures trading is a form of derivatives trading that enables participants to speculate the predetermined price of XRP at a specific time without actually owning this altcoin. Traders usually enter into contracts where they predict whether the price of XRP will go down or up, and in the process, they are not required to sell or buy real XRP tokens. Therefore, the high demand for CME’s XRP futures trading, shows that the XRP Army is not only found on American soil, but also in the whole world. With the XRP community’s strength being felt on the global stage, its fierce activism and loyalty cannot be ignored. This is because it acts like a grassroots movement that pushes for XRP adoption, legal awareness, and financial literacy. As a forward-thinking crypto movement, the XRP Army offers a mix of power, purpose, and passion. For instance, Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s cryptic tweet about a ”10x times” increase late last year sparked speculation within the XRP community about the token's future price potential. XRP Futures Trading Sees Surge as Investor Interest Rises XRP futures trading has experienced a significant surge in recent weeks, signaling renewed investor confidence and growing market interest in the digital asset. With open interest jumping to $4.67 billion across major exchanges, XRP is proving to be more than just a utility token — it's becoming a speculative powerhouse. This spike in futures trading activity is driven by several key factors. Firstly, positive sentiment around Ripple’s ongoing legal clarity in the U.S. has played a major role. As the lawsuit with the SEC edges closer to resolution, traders are positioning themselves in anticipation of a favorable outcome. This optimism is reflected in increased leverage and open interest, particularly on platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX. Additionally, XRP's role in cross-border payments continues to fuel long-term demand. Institutions and retail investors alike are recognizing its utility in the financial ecosystem, which is strengthening bullish momentum. Technical traders are also responding to XRP’s recent price movements and volatility, which present prime opportunities for profit through derivatives. Analysts note that this uptick in futures trading is not merely speculative hype but a signal of XRP’s growing maturity as an asset class. The combination of real-world use cases, regulatory optimism, and heightened trading volumes has created a compelling environment for both short-term traders and long-term holders. As the broader crypto market eyes a potential bull run, XRP futures may serve as a leading indicator of investor sentiment. If current trends persist, XRP will continue to be among the top-four cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization, with this altcoin occasionally dethroning Tether (USDT) from the third position. In a landscape where volatility often equals opportunity, XRP futures are drawing both cautious and aggressive traders, each betting on the token’s next breakout moment. CME Continues to Set the Crypto Ball Rolling CME is playing a significant role in enhancing crypto adoption by providing a trusted and regulated platform for institutional investors to access cryptocurrency markets. By enabling institutional capital inflow and providing secure crypto investment tools, CME is bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional finance. For instance, following Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) approval, CME hit a record trading volume of $94.9 billion in January 2024, representing a remarkable 35% increase. Having kicked off XRP futures trading, CME is encouraging institutional investment through an expansive global outreach.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 08:18:09

Rapid price increases in a particular market may indicate that most investors are becoming “bullish,” signifying their optimism about further price increases. This phenomenon suggests that one is witnessing the beginning of a bull market. Investing in the best altcoins can yield significant rewards, as they offer opportunities for diversification and potentially higher returns. However, it is imperative to approach the altcoin landscape cautiously and conduct thorough research. Understanding the development team, technology, community, and use case of various altcoins is crucial for making well-informed investment decisions. Moreover, staying updated on market trends and regulatory changes is essential for effectively navigating the constantly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. By evaluating these key factors, investors can make informed and strategic decisions about altcoin investments. Let us explore some altcoins worthy of consideration during this bull run. COIN Market Capitalization Current Price Ethereum (ETH) $318.8 billion $2640 Ripple (XRP) $136 billion $2.31 Solana (SOL) $92 billion $176 BDTCOIN (BDTC) $4.9 Billion $137 SUI (SUI) $11.84 Billion $3.54 Which Altcoin To Buy in The Next Crypto Bull Run Ethereum (ETH) Market cap: $318.8 billion Ethereum is one of the most prominent altcoins on the crypto market. Of the nearly $3.45 trillion representing the total market capitalisation of the over 20,000 crypto assets, more than 13% is held in ETH. It is a distributed computing network where users can utilise the blockchain to run dApps and host smart contracts critics of Ethereum point to high transaction fees. However, ETH is here to stay, with thousands of apps and other altcoins powered by its blockchain. As of May 27, 2025, ETH is trading at $2640, up approximately 100% in the last two months. Ripple (XRP) Market cap: $132.14 billion Developed by Ripple Labs in 2012, Ripple (XRP) stands out as a decentralized payment network designed for quick, cost-effective financial transactions. With an open-source protocol, Ripple eliminates reliance on intermediaries, enabling P2P transactions in seconds. The XRP ledger validates transactions through a consensus protocol, offering efficiency without relying on traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms. As of May 27, 2025, it is trading at $2.31 and has increased by 43% over the last two months. Solana (SOL) Market cap: $107.41 billion Solana gained popularity among crypto investors due to its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees. It is a blockchain platform that focuses on overcoming the speed and scalability challenges faced by many existing blockchains. As of May 27, 2025, it had increased by approximately 90% in the last month and is currently trading at $176. The surge in SOL brought the digital asset to its highest point in two years, reaching levels last observed in April 2022, three months after the conclusion of the bull cycle in 2021. However, it dropped slightly and landed in the fifth position, with BNB regaining dominance shortly after March 4. BDTCOIN (BDTC) Market Cap: $4.9 Billion BDTCOIN is one of the most outperformed altcoins in the Crypto Market. BDTCOIN is a gold-backed, real Cryptocurrency. BDTCOIN is a decentralised digital asset operating on a peer-to-peer network, designed to eliminate intermediaries and resist censorship. Its transactions are recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger, ensuring transparency and security. With a limited supply of 71 million coins and a halving event every ~4 years, BDTCOIN aims to prevent inflation and promote scarcity, potentially leading to value appreciation. It utilises advanced cryptographic algorithms, such as SHA-256 and ECDSA, for secure transactions and relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) for network validation. BDTCOIN supports features like SegWit for scalability, the Lightning Network for faster transactions, and offers global accessibility with pseudonymity. It is also divisible into 100 million “jus” for micro-payments and incorporates smart contract functionality for secure agreements. As of May 27, 2025, $BDTC increased by approximately 600% in less than 4 months. BDTC started trading on CEX in February 2025. $BDTC is available to trade on major CEX like Lbank, MEXC, AscenDEX. More exchanges listing is on the way. SUI (SUI) Market Cap: $11.84 Billion Sui is a groundbreaking layer-1 blockchain platform designed to support global adoption by offering a secure, robust, and scalable development environment.

Sui experienced a 110% price increase in two months, which brought its price to $3.54. Factors Contributing to Altcoin Growth Market Demand : Altcoins thrive on market demand. Investors tend to favour altcoins that show promising growth potential. Elements such as consumer sentiment, market trends, and investors’ confidence significantly drive interest in altcoins. Regulatory Policy : Regulatory policies can play a pivotal role in shaping the growth of altcoins. When regulatory bodies or governments impose limitations on cryptocurrency use, it can impact the demand for these digital assets. Technology : The core technology behind an altcoin plays a crucial role in its development and success. Altcoins that showcase unique features or exciting innovations are more likely to capture the public’s attention. Competition : The cryptocurrency market is highly competitive, which can significantly impact the growth of alternative cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. Those offering similar features may struggle to carve out a niche for themselves. Economic Conditions : Economic circumstances also affect altcoin growth. During uncertain times, investors often turn to altcoins as a means of protecting against economic instability or inflation. Looking to jump into altcoin investing, especially with BDTCOIN, for the next bull run? Awesome! It’s a thrilling space, but let’s ensure you’ve a well-thought-out plan. Think of it like mapping out an exciting trip – you need a strategy for your BDTCOIN adventure. Keep Your Cool (No Panic!) The crypto market, especially for altcoins like BDTCOIN, is a wild ride. Don’t let FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) push you to buy high, and don’t panic-sell if BDTCOIN dips. Stick to your plan! Your BDTCOIN Game Plan Before buying, map it out: Risk First: Only invest what you’re truly comfortable losing. Decide how much of that “fun money” specifically goes to BDTCOIN . Use stop-loss orders as your emergency brake if prices drop. Smart Entry: Don’t go all-in at once. Use Rupee-Cost Averaging (RCA) – buy smaller amounts of BDTCOIN over time, especially on dips, to smooth out your entry price. Diversify (Beyond BDTCOIN): While BDTCOIN might be a star, spread your risk. Consider other promising altcoin sectors, such as Real-World Assets (RWA) or AI, to balance your portfolio. Know When to Take Profits It’s tempting to hold forever, but greed can hurt! Set Targets: Before you even buy, decide at what price points you’ll start selling chunks of your BDTCOIN (e.g., 25% at X price, another 25% at Y price). Scale Out: Sell your BDTCOIN in pieces as its price climbs. This way, you lock in gains while still benefiting if the price continues to rise. Balance Your Risk BDTCOIN offers big rewards but can be volatile. Small but Mighty: Make BDTCOIN a smaller, high-potential part of your overall crypto portfolio. Blue-Chip Backup: Establish a solid foundation with “blue-chip” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum for stability. Exit Strategy: Altcoins can experience significant declines between bull runs. Have a clear exit strategy and target prices for BDTCOIN before you invest. Don’t plan to hold it forever without serious research. Research, Research, Research! Don’t buy BDTCOIN just because of hype. Do your homework! Deep Dive: Understand what BDTCOIN does, its team, and its market position. Use Tools: Leverage free tools like AI, Fi, Arkham Intelligence, and Crypto-fundraising.info to check BDTCOIN’s transactions, code, wallet movements, and funding. Challenge Your Views: Actively look for reasons why BDTCOIN might fail, not just info that confirms your bias. Utilise the tools mentioned above to conduct thorough research on a project’s fundamentals, market position, and team. You may also achieve this by performing a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Regularly question your thesis and seek reasons for a project’s failure instead of merely searching for information that confirms your bias.

According to data from CNBC, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 31 points in early morning trading, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.16%, and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.21%. This came after a wave of uncertainty on Thursday when a federal court first blocked and then reinstated the majority of the president’s tariffs, triggering confusion across global trade desks. The legal drama unfolded late Wednesday night when the Court of International Trade decided to freeze most of the current tariffs imposed by the administration. But by Thursday afternoon, that same court reversed course, putting a temporary hold on its own order. Stocks recoil as legal chaos deepens This constant policy flip-flop is throwing both markets and global trade partners into a loop. The S&P 500, which was up nearly 0.9% during early Thursday trading, turned south fast after the Trump administration hinted at a possible appeal. The issue isn’t just whether the tariffs are good or bad, it’s that nobody knows when they’re real. That’s paralyzing for companies trying to plan shipments and for countries negotiating trade deals. Even with the turbulence, stocks have had a solid May. The S&P 500 is still up more than 6% this month, the Nasdaq Composite has jumped 10%, and the Dow has added about 4%. For this week alone, the S&P has risen 2%, the Dow gained 1.4%, and the Nasdaq is up 2.3%. Traders are also watching closely for inflation data. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index for April is expected to show annual inflation at 2.2%, with a monthly increase of 0.1%. The core PCE, which cuts out food and energy, is projected to come in at 2.6% for the year, also rising 0.1% month over month. Crypto drops as investors brace for inflation Crypto markets weren’t spared either. Bitcoin dropped 2.8% and now trades at $105,430. Ether fell 4% to $2,617, XRP dropped 4.4% to $2.19, and Solana (SOL) tumbled 6%, now sitting at $162. The declines come as traders try to make sense of global economic signals that are increasingly impossible to predict. Source: TradingView But interestingly enough, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is currently at 60, which is strongly Greed. Retail investors aren’t feeling good about any of it. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) said bearish sentiment jumped to 41.9% this week, up from 36.7% last week. That’s higher than the long-term average of 31%, and this marks the 26th time in 28 weeks that pessimism has outpaced the norm. On the flip side, bullish sentiment dropped to 32.9%, down from 37.7%, and sits below the historical average of 37.5% for the 16th time in 17 weeks. In a special question, 64% of respondents said that the tariffs, along with the economy and inflation, are the top reasons they expect markets to drop in the next six months. Only 11% pointed to corporate earnings, 10% to valuations, and 9% to monetary policy or interest rates.

This would suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to make its next upside move. Nevertheless, a major hurdle is on the horizon in the form of the weekly Stochastic RSI, posturing a swing back down in the indicators that can potentially bring some future heavy downside price momentum. Caution is required. Keeping it simple in trading In the field of technical analysis there are countless charts and indicators that can point a price in one direction or another, and often, at any particular point in time. Therefore, one strategy that tends to iron out the often perverse market fluctuations over time is that of keeping things very simple. There are a small number of indicators for Bitcoin, that if used over the longer time frames, will generally help to show the main trend that $BTC is following, and give pointers as to when we need to sit up and take notice that a trend break is about to occur. The Stochastic RSI is one of the most reliable indicators in this respect. It is used to measure momentum and identify overbought or oversold conditions. On the higher, weekly time frame, the Stochastic RSI is exhibiting an overbought condition - thus the cause for concern. Before looking at the bigger picture, the shorter time frames are currently looking bullish. They are suggesting that there could be a nice upside surge that could develop into the weekend. Correction from all-time high still taking place Source: TradingView In the 4-hour time frame it can be seen that the correction from last week’s all-time high is still taking place. The bears were able to force the price below the important $106,000 support, and $BTC is now at the $105,000 support level. There is the possibility that the price could drop through here, but it isn’t expected. If it does, the furthest dip to the downside would likely be to the $102,500 horizontal support. What is more likely is that the price will start to bounce from here, and could then gain momentum from all the short time frame Stochastic RSI indicators crossing up from the bottom. The targets would be to break back above $106,000, pierce up through the descending trendline, make a higher high, and then have the possibility of getting back to the all-time high. 3-day chart shows concerns are beginning Source: TradingView The 3-day chart shows that concerns are beginning. The ascending trendline is in the process of being broken, and should the current red candle still be on the wrong side of this trendline by the end of Friday, the breakdown will be confirmed. Having said that, the horizontal supports are very important, and a close above $106,000 would be seen as a victory for the bulls. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame is looking ominous, with the indicator lines shaping to fall back down through the 80.00 level, and by doing so, bringing downside price momentum with them. Weekly Stochastic RSI signals a potential cross-down Source: TradingView As already mentioned, the weekly time frame is potentially the most problematic at this point in time. While it can be seen that the price is starting to roll over, it’s at the bottom of the chart where things are starting to become a little worrying. The Stochastic RSI has the blue indicator clearly angled down, and it is posturing to cross over the red indicator line. However, it’s not all doom and gloom quite yet. If the expected rally does take place into the last part of this week, the indicator lines could just end up flatlining along the top, much as they did in a 3-week period at the end of 2024. That said, they will have to come down at some point, putting an end to the upside price momentum. Is there still time in this bull market cycle for the indicator lines to drop all the way back to the bottom and then come back up for one last hurrah into Q4? Yes there is. Also, the indicator lines could bounce along the top for an extended period of time. The main take away here is that when the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators are at the top it signals caution to long-term traders, whereas when they are at the bottom, buys are signalled.

He shared a post on X outlining the current status of XRP ETF applications awaiting final decisions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The image he shared lists prominent asset managers, their filing dates, SEC decision deadlines, and key notes on each application. This provides a comprehensive overview of the competitive field for XRP-based investment products. $XRP ETFS Waiting SEC Final Decision Bitwise ETP is live, and it holds 109,812,107 XRP in Cold Storage Ill let you do the math when we have 18+ Spot ETFS Live pic.twitter.com/ATXKVPEzO7 — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) May 28, 2025 The Current State of XRP Spot ETFs Several major asset managers, including Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, CoinShares, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton, have submitted filings for spot XRP ETFs. Most filings were acknowledged by the SEC in February 2025, with final decision deadlines set for October 2025. The exchanges involved include Cboe, Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX, reflecting broad institutional interest in launching XRP-based products. Bitwise stands out as the first to file for a spot XRP ETF, having been acknowledged by the SEC in February. Van Winkle also drew attention to Bitwise’s ETP, which is already live, and holds over 109 million XRP in cold storage. Referencing this figure, Van Winkle invited his followers to consider the potential impact once over 18 spot XRP ETFs are live. XRP is an attractive asset to institutions , and the launch of all these products could bring a significant increase in institutional holdings and market activities, potentially sending the asset’s price up. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Demand and Market Outlook The list of applicants and the scale of assets involved indicate growing institutional demand for regulated XRP investment vehicles. The presence of established firms such as Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, alongside newer entrants, points to a competitive race to capture early market share. Several applications also propose innovative structures, such as including XRP among multiple digital assets within broader ETF offerings. 21Shares filed to list its Core XRP Trust shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange in November, and Grayscale followed suit in January, applying to convert its XRP Trust into a spot ETF . Grayscale’s filing has the closest deadline at October 18, and Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and CoinShares have the farthest, at October 25. However, many market participants are convinced that the SEC will approve these products earlier. One commenter argued that the commission has no excuse for delaying approval, and Polymarket recently raised the likelihood of XRP ETF approval to 85% , reflecting the confidence of the community. As the deadlines approach, all eyes are on the SEC to see if XRP will finally join the ETF ranks in the U.S. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

BTC's losses followed a $358 million net outflow from the 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Thursday, their first since May 13 and highest single-day tally since March 11, according to data source SoSoValue . Renewed trade war fears also weighed over the sentiment. Other majors, such as ETH, SOL, and DOGE, posted larger losses, with smaller tokens like OP, ARB, BONK, and PEPE falling by over 10% each, according to data source Coingecko. Focus on U.S. core PCE Consumer prices, represented by the personal consumption expenditure index, rose 0.15% on a monthly basis in April, bringing the annual inflation rate down to 2.2% from 2.3% in March, according to economists surveyed by FactSet. The core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.12% on a monthly basis and 2.5% on an annual basis. Another good month for inflation could raise Fed rate cut bets, boding well for BTC and other assets.

The report states that the average holder of these ETFs is currently sitting on a 21% paper loss, reflecting the gap between Ether’s current trading value and the purchase price of the funds. Ether, which is trading at $2,601, is well below the cost basis for both ETFs — with BlackRock’s average at $3,300 and Fidelity’s even higher at $3,500. The asset’s decline over recent months has significantly impacted investor sentiment and ETF performance. Tariffs Triggered the Downturn The last time Ether traded above $3,000 was in early February. The downtrend began shortly after then-President Donald Trump issued executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico. The crypto market reacted sharply, and Ether’s price plummeted to a yearly low of $1,472 on April 9 — the same day those tariffs took effect. Glassnode highlighted that ETF outflows accelerated when the spot price of Ether dipped below the average cost basis in August 2024, and again in January and March 2025. This reflected growing investor concerns and a broader crypto market correction. Signs of Recovery and Renewed Interest Despite these losses, Ether has rebounded by over 44% in the past month. From May 16 onward, spot Ether ETFs have recorded nine consecutive days of inflows totaling $435.6 million. The inflows are partly attributed to easing concerns around Trump’s tariff policies, especially after a US federal court blocked most of them on May 28. Market watchers believe this court ruling could fuel a broader crypto recovery, with Ether potentially leading the charge. Spot ETFs recorded their last net outflow on May 15, marking a shift in investor behavior. Mixed Reception Since Launch Since their launch in July 2024, US-based spot Ether ETFs have accumulated $2.94 billion in inflows. Ether was trading at roughly $3,536 at the time, making current prices a major drawdown for early participants. Glassnode noted that ETF volume was modest at first, making up just 1.5% of spot market trades. Although that share rose to 2.5% during November 2024 — coinciding with Trump’s re-election and a market-wide rally that pushed Ether to $4,007 — the figure has since fallen back to earlier levels. Lack of Staking a Key Limitation Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in March, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, acknowledged one weakness in their offering. He said the spot Ether ETF is “less perfect” without the inclusion of staking, a feature many crypto investors now consider standard. The sentiment underscores the challenges facing Ether ETFs, even as the broader market shows signs of stabilization. Investors remain hopeful that recent momentum can be sustained, but for now, many remain underwater.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-30 09:13:10

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s risk signal is trending downwards, an indication that the market risk is falling. According to the widely followed analyst, there’s an increase in liquidity from buyers, a fact which could push up the price of the crypto king. “We are setting up for another solid run on the long time frame.” Source: Willy Woo/X Woo, however, says that the strength of Bitcoin’s recent bullish run from the price of $75,000 reached around April 6th to the price of $112,000 recorded on May 22nd is beginning to weaken. Over the short term, the widely followed analyst says , “This week is absolutely critical, if we do not get follow through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” Woo further says , “In the short term, my main concern are the late-comer speculators taking long positions while an immense amount of potential profit-taking is ready to dump (SOPR). This week’s spot buying will strongly influence the next 1-2 months of price action. We are in a pivot zone.” The SOPR, an acronym for the Spent Output Profit Ratio, is an on-chain metric used to determine market sentiment by revealing whether the Bitcoin that is moving is being sold at a loss or profit.

This liquidation was triggered by bitcoin’s dip below $105,000 early Friday. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Wynn has been liquidated on four positions so far, totaling 1,134 BTC (over $118.8 million). He still has an open position with 40x leverage on the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid, which is sitting on an unrealized loss of $4.7 million at the time of writing. $1B Bitcoin Bet Backfires CryptoPotato reported last week that Wynn built his 40x leverage long Bitcoin position from $390 million to $1.1 billion within seven days. Well-known as a high-risk leverage trader and meme coin maxi, the whale continued to increase his bets as bitcoin’s price kept rising. As BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) of $111,970 on May 22, the bet increased to $1.14 billion with an unrealized profit of over $39 million. By May 24, Wynn had pumped the bet to $1.25 billion, even as BTC had slipped from its ATH and was consolidating around $108,000 to $109,000. Although analysts’ predictions and on-chain data suggested that BTC had more room for growth in the short term, macroeconomic changes triggered a reversal in the asset’s trajectory. Buying and Holding is Better: Wynn While Wynn took profits from his big BTC bet, he believed the asset could hit the $115,000 to $118,000 target this week. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Bitcoin is down 2.5% in the past 24 hours and was trading around $105,093 at writing time. Due to bitcoin’s decline over the last few hours, Wynn has been liquidated in four positions holding 91 BTC ($9.7 million), 527 BTC ($55.3 million), 421 BTC ($43.9 million), and 95 BTC ($10 million). Data from the Hyperliquid analytics platform, Hypurrscan, shows that the liquidations were triggered when BTC hit $106,330, $104,950, $104,150, and $104,620, respectively. Addressing his liquidation on X, Wynn tweeted that his bets have exposed the corruption in the crypto market. He insisted it is better to buy and hold BTC in cold storage rather than follow his investment strategy. One thing for sure is that I have exposed just how corrupt these markets are. Guess it’s better to just buy and hold $BTC on spot / cold storage it. — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 30, 2025 The post Crypto Whale Wynn Who Bet $1B on BTC Gets Liquidated for $118M Amid Price Dip appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Whales,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ARKM,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-30 09:15:41

At the same time, oil prices edged lower for the second consecutive week as traders braced for another OPEC+ output hike. The price of Gold Aug 25 (GC=F) dropped up to 0.8% during morning trade and headed for a weekly fall of nearly 2%. Investors are waiting for the US personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed’s primary inflation metric, due later in the day Gold Aug 25 price. Source: Yahoo Finance Kelvin Wong, senior analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte, said that the current sell-off was due to technical factors ahead of the metrics release. “The price action in gold has twice failed to break above the key near-term resistance level of $3,328 — both in the U.S. session yesterday and again early in the Asian session today,” he noted. Gold is still considered a safe haven amid market uncertainties Markets have been unsettled once again after a federal appeals court on Thursday granted Trump a temporary reprieve from a decision that had threatened to remove much of his planned tariffs. Tensions with China have also resurfaced. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described talks with Beijing as “a bit stalled.” Earlier in the week, the White House said it would start cancelling some Chinese student visas and curb sales of chip-design software to Chinese firms, prompting a swift protest from Beijing. Such uncertainty in the market is likely to keep some interest in the bullion. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also said that gold would remain a part of the firm’s long-term portfolios as a defense against rising prices, alongside crude oil. By 1:40 p.m. in Singapore, spot gold had trimmed losses but was still down 0.5% at $3,300 an ounce. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index inched higher after swinging the previous day. Other precious metals, including silver (SI=F), palladium (PA=F), and platinum (PL=F), all slipped lower. Crude oil prices decline for the second consecutive week Brent crude futures declined 21 cents (0.33%) to $63.94 a barrel by 06:26 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 22 cents (0.36%) to $60.72. Both contracts have dropped about 1.3% since Monday, and the Brent July futures contract is due to expire on Friday. Much of the pressure came from expectations that OPEC+ and its partners would approve another output hike on Saturday during a meeting. Analysts at JPMorgan said the global surplus has increased to roughly 2.2 million barrels per day, a gap that may force prices lower, in order to restore balance. The analysts predict crude will trade near current levels before easing into the high $50s by the end of the year. Supply worries were compounded after Trump’s broad tariffs were reinstated on Thursday, overturning a lower-court order issued a day earlier. Crude, which is often considered a safe haven alongside gold, has now fallen more than 10% since Trump rolled out his “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2. At the same time, tensions deepened further after Washington told a wide range of companies to halt shipments of goods such as ethane and butane to China without a license, and revoked existing permits for some suppliers. Even so, JPMorgan noted that global demand ticked up last week thanks to strong U.S. travel over the Memorial Day holiday. The bank estimates monthly demand growth at about 400,000 barrels per day as of May 28, roughly 250,000 barrels below earlier projections.

This article evaluates the monthly forecast using multi-timeframe analysis, combining short-term indicators with the weekly macro structure. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The Bitcoin price today is around $105,800, retreating slightly from recent highs near $112,000.

While this decline has made the markets nervous about the risk of further declines, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the news of Singapore-based crypto options data platform Greeks.live, 93 thousand Bitcoin (BTC) and 624 thousand Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on May 30 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.89, the maximum loss point is $ 100,000 and the notional value is $ 9.79 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.81, a maximum loss point of $2,300, and a notional value of $1.62 billion.

Analysts stated that Bitcoin has been following a volatile course this week, and that Ethereum is stronger compared to BTC. While the Pull/Call ratios show that the market is slightly optimistic in anticipation of a price increase, the Maximum Loss levels ($100,000 for BTC, $2,300 for ETH) carry the risk that prices could be pulled back to these levels. Analysts stated that price fluctuations may occur in BTC and ETH based on these rates. “Bitcoin has been mostly volatile this week, Ether has been relatively strong and the accumulation has been ongoing for two weeks. Data suggests that the market is still optimistic about BTC reaching new highs in the near future. ETH’s upward shock has started to slow down and the market has recalibrated ETH’s price and volatility. “Deliveries are less than 8% of total positions, a decline, and crypto institutions are not showing much reaction to new highs in Ethereum. This suggests low expectations for a near-term rally in ETH and more expectations for a steady, moderate increase.” May 30 Options Data 93,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.89, a Maxpain point of $100,000 and a notional value of $9.79 billion. 624,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.81, a Maxpain point of $2,300 and a notional value of $1.62 billion.

With recent upgrades like Hydra scaling and a renewed push in the DeFi market, Cardano (ADA) is positioning itself for a potential move back toward the $1 threshold, a key psychological and technical level. While ADA’s growth curve leans steady and sustainable, attention is shifting toward high-upside newcomers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly gaining traction as a new cryptocurrency with aggressive ROI potential in 2025. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.5 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,400 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. Cardano Eyes Recovery as $1 Becomes Key Milestone in 2025 Outlook Cardano (ADA), currently priced at $0.76, is gradually rebuilding market confidence as it grinds its way back to the critical $1 point, which was once its breakout level. The blockchain’s development , like Hydra’s scalability enhancement and increased developer activity, is an indication of commitment to long-term use and adoption. Despite a volatile background and questions about why crypto is down from time to time, ADA still retains its appeal as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today, especially for investors focusing on real-world use cases and network maturity. As the market turns its focus towards recovery and reaccumulation, ADA’s steady trajectory is in sharp contrast with the explosive growth potential of newer tokens like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. That more than 11,400 investors have invested $9.5 million in the presale is a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $1 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards. Ten lucky users will be given $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each for completing a series of simple steps. Cardano’s journey to $1 reflects steady fundamentals and long-term potential, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the breakout star for 2025. With over $9.5 million raised and 11,400+ investors already on board, MUTM offers up to 100% ROI at launch—and far greater upside post-launch. Its hybrid lending model, Certik-audited smart contracts, and upcoming stablecoin make it a top crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss your chance—join the presale before the next price hike.

The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular indicator that, in short, tells us about how the value held by the investors as a whole compares against their initial investment. Related Reading: Toncoin Open Interest Spikes 33%—Will History Repeat With A Pullback? When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders are carrying more than they put in. In other words, they are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under the threshold suggests the overall network is underwater. The analytics firm has used the MVRV Ratio to define pricing bands that correspond to extreme deviations from the average investor profitability (that is, the mean value of the MVRV Ratio). These bands help point out periods where investor profits/losses are unusually high. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode in the report that shows the trend in these pricing bands for Bitcoin over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin price has been trading above the mean level of this model since a while now. Recently, the asset has also broken above the +0.5 standard deviations (SD) line. This line corresponds to the price at which the MVRV Ratio attains a value that’s 0.5 standard deviations above the all-time mean. At present, the level is situated around $100,200. The level that BTC is yet to surpass in this latest rally is the +1 SD one, located at $119,400. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency breaking above this line has generally led to a top for its price. The explanation behind this pattern lies in the fact that the larger investor profits grow, the more tempted holders become to take them. At extreme deviations of the MVRV Ratio, selling pressure from holders giving in to this temptation becomes significant, hence why the asset approaches a long-term top. In the current cycle, Bitcoin has breached the +1 SD level of the model on two occasions, ending up with the formations of the March 2024 and December 2024 peaks. For now, the current rally is still below this level, but above the +0.5 SD that also corresponds to a significant level of gains.

After years of uncertainty, the government is preparing to release a discussion paper on crypto regulation in June. For a country that’s gone from heavy taxes to long periods of silence, this could be a defining moment. With the global market heating up and Bitcoin recently touching a new all-time high above $111,900, India’s timing is interesting. What’s in the paper? Will it invite public opinion? Could this be the start of a more structured approach to crypto in India? Let’s unpack what we know so far. Supreme Court Steps In: Silence is No Longer an Option The pressure isn’t just coming from the markets. India’s Supreme Court has strongly called out the government’s delay in addressing crypto regulation. It warned that the ongoing legal vacuum is creating space for misuse and made it clear that banning crypto isn’t the solution. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh questioned why, while other global economies are moving ahead with their own regulatory frameworks, India is yet to make a clear decision. This paper appears to be a direct response. According to reports, the government’s upcoming proposal will draw heavily from the IMF and Financial Stability Board’s recent synthesis report. There are also signs that it might open the floor for public input, giving stakeholders a chance to contribute to the process. India’s Journey So Far: Tax First, Clarity Later India’s crypto story has had its share of growing pains. The 2023 budget introduced a 30% tax on crypto profits, which pushed many users and exchanges to rethink their presence in the country. While firms were required to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit, the sector still lacks formal recognition. The Reserve Bank of India has remained cautious, often highlighting risks like money laundering and terror financing. At the same time, it has continued to promote its central bank digital currency as a safer alternative to private crypto assets. According to a recent report by think tank Esya Centre , nearly 90% of Indian crypto trading has moved offshore, largely in response to existing policies. Industry voices have warned that the current setup limits innovation and drives users toward unregulated platforms. Global Momentum Is Building – Can India Keep Pace? While India works through its roadmap, global powers are setting the tone. In the US, President Donald Trump has shifted the country’s stance with a bold pro-crypto approach. His administration has pardoned several digital asset leaders, backed a strategic bitcoin reserve, and seen the Senate pass stablecoin-focused legislation. Meanwhile, the European Union is already rolling out its MiCA regulation, setting clear rules for digital asset firms operating across its member states. A Defining Moment for India One senior Indian official noted that the country would approach crypto decisions with the national interest in mind, and avoid “knee-jerk” reactions. That could be key, especially in a market known for sudden shifts and global ripple effects. The industry will be watching closely and this time, expecting action.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 09:31:07

Legal expert and crypto commentator Bill Morgan, sharing the development via X, expressed his astonishment at the nature of the filing, noting that while he was anticipating a procedural move related to the pending status report before the U.S. Court of Appeals, what emerged was an unexpected multi-page submission from someone not even party to the lawsuit. I was expecting some filing in the SEC v Ripple case given what happened to the last motion that was dismissed two weeks ago, especially given that the 60 day period which the parties have before the SEC is required to file a status report with the court of appeals expires on 16… pic.twitter.com/I250sVGKLx — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 29, 2025 The Expected vs. the Unexpected The Ripple vs. SEC case has built anticipation among its close followers in the community. After all, following the recent dismissal of the SEC’s motion two weeks ago, attention had naturally shifted toward the 60-day window set to expire on June 16, 2025. This window relates to the timeline within which both parties must finalize their positions before the SEC is required to submit a formal status report to the appellate court. Given the high stakes and unresolved issues, including remedies, penalties, and regulatory implications for the crypto market, analysts like Bill Morgan were closely monitoring strategic filings and updates that could impact the litigation’s next phase. What nobody expected, however, was a filing from an outsider: Justin W. Keener, an individual not associated with Ripple, the SEC, or any of the involved legal teams, who submitted an “Emergency Request” to the court. The Nature of Keener’s Filing The filing, formally titled “Emergency Request – Presentation of Decisive Evidence in Favor of the Defendants and Favor of Liberty for the American People”, is a sprawling, multi-page document in which Keener claims to possess data and insights that he believes are crucial to settling the controlling questions at the heart of the Ripple case. According to his assertions, these materials cover issues tied to the application and interpretation of the Howey Test — the foundational legal framework used to determine what qualifies as an “investment contract” under U.S. securities law. Keener’s submission reportedly spans arguments over 90 years of securities law evolution, aiming not only to challenge the SEC’s approach to the Howey Test but also to frame the broader regulatory battle as one with profound implications for the liberty and economic well-being of the American public. Despite Keener’s stance as a champion of market freedom, legal experts remain skeptical about the influence of amicus briefs like his in federal court. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Courtroom Saga That Never Ends The Ripple vs. SEC case has become a defining legal saga in the crypto world, attracting the attention of investors, regulators, and legal scholars worldwide. Since the SEC’s original complaint in December 2020, which alleged that Ripple’s sales of XRP constituted unregistered securities offerings, the case has seen a series of dramatic turns. In July 2023, Judge Torres delivered a pivotal ruling distinguishing between institutional sales (which violated securities laws) and programmatic sales on exchanges (which did not). That ruling, followed by a contentious remedies phase and multiple appeals, has left the legal and crypto communities constantly on edge. Although Keener’s filing may not significantly change the case’s legal course, it does highlight the intense public interest and the deep frustrations many feel over regulatory ambiguity. This criticism isn’t new: both retail and institutional investors have long argued that the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation is unclear and overly reliant on enforcement actions. Waiting for the Next Official Move With the appellate timeline ticking down, all eyes remain on the formal moves by Ripple and the SEC in the coming weeks. The status report due on June 16 will likely provide clearer insights into whether the parties are inching toward resolution or bracing for another round of drawn-out appeals. For Ripple, which continues to expand its global partnerships and XRP-centered financial services, the legal clarity that could emerge from these proceedings is vital to its future positioning, particularly in the U.S. market. In the meantime, Keener’s “emergency request” stands as a curious footnote — perhaps a symbol of just how high the emotional stakes have risen in a case that, at its core, touches on questions of innovation, regulation, and the future of the U.S. financial system. As Bill Morgan aptly put it, “this case never fails to entertain (or end).” For now, the crypto world watches and waits, knowing full well that in the Ripple vs. SEC saga, surprises can come from just about anywhere.

This initiative aims to integrate cryptocurrency into the canal’s operations, potentially offering a more efficient payment method for expedited passage. Mizrachi shared this idea on May 29 while speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas alongside other Bitcoin supporters from El Salvador. Panama City Mayor proposes Bitcoin payments for priority canal transit Mizrachi spoke on the panel alongside Bitcoin advocates, El Salvador government advisors Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, and moderator Mike Peterson from Bitcoin Beach. He suggested that cargo ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal can pay their transit fees in Bitcoin and get priority access. The mayor pointed out that this idea could position Panama as a leading digital finance and technology center and bring Bitcoin deeper into the country’s economy. The Panama Canal saves cargo ships weeks of travel time that they would have to spend if they sailed around the southern tip of South America because it links the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The canal handles about 5% of all global maritime commerce, and nearly 10,000 ships passed through it between October 2023 and September 2024, carrying more than 423 million tons of cargo and generating almost $5 billion in revenue for Panama. Mizrachi’s idea comes at a time of political tension since President Donald Trump publicly demanded that the United States take back control of the Panama Canal in December 2024. Trump criticized the toll system by claiming that U.S. ships pay higher fees than ships from other countries and argued that China’s growing influence over the canal threatens American interests. The mayor’s idea to accept Bitcoin payments for faster canal transit in this complicated situation supports Panama’s digital growth goals. It makes the canal more competitive and efficient on the international trade stage. Panama City embraces Bitcoin for tax payments and proposes City-level crypto reserve Panama City approved a new rule that allows people and businesses to pay their municipal taxes, fines, and fees using Bitcoin and other digital currencies. This move shows that the city trusts digital currency and wants to give people more flexible ways to meet their financial obligations to the government. Mayor Mizrachi also proposed to create a dedicated Bitcoin reserve for Panama City to help stabilize its finances and attract new investment opportunities since the city contributes more than half of the country’s gross domestic product. He also said he could set up the reserve at the city level without waiting for the national legislature to pass any new laws. The mayor used strong language to warn lawmakers to avoid rushing into new rules that could slow progress or scare away innovation. He said, “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it,” emphasizing that the government should give Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the space to grow naturally. Mizrachi told lawmakers to watch how people use Bitcoin over time and only bring rules that protect users or improve systems. Mizrachi said the country transacts over $5 billion in Bitcoin annually, but most of it remains hidden because many fear the legal or social risks of being open about their involvement with crypto. The mayor believes that making the system more open, transparent, and officially supported will encourage more people and businesses to come forward. The decision to adopt Bitcoin also comes amidst social and economic tension. Panama declared a state of emergency in the Bocas del Toro province following news that a well-known banana company, Chiquita, was laying off over 5,000 workers. Those employees were demonstrating for additional social security guarantees and improved working conditions. In other discussion forums, Mizrach sai d cr yptocurrencies can function as safety nets when traditional infrastructures do not help the country’s most vulnerable people.

In a post published to X, the company stated, “If it’s happening on-chain, it’s happening with Ripple,” and encouraged its 3.1 million followers to explore how blockchain is transforming the financial sector and other industries. The post was accompanied by a short video clip displaying the phrase “It’s happening” alongside a ticking clock, an image of a charging bull, and a directional sign pointing to Wall Street, Broad Street, and the Marunouchi Line.

Find out how blockchain is changing finance…and just about everything else, too. pic.twitter.com/uQXFl0LC4I — Ripple (@Ripple) May 29, 2025 Community Decodes the Clues The timing and style of the message prompted immediate speculation from the XRP Army, a term used to describe XRP’s most engaged community members. One notable reaction came from community member deva tron, who commented , “It’s coming, you’re not ready XRP.” Others joined in the discussion by attempting to decode the imagery and messaging, including by using AI tools to interpret potential meanings behind the teaser. Among the most discussed elements was the reference to the Marunouchi Line, a subway route in Tokyo. Several users pointed out that SBI Holdings, one of Ripple’s long-term partners in Japan, has its headquarters situated near this metro line. Given that SBI uses XRP to support cross-border transactions in parts of Asia, some interpreted the inclusion of this location as a subtle reference to Ripple’s continued efforts to expand blockchain integration in key financial and urban centers globally. Ripple’s Expanding Payment Infrastructure While Ripple has not clarified the purpose of its post, the teaser appears to emphasize the company’s focus on three core areas: payments, custody solutions, and the deployment of its newly introduced stablecoin, RLUSD . These are segments where Ripple has been actively building over the past several months. In the payments domain, speculation has centered around Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road .

However, while many in the XRP community had hoped XRP itself would be utilized for settlement, Ripple has clarified that RLUSD will act as collateral, with XRP being used only to cover transaction fees. RLUSD Gains Momentum on Exchanges This week, RLUSD made further progress by being listed on new exchanges, including Bitget and Bitmex. It is already trading on major platforms such as Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini. These developments signal Ripple’s ongoing push to enhance RLUSD’s accessibility and market depth. The company’s focus on improving liquidity and reach for RLUSD reinforces its broader objective of building a stablecoin-based settlement infrastructure that complements XRP’s role within the ecosystem. Strengthening Custody Capabilities On the custody front, Ripple’s expansion continues through institutional-grade infrastructure. Earlier in the year, the company filed a trademark application for “Ripple Custody” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This filing came as the U.S. Treasury began considering external custody providers like Anchorage Digital for managing its Bitcoin reserves. Ripple has already moved to strengthen its custody offering with its acquisition of Metaco and now offers a dedicated Ripple Custody app. The application functions as an authenticator for institutional transactions rather than a personal digital wallet. As of now, the exact purpose behind Ripple’s “It’s happening” teaser remains undisclosed. Still, the deliberate imagery, timing, and tone have fueled speculation that Ripple may soon unveil a significant update or expansion. The community continues to watch closely for any further clues or announcements. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Jamie Raskin Demands Guest List of $TRUMP Coin Dinner appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A heated controversy is brewing in Washington as Rep. Jamie Raskin pushes President Donald Trump to reveal the full list of guests who attended a private dinner after purchasing $TRUMP memecoins. These attendees reportedly spent close to $400 million just to get access. This demand comes during the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas , where major crypto figures like Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, the Winklevoss twins, and pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht are promoting the administration’s strong pro-crypto stance. Jamie Raskin Calls for Transparency: Who Bought Their Way In? In a letter sent Thursday, Raskin pressed President Trump to disclose the names of all 220 buyers who used $TRUMP coins to secure a spot at the private dinner. He pointed out that many of these buyers appear to be foreign nationals who only purchased the coins after the event was announced. “These 220 buyers…collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars — $394 million by one account,” said Raskin, noting that “we deserve to know who is paying for access to our president.” He also expressed serious concerns that the event may break laws regarding foreign government payments, known as emoluments laws. Raskin demanded full disclosure of the sources of funds each attendee used to purchase the coins and set a deadline of June 4, 2025, for this information. The Focus on Justin Sun and Potential Foreign Influence One high-profile figure in the spotlight is Chinese-born crypto investor Justin Sun. He reportedly spent $23 million on $TRUMP coins. Sun has previously faced investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for his connections to a Trump-related crypto firm. Raskin warned that some of the funds may come from illegal sources or foreign governments, raising red flags about possible foreign influence through cryptocurrency. He was clear about what the public should know: beyond “virtually worthless memecoins,” what exactly are these buyers getting in return for their millions? Crypto, Politics, and a Growing Scrutiny This controversy unfolds at a critical moment for cryptocurrency in the U.S. The Trump administration’s aggressive push to embrace crypto, showcased at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, marks a significant shift in policy. However, Raskin’s demands highlight the ongoing concerns about foreign money mixing with political power through digital assets. With the June 4 deadline fast approaching, all eyes are on President Trump to see if he will disclose the details about who is buying access – and with what money.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 09:50:03

And few things influence that pulse more directly than decisions made by the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding Fed interest rates . Recent Mary Daly comments from the San Francisco Fed offer a crucial look into the central bank’s current thinking, providing valuable context for investors watching market trends. What Are the Latest Mary Daly Comments on Interest Rates? Speaking on May 29, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly provided an update on her perspective regarding the trajectory of monetary policy. Her key message offered a blend of caution and potential flexibility: Hold Steady for Now: Daly emphasized the need for the central bank to keep Fed interest rates unchanged at their current level for the time being. Why the Pause? The primary reason cited is the need for more time and data to gain greater confidence that inflation is definitively heading back towards the Fed’s long-term target of 2%. Potential for Cuts: Despite the call for patience, Daly reiterated that the possibility of two interest rate cuts before the end of 2024 remains on the table. This suggests that while the Fed isn’t in a rush, they haven’t abandoned their easing bias entirely. This balanced view highlights the data-dependent nature of the Fed’s current stance, waiting for clear signals before making a move. How Does the Inflation Outlook Influence Fed Decisions? A central theme in Mary Daly comments , and indeed in statements from most Fed officials, is the inflation outlook . The Fed’s dual mandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability (low, stable inflation). After a period of elevated price increases, bringing inflation down to 2% is the primary focus. Daly specifically noted that she is closely watching incoming data to see if inflation continues its recent trend of easing or if signs of persistence reappear. This means the Fed isn’t just looking at headline numbers but also underlying components of inflation, often referred to as ‘core’ inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. A stubborn inflation outlook is the main barrier to initiating interest rate cuts . What Does the US Economy Outlook Look Like According to Daly? Beyond inflation, the health of the labor market is a critical component of the US economy outlook and a key factor the Fed considers. A strong labor market typically supports consumer spending but can also contribute to wage pressures, potentially fueling inflation. According to reports on the Mary Daly comments , she sees no signs of significant labor market weakness so far. This suggests that the economy is currently robust enough to withstand current interest rate levels without causing widespread job losses. The Fed wants to see a gradual cooling, not a sharp downturn, in the labor market. This stable US economy outlook , particularly regarding employment, gives the Fed flexibility to wait longer on rate adjustments if needed to ensure inflation is under control. Why Are Interest Rate Cuts Still Possible This Year? While the immediate focus is on holding steady, the fact that two interest rate cuts are still considered viable by Daly speaks to the Fed’s expectation that the inflation outlook will likely improve over the coming months. The pathway to cuts depends on: Continued Disinflation: A steady decline in inflation readings towards the 2% target. Stable Employment: The labor market remaining healthy but not overheating. Absence of Negative Shocks: No major unexpected events (domestic or international) that could disrupt the economic trajectory. Should these conditions materialize, the Fed would gain the confidence needed to begin gradually lowering Fed interest rates , providing some stimulus to the economy. How Do Fed Interest Rates Impact the Crypto Market? Understanding the Fed’s stance is crucial for crypto investors because Fed interest rates significantly influence global liquidity and investor risk appetite. Higher rates tend to make traditional, safer assets like bonds more attractive compared to riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Conversely, lower rates or the prospect of interest rate cuts can increase liquidity and encourage investment in risk assets. Therefore, monitoring the inflation outlook and US economy outlook through insights like Mary Daly comments helps anticipate potential shifts in monetary policy, which in turn can impact capital flows into and out of the crypto market. The expectation of future interest rate cuts , even if delayed, can be seen as a potentially positive signal for risk assets over the medium term. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty with Daly’s Insights Mary Daly’s recent remarks provide a clear picture of the Fed’s current cautious but optimistic approach. The focus remains firmly on confirming the positive trend in the inflation outlook before considering any moves on Fed interest rates . While the possibility of interest rate cuts this year remains, the timing is highly dependent on incoming data. For those following the US economy outlook and its potential effects on markets, including crypto, paying close attention to further Mary Daly comments and data releases will be essential in the months ahead.

Protocol Staking Not a Non-Security In a May 29 release , the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance indicated that staking crypto through PoS mechanisms is not covered under the Securities Act. According to the staff, such activities “don’t have to register with the Commission” and do not require registration exemptions either. The guidance underscored that staking rewards are earned as compensation for providing a service — running validator nodes — and not based on others’ labor, a key distinction in securities law. Second, custodial staking — where a third party stakes on behalf of a user — is not a securities offering. Staff explained custodians are mere agents and have no control over how much is staked. Commissioner Peirce Praises Regulatory Certainty Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the agency’s Crypto Task Force, supported the action, maintaining it gives much-needed clarity to American crypto users. “Regulatory uncertainty about staking views discouraged Americans from staking,” she said, maintaining it also impeded network decentralization and consensus participation. Peirce has long maintained that a regulatory system that encourages innovation with clear rules for participants is necessary. Crenshaw Criticizes Legal Foundation But Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw was a strong critic of the guidance, declaring that it “falls short of providing a reliable roadmap” for staking classification on the Howey test, the judicial standard for determining securities. “The staff’s analysis is wishful thinking, not law,” Crenshaw said. “It’s another example of the SEC acting on assumptions of future legal outcomes.” Crenshaw warned that omitting settled court decisions could undermine investor protection and legitimacy of the SEC. The SEC’s latest move illustrates the internal conflict regarding regulation of cryptocurrency. Whereas Peirce views the guidance as pro-innovation, Crenshaw considers it a legally dubious deviation from disciplinary regulation. Crypto consumers and staking services providers will likely welcome the clarity — even as legal uncertainties may persist, subject to future enforcement actions and court interpretations.",Blockchain|SEC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-30 09:53:03

Despite short-term volatility, ETH is up 45% monthly, with analysts forecasting a push beyond $3,000 in June. XRP has surged 322% over the past year, but with 98% of its supply now in profit, Santiment warns of a higher risk of profit-taking and a possible short-term correction. Latest ADA Updates Earlier this week, some members of the Cardano community noted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has May 29 as an initial deadline to approve or reject Grayscale’s application to launch the first spot ADA ETF in the United States. The agency, however, opted to delay its decision until July 15. It has a maximum of 240 days to review the product, with a final deadline of October 22. The price of ADA is down 7% on a daily scale, as its downtrend could be attributed to the SEC’s actions and the overall decline of the cryptocurrency market during that time frame. Meanwhile, several key factors suggest that Cardano’s native token may soon regain its upward momentum. As CryptoPotato reported , whales purchased over 180 million ADA last week, which suggests strong confidence in the asset. Another bullish element is the development of Cardano. Just a few days ago, Input Output revealed that Bitcoin Ordinals can now be wrapped and bridged to the Cardano blockchain through Fairgate’s BitVMX framework. “This breakthrough marks a significant advancement in decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling seamless interaction between two of the most prominent blockchain ecosystems,” the team stated. Where’s ETH Headed? Despite the pullback over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is up 45% on a monthly basis , currently trading at just north of $2,600 (according to CoinGecko’s data). ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko Popular industry participants like the X users Daan Trades and Michael van de Poppe expect the asset to pump in the near future under certain conditions. The former saw a “big resistance” at $2,800, which will be “a tough level to break through quickly.” For his part, Michael van de Poppe touched upon the matter when the price was above $2,700, saying: “Ethereum above $2,700 is a great sign. I think we’ll see $3,000+ in June .” Those willing to explore other, even more bullish price predictions involving the second-largest cryptocurrency can take a look at our detailed article here . What About XRP? Ripple’s cross-border token has been on a downward trend lately, but it has seen an impressive 322% increase in the last year. As of this writing, it trades at around $2.20, having declined by 10% over the past week. According to Santiment, the total supply in profit (at least on paper) had surged past 98% earlier this week when the asset traded at $2.3. Thus, XRP outshined ADA (71%), ETH (71.5%), DOGE (77.9%), and LINK (80.5%). While the data might sound optimistic and encouraging, Santiment issued a major warning, stating: “When large portions of a network are heavily in profit, the odds of profit-taking and a short-term pullback rise.” This takes us to Warren Buffett’s famous advice, who years ago advised investors to be greedy when others are fearful and vice versa.

The firm noted that corporate profits plummeted by $118 billion in Q1 2025. The U.S. economy contracted in Q1 on an import surge following the start of President Donald Trump’s second term in office as he initiated a trade war with countries globally. Wall Street economists also changed their outlook to negative growth, largely because of an unexpected rise in imports as corporate institutions and consumers sought to counter the Trump levies imposed in early April. Trump’s policy uncertainty weighs on corporate profits 🇺🇸💸 Trump's trade war has cost companies more than $34 billion in lost sales and higher costs, according to analysis of corporate disclosures, a toll that is expected to rise as ongoing uncertainty over tariffs paralyzes decision making at some of the world's largest companies. pic.twitter.com/CDoN5ASgih — Flying Dutch Fella 🇺🇦🇳🇱🇪🇺 🇬🇪🇨🇦🇬🇱 (@FlyingDutchPall) May 29, 2025 Imports inched up 41.3% for the quarter, driven by a 50.9% increase in goods, reflecting the biggest growth outside the Covid pandemic since 1974. A sharp decline in federal expenditure also contributed to the weak GDP number amid Elon Musk ’s efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Federal government outlays declined 5.1% for the quarter, shaving off about one-third of a percentage point off GDP. “No surprise that GDP took a hit in the first quarter, mainly because the balance of trade blew up as companies imported goods like crazy to front-run tariffs. The more telling number for the future of the expansion was consumer spending, and it grew, but at a relatively weak pace.” -Robert Frick, Corporate Economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. Trump announced a 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. trade partners as well as a flurry of reciprocal tariffs against several nations. On April 9, the President suspended those duties for 90 days to allow for negotiations between its trade partners, with some deals still ongoing . Corporate Institutions ranging from airlines and retailers to motor vehicle manufacturers have also refrained from giving financial guidance for 2025, citing the uncertainty caused by the heightened nature of some levies. Ford suspended its annual guidance on May 5, arguing that tariffs would cost the company about $1.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes. General Motors cut its 2025 profit forecast on May 1, two days after pulling its annual guidance. The company also paused plans to buy back $2 billion of shares in the first half of the year, pending more clarity on the economic outlook. Mercedes pulled its earnings guidance for 2025 on April 30 as it posted lower first-quarter profits. A U.S. court on Wednesday halted most of Trump’s levies from going into effect, ruling that the President overstepped his authority. The uncertainty on corporations was echoed during the Federal Reserve’s 6-7 meeting published on Wednesday, noting that participants judged that the downside risk of employment and economic activity and upside risk of inflation had risen, reflecting the potential effects of tariff increases. Increased imports cause a drop in real GDP According to the second estimate, the real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased at an annual rate of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025. The report also disclosed that real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased by 2.4%. The BEA also reported that real gross domestic income (GDI) decreased by 0.2% in the first quarter, compared to an increase of 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Corporate profits also decreased by $118.1 billion in the first quarter, compared to an increase of $204.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The BEA said the decrease in real GDP in Q1 primarily reflected an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and a decrease in government spending. The government entity believes the movements in growth were partly offset by increases in investment, consumer spending, and exports. Data also revealed that the real GDP was revised up 0.1 percentage point from the advance estimate, reflecting an upward revision to investment that was partly offset by a downward revision to consumer spending. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased by 3.6%, the same as previously estimated. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased by 3.4%, which was revised down by 0.1 percentage points from the previous estimate.

This move, which comes amidst calls from industry groups for greater regulatory certainty, has been met with both applause and criticism from within the Commission itself. On May 29, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance released a staff statement asserting that “Protocol Staking Activities,” specifically crypto staked in a proof-of-stake blockchain, do not require registration under the Securities Act, nor do they fall under its exemptions. The Division elaborated that staking rewards are deemed compensation for services rendered by node operators, rather than profits derived from “others’ entrepreneurial or managerial efforts.” This distinction is crucial, as it places these activities outside the purview of traditional securities regulation. Furthermore, custodial staking, where custodians merely act as “agents in connection with staking” without direct involvement in staking decisions, is also not classified as a securities offering. Ancillary staking services, such as slashing and early unbonding, were similarly declared “merely administrative or ministerial in nature” and not subject to securities classification. Industry Welcomes The guidance provides a much-needed sigh of relief for many in the crypto industry, who have long grappled with regulatory ambiguity. During Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York earlier in May, crypto industry groups had specifically urged the SEC to provide formal guidance on staking , highlighting the prevalent regulatory uncertainty faced by Web3 infrastructure providers. Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, a prominent voice in the agency’s Crypto Task Force, lauded the guidance as “welcome clarity for stakers and staking-as-a-service providers in the United States.” She emphasized that the previous uncertainty had “artificially constrained participation in network consensus and undermined the decentralization, censorship resistance, and credible neutrality of proof-of-stake blockchains.” SEC Democrat Commissioner Criticizes the Move However, the SEC’s sole Democrat commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw , expressed strong dissent. Crenshaw argued that the guidance “fails to deliver a reliable roadmap for determining whether a staking service” constitutes an investment contract under securities laws, as defined by the longstanding Howey test. She criticized the staff’s analysis, stating that it “may reflect what some wish the law to be, but it does not square with the court decisions on staking and the longstanding Howey precedent on which they are based.” It is important to note that the staff statement explicitly mentioned that it “has no legal force or effect” and did not address other forms of staking, such as liquid staking and restaking, leaving room for future regulatory considerations.

Get ready for some really significant news in the US crypto market. After facing some serious headwinds and temporary restrictions, Binance.US, one of the major players in the United States, has just made a crucial announcement that’s set to bring a sigh of relief to many users. Yes, you heard that right – Binance.US is officially resuming its U.S. dollar services! This means users can once again easily make USD deposits on Binance.US and subsequently use those funds to buy crypto on Binance.US , specifically through convenient bank transfers. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the platform. Why is This Binance.US News So Important? You might recall that back in June 2023, Binance.US had to temporarily suspend USD deposits and withdrawals. This move came amidst a challenging regulatory environment, particularly following actions taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suspension of fiat services created considerable difficulties for users looking to fund their accounts or cash out their crypto holdings. It restricted how users could interact with the platform using traditional money, forcing many to look for alternative methods or exchanges. The ability to easily move money between your bank account and a crypto exchange is fundamental to participating in the market. Without straightforward USD deposits Binance.US faced limitations in attracting new users and retaining existing ones who preferred the convenience of direct bank transfers. This news of resuming services isn’t just about restoring functionality; it’s a strong signal that the platform is navigating its challenges and working to provide essential services to its user base. The Big Announcement: What’s Back on Binance.US? Binance.US took to their official X (formerly Twitter) account to share the good news. The core of the announcement is the resumption of U.S. dollar services. Specifically, this includes: USD Deposits: Users can now deposit U.S. dollars into their Binance.US accounts directly from their bank accounts. Crypto Purchases: With deposited USD, users can now purchase cryptocurrencies available on the platform. Method: These services are accessible via bank transfers, primarily through Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers. This marks a significant step towards restoring full functionality, particularly for users who rely on ACH transfers for their speed and low cost compared to wire transfers or other methods. The return of Binance.US bank transfer capabilities is a key element in making the platform more accessible and user-friendly once again. How Can You Make USD Deposits on Binance.US Now? For users eager to get back to using bank transfers, the process on Binance.US is designed to be relatively straightforward, similar to how it worked before the suspension. While the exact steps might have minor UI updates, the general flow involves linking your bank account and initiating a transfer. Here’s a general idea of the steps involved: Log In: Access your Binance.US account through the website or mobile app. Navigate to Deposits: Look for the ‘Wallet’ or ‘Deposit’ section. Select USD: Choose ‘USD’ as the currency you wish to deposit. Choose Method: Select ‘Bank Transfer’ or ‘ACH’. Link Account (if not already): If your bank account isn’t linked, you’ll need to follow the prompts to securely connect it. This usually involves logging into your bank portal through a secure third-party service or verifying micro-deposits. Enter Amount: Specify the amount of USD you wish to deposit. Confirm Transfer: Review the details and confirm the transaction. Once the ACH transfer is initiated, it typically takes a few business days for the funds to settle in your Binance.US account. However, in many cases, exchanges allow you to trade with a portion of the deposited funds almost immediately, while the full amount becomes available after settlement. This speed makes Binance.US bank transfer a preferred method for many. The Benefits: Why is This Good News for Users and Binance.US? The resumption of USD services brings a multitude of benefits, impacting both the users and the exchange itself. Benefits for Users: Convenience: Easily move money from your bank account directly to the exchange without needing intermediaries or alternative methods. Cost-Effectiveness: ACH transfers are typically much cheaper, often free, compared to wire transfers or using debit/credit cards which can incur higher fees. This makes it more affordable to buy crypto on Binance.US . Accessibility: Provides a familiar and widely used method for funding accounts, making crypto more accessible to a broader audience. Faster Access to Funds: While settlement takes time, the ability to initiate deposits directly from a bank account is often quicker than other methods used during the restriction period. Benefits for Binance.US: Increased Trading Volume: With easier funding options, users are more likely to deposit funds and trade, potentially increasing the platform’s overall trading volume. User Retention & Acquisition: The return of a core service helps retain users who might have considered leaving and attracts new users looking for a platform with straightforward fiat on-ramps. Improved Reputation: Successfully restoring services, especially after facing regulatory hurdles, can help rebuild trust and demonstrate resilience. Strengthened Position: In the competitive US market, offering reliable fiat services is essential to compete with other major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. This positive Binance.US news is a win-win, enhancing the user experience while bolstering the platform’s operational capabilities. Buying Crypto on Binance.US: Easier Than Ever? With your USD successfully deposited via bank transfer, the process to buy crypto on Binance.US becomes significantly simpler. You can now use your USD balance directly to purchase a wide range of cryptocurrencies available on the platform. This eliminates the need for workarounds that users might have employed when direct USD deposits were unavailable. The platform typically offers various ways to buy crypto: Spot Trading: Place market or limit orders on the spot market using your USD balance against various crypto pairs (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD, ADA/USD). Buy/Sell Feature: Use a simplified interface that allows you to quickly convert a specified amount of USD into a chosen cryptocurrency at the current market price. The availability of easy USD funding directly impacts the ease and speed with which users can react to market movements and execute their trading strategies. Comparing Deposit Methods: Why Binance.US Bank Transfer Stands Out While exchanges often offer multiple ways to fund your account, the Binance.US bank transfer (ACH) method has distinct advantages, particularly when compared to alternatives like debit/credit card purchases or wire transfers. Let’s look at a simple comparison: Method Speed (Funding) Typical Fees Convenience Availability for Trading Bank Transfer (ACH) 1-3 business days (settlement) Low to None High (Link bank account) Often immediate (partial) Debit/Credit Card Instant Higher (often 3-5%) High (Enter card details) Immediate (full amount) Wire Transfer Same day to 1 business day Moderate to High (Flat fee) Moderate (Requires bank visit/online setup) Immediate (full amount) As you can see, while debit/credit cards offer instant funding, the fees are usually significantly higher. Wire transfers are faster than ACH for settlement but typically involve higher flat fees and might be less convenient. The ACH Binance.US bank transfer strikes a good balance between cost and convenience, making it a preferred method for regular deposits and funding your account to buy crypto on Binance.US . Challenges and Considerations: What Should Users Watch Out For? While the return of USD deposits is fantastic news, it’s important for users to remain aware of the broader context and potential considerations: Withdrawals: The announcement specifically mentioned deposits and purchases. Users should verify the status and availability of USD withdrawals via bank transfer. While deposits resuming is a strong indicator, withdrawal functionality is equally critical for full fiat service restoration. Regulatory Environment: The underlying regulatory challenges that led to the suspension haven’t completely disappeared. The SEC lawsuit is ongoing. Users should stay informed about the regulatory landscape and its potential impact on exchange operations in the US. This is a key piece of ongoing Binance.US news . Platform Stability: While the service is back, monitoring its stability and reliability is wise. Ensure transfers are processing smoothly and within expected timeframes. Terms and Conditions: Always review the updated terms of service and fee schedules on Binance.US, especially concerning deposit and withdrawal limits and processing times. Staying informed and exercising caution, as with any financial platform, is always recommended. What’s Next for Binance.US? The resumption of USD services is a vital step, but it’s likely part of a larger effort by Binance.US to solidify its position in the US market. Future developments might include: Resolving Regulatory Issues: The primary focus will likely remain on navigating the legal and regulatory challenges it faces. A positive resolution would significantly strengthen its long-term viability. Expanding Services: Depending on regulatory clarity, the platform might look to add more trading pairs, features, or services to compete more effectively. Ensuring Fiat Stability: Maintaining stable and reliable fiat on/off-ramps will be crucial for rebuilding and maintaining user trust. This recent development is certainly a positive turn in the ongoing Binance.US news narrative. Actionable Insights: How to Take Advantage of Resumed Services For users looking to benefit from the return of easy USD funding: Verify Your Account: Ensure your Binance.US account is fully verified (KYC) as this is required for fiat transactions. Link Your Bank Account: If you haven’t already, or if you delinked it, go through the process of securely linking your bank account for ACH transfers. Start Small: If you’re cautious, make a small test deposit first to ensure the process works smoothly for you. Understand Limits: Be aware of any daily or transactional limits placed on ACH deposits by Binance.US or your bank. Plan Your Purchases: With easy USD funding, you can plan your strategy to buy crypto on Binance.US more effectively, perhaps taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. The ability to make USD deposits Binance.US offers via bank transfer is a powerful tool for managing your crypto investments. Conclusion: A Positive Step Forward for Binance.US and Its Users The announcement that Binance.US has resumed U.S. dollar deposit and crypto purchase services via bank transfer is undoubtedly a significant and positive development. It restores a fundamental functionality that was sorely missed by users and demonstrates the platform’s commitment to operating in the US market despite regulatory pressures. The return of easy Binance.US bank transfer capabilities makes it more convenient and cost-effective for users to fund their accounts and buy crypto on Binance.US . While challenges remain, particularly regarding the broader regulatory landscape, this piece of Binance.US news is a strong indicator of progress. It benefits users by providing a familiar and efficient way to interact with the platform and benefits Binance.US by potentially boosting activity and trust. For anyone looking to participate in the US crypto market via Binance.US, this is a crucial step towards regaining seamless access.

At this point, an important move came from a Chinese company. Webus International Limited, a China-based company that provides AI-powered mobility solutions, will raise up to $300 million to create a Ripple (XRP) reserve for global payments. According to the official statement, Webus announced that it plans to raise up to $300 million in non-capital financing to create an XRP reserve. The company also said it has renewed its partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings Ltd., one of China's largest online travel platforms. The $300 million funding strategy for the XRP reserve will consist of a mix of existing cash reserves, bank loans, shareholder guarantees, and institutional credit support from traditional banks. However, the company did not specify a timeline for the XRP purchase. Nan Zheng, Chief Executive Officer of Webus, said: “These strategic developments have the potential to create strong synergies between our domestic and international operations, “While our renewed partnership with Tongcheng strengthens our China network infrastructure, an XRP integration has the potential to revolutionize the way we handle cross-border payments for both partners and travelers worldwide.” Webus’ statement comes a day after Nasdaq-listed energy company VivoPower International announced its $121 million strategy to establish its own XRP treasury.

One significant step in this direction is the launch of a tokenized U.S. Treasury bill on the Algorand network, pioneered by the platform Midas. This move signals a growing trend towards integrating real-world assets (RWAs) into the digital asset ecosystem, offering new opportunities for investors seeking stable yield and diversification within DeFi. What is Midas mTBILL and Why Does it Matter for Algorand DeFi? Midas, known for its focus on internet-native investing solutions, recently announced the launch of mTBILL on the Algorand blockchain via their official X account. But what exactly is mTBILL? It’s a tokenized certificate designed to track short-term U.S. Treasury ETFs. Essentially, Midas is packaging exposure to highly stable, government-backed debt into a digital token that can be held, traded, and potentially used within decentralized applications on Algorand. The significance of this launch for Algorand DeFi cannot be overstated. Algorand is known for its robust, scalable, and secure blockchain architecture, making it a suitable platform for handling sophisticated financial instruments. Bringing assets like U.S. Treasury bills onto Algorand opens up possibilities: Enhanced Accessibility: Provides a way for global users, potentially even those with limited access to traditional brokerage accounts, to gain exposure to U.S. government debt. Increased Liquidity: Tokenization can make traditionally less liquid assets more easily tradable on secondary markets. Composability: Once on-chain, mTBILLs could theoretically be integrated into various DeFi protocols on Algorand, such as lending platforms or yield farming strategies, although the specific use cases would depend on Midas and other protocol developers. Transparency: Transactions involving mTBILLs on Algorand are recorded on the public ledger, offering a degree of transparency not always present in traditional finance. This integration aligns perfectly with the broader narrative of RWA tokenization , which aims to unlock the value of diverse assets, from real estate and art to commodities and financial instruments like bonds, by representing them as digital tokens on a blockchain. Midas mTBILL: A Closer Look at the Tokenized Treasury The Midas mTBILL represents a claim on underlying short-term U.S. Treasury ETFs. This structure is crucial because it means the token’s value and yield potential are tied directly to the performance of these highly stable, low-risk traditional financial products. For crypto investors, this offers a potential avenue for stability and yield that is less correlated with the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. Compared to stablecoins, which aim to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, tokenized Treasury bills offer a different value proposition. While stablecoins typically rely on reserves (cash, equivalents, or other assets), tokenized T-bills directly represent ownership or exposure to interest-bearing government debt. This means they can potentially offer a yield derived from the Treasury bills themselves, in addition to price stability (though the price would fluctuate slightly based on the underlying ETF). The design as a tokenized ‘certificate’ tracking ETFs provides a mechanism for managing and representing the underlying assets on the blockchain in a standardized way. Real-World Adoption: The First Atomic Swap on Algorand Proof of the immediate utility and functionality of mTBILL came shortly after its launch. According to a report by Cointelegraph, the first atomic swap involving mTBILL on Algorand was executed by a third party on May 27th. This transaction saw 2 million USDC exchanged directly for mTBILLs. An atomic swap is a peer-to-peer exchange of cryptocurrencies or tokens from one blockchain to another, or in this case, between different assets on the same blockchain (USDC is also available on Algorand) without needing a trusted third party or intermediary. This specific swap demonstrates: The operational readiness of the mTBILL token on Algorand. Demand for this type of tokenized asset. The ability to seamlessly exchange significant value between stablecoins and tokenized RWAs on the network. This successful high-value transaction is a strong indicator of potential institutional or large-scale investor interest in using crypto treasury bills for managing liquidity or seeking yield within the DeFi ecosystem. Exploring the Potential of RWA Tokenization on Algorand The launch of tokenized U.S. Treasury bills by Midas on Algorand is more than just a single product release; it’s a tangible example of the growing RWA tokenization trend. As more real-world assets are brought onto blockchains, the potential for DeFi expands dramatically. This could lead to: New Investment Strategies: DeFi users can diversify their portfolios with assets traditionally only available in legacy finance. Increased Capital Efficiency: RWAs can serve as collateral in DeFi protocols, potentially unlocking significant liquidity. Broader Market Participation: Lower barriers to entry for investing in asset classes like real estate, private credit, and government debt. Algorand’s technical capabilities, including its Pure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, speed, low transaction costs, and focus on regulatory compliance and security, position it well as a platform for hosting these complex tokenized assets. The success of mTBILL could pave the way for Midas and other platforms to tokenize additional asset classes on the network. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? While the launch of Midas mTBILL is a positive step, the RWA tokenization space still faces challenges. These include regulatory clarity across different jurisdictions, the legal frameworks for enforcing ownership of the underlying assets represented by tokens, and ensuring seamless interaction between the blockchain world and traditional finance. However, the opportunities are immense. Tokenized assets like mTBILL could become fundamental building blocks in the next generation of financial markets, combining the efficiency and transparency of blockchain with the stability and scale of traditional assets. For investors on Algorand, it offers a novel way to access yield tied to one of the world’s safest asset classes. Conclusion: A Milestone for Algorand and RWA Tokenization The introduction of Midas’s tokenized U.S. Treasury bill on Algorand marks a significant milestone for both the Algorand ecosystem and the broader RWA tokenization movement. By successfully launching mTBILL and facilitating initial high-value swaps, Midas has demonstrated the viability of bringing stable, yield-bearing traditional financial assets onto a public blockchain. This development enriches the Algorand DeFi landscape, offering users new, potentially more stable, investment options and further solidifying Algorand’s position as a platform capable of supporting sophisticated financial applications. As the trend of RWA tokenization continues to gain momentum, initiatives like mTBILL will be crucial in shaping the future intersection of traditional finance and decentralized technology, making crypto treasury bills a topic to watch closely.

A mysterious filing by Justin W. Keener with an emergency motion has resurfaced again. Decisive Evidence Change The Outcome? Keener says that he has “decisive evidence” which could change the outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC case in favor of Ripple. This unexpected move invited comments from experts like Bill Morgan and Marc Fagel.

He didn’t expect a lengthy, emotional rant against the Howey Test and its court interpretations, especially about “investment contracts.” The rant also criticized the SEC’s actions over the past 90 years. “This case never fails to entertain or end,” he said, which shows how unpredictable the lawsuit has become. Marc Fagel also pointed out that this is the second time the same individual has submitted documents. The SEC even responded to the first one but questioned why the court hasn’t shut down the person’s PACER account yet, given the unauthorized filings. Keener’s first attempt to submit his “decisive evidence” in the Ripple case was shut down back in April, but he’s now trying again. Keener was recently fined $10 million for illegally trading penny stocks without registering as a dealer. Will This Impact The Lawsuit? The XRP community is watching closely if this would have any impact on the lawsuit. Most expect the court to reject it again, but how the judge and SEC respond this time will show whether it has any real impact. In a recent letter to SEC, Ripple said that fungible crypto assets like XRP aren’t securities in secondary sales. Citing legal expert Lewis Cohen and a 2023 court ruling, Ripple argued that these tokens don’t carry the legal traits of securities and requested the SEC to adopt clearer rules, noting that XRP itself was ruled not a security in public trading.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 10:13:06

The pullback comes amid a rise in profit-taking activity, with data showing that BTC holders selling has reached a three-month high. Despite this near-term selling pressure, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains solid. Firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and GameStop have been adding BTC to their corporate treasuries, underscoring continued confidence in the asset’s long-term value. According to Glassnode’s latest weekly report, investor profitability and spending behavior have picked up meaningfully, though current metrics remain well below levels typically seen at the peak of prior bull markets. This suggests that while short-term corrections are underway, the broader uptrend remains intact with room for further upside if institutional accumulation continues. As Bitcoin remains range-bound and profit-taking sets in following its recent gains, retail attention is shifting toward emerging and unique narratives like Bitcoin Pepe, which is nearing the end of its presale. The flagship cryptocurrency’s increasing maturity, declining volatility, and deepening institutional involvement have diluted its appeal among investors chasing explosive upside potential. This dynamic is evident in Bitcoin’s current inability to break out decisively despite broader market optimism. Meanwhile, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are drawing speculative capital from traders willing to tolerate some risk in pursuit of potentially outsized gains. BTC ETFs inflow streak broken US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358.6 million in net outflows on Thursday, marking the end of a 10-day streak of positive flows that had brought in a combined $4.26 billion. The reversal underscores a shift in investor sentiment after a sustained period of inflows, largely driven by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT was the only fund to post net inflows on the day, attracting $125 million, according to data from SoSoValue. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC led the day’s outflows with $166.32 million exiting the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC followed with $107.53 million in net redemptions, while Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB saw $89.22 million in outflows. Bitwise’s BITB posted $70.85 million in redemptions, with additional withdrawals reported from ETFs issued by VanEck, Valkyrie, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton. As of Wednesday, total net inflows across the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs had reached $45.34 billion. With Thursday’s outflows, the cumulative figure dropped to $44.99 billion. Bitcoin Pepe: time to buy in? Even as Bitcoin stabilizes, its recent push to new highs is once again lifting sentiment across the crypto market — a trend that has historically preceded broader rallies. As capital rotates back into digital assets, speculative segments such as meme coins are drawing heightened investor interest. Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a key beneficiary of this shift. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself at the intersection of meme culture and blockchain utility. The project seeks to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability — a technical edge that sets it apart from most meme tokens, which typically lack infrastructure. To develop its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has announced a string of strategic partnerships. These include partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. A collaboration with the GETE Network also aims to extend Bitcoin Pepe’s reach into the cross-chain Web3 gaming space. The project’s attempt to combine real-world utility with viral meme appeal appears to be gaining traction. Its ongoing presale has raised over $12.4 million, with BPEP tokens currently priced at $0.0377. With just over a day left until the presale ends on May 31, 2025, Bitcoin Pepe is drawing increased attention. A listing on centralized exchanges is expected soon after, a potential near-term catalyst for price action.

At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, which hosted important names for three days, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino also made important statements about Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and the cryptocurrency industry. Paolo Ardoino, who made statements supporting and praising Bitcoin, stated that Bitcoin is much more than a digital asset and said, “Bitcoin is the ultimate social network.” Comparing Tether to Facebook, the Tether CEO said, “Tether has experienced growth that is equivalent to what Facebook once did.” Bitcoin and Gold Reserves! Paolo Ardonio, who also announced Tether's reserves, stated that the company has over 100 thousand Bitcoins (worth over $10 billion) and 50 tons of gold in its reserves. Ardoino also said that Tether made around $13 billion in profits in 2024, making it the most successful and profitable name in the crypto industry. The famous CEO also explained Tether's decision to hold gold in its reserves and the reasons for it. Noting that Bitcoin supporters questioned Tether's decision on gold, Ardoino said: “A lot of Bitcoiners don’t like talking about gold because they think it takes something away from Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is perfect. Gold is imperfect. “At this point, gold is not competing with Bitcoin. Gold is competing with fiat money, and that's why we like gold quite a bit.” The famous CEO finally stated that Tether has made a profit of approximately $20 billion in the last three years and said: “Less than 5 percent of this profit has been paid to shareholders. The remaining 95 percent will be used to expand the global distribution network and reinvest in Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

Among the best tokens to invest in are Cardano (ADA) Solana (SOL) Dogecoin (DOGE) and the emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano is gaining momentum with increased institutional support and strategic partnerships positioning it as a strong coin in the crypto market. Solana backed by optimistic forecasts from major financial institutions is projected to reach new heights making it a top cryptocurrency to watch. Dogecoin, bolstered by a dedicated community and influential endorsements continues to show resilience and potential for growth. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new entrant in the market, is attracting attention for its innovative approach and promising ROI potential. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.5 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,400 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. With the crypto fear and greed index indicating a favorable investment climate, these cryptocurrencies represent some of the best options for those looking to capitalize on the upcoming market boom. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin: Leading the Pack as 2025 Approaches Cardano (ADA), which is trading at around $0.76, keeps adding strength to its solid foundation through network enhancements that are geared towards scalability and smart contract adoption, making it a good option among the best crypto investments today. Solana (SOL), which trades at around $174, enjoys its high-speed transactions and growing DeFi ecosystem, driving hopes for its capability to reach higher targets in the near future. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE), still going strong at about $0.22, gains further traction in its loyal base and celebrity backing and thus sits as a strong player among investors seeking convenient exposure to crypto markets. As the established coins accumulate for the rumored 2025 boom, emerging tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also beginning to receive attention for their growth potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,400 investors have invested $9.5 million in the presale, a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $2.50 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin remain solid picks, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the standout. With $9.5M raised and 11,400+ investors, the $0.03 presale offers 100% ROI at launch. Backed by a Certik audit and real DeFi utility, MUTM is a top buy now. Join the presale before the next price increase.

The country’s financial watchdog, the Thailand SEC , is cracking down on several major international cryptocurrency exchanges. If you use platforms like Bybit, OKX, CoinEx, 1000X, or XT, this affects you directly. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand has announced that these platforms will be blocked starting June 28, 2024, due to operating without the required digital asset business licenses. This move highlights the increasing focus on crypto regulation Thailand is implementing to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Why is the Thailand SEC Taking This Action? The primary reason cited by the Thailand SEC for this drastic measure is the operation of these platforms without proper licensing. In Thailand, engaging in digital asset business activities, including operating a cryptocurrency exchange, requires explicit approval from the SEC. This regulatory framework is designed to ensure platforms adhere to strict standards regarding security, compliance, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Operating without a license means these exchanges are not subject to the same oversight as licensed entities, potentially exposing users to higher risks. The SEC views unlicensed operations as a violation of the country’s digital asset laws. By blocking access and pursuing legal action, the regulator aims to: Protect Thai investors from potential risks associated with unregulated platforms. Ensure fair competition among digital asset operators, favoring those who comply with local laws. Strengthen the overall integrity and stability of the Thai digital asset market. Which Crypto Exchanges Are Affected by the Ban? The announcement specifically names five international crypto exchanges that will face the block. It’s crucial for users in Thailand to be aware of which platforms are included. The affected exchanges are: Bybit OKX CoinEx 1000X XT These platforms are popular globally, and many Thai residents have likely been using them due to their wide range of services, diverse altcoin listings, and sometimes competitive fees compared to local options. The impending block means users will lose access to their accounts and funds held on these platforms from June 28th onwards unless they take action. What Does This Mean for Users of Bybit, OKX, and CoinEx in Thailand? This is perhaps the most critical question for individuals using these platforms. The blocking action means that, from the specified date, users within Thailand may find it difficult or impossible to access the websites or mobile applications of Bybit , OKX , CoinEx , 1000X, and XT. This loss of access directly impacts their ability to trade, manage their portfolios, and most importantly, withdraw their assets. The SEC’s typical procedure in such cases involves requiring the blocked platforms to facilitate the withdrawal of assets for their Thai users within a specified timeframe before the block becomes fully effective. However, the statement also mentions pursuing legal action, which could complicate the process. Users should immediately check communications from these exchanges for specific instructions regarding asset withdrawal deadlines and procedures. Navigating Crypto Regulation Thailand: What Are Your Options? For users affected by the ban, understanding the current crypto regulation Thailand has in place is key to finding compliant alternatives. Thailand has a relatively mature regulatory framework for digital assets compared to some other countries. The SEC licenses and oversees several domestic digital asset exchanges and brokers. If you are a Thai resident using one of the blocked exchanges, here are some actionable steps you should consider immediately: Identify Your Assets: Log in to your Bybit, OKX, CoinEx, 1000X, or XT account (while you still can) and make a detailed list of all the cryptocurrencies and funds you hold on the platform. Check for Withdrawal Information: Look for official announcements from the exchange regarding the Thailand situation and withdrawal deadlines for Thai users. Act quickly, as time is limited. Withdraw Your Funds: Initiate withdrawals of all your assets from the affected exchanges to a personal wallet or to a licensed Thai digital asset exchange. Prioritize this step as access will be cut off. Explore Licensed Alternatives: Research and open accounts with digital asset exchanges that are licensed and regulated by the Thailand SEC. This ensures you are trading on a platform compliant with local laws. Examples of licensed exchanges in Thailand include Bitkub, Satang Pro (now Orbix Trade), Zipmex (currently under rehabilitation), and others. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from the Thailand SEC and the affected exchanges. Regulatory situations can evolve. Transitioning to a licensed platform is crucial for continued participation in the Thai crypto market in a compliant manner. Comparing Regulatory Approaches: Thailand vs. Global Trends Thailand’s approach to digital asset regulation reflects a global trend where regulators are increasingly scrutinizing cryptocurrency platforms. Many countries are implementing licensing regimes to bring exchanges under regulatory purview, similar to traditional financial institutions. This aims to mitigate risks such as money laundering, terrorist financing, market manipulation, and investor fraud. While some jurisdictions take a more permissive stance, others, like Thailand, are adopting stricter measures to ensure compliance. The action against Bybit , OKX , and CoinEx , among others, serves as a stark reminder that operating in any country requires understanding and adhering to its specific legal and regulatory requirements. Exchanges that fail to do so risk facing similar consequences. The benefits of regulation, from a governmental perspective, include enhanced investor protection through mandated security standards, segregation of client funds, and robust compliance frameworks. Challenges include the potential for stifling innovation if regulations are too stringent and the difficulty of enforcing rules on borderless internet platforms. What Happens Next? Legal Action and Market Impact The Thailand SEC has stated it will pursue legal action against the non-compliant platforms. The exact nature of this legal action was not detailed in the initial reports but could involve formal complaints, investigations, and potentially penalties or further restrictions. This adds another layer of complexity to the situation, particularly for the exchanges involved. The market impact within Thailand could see an increase in trading volume on licensed domestic exchanges as users migrate their funds. For the blocked international exchanges, losing access to the Thai market represents a loss of users and potential revenue. The news also sends a strong signal to other international platforms operating in Thailand without a license that they risk similar enforcement action. Ensuring Compliance in the Digital Asset Space This situation underscores the critical importance of compliance for any business operating in the digital asset space, especially across different jurisdictions. For international exchanges like Bybit , OKX , and CoinEx , navigating diverse regulatory landscapes is a significant challenge but a necessary one for sustainable global operations. For users, it highlights the importance of using regulated platforms to ensure their assets are protected under local laws. As the digital asset market continues to evolve, we can expect regulators worldwide to refine their approaches. The focus on licensing and investor protection is likely to remain a key theme in crypto regulation Thailand and beyond. Summary: The Clock is Ticking for Unlicensed Crypto Exchanges in Thailand In conclusion, the Thailand SEC’s decision to block access to Bybit, OKX, CoinEx, 1000X, and XT from June 28th is a major development stemming from their operation without the required digital asset business licenses. This action is part of Thailand’s broader efforts to strengthen crypto regulation Thailand , protect investors, and ensure market integrity. Users of these platforms in Thailand must act swiftly to withdraw their assets before the deadline and consider migrating to licensed local exchanges to ensure continued, compliant participation in the market. The situation serves as a powerful reminder of the growing global trend towards stricter oversight of crypto exchanges and the consequences of non-compliance.

Here’s What’s Coming,https://timestabloid.com/today-is-crucial-for-xrp-holders-heres-whats-coming/,"The crypto world is holding its breath today as XRP Las Vegas (XRPLV) kicks off, a moment anticipated not just by retail holders but by serious builders, capital allocators, and global onlookers alike. While the broader crypto scene often gets clouded by flashy stunts, meme-driven hype, and sometimes circus-like spectacles, as we saw this week at another Vegas crypto event, XRP Las Vegas promises to deliver something fundamentally different. In a yesterday post, Crypto analyst Stellar Rippler, known for deep macro insights on the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem, summed it up pointedly in a post on X: “When XRP Las Vegas happens tomorrow, it won’t be costumes, memes, or cow dances. It’ll be suits, smart minds, real builders, and world-changing integrations… XRPLV will be the G20 of crypto.” That framing sets the tone: this is a gathering not for empty noise but for meaningful, ecosystem-shifting announcements that could define XRP’s next chapter. After the circus in Vegas this week, I’m just saying… When XRP Las Vegas happens tomorrow, it won’t be costumes, memes, or cow dances. It’ll be suits, smart minds, real builders, and world-changing integrations. XRPLV will be the G20 of crypto. Quiet rooms. Serious capital.… pic.twitter.com/sYOFaWlD4x — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) May 29, 2025 A Turning Point for XRP XRP holders are watching closely because this isn’t just another blockchain conference; it’s unfolding at a pivotal time for the Ripple ecosystem. After Ripple’s historic partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions, the token has steadily regained both market legitimacy and institutional curiosity. Since then, Ripple has aggressively pursued partnerships, CBDC pilots, cross-border payment corridors, and integrations that stretch beyond U.S. shores, especially in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. XRPLV is set to showcase groundbreaking integrations that harness Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX), and innovations like the EVM-compatible sidechain developed with Peersyst Technology, enabling smart contract functionality on XRPL. Although specifics about today’s announcements are yet to be disclosed, insiders and analysts alike have hinted at potential institutional tie-ups, cross-chain bridge solutions, and further CBDC progress, making this a high-stakes event for both XRP’s price trajectory and its long-term ecosystem health. The Weight of Institutional Eyes Unlike the typical retail-driven hype cycles that dominate crypto headlines, XRPLV is drawing serious capital players — hedge funds, fintech firms, cross-border payment giants, and even central bank observers — who are watching Ripple’s execution carefully. Stellar Rippler’s post underscores this institutional pivot, describing XRPLV as “the G20 of crypto,” where quiet rooms, sharp minds, and major capital converge, far from the chaos of meme coins and speculative frenzies. Ripple’s institutional focus is crucial, given its unique strategy that sets it apart from other cryptocurrency initiatives. While Bitcoin leans into its store-of-value narrative and Ethereum positions itself as the decentralized world computer, Ripple has aimed squarely at real-world financial use cases — frictionless cross-border settlements, instant liquidity access, and seamless integration with existing monetary systems. This development could solidify XRP’s position as a neutral bridge asset in the rapidly evolving digital payments ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Global Spotlight As global regulations tighten and financial institutions cautiously adopt digital assets, XRPLV showcases Ripple’s commitment to compliance and enterprise readiness. The crypto industry has been under immense pressure to prove it can scale responsibly, and Ripple, having weathered one of the most high-profile legal battles in crypto history, stands uniquely positioned to lead by example. Observers expect Ripple executives, technical leads, and partner institutions to unveil new products, pilot results, and perhaps even major corporate integrations that could accelerate the XRP Ledger’s global adoption. Given Ripple’s momentum, any announcements made today will likely ripple (pun intended) across both institutional and retail markets, reinforcing XRP’s reputation not just as a speculative asset but as a foundational component of the evolving digital financial system. Why Today Matters for XRP Holders For XRP holders, today is about much more than price action — it’s about clarity on Ripple’s strategic roadmap. Will Ripple solidify its leadership in cross-border finance? Will the XRPL ecosystem expand meaningfully into DeFi and smart contracts through the EVM sidechain? Will Ripple’s CBDC pilots turn into production-level deployments with central banks? These are the big-picture questions XRP holders want answered, and XRPLV promises to deliver. In short, this is a moment where retail meets institution, where crypto’s potential meets enterprise reality, and where XRP’s years of foundational work could finally translate into scaled, global impact. As Stellar Rippler put it, “The world will watch.” The crypto industry, and potentially the wider financial sector, is now keenly focused on XRP Las Vegas.

It’s a clear indicator that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . The index itself is quite straightforward in its methodology. It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The scale runs from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: For the market to be considered in Altcoin Season, a significant majority – specifically, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins – must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin during the same timeframe. The ‘In-Between’: Readings between 25 and 75 typically suggest a more neutral or mixed market environment, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a dominant edge in performance relative to each other. A reading of 22 falls well within the threshold for Bitcoin Season , indicating that over the last three months, a vast majority of the leading altcoins have lagged behind Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season So, the index says it’s Bitcoin Season . What does this practically mean for those involved in the Crypto Market ? Historically, Bitcoin Season often occurs after a period of strong Bitcoin price increases, where the leading cryptocurrency captures a larger share of the total market capitalization – a metric known as Bitcoin Dominance. While the index specifically tracks relative performance rather than dominance percentage, the two often correlate. During Bitcoin Season , we typically see: Bitcoin Leads the Way: Bitcoin tends to show stronger price momentum and relative stability compared to many altcoins. Altcoins Lag or Decline: Many altcoins may struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin’s gains, and some might even see declines, especially those with lower market caps or less established use cases. Reduced Altcoin Mania: The speculative frenzy often associated with Altcoin Season, where even lesser-known projects can see massive pumps, is typically subdued. Focus Shifts: Investor and media attention often consolidates around Bitcoin’s price movements and developments. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions within the Crypto Market . It doesn’t mean altcoins can’t perform, but the probability of widespread, explosive Altcoin Performance is lower when the index is this low. Comparing Altcoin Performance vs. Bitcoin: The Current Picture The core of the Altcoin Season Index is this direct comparison: how many altcoins are beating Bitcoin over 90 days? With the index at 22, it tells us that roughly only 22% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last three months. This paints a clear picture of where relative strength lies in the market right now. Consider it this way: Metric Condition for Altcoin Season Condition for Bitcoin Season Current Status (Index at 22) % of Top 100 Altcoins Outperforming Bitcoin (Last 90 Days) >= 75% Approx. 22% This table clearly illustrates why the index indicates Bitcoin Season . The vast majority of the largest altcoins have not kept pace with Bitcoin’s price action over the recent past. This isn’t necessarily a judgment on the long-term potential of individual altcoin projects, but it reflects the prevailing short-to-medium term market sentiment and capital flow. Understanding Cryptocurrency Trends: Is This Normal? Observing Cryptocurrency Trends often reveals cyclical patterns. The market rarely moves in a straight line, and periods of Bitcoin dominance are a natural part of these cycles. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes or coincides with a period where altcoins lag behind. Sometimes, this is followed by a phase where profits from Bitcoin are rotated into altcoins, potentially triggering a new Altcoin Season. Several factors can contribute to a shift towards Bitcoin Season : Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainty in traditional markets can sometimes lead investors to favor Bitcoin as a relatively safer, more liquid crypto asset compared to smaller altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional inflows often target Bitcoin first due to its size, liquidity, and established infrastructure (like Bitcoin ETFs). Network Developments: Significant upgrades or events specific to Bitcoin can draw attention and investment. Market Psychology: Strong upward price momentum in Bitcoin can create a fear of missing out (FOMO) effect, pulling capital away from altcoins. Recognizing these Cryptocurrency Trends helps put the current Altcoin Season Index reading into context. It’s a snapshot of the market’s current state, influenced by a confluence of factors. Actionable Insights for the Current Market Given the market is in Bitcoin Season according to the index, what are some things investors might consider? (Note: This is not financial advice, always do your own research). Focus on Bitcoin: If you are bullish on the overall crypto market, concentrating on Bitcoin might align with the current trend indicated by the index. Review Altcoin Holdings: Evaluate the performance of your altcoin portfolio. Are your holdings among the few outperforming Bitcoin, or are they lagging? This might inform decisions about rebalancing. Research Quality Projects: Even in Bitcoin Season, strong altcoin projects with solid fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases can still perform well or present accumulation opportunities at lower prices. Manage Risk: Volatility can still be high. Employ risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses or diversifying within your crypto portfolio (even if that diversification leans towards Bitcoin). Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. A shift back towards a higher reading could signal a potential change in dynamics. Understanding the nuances of Altcoin Performance in different market cycles is key to navigating the crypto landscape effectively. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of the Crypto Market The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 22 is a clear signal that the Crypto Market is currently favoring Bitcoin. This Bitcoin Season means that, for now, Altcoin Performance on average is lagging behind the pioneer cryptocurrency. These Cryptocurrency Trends are part of the market’s natural ebb and flow, influenced by various internal and external factors. While Bitcoin leads, it’s a period for investors to assess their strategies, focus on research, and manage risk, understanding that market conditions can and do change. Staying informed about key indicators like the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable perspective on the prevailing market dynamics.

According to multiple crypto analysts, MUTM is not only undervalued at its current price of $0.03 but also offers the strongest mix of utility, real-world use cases, and early-stage ROI potential. Unlike many of its speculative peers that lack functional products or audited technology, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart with a working protocol, a roadmap to launch, and an engaged user base. What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) different? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that supports both P2P (peer-to-peer) and P2C (peer-to-contract) lending and borrowing models. This dual approach enables unmatched flexibility. While P2C offers stable passive income through pool-based lending, the P2P model gives users the freedom to lend and borrow niche tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Pepe (PEPE)—something that major platforms still don’t support. This feature is especially appealing to memecoin traders who have limited options when it comes to borrowing against or earning yield on their assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) solves this gap while also offering customizable loan terms and dynamic interest rates based on pool utilization. Investors who supply liquidity via stablecoins like DAI can earn passive income through interest, which adjusts according to market conditions. At high pool utilization, the yield can climb to double-digit annual returns. For those focused on capital gains, the math speaks for itself. An investment of $1,000 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at today’s price of $0.03 results in 33,333 tokens. As the token reaches a conservative target of $1, those tokens would be worth over $33,000, marking a 30x return. Even at a $0.75 valuation, that same $1,000 becomes $25,000. These numbers aren’t just hype—they’re based on a realistic view of market cycles and the rising importance of audited, functional DeFi protocols. With over $9.45 million raised so far in Phase 5, demand is increasing rapidly. Investors in early phases have already seen their entries rise by 100% to 200%, as earlier rounds were priced as low as $0.01. Those who wait for later phases risk paying more for smaller upside, making now the most strategic time to get in. CertiK audit validates security Security is another reason analysts are confident in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The protocol has been audited by CertiK, one of the industry’s most respected blockchain security firms. The audit, which includes manual code review and static analysis, returned a Token Scan Score of 70, confirming that Mutuum’s backend is not only legitimate but resilient against known vulnerabilities. Unlike many project tokens that serve little purpose beyond speculative trading, MUTM has direct, ongoing utility within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. Holders gain access to yield tiers and in lending pools that actually shape the future of the protocol. As the platform scales, demand for MUTM will increase not only from speculators but from users who need the token to fully utilize the system’s features. As an added benefit, users who deposit ETH or DAI into the liquidity pools receive mtTokens, which accumulate value in real time. A deposit of $5,000 in DAI into an active pool will generate up to 12% annual interest, depending on utilization. That’s $600 a year in passive income, far outpacing most traditional savings accounts or centralized crypto lending platforms. Growing community and roadmap momentum Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has over 11,650 holders and continues to grow. The team has announced that a beta version of the platform will launch by the time the token goes live, a major milestone that places it far ahead of vaporware projects that spend years in development. Adding to the excitement is an ongoing $100K giveaway, designed to reward the community and attract more users to explore the platform. This marketing push is already increasing visibility and will act as a catalyst for further price appreciation. In simple terms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers what low-cap investors are searching for: security, utility, liquidity, and upside. It enables users to earn real passive income, lends against previously unsupported tokens, and is backed by a functioning, audited protocol. Projects that are this complete and undervalued don’t stay hidden for long. The window for entering below $0.05 is closing fast, and history shows that early-stage investments in working DeFi protocols generate the highest returns. Once MUTM hits exchanges and the beta goes live, a surge in demand will be inevitable. As analysts continue to rate Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the most compelling buy under $0.05, one thing becomes clear: those holding at $0.03 stand to benefit the most when this token crosses $1 and beyond.

News recently broke about a significant development in the fight against crypto crime: a key figure behind a massive Crypto scam South Korea has finally been apprehended after evading authorities for over two years abroad. This arrest shines a spotlight on the ongoing challenges faced by regulators and law enforcement globally in tackling large-scale cryptocurrency fraud. Understanding the Massive Scope of the Korean Crypto Scam So, what exactly happened? According to reports, a criminal group orchestrated a vast Korean crypto scam that defrauded over 15,000 individuals out of a staggering 325.6 billion won, which translates to approximately $236.67 million US dollars. This wasn’t a small operation; it was a highly organized effort that ran from December 2021 to March 2023. Here are the key details of this extensive fraud: Total Amount Scammed: 325.6 billion won ($236.67 million) Number of Victims: 15,304 people Timeline: December 2021 to March 2023 Modus Operandi: Promising impossibly high returns on investments in 28 different cryptocurrencies. This scale of loss highlights the devastating impact such schemes can have on individual investors, many of whom likely invested their savings hoping for financial growth. How Did This Cryptocurrency Investment Fraud Operate? Large-scale frauds like this often rely on classic Ponzi or pyramid scheme tactics, adapted for the crypto age. In this specific Cryptocurrency investment fraud , the criminals allegedly lured victims by making unrealistic promises of significant profits. They claimed these returns would come from trading and issuing 28 different cryptocurrencies. It’s highly probable that these cryptocurrencies were either entirely fake, or the scheme relied on bringing in new investors’ money to pay off earlier investors, creating the illusion of profitability until the scheme inevitably collapsed. Schemes promising guaranteed, high, and fast returns are major red flags in any investment, but especially in the volatile and often complex crypto market. The promise of investing in multiple different coins likely added a layer of perceived legitimacy or complexity, making it harder for average investors to spot the fraud. The Hunt for the Crypto Fraud Arrest Ringleader Following the collapse of the scheme and the filing of complaints, South Korean police launched a prolonged investigation. Identifying and locating the key players in such cross-border crimes is incredibly challenging. The alleged ringleader managed to flee the country and remained on the run overseas for over two years. The recent Crypto fraud arrest of this key figure is a significant victory for law enforcement. It demonstrates perseverance and potentially international cooperation in tracking down individuals who believe they can escape justice by crossing borders. While the original report doesn’t detail the specifics of the capture, it underscores the commitment of authorities to pursuing those responsible for large-scale financial crimes, even when they attempt to hide abroad. What This Crypto Crime Law Enforcement Action Means The arrest of a ringleader in a scam of this magnitude sends a strong message. It signals that South Korean authorities are actively pursuing those who exploit the crypto space for criminal gain. This particular Crypto crime law enforcement action is important for several reasons: Justice for Victims: While recovering lost funds is often difficult in these cases, the arrest brings a measure of justice and accountability for the over 15,000 victims. Deterrence: High-profile arrests can deter others considering similar criminal activities. International Cooperation: Pursuing criminals overseas often requires collaboration between different countries’ law enforcement agencies, highlighting the growing need for such partnerships in the digital age. Focus on Crypto Regulation: Incidents like this add pressure on governments to enhance regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency market to protect investors. This case is a stark reminder that despite the innovative potential of cryptocurrency, the market remains vulnerable to sophisticated fraud, and robust law enforcement is crucial. Protecting Yourself from Cryptocurrency Investment Fraud While law enforcement works to catch criminals, the best defense for investors is education and caution. How can you avoid becoming a victim of Cryptocurrency investment fraud ? Beware of Unrealistic Promises: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns with little to no risk, it’s almost certainly a scam. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t invest based solely on social media hype or unsolicited advice. Research the project, the team, the technology, and the market. Verify Exchange and Platform Legitimacy: Use reputable and regulated exchanges. Be wary of new or unknown platforms.

Following that, CETUS said on Tuesday that it is prepared to return 100% of user funds lost in a $223 million exploit, based on the outcome of a community vote. Now, a recent optimistic update joined this Friday , May 30th, a recent post from CETUS highlighted that within just 48 hours, the Sui community united to pass this critical on-chain decision. As a result of the vote, more than 90% of validators and stakers voted in CETUS’ favour. As a result, now a on-chain governance proposal to move the frozen funds into a multi-sig wallet. The vote is a critical step in Cetus’s recovery plan after a $223 million exploit on May 22 . Further, it outlined an 8-point recovery roadmap for the coming week, which includes the restoration of data, an upgraded CLMM contract, and the full resumption of other functions like LP functions, as they said in an X post. Despite the positive update, its token price has declined following the altcoin market sentiment. Keep reading to know more. Will CETUS Price Recover? With the proposal passed, it has now authorized the recovery of locked funds, enabling full reimbursement to be possible for affected users. The community awaits the beginning of the user refund process. Once completed successfully, it will become a great example of community-led recovery in the DeFi space. However, the response in CETUS crypto price action seen on Tuesday is not mimicked on Friday, not even the slightest surges are seen, despite the great optimism in CETUS. This has happened because the BTC fell to $105K, ETH fell to $2580, and SUI fell to $3.40, signifying market-wide weakness. As a result, the CETUS price has faced rejection from the Fibonacci 0.5 level at $0.16625 and is down nearly 19% to trade at $0.14492. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SlowMist Breaks Down How a Tiny Code Flaw Led to Cetus’ $230M Collapse , If market sentiment continues, then CETUS price could shatter more in the short term and impede its price recovery journey.

Additionally, its followers on X have surged this week after a hefty fall last week, but the weighted sentiment lingers near the zero line at “+0.141” that clearly indicates that positive and negative views are canceling out each other, and no strong directional bias has formed in CETUS price yet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release its key inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, tonight, putting the crypto market on watch for potential turbulence, which is a critical indicator for the Federal Reserve.

However, a recent collaboration aims to simplify this process significantly for users interested in the USD1 stablecoin . Crypto payment gateway Alchemy Pay (ACH) has officially announced a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ), a DeFi project that has garnered attention due to its links to the Trump family. This collaboration marks a significant step towards providing seamless crypto on-ramp access for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , directly addressing one of the major hurdles for mainstream crypto adoption: converting fiat currency into digital assets easily and efficiently. What Does This Alchemy Pay and WLFI Partnership Entail? The core of this partnership revolves around integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s robust payment gateway services with the WLFI ecosystem. Announced via Alchemy Pay ‘s official Medium blog, the collaboration means that users no longer need to navigate potentially complex cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms to acquire USD1 stablecoin . Instead, they can leverage Alchemy Pay ‘s extensive network of supported payment methods to directly purchase USD1 using their preferred fiat currency. For those new to the space, a ‘ crypto on-ramp ‘ is essentially a service that allows individuals to convert their traditional fiat money (like USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) into cryptocurrency. Think of it as the bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto world. Making this bridge as smooth and accessible as possible is crucial for increasing user adoption and liquidity within specific crypto ecosystems like WLFI ‘s. By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s capabilities, WLFI is significantly lowering the barrier to entry for potential users of its USD1 stablecoin and associated DeFi services. This is particularly important for a project seeking wider reach and participation. Why is Seamless Crypto On-Ramp Access Important for USD1 Stablecoin ? Stablecoins like USD1 stablecoin are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They serve multiple purposes within the crypto landscape, including: Store of Value: Offering stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Medium of Exchange: Facilitating quick and low-cost transfers globally. DeFi Participation: Acting as essential building blocks for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols within decentralized finance platforms. However, accessing stablecoins often requires users to first buy a major cryptocurrency (like BTC or ETH) on an exchange and then trade it for the stablecoin. This multi-step process can be intimidating and cumbersome for newcomers. A direct crypto on-ramp solution, powered by a reputable payment gateway like Alchemy Pay , streamlines this process into potentially just a few clicks, making it far more user-friendly. For WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , enhanced accessibility via a direct on-ramp means: Increased liquidity for USD1 . Easier participation in any DeFi protocols or services offered by WLFI that utilize USD1 . A broader potential user base, including those less familiar with traditional crypto exchanges. How Does Alchemy Pay ‘s Payment Gateway Facilitate This? Alchemy Pay operates a comprehensive payment gateway that connects fiat and crypto economies. Its infrastructure supports a wide array of global and local payment methods, making it a versatile tool for businesses and projects looking to integrate crypto payments or on/off-ramps. Key features of Alchemy Pay ‘s payment gateway that benefit the WLFI partnership include: Extensive Payment Method Support: Acceptance of major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), various bank transfer options, and numerous local payment channels specific to different regions. Global Coverage: Ability to process transactions from users in many countries, expanding the potential reach for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin . Compliance and Security: Handling necessary regulatory compliance and security measures for processing fiat-to-crypto transactions. Ease of Integration: Providing tools and APIs that allow partners like WLFI to seamlessly embed the on-ramp service directly into their platforms or websites. This technical capability is what underpins the ‘seamless access’ touted in the announcement. Users interacting with WLFI ‘s platform (or wherever the integration is live) can now initiate a purchase of USD1 stablecoin and complete the transaction using familiar fiat payment methods, all powered by Alchemy Pay ‘s backend. Exploring the WLFI Project and USD1 Stablecoin World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ) is positioned as a DeFi project. While the original announcement highlights its link to the Trump family, the core focus from a technical perspective is its offering, specifically the USD1 stablecoin . Understanding WLFI ‘s broader goals and the intended use cases for USD1 stablecoin provides context for why a seamless crypto on-ramp is a critical piece of infrastructure for them. Typically, DeFi projects aim to recreate traditional financial services (like lending, borrowing, trading) using blockchain technology, often utilizing stablecoins as the primary medium of value exchange due to their price stability. For WLFI , the USD1 stablecoin likely serves as the native stable asset within its specific DeFi ecosystem or planned applications. Making it easy for users to acquire USD1 directly with fiat is essential for driving activity and participation within that ecosystem. The partnership with Alchemy Pay suggests WLFI is prioritizing user accessibility and aiming to onboard users who may be new to DeFi or crypto but are interested in the specific offerings or community around WLFI . Benefits of the Partnership: A Closer Look Let’s break down the tangible benefits this collaboration brings: For WLFI : Access to Alchemy Pay ‘s global payment gateway network instantly expands the potential user base for USD1 stablecoin . It removes technical hurdles for onboarding new users who hold fiat, increasing liquidity and potentially driving adoption of other WLFI services. It positions WLFI as a more accessible DeFi project. For USD1 Stablecoin Users: The primary benefit is convenience. Users can now purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using their local fiat payment methods without needing to use separate exchanges or complex crypto wallets initially. This simplifies the process significantly, saving time and potentially reducing fees associated with multiple transactions. For the Broader Crypto Ecosystem: Partnerships like this contribute to the overall goal of making cryptocurrency and DeFi more accessible to a mainstream audience. By providing user-friendly on-ramps for specific assets like USD1 stablecoin , they help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Actionable Insight: How to Use the New On-Ramp While specific steps may vary slightly depending on where WLFI integrates the service, the general process for users wishing to purchase USD1 stablecoin via the Alchemy Pay payment gateway would typically involve: Visiting the official WLFI platform or a service that has integrated the Alchemy Pay on-ramp. Locating the option to ‘Buy USD1 ‘ or ‘Add Funds’. Selecting Alchemy Pay as the payment provider. Choosing their preferred fiat currency and the amount of USD1 they wish to purchase. Selecting a supported payment method (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer). Completing the required payment and verification steps through Alchemy Pay ‘s secure interface. Receiving the purchased USD1 stablecoin directly into their connected crypto wallet. This streamlined flow is designed to mimic familiar online purchase experiences, reducing friction for users entering the crypto space. The Road Ahead for Alchemy Pay and WLFI This partnership is a clear indication of both Alchemy Pay ‘s continued strategy to expand its payment gateway services across various crypto projects and WLFI ‘s effort to enhance the accessibility of its USD1 stablecoin . As the DeFi space evolves, seamless on-ramps will remain a critical component for attracting and retaining users. The success of this integration will likely be measured by the ease of use reported by users and the increase in accessibility and liquidity for the USD1 stablecoin within the WLFI ecosystem. Partnerships like this highlight the ongoing effort within the crypto industry to build user-friendly infrastructure that connects the traditional financial world with the innovative possibilities of blockchain and DeFi. Conclusion: Bridging Fiat and USD1 Stablecoin with Ease The strategic partnership between Alchemy Pay and WLFI is a significant development for anyone interested in accessing the USD1 stablecoin . By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s versatile payment gateway , WLFI has effectively created a seamless crypto on-ramp , allowing users to purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using a wide range of fiat payment methods. This move not only enhances the accessibility of USD1 but also contributes to lowering the barrier to entry for the WLFI DeFi ecosystem. As the crypto landscape matures, collaborations focused on improving the user experience, particularly at the fiat-to-crypto conversion point, are essential for driving wider adoption. This partnership is a prime example of such an effort, promising a more convenient path for users to acquire USD1 stablecoin and engage with the WLFI project.

That’s what’s unfolding with XRP, which just saw $4 billion leave in 24 hours, and Pi Network (PI), which plummeted after 2 million tokens hit CEXs. Both coins are struggling with momentum. But while traders prepare for more dips, BlockDAG is flipping the script. Instead of just buying low, it’s giving users a way to earn passively. Due to its 25% referral bonus, you don’t need to invest more to increase your holdings. Simply share your link, and you’ll earn 25% of every purchase made through it. No caps, no added cost, just a chance to earn while the market shifts. Right now, you can get in at just $0.0018 per coin. BlockDAG’s 25% Referral Bonus: The Smart Way to Earn While most are focused on price fluctuations, BlockDAG users are cashing in on something entirely different. The current 25% referral bonus allows holders to earn just by sharing their referral link, no additional funds needed. Every time someone makes a BDAG purchase through your link, you pocket 25% of their transaction in BDAG. And for your referrals? They get a 5% bonus too. This isn’t about chasing trends, it’s about earning in a sustainable way without the pressure to time the market. BlockDAG’s presale is currently in Batch 28, with BDAG priced at an attractive $0.0018. But don’t wait too long, the price will rise to $0.0262 after June 13, and a launch price of $0.05 is already set. More than 21.4 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, with over $277 million raised. With more than 200,000 holders and listings coming to major exchanges like MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank, it’s clear that BDAG is gearing up to make its move. Thanks to the 25% referral system, it’s easier than ever to build your position without spending extra. Just share the link, and watch your rewards grow. No caps, no complex rules, just an opportunity for compounding rewards that keep adding up. With BDAG’s “Go Live” event on June 13, now’s the perfect time to jump in before the price starts climbing. XRP Struggles Amid $4B Outflows and Weak Growth XRP is feeling the pressure as over $4 billion exited the market in just 24 hours, pushing its market cap down from $137.5B to $133.39B before a slight rebound. The price is holding steady at $2.31, staying above crucial moving averages, $2.26 (50-day) and $1.91 (200-day). But if the downward trend continues, a drop below $2.26 could push XRP toward $2.00 and even $1.91. However, it’s not all doom and gloom. Analyst Brett Crypto pointed out that XRP has broken free from a 7-year descending triangle, potentially setting up a rise to $4.43. While technicals and strong volume support the idea, short-term sentiment remains uncertain. The sharp 95% decline in new XRP accounts since December highlights a slowdown in network activity. Until that changes, the pressure on XRP may continue, especially as traders keep an eye on whether the $2 support holds. Pi Network Dips 53%, Investors Brace for Potential Losses Pi Network (PI) is grabbing attention after its price plummeted 53% from its monthly high, dropping to $0.7752. The sharp fall followed over 2 million tokens being sent to exchanges in just 24 hours, creating sell pressure across platforms like OKX, Bitget, and Pionex. This pushed PI below its 50 EMA at $0.7910, signalling a bearish breakdown. If it falls below $0.6584, the next stop could be $0.5545, a drop of nearly 30%. Things could get even tougher, with over 72 million tokens unlocking in the coming days and 280 million more expected next month. If demand doesn’t pick up, PI could see further declines. Right now, the sudden drop is raising concerns about shaken investor confidence. Until we see a reversal in exchange outflows, the selling pressure will likely persist. Resistance is at $0.8600, but buyers will need more to stop this momentum. Final Thoughts XRP is facing mounting pressure as $4 billion in capital has flowed out, coupled with weak network growth. While the long-term outlook suggests it could hit $4.43, short-term dips below $2.26 could lead to further losses. At the same time, Pi Network (PI) has seen a sharp decline, dropping over 53%, with major risks from token unlocks and exchange inflows. As a result, many are shifting focus to BlockDAG, a crypto project offering more than just speculation. With its 25% referral system, you don’t need to buy more to earn more. Just share your referral code and get 25% in BDAG every time someone makes a purchase. The presale price of $0.0018 is locked until June 13, with a confirmed launch price of $0.05. Plus, with a 5% bonus for your referrals, BlockDAG is giving users an easy way to earn while others focus on the volatility. For many, it’s looking like the smarter move.

With Bitcoin recently tumbling from its lofty $106K perch and a sea of red washing over most altcoins in the last 24 hours, ‘crypto crashing’ is a trending search term, and for good reason. Investors are understandably on edge, asking the crucial question: Is this a temporary blip, a correction after a strong run, or are we staring down the barrel of a more significant downturn? Navigating the turbulent waters can be daunting. However, periods of market fear can also present unique, albeit high-risk, opportunities. For the daring investor, the meme coin sector, known for its explosive potential (and equally dramatic nosedives), might be of interest. Some traders will be eyeing specific meme coins, wondering if the current dip offers a discounted entry point. If this dip is just a market correction, the real question becomes: which meme coins are built to survive the storm and thrive when the skies clear? From seasoned tokens with staying power to buzzy newcomers making serious noise, the hunt is on for meme coins that can hold their ground and deliver when the rebound hits. And don’t sleep on the best presales either. Projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) are revving up for launch with real momentum, and could reward early believers with serious upside. In a market like this, timing is everything, and catching the next breakout project before the crowd does could make all the difference. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff, Snipe, Succeed. Master Meme Coin Trading In Telegram. If you’re tired of missing out on the next big meme coin, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is your new secret weapon. Helping you navigate crypto-trading from the convenience of your Telegram app, $SNORT will help you sniff out those early, under-the-radar gems before they hit the mainstream. The integrated Snorter Bot is about to become your Swiss Army knife, giving you all the tools you need to identify promising coins with speed and precision. $SNORT powers a trading experience built for rapid execution, leveraging the low fees and high speeds of chains like Solana. Holding $SNORT tokens can further enhance your edge, offering potential benefits like reduced trading fees within the bot. You can buy $SNORT now for $0.0935, and it’s raised an impressive $246K already. If you stake during the presale, you can expect rewards of up to 1215%. By combining intelligent discovery tools with a powerful trading bot and token holder benefits, $SNORT has the chops to level the playing field and potentially come in strong despite the recent market red. 2. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW) – Solana’s Feline Fury, Challenging the Meme Coin Pack. Some investors see red as a challenge to find the coins that fight back. Enter Cat In a Dog’s World ($MEW) , the feisty alternative to the crowded dog-themed crypto market. Built on the high-speed, low-fee Solana blockchain, $MEW isn’t just another cute face in the meme coin crowd. It embodies a rebellious spirit, playfully ready to claw its way into the territory dominated by the likes of Dogecoin. This feline fury is all about carving a unique niche, backed by a rapidly growing community captivated by its disruption and the technical advantages of its Solana foundation. You can buy $MEW for $0.003362 on Kraken . Coins like $MEW, with distinct branding and passionate followings ( 137K+ followers on X , and 25K+ subscribers on Telegram ), offer resilience, and its clear underdog (or rather undercat) appeal, could make it an intriguing addition for those looking for high-potential plays during market uncertainty. 3. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin Rewards & Token Burns. Multiply Your Bull Run. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is an innovative way to align with $BTC’s potential long-term success. This isn’t just another meme coin. It directly rewards its holders with actual $BTC as the flagship crypto achieves key price milestones. Hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets) to receive your rewards. Furthermore, $BTCBULL incorporates a strategic token burn mechanism, reducing its supply as $BTC climbs, thereby enhancing scarcity and value for its community. While the current market might be red, savvy investors understand that volatility is part and parcel of crypto. Many adopt longer-term perspectives, focusing on foundational assets. $BTC in particular continues to see positive signals in the evolving regulatory discussion, cementing itself as a cornerstone of the digital asset space that isn’t going anywhere. You can snap up $BTCBULL for $0.00254 with 63% staking rewards. We see $BTCBULL going the distance and predict it will reach $0.06467 by the end of 2025, a 2446.06% increase on today’s presale price. For those who believe in $BTC’s enduring trajectory, $BTCBULL offers a unique proposition: a chance to not only ride the wave of the eventual bull run but potentially multiply those gains through its distinct rewards. 4. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) – No Hype, No Stress. Just Good Vibes on The Blockchain. Okay, yes, the market is generally red at the moment, but take a leaf from the playbook of Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) and relax. $CHILL isn’t about chasing fleeting pumps or navigating complexity; it’s cultivated around the simple ethos of providing a relaxed, community-centric space in the often frenetic meme coin universe. The core idea is to build a token where the community can keep calm, fostering a sense of stability and shared patience. The market red can be taxing, but this is where a project like $CHILL might find its unique appeal. It’s a coin that offers a different kind of value, one centred around a low-pressure vibe. If you’re looking for a project less frantic about speculation and more about shared long-term beliefs in a simple concept and its collective, the $CHILL philosophy could be your proposition. $CHILL is available for $0.07465 on decentralized exchanges. In times of uncertainty, the strength of a calm, committed community can be a strong signal, suggesting that sometimes the most chill approach is the one that endures. Red Sea Opportunities: Investing Wisely When Markets Dip A market downturn can reveal unique opportunities for investors. While creating uncertainty, projects in the meme coin sector, like the utility-focused $SNORT or the $BTC rewarding $BTCBULL , aim to offer distinct propositions, even in challenging times. At any time, but even more so in the red, always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose.",Cryptocurrency Market News|Meme coins,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-05-30 12:01:27

The total market capitalization of the industry has fallen by 3.81%, now standing at $3.3 trillion. This sharp downturn was triggered by widespread trader liquidations totaling $712.76 million. Notably, long positions comprised $644.84 million. XRP suffered $29.68 million worth of liquidations, with a staggering $29.26 million coming from longs and only $419.93k from shorts. This outsized ratio reflects overleveraged bullish bets and subsequent panic exits. In this XRP price analysis, we explore where the token could be headed amidst the downturn of events. Whale Activity Surges Amid Price Drop? The exchange outflow chart by CryptoQuant shows a significant uptick in XRP movements today, i.e, on May 30, with over 330 million XRP exiting in various bands. Notably in the 1 M+ XRP category (light blue), followed by 100k–1M XRP (purple) and 10k–100k XRP (green). This spike in outflows typically suggests that whales are moving assets off centralized exchanges, possibly toward cold storage or alternate platforms, often a bullish signal long-term. However, given the price decline, this may also signal precautionary withdrawals amid market uncertainty. In the short term, reduced exchange supply may ease selling pressure, potentially aiding in price recovery. Ripple XRP Price Analysis: XRP price today is at $2.19, marking a 4.38% drop in the past 24 hours and a 10.52% fall over the week. Its market cap has contracted to $128.72 billion, down 4.36%, despite a sharp rise in 24-hour trading volume to $3.49 billion, up 32.74%. This surge in volume amid a price drop reflects liquidation activity. On the price chart, XRP is trading close to its 24-hour low of $2.18, with resistance overhead at $2.26. If bulls manage to reclaim this level, XRP could rebound toward the $2.4 to $2.5 range. However, continued rejection at this resistance could drive the price back to the key support zone at $2.0145. Also read our Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term price targets! FAQs Why did XRP’s price drop despite increased volume? The rise in volume is likely driven by panic selling and liquidations rather than buying interest, which has contributed to the price decline. What does the large exchange outflow on May 30 mean for XRP? It indicates significant whale movement, possibly for long-term holding or strategic repositioning, which could reduce sell pressure on exchanges short term. How much is 1 XRP right now?

Ondo price could reach a high of $0.80 to $2.05. With a potential surge, Ondo crypto price may hit $9.30 by 2030. After an impressive surge that saw the ONDO price reach $1.10 before retreating to $0.91, investors are now closely eyeing its future potential. In Q2 2025 alone, ONDO gained 70% from its lows of $0.66, and despite a recent cooldown, it’s still holding onto gains of over 40%. With such resilience, ONDO price prediction 2025 has become a hot topic among analysts and retail investors alike, especially as the token continues to build credibility and momentum through high-profile developments. With more than $250 million in TVL and growing institutional interest, ONDO has solidified itself as a major player in the Real World Asset (RWA) space . But how far can it go from here? Let’s dive into the detailed ONDO price forecast from 2025 to 2030. Table of contents Ondo Price Today Ondo Price Prediction 2025 ONDO Cryptocurrency Price Target 2026 – 2030 Ondo Coin Future Forecast 2026 Ondo Token Price Prediction 2027 ONDO Price Prediction Next Bullrun 2028 Ondo Price Forecast Long-term 2029 ONDO Coin Price Growth Potential 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Ondo Price Targets FAQs Ondo Price Today Cryptocurrency Ondo Token ONDO Price $ 0.86097660 -7.94% Market cap $ 2,719,917,646.9603 Circulating Supply 3,159,107,529.00 Trading Volume $ 182,023,481.7483 All-time high $2.14 on 16th December 2024 All-time low $0.08355 on 18th January 2024 Ondo Price Prediction 2025 Analyzing the daily chart reveals a fascinating price action for ONDO, especially following its recent Q2 surge. Experts were anticipating that this altcoin could gain significant traction and potentially break the crucial $1 mark, which coincides with a strong supply level. As institutional collaborations increase, retail adoption appears to be on the rise as well. Also, external factors, such as Bitcoin’s ascent beyond $100K , have contributed to a positive trend in the crypto sector. However, after mid-May, the optimism turned pessimistic when supply at $1 pushed the ONDO price back below the 200-day EMA band . The uptrend observed in Q2 has come to an end, as the price broke through a multi-day support trendline and faced strong resistance from the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. Geopolitical uncertainties have also resurfaced, particularly following recent tensions between the European Union and Trump , leading to a temporary pause until early June. Moreover, over the past few months price action, Q2’s momentum seemed to indicate a breakout from a falling wedge pattern that had formed since December 2024. However, ONDO crypto’s dip below the $0.87521 level has invalidated this pattern, for now. If the price rebounds, the uptrend can only be confirmed by first overcoming the 200-day EMA. Should that happen, a target of $1.20 could be within reach, with the potential to retest $2.05 by year-end. Conversely, with a bearish reversal and ongoing market uncertainty, the ONDO price may decline. If the $0.80 support level is breached, it could fall to $0.66.

After enjoying an impressive run of 11 consecutive trading days with net inflows, these popular investment vehicles experienced a significant shift on May 29th, recording substantial Bitcoin ETF outflows . This sudden reversal has naturally sparked discussions across the crypto market , prompting investors and analysts alike to assess the potential implications for the Bitcoin price and the broader landscape of institutional investment in digital assets. What Happened with US Spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 29? According to data shared by market observer Trader T (@thepfund) on X, May 29th saw a combined net outflow of $347 million from US spot Bitcoin ETFs . This figure represents a clear break from the recent streak of positive inflows that had characterized the market for nearly two weeks. The outflows were spread across several prominent funds, indicating a broad, albeit uneven, movement of capital out of these products. Here’s a breakdown of the funds that saw net outflows: Fidelity’s FBTC: $166.32 million Grayscale’s GBTC: $107.53 million ARK Invest’s ARKB: $89.22 million Bitwise’s BITB: $70.85 million Invesco’s BTCO: $20.05 million VanEck’s HODL: $11.98 million Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: $6.13 million Cumulatively, these seven ETFs accounted for the vast majority of the day’s net negative flow. Who Bucked the Trend Amidst the Bitcoin ETF Outflows? In contrast to the widespread outflows, only one of the actively trading US spot Bitcoin ETFs managed to attract net inflows on May 29th. BlackRock’s IBIT, often a strong performer in terms of inflows, recorded a net positive flow of $125.22 million for the day. This highlights that while there was a general movement towards exiting positions, some funds continued to see buying interest. Other ETFs in the market reported no changes in their holdings, meaning they experienced neither significant inflows nor outflows on that particular day. Understanding the Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Crypto Market Net flows into or out of US spot Bitcoin ETFs are closely watched metrics by investors and analysts. These flows are often seen as a proxy for the level of institutional investment and broader investor sentiment towards Bitcoin. Significant outflows can sometimes exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price , as ETF issuers may need to sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemptions. While a single day of outflows, even a substantial one like $347 million, doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term reversal, it does serve as a reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto market . The recent 11-day inflow streak had contributed to positive sentiment and potentially supported Bitcoin’s price rally towards the $70,000 mark. A sudden outflow event can temper that enthusiasm and lead to price consolidation or a minor pullback. Potential reasons for the outflows could include: Profit-Taking: After a period of positive price action, some investors might be taking profits on their ETF holdings. Market Rotation: Capital might be rotating into other assets or sectors, either within crypto or traditional finance. Macroeconomic Factors: Shifts in global economic outlook, interest rate expectations, or other macro news could influence investor risk appetite. Specific Fund Dynamics: Outflows from a fund like GBTC can sometimes be related to its specific structure or investor base dynamics. The event underscores the interconnectedness between traditional financial products like ETFs and the underlying digital asset market. Monitoring these flows provides valuable insight into the ebb and flow of institutional investment . Why Did Institutional Investment See a Pullback? The primary investors in US spot Bitcoin ETFs are often considered to be institutional players and sophisticated retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin. The sudden shift from consistent inflows to significant outflows suggests a collective decision by a portion of this investor base to reduce their exposure. While the exact motivations are multifaceted and difficult to pinpoint definitively for every investor, the overall trend indicates a temporary pause or reversal in the recent bullish sentiment among some institutional participants. It’s crucial to remember that institutional investment isn’t monolithic; different firms and individuals have varying strategies, time horizons, and risk tolerances. Understanding the drivers behind these shifts is key to navigating the crypto market . While ETFs offer a regulated pathway for institutional investment , they also tie the performance and flows of Bitcoin more closely to traditional financial market dynamics and sentiment. Key Takeaways from the Outflow Event This recent development offers several important insights for anyone interested in US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the broader crypto market : Volatility Remains: Even with increasing institutional adoption, the market for Bitcoin and related products remains volatile and subject to rapid sentiment shifts. Flows are Crucial: ETF flow data provides a real-time pulse on institutional interest and can influence short-term price action. Not a Unanimous Trend: While many funds saw outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract inflows, showing varied strategies among investors. Context is King: A single day’s data point should be viewed in the context of longer-term trends and broader market conditions. For investors, monitoring these flows alongside other fundamental and technical indicators is essential for making informed decisions regarding their exposure to Bitcoin and the crypto market . Conclusion: Navigating the Dynamic World of Bitcoin ETFs The $347 million in net outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 29th marked a notable pause in the recent positive momentum. This event, ending an 11-day streak of inflows, highlights the dynamic nature of the market and the factors influencing institutional investment . While several funds experienced significant Bitcoin ETF outflows , BlackRock’s IBIT managed to attract inflows, showcasing varied investor behavior. This shift serves as a reminder that the path for the Bitcoin price and the overall crypto market is rarely a straight line, and staying informed about these key indicators is vital for navigating the landscape effectively.

He suggested that a phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping might be needed to revive the process. The negotiations had shown promise during earlier meetings in Geneva, where both sides agreed to reduce tariffs for 90 days. However, little follow-up progress has been made. As part of the temporary truce, the US agreed to drop tariffs on Chinese goods to 30%, while China lowered its own to 10%. China also pledged to suspend certain non-tariff barriers, but gave no specifics. Despite establishing a framework for continued economic dialogue, there have been few updates or public signs of ongoing cooperation . Instead, the US has escalated pressure by restricting the sale of AI chips and semiconductor design software to Chinese firms, including Huawei. Bessent expressed optimism that once President Trump shares his intentions directly, China might return to the negotiating table , thanks to the reportedly strong relationship between the two leaders. Meanwhile, Chinese officials have avoided commenting on recent US remarks, and analysts in Beijing suggest they are preparing for a prolonged standoff.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-30 12:10:20

The firm’s recently acquired prime brokerage platform, Hidden Road, has launched a crypto over-the-counter (OTC) service for institutions in the U.S. According to an official release from Hidden Road, the brokerage will enable U.S. institutional clients to settle OTC swaps across leading cryptocurrencies with cash. Hidden Road to Service U.S. Institutions Institutions often use OTC trades to execute large transactions privately rather than on exchanges. This is to prevent huge price swings on open markets. Hidden Road said its Financial Conduct Authority-regulated United Kingdom arm, Hidden Road Partners CIV UK Ltd., will handle the operations of the new OTC Swaps product alongside several crypto cross-margining and financing services. Michael Higgins, International CEO and Global Head of Corporate Development for Hidden Road, said: “The United States digital asset market has long been under-served from a product standpoint. While OTC swaps represent a significant portion of digital asset trading volumes globally, until now, they were largely unavailable to U.S. institutions. With the launch of our swap prime brokerage capabilities for the United States market, we can provide clients with access to an expanded range of products and solutions.” Ripple’s Strategic Move The latest announcement comes less than two months after Ripple acquired Hidden Road for $1.5 billion. Although the deal is expected to close in the coming months, Ripple, with its significant balance sheet, is supporting Hidden Road to expand its capacity and services. The brokerage firm aims to become one of the largest non-bank prime brokers worldwide. While news of Ripple’s $1.25 billion play made the rounds early last month, CryptoPotato reported that the move was beyond a corporate deal. It was more about creating a pipeline for institutional flows into the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the network’s native asset, XRP. Further explanation by market experts revealed that the deal would enable Ripple to expand the XRP ecosystem from handling just retail remittances and enterprise payments to institutional treasury flows and liquidity management. With Hidden Road, which processes at least $3 trillion in volume yearly for more than 300 top market makers, hedge funds, and trading firms globally, Ripple is well on its way to evolving its payment ecosystem .

According to data from CoinGlass, this broke a 10-day inflow streak across all 11 ETFs , with the last similar pullback occurring on May 13. This outflow also marks the largest single-day capital flight since March 11, when investors pulled $396 million from the funds. The sharp outflow followed a drop in Bitcoin’s price, which fell over 3.5% during the day. The world’s largest cryptocurrency slid from an intraday high of $108,850 to briefly dip below the $105,000 mark. The pullback in price appears to have triggered significant selling activity, especially among institutional ETF holders. Fidelity and Grayscale Lead the Exodus The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) bore the brunt of the outflows, losing $166 million in a single day. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed with a $107.5 million outflow. Other notable exits included funds managed by Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Meanwhile, CoinShares, WisdomTree, and Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin trust reported no flows for the day. Despite the general downtrend, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract capital , recording $125 million in net inflows. The fund has now notched up 34 consecutive days of inflows, having last seen a redemption on April 9. Over the past two weeks alone, IBIT has brought in nearly $4 billion, pushing its total net inflows to $49 billion and assets under management beyond the $70 billion mark. Ethereum ETFs Attract Capital Amid Bitcoin Outflows Interestingly, spot Ethereum ETFs defied the bearish trend affecting Bitcoin products. On the same day, they collectively logged $92 million in net inflows, extending their own 10-day inflow streak. The last day of outflows for these funds was May 15. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was once again the front-runner, bringing in just over $50 million in new capital. The fund has now accumulated $4.5 billion in inflows since its launch in July 2024. Commenting on the broader outlook, ETF Store President Nate Geraci highlighted a significant capital rotation, noting that while more than $9 billion has flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past five weeks, gold ETFs have lost nearly $3 billion in the same timeframe. He also pointed to recent SEC clarity on staking, calling it a major step forward for Ethereum ETF products.

Some analysts see the recovery as a sign of a possible continued rally towards the $3,000 level. The price of Ethereum opened at $2,788 yesterday before falling sharply to $2,557, down about 6%. However, the asset later rose to $2,621.66, signaling renewed buying pressure and a possible change in sentiment. The sharp sell-off was accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting that both retail and institutional investors actively participated during the decline. Such increases in volume during pullbacks are often a precursor to strong recoveries when investor confidence returns, analysts said. The day’s price action reached a high of $2,642.84 before the session closed, indicating continued price fluctuations and a volatile trend that could continue in the short term. Technical analysis highlights short-term support at $2,570, which has held steady despite heavy selling. The rapid recovery from this area has cemented its importance as a key level to watch in the coming days. Market watchers are optimistic about Ethereum’s medium-term prospects, citing factors such as rising institutional interest and ongoing upgrades to the Ethereum network (including scalability improvements and Layer 2 adoption) as the main drivers of a potential move towards the $3,000 threshold. While the market remains sensitive to both general macro and cryptocurrency-specific developments, Ethereum’s ability to recover from sharp losses is considered a positive signal in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

If you’re curious about Decentraland’s future and wondering whether MANA is a good investment, this MANA price prediction 2025–2030 will walk you through its potential growth and long-term outlook Table of contents Story Highlights Overview CoinPedia’s Decentraland Price Prediction MANA Price Prediction 2025 Decentraland Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Decentraland Price Prediction 2026 Decentraland Price Prediction 2027 Decentraland Price Prediction 2028 Decentraland Price Prediction 2029 MANA Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Factors Affecting The Price Of MANA Token Historical Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Decentraland Token MANA Price $ 0.27575927 -11.07% Market Cap $ 543,171,032.8595 Circulating Supply 1,969,729,010.3688 Trading Volume $ 60,241,592.9883 All-time High $5.90 on 25th November 2021 All-time Low $0.00788 on 14th October 2017 CoinPedia’s Decentraland Price Prediction As per the formulated price prediction, the MANA crypto price could hit a potential high of $1.05 in 2025. This could be possible if the project seeks assistance from developments and collaborations. In contrast, factors like a prolonged bear run could spiral the price down to $0.42. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.42 $0.73 $1.05 MANA Price Prediction 2025 Decentraland’s price has faced significant challenges, plummeting to $0.1903 on April 6, 2025. However, it managed to recover, doubling to $0.3935 by mid-May. Unfortunately, the rest of May saw a decline, erasing over 50% of the gains made in Q2 2025. As of now, Decentraland price sits below all major EMA bands but is resting on a strong support zone. If this support is breached again, similar to what happened in April, concerns about a drop back to the $0.1903 low could become a reality. On the other hand, if the price bounces back from this support, reaching $0.5612 by the end of June is within a possibility. A more ambitious target of $1.10 could also be on the horizon by the end of 2025, provided a strong bullish momentum returns, like the surge seen in Q4 2024. Still, market participants are likely wondering, “What does the future hold for the MANA price?” To answer this, examining its multi-year chart is crucial. Since the FTX crash in 2021 , MANA has fallen from a high of over $5.91. This long-term activity illustrates its range during both bull and bear markets, which now appears to be a consolidation phase compared to its 2021 peak. In 2025, MANA is at its lowest point, down 95% from its all-time high. If a revival occurs and MANA manages to clear the $1.10 mark by the end of the 2025, it could signal the beginning of a true bullish era for this cryptocurrency.

The very high Tariffs I imposed have made it nearly impossible for China to TRADE into the United States market, which is by far the number one market in the World.

45287712,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=737774,1748607560,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45287712.jpeg,US Treasury yields set for monthly loss as markets wait on key Fed inflation data,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/treasurys-steady-on-key-fed-inflation-data/,"Treasury yields stayed still on Friday while traders waited on fresh inflation figures and followed President Donald Trump’s ongoing legal push to keep his reciprocal tariffs alive. The numbers barely moved — the 30-year yield ticked up by less than a basis point to 4.927%, while the 10-year yield sat flat at 4.422%, and the 2-year held at 3.939%. But the lack of movement doesn’t mean the market’s calm. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday sided with the White House, agreeing to freeze a ruling from a lower trade court that had overturned the reciprocal tariffs, which first kicked in back in April. That legal win came just hours before the Trump administration told the court it would go to the Supreme Court if the pause wasn’t granted. Trump pushes tariffs, market waits for Fed Trump’s team isn’t stopping with the courts. Officials are also working on a backup — using a section of the Trade Act of 1974 to roll out temporary tariffs up to 15% for as long as 150 days, The Wall Street Journal reported. That plan alone has added a new layer of stress to a market already dealing with inflation risk, weak data, and deficit fears. And all of it is happening as Wall Street watches for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Federal Reserve’s top inflation metric, which dropped Friday morning. Traders want a clear sign that spending and inflation are slowing, something that could boost the case for rate cuts later this year. Current pricing suggests around 50 basis points in cuts are expected by December. But until then, Treasuries are heading toward their worst monthly performance this year. A Bloomberg bond index tracking US government debt fell 1.2% in May, as bond prices slipped and yields rose across all maturities. It’s the third straight monthly climb for the 30-year yield — the longest since 2023. The 2-year and 10-year also posted their first monthly increases of 2025. Investors are blaming Trump’s chaotic fiscal plans, especially his push for new tax cuts without offering a clear way to shrink the budget deficit. Bond traders brace for long-term Treasury risks Despite the broader selloff, buyers came back in this week as yields stayed high and weak data made Treasuries more attractive. That relief may last if the PCE report and other numbers suggest slower growth. If that happens, the short end of the yield curve (particularly the 2-year) could rally hard. But the long end is still under pressure, thanks to the ballooning global supply of low-risk assets. Over at Goldman Sachs, John Waldron said that investors are more spooked by US debt levels than by tariffs right now. He warned that the underlying fear is whether there will be enough demand to absorb all the bonds Washington keeps issuing. At Citigroup, Dirk Willer and his team think the term premium — the extra payment buyers demand for holding long-term bonds — is likely to rise another 50 basis points over the next year. It already hit a 10-year high earlier this month, showing the growing discomfort with locking in money for the long haul. Henry Neville, a portfolio manager at Man Group, has been tracking how far real-world yields on the 10-year diverge from what’s considered their fair value. That gap has shrunk a lot. Since 2020, the average spread has been about 150 basis points, the narrowest in any decade since the 1960s. And between May 2023 and July 2024, the gap stayed under 100 basis points for 15 months straight, a record-setting streak. “Persistent readings below 100 are for me the key tell that the dollar and dollar assets may be losing their luster,” Henry wrote in a note on Friday. If that trend holds, domestic buyers will have to pick up the slack as foreign interest cools. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Aimed squarely at supercharging development and adoption, this initiative could reshape how resources are allocated within the network. Let’s dive into the details of the Stacks Ecosystem Funding proposal, known as SIP-031, and what it means for the future of Bitcoin Layer-2. What is the Stacks SIP-031 Proposal? Published on May 27th on the Stacks forum, SIP-031 is a comprehensive plan designed to create a dedicated STX ecosystem endowment. Think of it as a centralized fund specifically purposed to fuel growth, innovation, and infrastructure within the Stacks network. The proposal outlines a multi-pronged approach to building this treasury, primarily through transfers from existing entities within the ecosystem and, notably, through a temporary adjustment to the network’s token economics. How Will the Crypto Endowment Be Funded? Understanding STX Token Emissions The proposed endowment wouldn’t appear out of thin air. SIP-031 details two primary funding mechanisms: Transfers from Existing Entities: This involves consolidating resources currently held by various foundations or groups associated with the Stacks ecosystem into the new endowment. Increased STX Token Emissions: This is perhaps the most discussed aspect. The proposal calls for a temporary increase in the annual issuance of STX tokens over the next five years. Currently, the annual STX emission rate is around 3.52%. SIP-031 suggests raising this average rate to approximately 5.75% for this defined period. It’s crucial to understand that this is proposed as a temporary measure to quickly capitalize the endowment, with emissions expected to return to baseline levels thereafter. This adjustment to STX Token Emissions is central to the plan’s ambition. This strategic increase in token emissions is designed to provide the endowment with substantial capital upfront, enabling it to make significant investments in the ecosystem’s future. Why is This Stacks Ecosystem Funding Initiative Necessary? Addressing Key Challenges The proposal doesn’t just appear randomly; it’s a direct response to identified challenges hindering the Stacks ecosystem’s full potential. The authors of SIP-031 highlight several critical issues: Underfunding Relative to Competitors: Despite its unique position as a Bitcoin layer, Stacks has faced challenges in securing comparable levels of funding and resources seen in other layer-1 or layer-2 ecosystems. This limits its ability to compete effectively for talent and projects. Operational Fragmentation: Resources and initiatives are currently spread across various entities, leading to potential inefficiencies and lack of coordinated effort. A consolidated endowment aims to streamline this. Limited Access to Growth Tools: Developers and projects within Stacks sometimes lack access to the sophisticated tools, grants, and support structures available in better-funded ecosystems. Insufficient Resources for Developers: Attracting and retaining top-tier developers requires competitive grants, bounties, and infrastructure support, areas where the ecosystem needs strengthening. By creating a robust Stacks Ecosystem Funding mechanism, the proposal seeks to directly tackle these hurdles, providing the necessary capital and structure to accelerate development. What are the Potential Benefits for Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth? A well-funded and strategically managed endowment could unlock significant potential for Stacks and, by extension, contribute substantially to overall Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth . The benefits could include: Faster Development Cycles: Increased funding can support core protocol development, tooling, and infrastructure improvements at a much quicker pace. Attracting Top Talent: Competitive grants and bounties can incentivize developers and researchers to build on Stacks. Supporting Key Projects: The endowment can provide crucial funding for promising dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms building on Stacks. Enhanced Marketing and Adoption Efforts: Resources can be allocated to educational initiatives, marketing campaigns, and partnerships to drive user adoption. Improved Ecosystem Coordination: A central fund can help align various ecosystem participants towards common goals. Ultimately, the success of this endowment could solidify Stacks’ position as a leading platform for innovation on Bitcoin. What Happens Next with the Stacks SIP-031 Proposal? Proposals in decentralized ecosystems like Stacks follow a specific process to ensure community consensus. For Stacks SIP-031 , the next steps are clearly defined: Community Feedback: The proposal is currently open for discussion on the Stacks forum, allowing anyone in the community to provide input, raise concerns, and suggest modifications. This feedback phase is crucial for refining the proposal. Committee Setup: A dedicated committee will likely be formed to review the feedback, potentially revise the proposal, and prepare it for a formal vote. Voting: The final decision rests with the STX token holders, who will vote on whether to approve or reject the proposal. The outcome of this vote will determine if the STX ecosystem endowment becomes a reality. This community-driven process ensures that significant changes like adjusting STX Token Emissions and establishing a large Crypto Endowment are made with the broad support of the network’s participants. Considering the Implications: Risks and Rewards While the potential benefits for Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth are substantial, it’s also important to consider potential downsides. The temporary increase in STX Token Emissions , for instance, could lead to short-term inflationary pressure, although the long-term benefits of a well-funded ecosystem are argued to outweigh this. Governance of the endowment will also be critical to ensure funds are allocated transparently and effectively for the benefit of the entire Stacks community. The success of this Stacks Ecosystem Funding initiative hinges on careful planning, transparent execution, and continued community oversight. Summary: A Bold Step for Stacks The SIP-031 proposal represents a bold and ambitious plan to address critical funding and coordination challenges within the Stacks ecosystem. By proposing the creation of a significant Crypto Endowment , funded in part through a temporary adjustment to STX Token Emissions and consolidation of existing resources, Stacks aims to accelerate Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth and development. The path forward involves crucial community discussion and ultimately, a vote by STX holders on the future of Stacks Ecosystem Funding . This process highlights the decentralized nature of the network and the importance of community participation in shaping its destiny.

The main factor driving the surge appears to be support from a leading cryptocurrency exchange. The Top Performers Despite the overall pullback of the cryptocurrency market in the past 24 hours, some lesser-known altcoins defied the negative trend by recording substantial gains. Two of the best performers today (May 30) include Pocket Network (POKT) and Livepeer (LPT). The price of the former has exploded by a whopping 350% on a daily scale , currently trading at roughly $0.058 ( per CoinGecko’s data). This is the highest mark observed since December last year, while POKT’s market capitalization surged past $100 million. POKT Price, Source: CoinGecko For its part, LPT soared by over 80% within the timeframe. As of this writing, its valuation stands at a four-month high of around $10.17, with a market cap of more than $420 million. LPT Price, Source: CoinGecko The most obvious factor driving the price increase is the latest announcement from Upbit. The leading Korean crypto exchange allowed trading services with the assets, listing the LPT/KRW, LPT/USDT, and POKT/KRW pairs. Pocket Network (POKT) is a US-based decentralized infrastructure protocol that provides RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services for dApp s . It is composed of full nodes that hold blockchain data and are rewarded with tokens for fulfilling requests. Livepeer (LPT) is also headquartered in the States. It is a decentralized video streaming network built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide an accessible, scalable alternative to traditional services like AWS or YouTube’s backend. Its main focus is on video transcoding, which is the process of converting raw video files into formats suitable for different devices. Upbit’s Previous Influence This isn’t the first time the prices of certain cryptocurrencies have headed north following support from the Korean platform. In February, the company enabled users to trade the TRUMP/KRW, TRUMP/BTC, and TRUMP/USDT, which resulted in a significant rally for the meme coin associated with the American president. A few months later, Upbit and Binance showed support for DeepBook (DEEP), listing the trading pairs DEEP/KRW and DEEP/USDT, respectively. The asset’s valuation jumped by double digits following the disclosures.

In a move that stunned both skeptics and supporters, the SEC has officially clarified that PoS staking, when conducted by individuals or decentralized protocols, does not constitute a securities transaction. This long-awaited guidance could reshape the American crypto landscape, unlocking new opportunities for both retail and institutional players. For years, the SEC’s ambiguous stance on staking cast a shadow over U.S. DeFi innovation. In 2023 and 2024, high-profile enforcement actions against exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase rattled the industry. Regulators argued that pooled staking services might violate securities laws, leading to multi-million dollar settlements and the delisting of staking products for American users. The chilling effect was immediate: U.S. participation in on-chain staking plummeted, and ETF issuers shelved plans to offer staking rewards. But the new guidance, released in May 2025, marks a dramatic policy reversal. According to the SEC’s statement, “When an individual or decentralized protocol participates in Proof-of-Stake consensus and receives rewards, such activity does not, in itself, constitute an investment contract or securities transaction under the Howey Test.” The agency emphasized that this applies to direct, non-custodial staking, while centralized, pooled staking programs may still be subject to additional scrutiny. “This is a watershed moment for U.S. crypto. The SEC finally admits what we’ve argued for years: staking is not a security!” — @jchervinsky (Jake Chervinsky, crypto policy expert), May 29, 2025 What Changes for Retail Stakers? We spoke with U.S. tax attorney Lisa Bragg, who explained: “For retail investors, this means you can stake ETH, SOL, or other PoS assets directly from your wallet without worrying about violating securities laws. The main tax treatment — staking rewards as ordinary income remains, but the regulatory risk is gone. Expect a surge in U.S. on-chain participation this quarter.” ETF issuers are also celebrating. BlackRock and Fidelity, both of whom have filed for spot ETH ETFs with staking features, can now move forward without fear of SEC pushback. “We expect to see staking rewards added to ETF products before year-end,” said ETF analyst Nate Geraci on X. “SEC’s staking clarification clears the path for ETH ETFs with yield. U.S. DeFi just got a green light!” — @NateGeraci, May 29, 2025 Ripple Effects: DeFi, Exchanges, and Global Markets The SEC’s move is expected to reignite U.S. DeFi innovation. Protocols like Lido, Rocket Pool, and native staking on Ethereum and Solana are likely to see a flood of new users. U.S. exchanges may cautiously relaunch non-custodial staking products, while ETF issuers can confidently add yield features to their offerings. Global markets are watching closely. The U.K., EU, and Singapore have already taken a lighter approach to staking, and the SEC’s shift could spark a new wave of regulatory harmonization. Key Takeaways The SEC’s confirmation that PoS staking is not a securities transaction is a historic win for U.S. crypto. It removes a major regulatory overhang, paves the way for on-chain yield products, and could put the U.S. back at the forefront of DeFi innovation. For retail stakers, ETF issuers, and the entire crypto ecosystem, the future just got a lot brighter.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|RPL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 13:14:24

The adjustment is likely to finalize within the next 100 blocks, with projections showing the measure will rise about 4% to 126.95 trillion (T), eclipsing the current 123 T record. Difficulty was 109 T at the start of the year, according to Coinwarz . The increase reflects growing long-term confidence in bitcoin’s value, even as on-chain activity and transaction fees remain low. Difficulty is adjusted every 2,016 blocks, and is driven by the network hashrate, which measures the total computational power dedicated to securing the network. The hashrate's seven-day moving average is now 918 exahashes per second (EH/s), having risen from 840 (EH/s) over the past two weeks. With previous peaks at 925 EH/s, any further increase would mark a new record high in hashrate. Despite the increase in mining activity, transaction fees remain exceptionally low. A high-priority transaction currently requires only 2 satoshis per virtual byte (sat/vB), equating to roughly $0.30. The higher the fee, the faster a transaction will be confirmed, as miners prioritize transactions that pay more. These figures suggest that while transaction demand on the Bitcoin network is subdued, mining power continues to scale to new heights, highlighting a divergence between usage and infrastructure growth.",Markets|Hashrate|Bitcoin|Mining Difficulty|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 13:14:56

Here Are The Support And Resistance Levels According To Analysts!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cosmos-native-token-atom-faces-high-volatility-here-are-the-support-and-resistance-levels-according-to-analysts/,"Cosmos’ native token, ATOM, is experiencing high volatility as changing geopolitical dynamics and evolving global trade policies put pressure on financial markets. Cosmos (ATOM) Faces High Volatility Due to Geopolitical Tensions and Market Uncertainty The cryptocurrency fluctuated between $4,848 and $4,413, recording a trading range of 9%, reflecting the turbulent market environment, according to Binance TR data. In the past few hours, short-term swings have also emerged and it has fluctuated between $4,492 and $4,454, which has made investors nervous. Analysts have identified support levels around $4.45 and resistance levels around $4.48. Traders are closely watching these levels for directional clues. ATOM’s price action coincides with geopolitical tensions and policy changes that continue to impact global risk sentiment. These macroeconomic pressures are not only affecting traditional assets but are also reverberating across the crypto market, affecting investor behavior and asset valuations. The increase in trading volume, which reached 3.05 million on May 30, indicates that interest in ATOM is increasing despite the overall decrease in activity in the crypto sector. This difference suggests that selective interest in tokens with strong infrastructure stories, such as Cosmos, is intensifying, despite the decrease in overall participation. Interest in blockchain-based assets like Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) is also rising, fueling speculation that cryptocurrencies with strategic integrations and active ecosystems could outperform in the coming month. According to technical analysis, the major resistance level remains at $4.84, while the short-term support level has emerged at $4.67. If ATOM sustains its current momentum and breaks through the resistance levels, analysts believe that the asset could regain upside potential, especially if institutional interest deepens and macro conditions stabilize. As market participants brace for more volatility, ATOM's recent volatility highlights the importance of balancing short-term risk with long-term growth potential, especially in a macroeconomic environment dominated by uncertainty and rapid changes in investor sentiment. *This is not investment advice.

Cardano is expanding its smart contract ecosystem and leaning into real-world utility. Monero is climbing fast as demand for privacy surges, which pushed it back into the top 25. And Coldware ($COLD) is shipping real hardware that connects directly to a Layer-1 blockchain. Below, we break down why each of these tokens is gaining traction and how they’re helping investors build serious gains in a shifting market. Cardano Focuses on Real-World Use and Steady Ecosystem Growth Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.77 today and holding steady after a slight uptick. It’s been moving between $0.733 and $0.775. So, what’s going on? Cardano just hit a big milestone: over 100,000 new smart contracts added in 2024. That’s a strong signal of increasing developer interest and real-world use. On top of that, there’s talk of integrating RLUSD, a stablecoin that could bring more liquidity and DeFi action to the Cardano ecosystem, especially if the Circle acquisition goes through. Traders are watching the $0.80–$0.85 range if ADA can keep pushing upward. But if it dips below $0.73, $0.70 will be the next support to watch. Monero Remains a Good Privacy Pick in a Surveillance-Heavy Market Monero (XMR) is trading at $415 today and continuing a strong run that’s seen its price more than double this year. Market cap is now over $7.5 billion—enough to flip Litecoin and Toncoin and push XMR into the top 25 cryptos. Demand for privacy is rising, especially as regulators tighten their grip on the rest of the market. There’s also buzz about potential relistings on major exchanges. If XMR keeps up this pace, traders are watching the $440 level next. But with the RSI that high, a short-term pullback wouldn’t be a surprise. Coldware Is Turning Web3 Into Something You Can Hold in Your Hand Coldware ($COLD) is doing what most crypto projects don’t—shipping real products. Instead of staying stuck in the digital space with wallets and whitepapers, Coldware is merging blockchain, hardware, and privacy to create something tangible. Its Layer-1 network is designed to work seamlessly with its own devices: the Larna 2400 smartphone and the ColdBook laptop. These come crypto-ready—no need to install wallets or browser extensions. Users power them on, and they’re ready to send tokens, stake, or access DeFi apps. The Larna 2400 runs on Android 15 and features a 6.56” OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. But what makes it stand out is what’s inside: apps like ColdWallet, ColdChat, and a decentralized VPN come built-in, which gives users secure, private access to the crypto ecosystem right out of the box. $COLD Isn’t Just a Token—It’s the Core of the Coldware Ecosystem $COLD token powers everything from payments and governance to Freeze.Mint—a tool that lets users create their own tokens or asset-backed digital assets without writing a single line of code. It’s tailor-made for creators, builders, and businesses that want to go on-chain without hiring a dev team. With a fixed supply of 21 billion, the token is distributed across staking, grants, liquidity, and ecosystem growth. Only 1.7% goes to the core team, which shows this project is built with users in mind. The Stage 2 presale is live at $0.00625 per token, with over $3.9 million already raised and more than 66% of tokens claimed. Coldware ($COLD) is building the tools that make Web3 usable, especially for the people who need it most. Wrapping Up Cardano is building quietly, Monero is surging as privacy demand grows, and Coldware is breaking the mold with real-world tech. All three bring something valuable to the table, but Coldware ($COLD) stands out for one reason: it’s making Web3 usable for everyone, not just the tech-savvy. If you're betting on long-term utility over short-term noise, Coldware deserves a closer look. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Over half of all Tether (USDT), around $73.8 billion, is now hosted on TRON’s network . Tether has minted $16 billion in new USDT on TRON just this year.

TRON has also boosted retail accessibility. A new MoonPay partnership now lets U.S. users buy TRX with debit cards in minutes, directly targeting the same demographic that a Trump-branded crypto push might energize. From a revenue standpoint, Q1 2025 marked a record-setting $760 million, with daily active addresses reaching 2.4 million. These milestones support the argument that TRON’s traction isn’t just hype-driven, it’s built on utility and user growth. Then came Sun’s cryptic May 30 tweet, simply captioned “Progress.” Progress. https://t.co/YMEY0EfD8f — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 30, 2025 The single-word post triggered a 15% spike in transaction volume and pushed TRX to $0.1115, up 1.2% on the day. Binance’s TRX/USDT pair rose 2.1% within hours, while the TRX/BTC pair also gained. Volume surged 18% across major exchanges, and the token broke above its 50-day moving average, further strengthening short-term bullish sentiment. Trump-Era Alliances: Simple Breakdown of the Risks and Rewards Justin Sun’s ties to Donald Trump Jr. are more than a publicity move. Sun is a big holder of the $TRUMP memecoin and now advises the Trump family’s crypto venture, giving him direct access to policymakers who are suddenly friendlier toward digital assets Tron founder @justinsuntron has received a Trump-branded Golden Tourbillon watch for being the top holder of President @realDonaldTrump ’s memecoin. #Trump #Sun https://t.co/NI4bVy3smJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 23, 2025 As a result of being the top holder of President Donald Trump’s memecoin, he received a Trump-branded Golden Tourbillon watch during the exclusive dinner hosted by Donald Trump. Some critics call this a conflict of interest, but the timing matters: the SEC has recently dropped or settled cases against Coinbase, ConsenSys, Kraken, Circle, and Immutable. With regulators easing off, TRON might also win relief, especially with Sun pushing for approval of a TRON ETF and clearer DeFi rules. The SEC’s softer stance is already visible. In February 2025, the agency told a federal judge it was in talks to pause its civil fraud lawsuit against Sun and his companies (Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry). The case, filed in 2023, had accused Sun of illegally distributing TRX and BTT tokens and boosting trading volumes with hidden celebrity endorsements. A pause could lead to a settlement, underscoring how Sun’s political connections may turn regulatory risk into opportunity.

Rather, they believe it’s a natural cooldown after a strong rally. According to Nick Forster, founder of onchain options protocol Derive, the cryptocurrency is currently “digesting recent gains,” and the consolidation is likely a “healthy pause” before a potential fresh rally. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 but has since pulled back to around $105,976 as of the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The digital asset remains up 11.59% over the past month, despite recent fluctuations. “We are likely in a phase where price stability will dominate the short term,” Forster stated in an interview , adding that this phase helps “gear up for the next movement.” Trade Tariff Ruling and Fed Decision A key macro factor influencing market sentiment is the U.S. Court of International Trade’s recent decision on May 28 to strike down President Donald Trump’s broad tariff policies, ruling that he exceeded his authority. However, the following day, the Court of Appeals temporarily allowed the tariffs to stay in place under an emergency powers law while Trump appeals the ruling. Forster said the initial ruling relieved fears about trade-induced inflation, potentially giving Bitcoin some breathing room. However, all eyes are now on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s next interest rate announcement, scheduled for June 18. “The Fed’s decision will be pivotal in shaping short-term market direction,” he noted. Q3 Could Defy Historical Weakness Looking ahead, Forster suggested that the third quarter—which has traditionally been weaker for Bitcoin—may play out differently this year. “Favorable regulatory news and rising institutional interest could flip the script,” he said. Since 2013, Q3 has posted an average 6.03% gain for Bitcoin, while Q4 remains the standout performer with an average return of 85.42%, according to CoinGlass. One overlooked factor, Forster added, is the substantial yet understated impact of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. “Over $6.2 billion flowed into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in May alone,” he pointed out. Yet, Bitcoin’s spot price hasn’t shown a proportional move. This, he explained, is because many ETF investors are institutions opting for indirect exposure, which doesn’t immediately pressure spot markets. In the final week ending May 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.75 billion in inflows —highlighting strong undercurrents despite the apparent market calm.

According to a new analysis by the Yale Budget Lab, economists said consumers will still feel an impact of close to $1,000 a year. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) ruled on Wednesday that Trump misused his authority by implementing tariffs on multiple countries in the hopes of empowering domestic manufacturing and cutting budget deficits through the revenue generated from the tariffs. The court added that Trump used the tariffs as a bargaining chip for trade deals favoring the U.S. and in geopolitical negotiations. Economists say a tariff is a tax paid on imports by U.S entities Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at Yale Budget Lab and former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said it does pinch consumers’ wallets. He revealed that tariffs are taxes paid on imports by domestic entities, and businesses are expected to pass on some of the costs to consumers. The Wednesday ruling, which would have stopped a 30% tariff on China, a 25% tariff on certain goods from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% universal tariff, was appealed by the Trump administration and overruled today, reinstating the tariffs. The tariffs are expected to push consumer goods prices up. The 25% tariff on steel, aluminum, and auto parts was also upheld today. Jennifer McKeown and Stephen Brown, economists at Capital Economists, revealed that, according to Yale Budget Lab analysis , those tariffs would cost the average household $950 in purchasing power in 2025. That means an estimated 0.6% increase in consumer goods prices across the U.S. On the other hand, if the Wednesday ruling had been upheld, consumers would save more than $1800 in 2025, Tedeschi added. He revealed that the average household would lose about $2,800 and experience a 1.7% bump in consumer prices in 2025 if the country-specific tariffs were to stay. McKeown and Brown added that if the Wednesday court ruling were upheld, it would lower the effective tariff rate to 6.5% from 15%. The tariff rate was at 2.5% at the beginning of the year. According to Tedeschi, the most direct impact would be on car imports. Car buying prices would rise by about 8% this year and 5% in the long term. The Trump administration hints at possible tariffs on multiple products Trump promised to move to sector-specific tariffs recently. The President said he would apply section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the President to impose tariffs to protect or boost domestic industries if they are considered a potential threat to national security. The Department of Commerce began investigating copper and lumber earlier last month, and the Trump administration followed suit by investigating pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, according to a Federal Register made public in April. The Trump administration also indicated that it would continue with similar investigations for critical minerals. The investigations are expected to end within 270 days from the day they began. “The risk from imposing duties on imports of products where there are few substitutes is certainly greater, and that’s why there have been some exemptions and reductions in tariffs and exclusions of products that are of key importance to the U.S.” – Gregory Daco , Chief Economist at EY-Parthenon Daco added that the economy is expected to slow down and enter a recession. His firm estimated that the increased cost of imports would lead to higher consumer prices, accelerated inflation, and reduced economic growth domestically and abroad. The U.S. imports about 50% of its copper, mostly for the electrification and defense sectors. Dan Inkenson, an economist and trade policy scholar at Ikenomics Consulting, said in an interview with CNN that the demand for copper and other critical minerals is expected to grow in the upcoming months, especially as energy-consuming sectors such as AI and blockchain continue to grow in the U.S. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

ARKHAM ALERT: JAMES WYNN HAS JUST BEEN LIQUIDATED FOR $100 MILLION DOLLARS pic.twitter.com/dJNCUmbgZO — Arkham (@arkham) May 30, 2025 Some context: Wynn bet on a BTC rebound through Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), opening two massive long positions , one of 527.29 BTC (that’s $55.3 million) and another of 421.8 BTC (or $43.9 million). But when Bitcoin dropped to a 10-day low, his positions were liquidated. What’s worse, a separate position of 94 BTC ($10 million) was also liquidated just yesterday. That’s a total of 949 BTC, or $99.3 million, gone with the wind within a week. Crypto trader Wynn has no regrets A self-professed “degenerate trader”, Wynn has quite a history with crypto, with the last three months being almost incredible, as he’s gone from $82 million in profits only to losing $100 million. After his PEPE moves in April, which led to $25 million in profits, Wynn started going long on BTC, opening a $500+ million position. Afterwards, he opened a $1 billion BTC short , which he closed at a $1 million loss. Things were looking great for Wynn. After all, his profit and loss (P&L) grew from $30 million to almost $82 million. But, as we’re now aware, Wynn flew too close to the sun, as BTC hit his liquidation price and bounced. While he’s just been liquidated for what amounts to more or less five decently sized mansions, Wynn appears to have no regrets. He tweeted: The perps casino was fun. Zero regrets. Flipping $4m to $100m and back down to -$13m is one hell of a thrill. Hope many of you enjoyed it as much as I did. Most wouldn’t dare or dream to place these kind of trades.

Meanwhile, in the UK, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced the party will accept crypto donations and introduced a pro-crypto agenda, including a potential Bitcoin reserve at the Bank of England. In Kazakhstan, President Tokayev revealed plans for “CryptoCity,” which is a regulated zone where crypto can be used for everyday purchases. The city of Alatau, known for its tech heritage, is the leading candidate to host the initiative. Overall, Panama, the UK, and Kazakhstan are each making bold moves toward deeper crypto integration. Bitcoin Could Let Cargo Ships Skip the Line Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi proposed a bold new idea to integrate Bitcoin into one of the world's most vital shipping routes—the Panama Canal. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29, Mizrachi floated the concept of allowing cargo ships to pay in Bitcoin to receive expedited passage through the canal. He was joined by El Salvador Bitcoin advocates Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, and the talk was moderated by Mike Peterson of Bitcoin Beach. Mizrachi suggested that Bitcoin payments could offer ships the perk of bypassing the long queue times that are often associated with the canal. The Panama Canal is a crucial man-made waterway linking the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, and it facilitates about 5% of global maritime trade annually. It even generated $5 billion in revenue between October of 2023 and September of 2024. Over 423 million tons of goods passed through the canal in that period via nearly 10,000 transits. Panama Canal Mizrachi’s idea was floated even as the canal remains a politically charged issue, especially after President Donald Trump’s December 2024 call to reclaim US control of the canal over concerns about Chinese influence and alleged discrimination against US vessels. Panama is a crypto-forward nation, following in El Salvador’s footsteps. Mizrachi’s administration already made strides, including passing a measure to allow cryptocurrency for public payments like taxes, fines, and municipal fees. Mizrachi is also exploring the possibility of creating a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which he believes could be implemented without needing any legislative approval. Additionally, Mizrachi called on Panama’s lawmakers to take a laissez-faire approach to regulating cryptocurrency. He urged them to “not touch it,” and argued that the government should first let Bitcoin function organically and then determine the appropriate policy response—whether to restrict or promote it. He specifically referred to figures suggesting Panama sees over $5 billion in annual Bitcoin transactions, although much of it reportedly happens in the shadows due to fear and uncertainty around regulation. His vision is unfolding against the backdrop of domestic unrest, as Panama recently declared a state of emergency in Bocas del Toro after mass layoffs at banana giant Chiquita Brands, which claims to have suffered over $75 million in losses due to protests and blockades demanding better social protections. Mizrachi’s plans look like an attempt to both modernize Panama’s financial infrastructure and ease the country’s economic tension through bold, decentralized strategies, and Bitcoin could very likely play a central role in that future. Reform UK Now Accepts Crypto Donations Other countries are also finding new ways to utilize cryptocurrencies. Nigel Farage, the leader of the Reform UK political party, announced that the party is now accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for donations, becoming the first major UK political group to do so. Farage also spoke at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, and said that Reform UK will use the Radom platform to facilitate crypto donations from eligible contributors. This move places Reform ahead of both the Conservative and Labour parties, which currently dominate the UK’s House of Commons but have yet to embrace crypto contributions. Nigel Farage Farage said, “We’re way behind you in America, but as of now, people with Bitcoin can give us money provided they’re eligible.” His appearance at the conference also touched on personal experiences with being debanked in the UK in 2023, which he said proved the need for alternative financial systems. In addition to introducing crypto donations, Farage laid out a vision for digital assets in the UK, including a proposed “Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill” that Reform will push if it secures government control in the general election expected before August of 2029. While Reform UK currently holds only five seats in the House of Commons compared to Labour’s 403 and the Conservatives’ 120, Farage’s comments shed some light on the desire to position the party as a crypto-friendly alternative. Nigel Farage at Bitcoin 2025 Farage also advocated for the creation of a Bitcoin reserve held by the Bank of England and voiced strong opposition to the launch of a UK central bank digital currency (CBDC). He praised President Donald Trump’s stance on crypto and agreed with sentiments aligned with US pro-crypto conservatives. He pointed out that crypto ownership is widespread in the UK, and even claimed that seven million people hold digital assets, including one in four individuals under the age of 30. While the current Labour-led government proposed a framework to treat crypto exchanges and dealers similarly to traditional financial institutions, Farage’s approach suggests a more aggressive path toward national adoption and reserve integration. Kazakhstan Plans CryptoCity Pilot Meanwhile, Kazakhstan is preparing to launch “CryptoCity,” which is a pilot zone designed to allow the use of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. This is according to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. At the Astana International Forum 2025 , Tokayev announced the government’s plan to create a regulated sandbox environment where digital assets could be used for purchasing goods, services, and potentially more. A transcript of his remarks was published on the official website of the presidency on May 29. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev The initiative is a bold step in Kazakhstan’s plan to embrace digital innovation. The country recently made several moves in the crypto space, including piloting a CBDC that reportedly helped reduce wait times for value-added tax refunds. Kanysh Tuleushin, Kazakhstan’s first vice minister of digital development, publicly stated that the country has the potential to become a leading crypto hub in Central Asia, especially if regulatory hurdles are reduced. While the government is still finalizing the location for the CryptoCity pilot, Digital Development Minister Zhaslan Madiyev said the new city of Alatau is the most likely candidate. It is located near Kazakhstan’s southeastern border, and has a strong scientific and technological legacy. It was founded in 1957 to house scientific institutions and is home to the Institute of Nuclear Physics, the National Nuclear Center, and the Physics and Technology Institute. Alatau also hosts the Innovation Technology Park, which is a special economic zone that could complement the CryptoCity concept by drawing in tech-focused investment. Madiyev explained that the city would support broad crypto utility, with residents able to use digital assets for purchases in restaurants and cafes, real estate transactions, and investments.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 13:22:54

With network upgrades that increase speed and cut fees to a great extent, ETH is proving that even a decade-old blockchain can reinvent itself. However, alongside this massive player, a newcomer is making news: Yeti Ouro , a GameFi token on Ethereum that promises to add a brand new dimension to on-chain utility and blockchain gaming. Ethereum’s Massive Growth in May After the very well-received “ Pectra” hard for k and widespread adoption of Layer 2 rollups, Ethereum’s average transaction fee has fallen to a great extent. Suddenly, DeFi apps, NFT marketplaces, and even small-ticket transactions feel practical again. Daily active addresses are climbing, indicating more real-world use rather than just speculative trading. What’s driving this resurgence? A few factors: Rollup Explosion: The Majority of Ethereum transactions now occur on rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism. That frees the mainnet to handle higher-value operations, smoother smart contract calls, and large NFT mints without gas wars. Credits: TradingView Institutional Eyeballs: Big funds and tech firms are building on Ethereum again, whether issuing stablecoins for on-chain payments or deploying tokenized real estate. Their participation suggests a healthy foundation for Ethereum’s price. With ETH trading around $2600 and bullish analysts pointing to $4,000 by year-end, now feels like a strategic moment to revisit Ethereum’s potential. Yeti Ouro Presents A Strong Case YETIO is an ERC-20 token that finds its main product in YetiGo, a Play-to-Earn racing game built on Unreal Engine 5. Instead of simply buying tokens and hoping for a price bump, Yeti Ouro has announced a $100,000 giveaway ! There will be five winners of a grand raffle of $20,000 each in YETIO. YETIO holders can: Race to Earn : Compete in high-speed elimination-style races and earn YETIO for contest wins. Trade In-Game Assets : Purchase and sell game-based assets on an on-chain marketplace. So, effectively, every trade burns a portion of YETIO, tightening supply. Why YETIO Thrives on Ethereum? Scalable Gameplay : Thanks to some of Ethereum’s Layer 2 integrations, YetiGo transactions will happen much more swiftly and in an affordable manner. Racers can enter tournaments and trade assets without waiting minutes or paying weighty gas fees. Deflationary Design : Every YETIO transaction triggers a 5% burn, making sure that as the game grows, token scarcity intensifies. In contrast, ETH’s supply remains fixed beyond staking dynamics. Shared Security: By relying on Ethereum’s strong proof-of-stake security, YETIO avoids building its own chain. Community Support Meets Utility: Yeti Ouro’s team has partnered with top game veterans and Grammy-nominated audio producers. As Ethereum’s upgrades boost overall network value, Yeti Ouro stands to gain from upgraded visibility and smoother gameplay experiences. Conversely, YETIO’s excitement and active community can bring in new users onto Ethereum, creating a virtuous cycle. Conclusion Ethereum’s amazing comeback proves that innovation never stops. Moreover, its recent growth also shows that the value of reliable assets like BTC and ETH remains massive. At the same time, Yeti Ouro is redefining what utility means in the crypto world.

This development saw a Tether freeze and a Circle freeze on specific digital wallets, directly responding to sanctions imposed by U.S. authorities. Understanding the Recent Action: USDT Frozen Addresses Recent reports from crypto tracking platform MistTrack on X confirmed that approximately 19,955 USDT frozen across two addresses were linked to Funnull Technology. Funnull Technology is a computer infrastructure provider based in the Philippines. This action by Tether and Circle wasn’t arbitrary; it was a direct consequence of sanctions announced on May 29 by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). OFAC targeted Funnull Technology for its alleged involvement in widespread ‘pig butchering’ scams. These sophisticated frauds manipulate victims into investing in fake crypto platforms, ultimately stealing their funds. By freezing the USDT held in these specific wallets, Tether and Circle are demonstrating their commitment to complying with international sanctions and combating the use of their stablecoins for illicit purposes. What Are OFAC Sanctions Crypto Targets? The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC plays a crucial role in enforcing U.S. foreign policy and national security goals through economic and trade sanctions. In recent years, as cryptocurrencies have become more widely adopted, OFAC’s focus has expanded to include digital assets and the entities that use them for illegal activities. OFAC sanctions crypto addresses and entities when there is evidence they are involved in: Terrorist financing Money laundering Cybercrime (like ransomware attacks or scams) Evading sanctions against rogue states or individuals The action against Funnull Technology is part of a broader effort by OFAC to disrupt the financial infrastructure used by cybercriminals, particularly those engaged in large-scale investment frauds like pig butchering scams. By identifying and sanctioning entities like Funnull, OFAC aims to make it harder for these criminal networks to operate and profit from their illegal activities. The Role of Tether and Circle in Compliance Tether, the issuer of USDT, and Circle, the issuer of USDC, are the two largest stablecoin providers globally. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Their stability makes them popular for trading, transferring value, and increasingly, for holding funds. As centralized entities that issue and manage these stablecoins, Tether and Circle have the technical capability to freeze assets held in specific addresses. This ability is a double-edged sword in the crypto community, often sparking debate about centralization versus decentralization principles. However, it is also a necessary function for these companies to comply with regulations and law enforcement requests. When OFAC issues sanctions targeting specific individuals or entities, it often includes identifying associated cryptocurrency addresses. Tether and Circle, like traditional financial institutions, are then obligated to screen their transactions and freeze funds linked to these sanctioned addresses. The Circle freeze and Tether freeze in the Funnull case are direct examples of this compliance mechanism in action. Why Stablecoin Regulation is Becoming Crucial The Funnull case underscores the growing importance of Stablecoin regulation . As stablecoins become integrated into the global financial system, regulators worldwide are scrutinizing how they are used and the potential risks they pose, including their use in illicit finance. Regulators are keen to ensure that stablecoin issuers have robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures in place. They also want to ensure issuers can comply with sanctions regimes, just like banks and other financial intermediaries. The ability of Tether and Circle to freeze the USDT frozen in the Funnull-linked addresses is often cited by regulators as a necessary feature for stablecoins to operate within legal frameworks. However, achieving effective Stablecoin regulation is complex. It involves balancing the need for compliance and financial stability with the innovative potential and decentralized ethos often associated with cryptocurrencies. The ongoing discussions around stablecoin legislation in various countries aim to strike this balance. Exploring Pig Butchering Scams and Crypto Use ‘Pig butchering’ scams, also known as ‘Sha Zhu Pan,’ are a particularly cruel type of investment fraud that has proliferated globally. The name comes from the idea of fattening a pig before slaughtering it. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how they typically work: Initial Contact: Scammers often make contact through dating apps, social media, or messaging platforms, building a rapport and romantic or friendly relationship with the victim over weeks or months. Building Trust: They share fabricated stories of wealth gained through cryptocurrency investments, presenting themselves as successful traders or insiders. The Setup: The scammer convinces the victim to invest a small amount on a seemingly legitimate-looking (but fake) trading platform or app. The victim might even see small, fabricated profits initially, encouraging them to invest more. The ‘Butchering’: Once the victim has invested a significant amount (the ‘fattening’), the scammer and the fake platform disappear, or the victim is told they need to pay exorbitant ‘taxes’ or ‘fees’ to withdraw their funds, which they never can. Cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins like USDT, are often the preferred method of payment for these scams because they can be sent quickly across borders and offer a degree of pseudonymity, making tracing and recovery difficult for victims and law enforcement. Funnull Technology’s alleged role likely involved providing infrastructure or services that facilitated these fraudulent platforms or the movement of illicit funds. The Implications of Stablecoin Freezes The ability of stablecoin issuers to freeze assets has significant implications for the crypto ecosystem: Enhanced Compliance: It allows issuers to cooperate with law enforcement and comply with sanctions, potentially reducing the use of stablecoins for illicit activities. This could make stablecoins more palatable to traditional financial institutions and regulators. Centralization Concerns: Critics argue that the power to freeze assets undermines the decentralized nature that many associate with cryptocurrencies. It gives issuers significant control, raising questions about who decides what gets frozen and under what authority. User Risk: While freezes primarily target illicit funds, there’s a theoretical risk of legitimate users being caught in the crossfire due to mistaken identity or association with sanctioned entities. Precedent Setting: Each instance of a freeze sets a precedent, reinforcing the expectation that stablecoin issuers will act as gatekeepers within the crypto space, similar to banks. The Tether freeze and Circle freeze on the Funnull addresses serve as a stark reminder that holding stablecoins issued by centralized entities comes with different considerations than holding truly decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Actionable Insights for Stablecoin Users Given these developments, what should stablecoin users know and do? Understand Your Stablecoin: Be aware of whether the stablecoin you hold is issued by a centralized entity (like USDT, USDC) or is algorithmic/decentralized (though these have faced other challenges). Centralized issuers can freeze assets under certain conditions. Know the Risks: Understand that compliance with sanctions and law enforcement is a reality for centralized stablecoin issuers. Your funds could potentially be frozen if linked, even indirectly, to sanctioned activity. Practice Due Diligence: Be extremely cautious of unsolicited investment advice, especially on social media or dating apps. Research any platform thoroughly before sending funds. If it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Use Reputable Platforms: Only use well-known, regulated cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with regulatory developments and how they impact the stablecoins you use. The fact that USDT frozen in this case was linked to alleged criminal activity underscores the ongoing battle against illicit finance in the crypto space. The Future of Stablecoins and Compliance The Funnull case is unlikely to be the last time we see stablecoin issuers acting on sanctions. As regulators like OFAC become more adept at tracing crypto flows, pressure on issuers to maintain robust compliance programs will only increase. This could lead to: More stringent KYC/AML requirements for stablecoin users, even for smaller transactions. Increased collaboration between stablecoin issuers, exchanges, tracking firms, and law enforcement. Potential regulatory frameworks specifically designed for stablecoins, mandating certain compliance capabilities. While some in the crypto community lament the centralization aspects highlighted by instances like the Tether freeze and Circle freeze , others see it as a necessary step for stablecoins to gain broader acceptance and integration into the mainstream financial system, provided it is done transparently and under clear legal authority. Summary: A Clear Message on Illicit Crypto Use The freezing of USDT by Tether and Circle in response to OFAC sanctions against Funnull Technology sends a clear message: the crypto ecosystem is not immune to traditional financial regulations and law enforcement actions, especially when it comes to centralized stablecoins. The USDT frozen represents a direct blow against the financial channels allegedly used by pig butchering scams. This event highlights the ongoing efforts by regulators to combat illicit finance using digital assets and the complex role stablecoin issuers play in navigating compliance while operating within a space that values decentralization. It reinforces the importance of robust Stablecoin regulation and serves as a critical reminder for users to exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence to avoid becoming victims of scams facilitated by crypto.

The altcoin maintained a bullish momentum over the past day, fueled by President Faustin-Archange Touadera’s bullish announcement. Notably, the Central African Republic will tokenize over 1,700 hectares of land on the Solana network. It will use the country’s meme token to digitize land ownership from June 2025. The president has authorized the move with a decree, marking a significant step in the nation’s efforts to merge cryptocurrency with real-world property and governance. Touadera stated: I have signed a presidential decree to tokenize over 1,700 hectares of land in the Central African Republic. Starting June, land concessions will be accessible online using $CAR directly on Solana.

Notably, the property in focus lies near the Bossongo village, a region with potential mineral wealth. RWA tokenization backed by mining policies Central African Republic aims to take real-world asset tokenization to a new level. The presidential verdict was more than permitting blockchain-based digital land ownership. The decree referenced the nation’s latest tokenization laws and mining code. That means the tokenized land will be for mining activities, not commercial use or settlement. Meanwhile, this move will likely give CAR a distinctive edge among meme tokens. Most themed tokens rely on internet culture and hype without real-world utility. That limited growth in assets like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu beyond the craze. Is $CAR poised to be one of the hottest meme tokens on the Solana network after its controversial debut ? $CAR soars ahead of decree The altcoin started soaring hours before the presidential announcement. It surged over 21% in the past 24 hours, extending its weekly gains to 116%. $CAR trades at $0.05348 after brief corrections from the intraday high. Chart by CoinMarketCap The surging trading volume signals renewed investor and trader interest in the themed token. However, $CAR could see short-term retracements due to potential profit-taking. The prevailing broad market correction might also limit the meme’s recovery. Meanwhile, it trades 90% below its February 10 all-time high of $0.60 Can it recover as it secures utility in the booming tokenization sector? Industry analysts predict that the asset tokenization sector will double to surpass $16 trillion in the next five years. The Central African Republic meme token boasts massive potential.

Cantor’s CEO, Brandon Lutnick, explained that the firm will achieve full participation in Bitcoin’s gains, with physical gold holdings to cushion against price drops.

The firm had announced it would collaborate with a third-party company to launch a portable gaming PC. Microsoft revealed its first-party handheld device would be Xbox-branded. As reported by Windows Central, Microsoft has shelved plans to develop its handheld gaming gadget. The Redmond-based tech firm said it would focus on third-party portable opportunities, including Project Kennan, which is supposedly due this year. Microsoft said it had opted for a multi-pronged handheld approach and that it would collaborate with a third party to launch an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC. The tech firm revealed the portable gaming PC would be codenamed Kennan. Microsoft says it wants to focus on Windows 11 gaming performance Microsoft has paused plans for a first-party Xbox handheld, originally set for 2027, to focus on enhancing Windows 11 gaming performance. The shift comes as third-party devices gain traction, like Asus' upcoming Kennan. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/GnYE4cy9NV — playswave 🎮 🌊 (@playswave_com) May 30, 2025 Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox , first revealed an Xbox portable device back in 2017. Spencer revealed the firm had “roughly designed” a portable gaming device in the past. The CEO has repeatedly talked about the handheld in recent years, fueling speculations that the handheld gaming device project had been revived. Jason Ronald, the VP of Next Generation at Microsoft, said in January that the firm was planning to combine Windows and Xbox experiences. Ronald added that the combination of the two would form a PC gaming handheld. In March, Microsoft said it would release Kennan while working on its internally developed portable gaming device. The tech company revealed it intended to release its own handheld device alongside an Xbox Series X/S replacement in 2027. Microsoft has allegedly revealed that it would focus its teams to work on improving the gaming performance of Windows 11. The tech firm stated the improvements would be implemented for specific devices, such as the ASUS partner gadget Project Kennan. Microsoft has confirmed it has essentially finished the hardware part of the device. The Redmond-based firm clarified that Xbox and Windows teams still had some improvements to make on the software side. Microsoft joins other firms launching handheld devices Microsoft’s move to refocus on improving the performance of Windows 11-powered gadgets followed similar decisions other tech firms took. In January, Valve said it was working on bringing SteamOS to power the Steam Deck to third-party portable gaming devices. The firm later announced the operating system was available on a variety of portable devices, including the recently launched Lenovo Legion Go S. Nintendo first launched the Nintendo console in 2017, but has recently revealed an upcoming release. Japanese gaming firm Nintendo announced the Nintendo Switch 2 at the beginning of this year. The company said the handheld would be able to connect gamers in new ways. The firm also stated that the device would provide gamers with new ways to experience their games. Nintendo revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be launching on June 5, 2025. The gaming firm said the device would have Joy-Con 2 controllers, which gamers could use as a mouse in any of the compatible games. The Japanese gaming firm added that the controllers would snap to the systems using magnetic connectors. The company also revealed the device would have powerful processing speeds that would deliver visuals via the gadget’s big screen. Nintendo revealed that gamers would connect with their friends to play Nintendo Switch 2 games via the new device. Shuntaro Furukawa, the President of Nintendo, said the device would improve gaming experiences at home because gamers could use it on the go. The president stated that its new features would significantly expand the possibilities of gaming experiences. Furukawa said the upcoming device would be a leap forward in the firm’s journey of bringing joy to everyone who would use it. Sony launched the portable PlayStation Portal in 2023. The firm said the PS Portal would allow gamers to stream games from PS5 over the internet. Sony revealed that the handheld featured built-in controllers. The company stated that the controllers would support haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which were aimed at replicating the tactile sensations experienced while gaming on PS5. Sony said the device would have a dedicated media section on the home screen, which would mirror the interface of the PS5.

BTC lost momentum late on Thursday and fell from $108,886 to a low of $104,802 before recovering to reclaim $105,000 and move to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $106,192. Meanwhile, ETH slipped below $2,700 after dropping over 3% in the past 24 hours. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is trading at around $2,638. Ripple (XRP) continued its bearish trajectory, with the price down almost 3%, while Solana (SOL) fell below $170 after a drop of nearly 4%, and is currently around $165. Dogecoin (DOGE) has registered a substantial decline, with the price down almost 8%. Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered significant declines. However, Toncoin (TON) bucked the bearish trend and is up over 1%. Proof-Of-Stake Does Not Constitute Securities Transactions The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that certain blockchain staking activities do not involve the offering of securities. The SEC stated its view involves the staking of “covered crypto assets” on Proof-of-Stake networks, activities of third-party service providers like custodians and node operators, and ancillary services. “Accordingly, it is the Division's view that participants in Protocol Staking Activities do not need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act.” Specifically, ancillary services encompass self-storage, self-custodial staking with a third party, and custodial management, where custodians stake on behalf of asset owners. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce welcomed the decision, stating, “Today's statement provides welcome clarity for stakers and 'staking-as-a-service' providers in the United States.” China Imposes Fresh Ban On Crypto China has announced a sweeping new ban on crypto, prohibiting not just the trading and mining of cryptocurrencies but also the individual ownership of cryptocurrencies like BTC. The move is a significant escalation of China’s hardline approach to crypto, reiterating its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of the state-backed digital yuan. The announcement had an immediate impact on the crypto market, as BTC registered a sharp dip, and altcoins followed suit, exhibiting even greater volatility. The ban allows Beijing to tighten its grip on financial flows in the country and accelerate the adoption of the digital yuan. It could also prompt greater decentralization in crypto across Asia as users seek alternative jurisdictions with more favorable policies. US Markets Close Green Despite Tariff Uncertainty US stocks closed in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.4% after Nvidia’s strong first-quarter earnings boosted investor sentiment. However, the gains were limited due to renewed uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s tariff policies following conflicting court decisions. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.39%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 127 points. Price action turned negative after a federal court reinstated tariffs on the European Union hours after the US Court of International Trade ruled them unlawful. Investors are wary of President Trump’s inconsistent stance on trade, particularly regarding the reciprocal tariff policy, which adds to concerns about persistent inflation. Several companies in the US have cited tariffs as key reasons behind the weaker forecasts. SEC Dismisses Lawsuit Against Binance The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its civil lawsuit against Binance, continuing its new approach to crypto since President Donald Trump assumed office. Lawyers for the SEC, Binance, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao signed a joint stipulation of dismissal filed in the Washington DC federal court. The SEC stated that dismissing the enforcement case was appropriate in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter. However, it added that the action did not reflect its view on other cryptocurrency litigation. The dismissal with prejudice means the SEC cannot pursue the case again. A Binance spokesperson called the dismissal a landmark moment, stating, “We're deeply grateful to (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins and the Trump administration for recognizing that innovation can't thrive under regulation by enforcement.” Binance was accused of artificially inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, and misleading investors about its surveillance tools. The exchange has also been accused of unlawfully facilitating the trading of several crypto tokens that the SEC leadership under the previous administration had classified as securities. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $106,000 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified, with the price dropping over 2% to a low of $105,417 before registering a marginal recovery. Despite the substantial pullback, analysts believe sentiment around BTC will remain positive as long as the flagship cryptocurrency holds its position above $100,000. BTC has maintained its position above this level despite volatility and selling pressure. BTC had jumped to an intraday high of $108,944 early on Thursday as buyers thronged the market before losing momentum. Analysts are divided over BTC’s next course of action, with some calling it a healthy pause and others expressing concerns about growing selling pressure and a drop to $100,000. Some analysts anticipate a sideways move thanks to uncertainty about tariffs, but this cannot be interpreted as a bearish signal. “While the recent surge to over $111,000 was notable, the current price action suggests a phase of consolidation rather than an imminent breakout.” Analysts believe a consolidation phase could be healthy before BTC begins another significant upward move, with a pause in the rally giving the market time to gear up for the next phase of the bull run. Market watchers believe that BTC’s peak is still some way away and that Q3, historically a weak quarter for BTC, could surprise markets in 2025. However, some conservative analysts have expressed concerns about BTC’s immediate outlook, highlighting the emergence of an elevated market risk signal through the “Standardized 60-Day Realized Cap Volatility (RCV)” metric. The indicator is used to assess risk levels and recently crossed a critical historical threshold. However, if BTC can maintain its position above $105,000 and reclaim $110,000, it could become a robust base for another rally if momentum holds. BTC started the previous week in the red, falling to an intraday low of $102,135 before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose nearly 3% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,589. However, markets turned bearish on Friday, and BTC plunged almost 4% and settled at $107,356. Source: TradingView BTC recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and rising 1.16% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price registered a marginal rise on Monday but fell back in the red on Tuesday after facing selling pressure and volatility and settling at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday, with the price dropping 1.03% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $105,000. If BTC dips below this level, it could drop to $100,000. On the other hand, if momentum returns, the flagship cryptocurrency could return above $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) extended its losses during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down after registering a drop of nearly 2% on Thursday after being rejected from $2,800 again. ETH is at a crucial point, with over $2.4 billion in ETH options set to expire on May 30 if the price holds above $2,600. This could support ETH’s attempt to reclaim $2,700 for the first time in nearly 3 months and break above the $2,800 level. ETH bulls will be highly motivated to keep the price above $2,600. However, limited network activity suggests the upside potential could be limited. Analysts believe ETH’s subdued performance is due to growing competition among blockchains focusing on decentralized applications. However, ETH holds a key advantage: It is the only altcoin with a spot ETF offering in the US. Ethereum ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, indicating growing interest from institutional investors. ETH registered a significant drop on Monday (May 19) as it plunged to a low of $2,349. The price recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.18% and settle at $2,527. It registered a marginal decline on Tuesday but recovered on Wednesday, rising 1.10% to $2,550 despite volatility and selling pressure. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 4% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The price reached an intraday high of $2,731 on Friday as buyers attempted a move to $2,800. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell over 5% to $2,527. Source: TradingView ETH recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. The current week started positively, with the price increasing 0.49% to $2,564. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH rose nearly 4% and settled at $2,662. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, increasing almost 1% and settling at $2,683. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,791 on Thursday but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell nearly 2% to $2,633. The current session sees ETH marginally down as sellers look to lower the price. ETH bulls will attempt to keep the price above $2,600 and build momentum to move towards $2,700. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continued to descend as it slipped below $170 on Thursday and extended its losses during the ongoing session, falling to a low of $160 before rebounding to current levels. SOL faces renewed selling pressure, which could drag it below $160. SOL is facing immediate resistance around $170, a level it must reclaim to realize a move towards $180. SOL faced selling pressure on Monday (May 19), falling nearly 4% and settling at $166 after dropping to a low of $159. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.05% to $168. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL reclaimed $170 and settled at $173. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rose 3.52% and settled at $179. SOL raced to an intraday high of $187 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, it dropped over 3% and settled at $173. Source: TradingView SOL rebounded on Saturday, rising 1.09% to settle at $175. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $175. SOL remained bearish on Monday and settled at $174, but rebounded on Tuesday and moved to $176 after an increase of 1.03%. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as the price fell 2.55%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $172. Sellers retained control on Thursday as SOL fell over 3% to $166. SOL fell to a low of $160 during the ongoing session but has rebounded to trade around $163, down nearly 2%. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) has registered high volatility and selling pressure after losing the $3 level on May 15. It started the previous week in the red, dropping 2.64% to a low of $2.51 before settling at $2.64. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.51% to $2.68. However, TIA was back in the red Wednesday, dropping 1.04% after facing selling pressure and volatility. Despite the negative sentiment, TIA rebounded on Thursday, rising almost 7% to cross the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settle at $2.83. TIA raced to an intraday high of $3.07 on Friday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and plunged over 12%, slipping below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $2.48. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, TIA recovered over the weekend, rising 1.64% on Saturday and 1.29% on Sunday to settle at $2.56.

Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as TIA fell over 4% despite rising to an intraday high of $2.70, ultimately settling at $2.50. The current session sees TIA down over 6%, trading around $2.34 as sellers look to drive the price below key support levels. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Analysis Internet Computer (ICP) registered a sharp drop on Monday (May 19) but made a strong recovery the following day, rising nearly 1% despite facing selling pressure and volatility and settling at $5.26. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price registered an increase of almost 2% and settled at $5.35. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ICP surged over 6% and settled at $5.69.

Have you been keeping an eye on the latest developments in the world of exchange-traded funds? There’s some exciting news coming out of the United States regarding US Spot ETH ETF products. These investment vehicles, which directly hold Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset, are showing impressive momentum, attracting significant capital. What Happened with ETH ETF Inflows on May 29? The big headline is the substantial net inflow recorded by ETH ETF products in the U.S. On May 29th, these funds collectively saw a net inflow of a cool $91.9 million. This figure, reported by Farside Investors, is particularly noteworthy because it extends a positive trend that began over a week prior. Yes, you read that right – May 29th marked the ninth consecutive day of net inflows for these newly active investment products. This consistent positive flow suggests growing investor confidence and interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum through traditional brokerage accounts. Breaking Down the Crypto ETF Inflows by Fund While the overall number is compelling, looking at the individual fund performance gives us a clearer picture of where the money is going. Here’s a quick breakdown of the major players and their activity on May 29th: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the pack with a significant $50.4 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space has been closely watched, and their fund is quickly becoming a major force. Fidelity’s FETH: Was the second strongest performer, bringing in $38.3 million. Fidelity is another major financial institution signaling strong demand for Ethereum exposure. Bitwise’s ETHW: Added a respectable $4.6 million to its holdings. Grayscale’s ETH: Saw a modest $3.2 million inflow into its new spot product. Grayscale’s ETHE: In contrast to the inflows into the new spot products, Grayscale’s existing trust, which converted into an ETF (ETHE), continued to see outflows, losing $4.6 million on the day. This mirrors a trend seen with the Bitcoin ETFs, where the conversion of the existing Grayscale trust led to significant initial outflows as investors potentially rotated into newer, lower-fee products or cashed out. Other registered Ethereum ETF products reportedly saw no change in their holdings on May 29th. Why Are Spot ETH ETF Inflows Important for the Crypto Market? The approval and subsequent performance of Spot ETH ETF products in the U.S. are pivotal moments for the entire Crypto Market . Here’s why these inflows matter: Firstly, they represent a significant step towards mainstream adoption. These ETFs make it easier for institutional investors, financial advisors, and retail investors to get exposure to Ethereum without needing to directly buy, store, and secure the cryptocurrency itself. This accessibility opens the door to a much larger pool of potential capital. Secondly, consistent inflows signal growing institutional interest and confidence in Ethereum as an asset class. When major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity see substantial money flowing into their ETH products, it validates Ethereum’s position in the financial landscape. Thirdly, these inflows can have a direct impact on the price of Ethereum. As ETFs buy ETH on the open market to back the shares they issue, increased demand from these large funds can contribute to upward price pressure. Think back to the launch of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Their approval and subsequent inflows were widely credited with helping drive Bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs. While the dynamics for Ethereum might differ slightly, the principle of significant new demand entering the market remains the same. What Does This Mean for Investors? For existing crypto investors, these trends are generally positive indicators of market maturation and increasing demand. For those new to crypto or looking for easier ways to invest, US Spot ETH ETF s offer a regulated and familiar pathway. However, it’s crucial to remember that while ETFs offer convenience, they don’t eliminate market risk. The value of an ETH ETF is directly tied to the price of Ethereum, which is known for its volatility. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. The consistent Crypto ETF Inflows into Ethereum funds are a clear signal that the market is reacting positively to the availability of these new investment products. It suggests that there is pent-up demand from investors who were previously unable or unwilling to invest directly in ETH. Looking Ahead: The Future of the Ethereum ETF Landscape The nine consecutive days of inflows, capped by the $91.9 million on May 29th, paint a promising picture for the future of the ETH ETF market in the U.S. While initial trading volumes and inflows might not match the explosive start seen by the Bitcoin ETFs, the consistent positive trend is arguably just as significant, indicating steady, accumulating interest rather than just initial hype. Market participants will be closely watching the inflow data in the coming weeks to see if this trend continues. Sustained inflows could provide a strong tailwind for Ethereum’s price and further solidify its position as a major asset class alongside Bitcoin in the traditional financial world. Challenges remain, of course. Regulatory clarity beyond the initial ETF approval will be important, and the inherent volatility of the crypto market means price swings are always possible. Nevertheless, the successful launch and positive initial performance of these ETFs mark a significant milestone. In Conclusion: A Strong Start for US Spot ETH ETFs The recent performance of US Spot ETH ETF s, highlighted by the $91.9 million net inflow on May 29th and nine consecutive days of positive flows, is a strong indicator of growing investor appetite for Ethereum exposure through regulated financial products. The data shows clear leaders emerging among the funds, with BlackRock and Fidelity attracting the largest portions of new capital, while Grayscale’s converted trust continues to see some rotation out. These consistent Crypto ETF Inflows are a bullish signal for the broader Crypto Market , suggesting increased accessibility and institutional validation for Ethereum. As the Ethereum ETF landscape evolves, its impact on ETH’s price and the overall market structure will be a key narrative to follow.

45290248,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69065,1748612613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Ledger Validator Sends Critical Warning to XRP Holders,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ledger-validator-sends-critical-warning-to-xrp-holders/,"As excitement surges across the XRP ecosystem following the high-profile XRP Las Vegas (XRPLV) event , a sobering warning has emerged from one of the network’s key voices. Vet, an XRP Ledger validator and respected figure in the XRPL community, issued a critical alert on X, urging XRP holders to exercise extreme caution as announcements flood in about projects building real-world asset (RWA) solutions on the XRP Ledger or encouraging purchases of XRP itself. Vet’s message is clear: while the flurry of integrations, partnerships, and innovations announced around XRPLV signals a period of unprecedented growth for the XRP Ledger, it also creates fertile ground for scammers seeking to exploit the enthusiasm and confusion. “Be insanely careful interacting with all of these companies put in announcements about either doing RWA’s on the XRP Ledger or to buy XRP,” Vet wrote, emphasizing that holders should “let the dust settle” because “scammers are everywhere right now.” Be insanely careful interacting with all of these companies put in announcements about either doing RWA's on the XRP Ledger or to buy XRP. Let the dust settle, scammers are everywhere right now. Stay vigilant. — Vet (@Vet_X0) May 29, 2025 The XRP Ecosystem Is Booming, But Risks Are Rising In recent months, the XRP Ledger has seen a rapid acceleration of real-world asset tokenization initiatives. These projects aim to bring everything from tokenized treasury bonds to real estate and commodities onto the blockchain, leveraging XRPL’s speed, low fees, and growing liquidity pools. Ripple’s recent collaborations with major financial institutions, as well as the anticipated launch of an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible sidechain , have further fueled this surge. However, the flip side of rapid expansion is heightened vulnerability. History has shown across the crypto space that whenever significant ecosystem developments or price rallies occur, bad actors are quick to infiltrate with fake projects, phishing scams, and fraudulent token sales. Vet’s warning reflects a deep understanding of this pattern, highlighting the need for holders to remain vigilant amid the noise. Why Scams Flourish After Major Announcements When major events like XRPLV deliver groundbreaking news, they tend to generate two simultaneous forces: optimism and urgency. Optimistic holders are eager to participate in the next big thing, whether it’s an RWA protocol launching on XRPL or a decentralized finance (DeFi) application promising attractive yields. At the same time, scammers create fake websites, social media accounts, and phishing schemes designed to capitalize on that urgency, often mimicking official announcements or exploiting poorly understood technical details. Vet’s call to “let the dust settle” is therefore not about dampening enthusiasm but about protecting the community. By urging holders to wait, research, and confirm the legitimacy of any project or offer before engaging, Vet reinforces a crucial principle: no matter how exciting the news, due diligence remains non-negotiable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Importance of Community and Validator Warnings What makes Vet’s warning particularly significant is its source. As an XRP Ledger validator , Vet plays a key role in the XRPL’s decentralized network, helping to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. Validators are deeply embedded in the technical and operational workings of the network, making their insights invaluable to the broader community. In the often noisy world of crypto influencers, traders, and speculators, validator warnings cut through the hype. They are issued not for personal gain or engagement farming but out of a genuine commitment to safeguard the network and its participants. XRP holders would do well to heed Vet’s advice, especially during a moment when the ecosystem is both vibrant and vulnerable. What XRP Holders Should Keep in Mind For XRP holders navigating this fast-moving landscape, the best course of action is patience and caution. Official announcements will always withstand scrutiny over time; legitimate projects will have clear documentation, credible teams, and transparent roadmaps. Scams, by contrast, rely on pressure tactics, fake urgency, and emotional manipulation. By waiting, verifying, and staying alert, the XRP community can ensure it reaps the benefits of the ecosystem’s growth without falling prey to opportunistic schemes. In sum, while the XRP Ledger is entering an exhilarating new phase of development — marked by institutional integrations, RWA tokenization, and global-scale ambitions — Vet’s warning is a timely reminder that security and skepticism must always come first. Amid the excitement, XRP holders are urged to keep their guard up, stay informed, and remember that true progress cannot be rushed.

Salamanca: A Meme Coin With a Mission Salamanca, inspired by the infamous cartel family from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, isn’t just another meme coin chasing attention. It runs on the Binance Smart Chain and carries a distinct identity through its $DON token. In addition to being active on Gate.io, MEXC, and PancakeSwap , the project may soon be listed on Binance. This could lead to a substantial change in volume and exposure. The price of $DON has been stable over the week, hovering at $0.0009895 to $0.001132, now trading at about $0.001009 . These levels suggest a healthy base, especially as projections for a 2000% move from current prices begin to build traction. With its previous all-time high set at $0.008522 on April 30, 2025, returning to or surpassing that high isn’t far-fetched. The token’s 1,000,000,000 supply and $3.62M in 24-hour volume further support its strength, especially as community interest grows. How Pepe Sparked a Meme Coin Revival Originally a no-utility, no-tax meme coin that paid homage to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, PEPE was introduced on Ethereum. With a peak market valuation of $1.6 billion, it was instrumental in reviving interest in meme currencies among the general public in early 2023. Its rapid rise made millionaires and triggered an influx of similar launches across the market. However, volatility has become a defining feature of PEPE. Currently priced at $0.000013 , the token has recorded an -11.62% drop in the past 24 hours and a -18.59% decline over the past week. While it still holds a loyal community and substantial volume, over $1.76 billion in 24 hours, the coin’s simplicity, while appealing, may limit its growth potential compared to structured, utility-backed meme coins emerging in 2025. Salamanca’s Social Strength and Market Position A core pillar behind Salamanca’s growing influence is its strong and active community. The project has amassed thousands of followers on X (formerly Twitter), while its Telegram group now boasts over 20,000 engaged members. This social presence is not just for show; it supports organic traction, spreads awareness, and helps reinforce market confidence ahead of bigger listings. Moreover, being dubbed the “Best BSC Meme of 2025” positions Salamanca well in the eyes of investors looking for breakout coins on the Binance Smart Chain. The project’s steady price performance, clear branding, and expanding visibility make it more than just another short-term play. Why Salamanca Could Outpace SHIB With a Binance listing now within reach, Salamanca could soon shift from rising contender to market mainstay. The project already sits comfortably on major platforms like Gate.io, MEXC, and PancakeSwap, increasing liquidity and investor accessibility. Add to that a price base with room for exponential growth and a loyal backing, and the coin is clearly primed for more. Shiba Inu’s slow pace and saturated market position may not offer the same kind of upside over the next year. Salamanca, by contrast, is building momentum at the right time. It has narrative strength, technical promise, and the kind of engagement needed to go further.

The global telecom economy is expected to shoot past the $2.1 trillion valuation in 2025, which makes it one of the largest sectors of the tech industry. The wireless mobile technology is staring at an evolving climate as the Web3 revolution pushes advancement beyond basic connectivity. RZTO , a Solana-based utility token, is looking to make a mark on the global telecom sector with Web3 capability and major innovative features to make the Web3 transition possible. However, having a utility token is one thing, and getting it out there in the real world is another struggle. Most of the digital coins talk a big game, but they don't have any real-world application. The telecom token RZTO looks to break this trend as it has inked a major partnership with Rizz Wireless, an FCC-licensed Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) in the USA. The partnership aims to realize a Web3 telecom ecosystem that redefines user engagement and the future of mobile connectivity. Rather than focusing on a rigid centralized layout, the RZTO ecosystem represents a complete reset of the workings of the telecom sector. The main benefit of a digital coin-based infrastructure is that it can be used to reward users for loyalty and engagement over the years. Rather than wasting unused data, it is rolled over to the next month, or users are rewarded in the form of tokens. Subscribers earn free tokens every step of the way, which helps reduce costs and provides access to a large tokenized digital economy. Rizz Wireless-Changing Connectivity for the Better Rizz Wireless is the first use case for the RZTO system. It brings much-needed MVNO credibility and reach to the table. The Rizz Wireless token partnership offers useful services, including 5G connectivity, flexible payment plans starting at just $25/month. It supports all kinds of cellular modules, including physical SIMs and eSIMs. This development is ideal for international users who are looking for seamless global connectivity. RZTO is not just a Proof of Concept but a real-world implementation of blockchain technology in a futuristic Web3 package. RZTO tokens are used for data top-ups, paying roaming fees, and even international merchant payments through secure outlets. For this purpose, an agreement was struck with Amdocs Connect for international roaming and another with Zoyili.com for extended token utility. Technical Details The telecom token RZTO employs tangible Web3 principles across a major Call-to-Earn model to help subscribers enjoy extensive rewards based on everyday mobile usage. With its robust tokenomics, it maintains a supply of just 10 billion RZTO tokens. The scarcity of these Solana-based utility token coins is improved by equitable distribution across public-private sales, liquidity pools, staking rewards, and deflationary mechanisms like token burnings. The staking model is inspired by Bitcoin itself, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It allows users to earn fixed passive income through an APY pool. These DeFi principles are much needed in telecom services. The token burn mechanism is set to choke the supply constantly over time, ensuring long-term value and ecosystem sustainability. In addition to tokenomics and DeFi capability, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) mechanism is also on the cards, and it will help decentralize decision-making on the RZTO platform. Strategic Advantages for Crypto Investors A Certik audit is in progress to ensure third-party scrutiny around overall platform security and code integrity. Planned listings on major digital currency aggregation websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are also in the works to gain legitimacy within the crypto space. The Rizz Wireless token ecosystem's major strength lies in real-world application, and that cannot be achieved with pure speculation like other new cryptocurrencies focus on. The firm maintains that working with a regulated player like Rizz Wireless brings credibility to the table. How to Join the RZTO Ecosystem Watch the telecom token RZTO presale live on the website. Market rollout is focused on Dubai and other parts of the Middle East, as well as key regions in Europe and Asia. The United States is currently excluded from the token campaign. For investors researching cryptocurrency opportunities, this innovative Solana-based utility token represents a unique intersection of blockchain technology and telecommunications.

45290496,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164461,1748613019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45290496.jpeg,Asia FX Watch: Crucial PCE Data and Trump Tariffs Shape US Dollar Outlook,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-outlook/,"BitcoinWorld Asia FX Watch: Crucial PCE Data and Trump Tariffs Shape US Dollar Outlook In the interconnected world of global finance, events impacting major currencies and trade policies ripple through markets everywhere, including those that influence the sentiment around cryptocurrencies. Right now, the focus is sharply on Asia FX, which is showing a muted reaction as the US dollar finds its footing amidst swirling uncertainties. Two major factors are driving this cautious stance: potential shifts in US trade policy under former President Trump’s influence and the upcoming release of crucial US PCE inflation data. Understanding these dynamics is key for anyone tracking global liquidity and risk appetite. Why Is Asia FX Muted Against the US Dollar Outlook? Asian currencies have been trading within tight ranges recently. This lack of significant movement in Asia FX reflects a wait-and-see approach by investors. Several factors contribute to this: US Dollar Strength: The US dollar has shown resilience, stemming some of its recent losses. A stronger dollar typically puts pressure on emerging market currencies, including those in Asia. Economic Data Uncertainty: Markets are anticipating key economic indicators, particularly from the US, which could signal future monetary policy direction. Geopolitical and Trade Tensions: Lingering concerns over global trade relations, potentially exacerbated by political rhetoric, encourage caution. The US dollar outlook is currently the primary driver, with investors reluctant to make big bets on Asian currencies until there is more clarity on the path of US interest rates and trade policies. How Could Trump Trade Tariffs Impact Currency Markets? Discussions around the potential return or expansion of Trump trade tariffs are injecting a significant layer of uncertainty into the market. While not enacted yet, the prospect of higher tariffs on goods from countries like China or others could have profound effects: Disruption to Trade Flows: Tariffs impede international trade, potentially slowing economic growth in affected countries. Currency Volatility: Countries facing tariffs might see their currencies weaken as exports become more expensive and their economic outlook dims. Conversely, the US dollar could strengthen initially due to safe-haven flows, but face pressure later if tariffs hurt US consumers or businesses. Supply Chain Shifts: Businesses might relocate production to avoid tariffs, leading to long-term shifts in capital flows and currency demand. The mere possibility of new Trump trade tariffs is enough to keep currency traders on edge, contributing to the muted activity seen in Asia FX as market participants await clearer signals. What Does PCE Inflation Data Mean for the Fed and USD? Perhaps the most immediate market mover on the horizon is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data from the United States. This is the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, making it critical for assessing the future path of interest rates. Here’s why it matters for the US dollar outlook: PCE Data Point Market Reaction (Likely) USD Impact (Likely) Higher than Expected Inflation Increases bets on delayed Fed rate cuts. Positive (USD strengthens). In Line with Expectations Maintains current rate cut expectations. Neutral to slightly Positive. Lower than Expected Inflation Increases bets on earlier Fed rate cuts. Negative (USD weakens). The PCE inflation data provides crucial insights into consumer spending and price pressures, directly influencing the Fed’s decisions. A strong report could reinforce the dollar’s recent gains, while a weak report might reverse them, significantly impacting global currency pairs, including those involving Asia FX. Navigating the Forex Market Analysis Ahead: What’s Next? For traders and investors watching the Forex market analysis, the coming days require careful attention. The combination of potential Trump trade tariffs creating structural uncertainty and the immediate impact of PCE inflation data on the US dollar outlook means volatility could increase rapidly. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor PCE Data Closely: The headline and core PCE numbers will be key. Pay attention to month-over-month and year-over-year figures. Watch Trade Rhetoric: Any concrete statements or proposals regarding tariffs will be significant market events. Observe Central Bank Reactions: See how Asian central banks respond to movements in the US dollar and potential trade impacts. Manage Risk: Given the potential for sharp moves, employing risk management strategies is prudent. The current environment calls for patience and readiness to react to incoming information. The muted Asia FX performance is likely the calm before a potential storm, triggered by either economic data or political developments. In conclusion, the global currency landscape, particularly Asia FX, is currently positioned delicately between the immediate influence of US economic data, like the pivotal PCE inflation data, and the longer-term structural uncertainty introduced by discussions around Trump trade tariffs. The US dollar outlook remains central to this narrative. As these factors converge, the Forex market analysis suggests a period of potential volatility ahead. Staying informed about these key drivers is essential for navigating the complexities of international currency markets.

While XRP continues to wait on regulatory clarity, two standout cryptos, Bittensor (TAO) and Remittix (RTX) , are gaining serious ground. TAO shows strong recovery signs with bullish technicals, while Remittix is making real waves with its game-changing crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol. The XRP price remains in limbo, so these two tokens could deliver major returns. Ripple’s bold 2025 moves could spark a $20 XRP price surge Ripple Labs is rewriting the rules in 2025, and its aggressive strategy may finally be tipping the scales in XRP’s favor. The recent launch of XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) immediately impacted, generating $19 million in notional volume on day one—a clear sign of growing institutional appetite. But it’s Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Roads that has insiders buzzing. Source Hidden Roads is registered with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC). It is a key player in the U.S. financial system, handling over $11 trillion in daily trades through its Government Securities Division. If Ripple can successfully tap into this infrastructure, it would mark one of the crypto asset's most significant institutional integrations. Analysts suggest this could double capital inflows into XRP and trigger the kind of market expansion rarely seen in the digital asset space. Adding more fuel to the fire is the rising anticipation of an XRP ETF. Confidence is climbing with the Ripple vs. SEC case reportedly nearing a final settlement. Polymarket data shows odds of ETF approval by December 2025 at 83%, a figure holding steady despite fluctuations earlier this year. Bittensor (TAO) signals short-term recovery as technicals turn bullish Bittensor (TAO) shows early signs of a potential rebound, trading at $439.56 after a 1.05% gain in the past four hours. Following a brief correction, the asset is regaining momentum, supported by bullish technical indicators. Bittensor holds above key moving averages, with a bullish MACD crossover and a supportive RSI pointing to a strengthening short-term trend. Source If Bittensor remains above the critical $430 support level, analysts expect a possible retest of the $450 resistance zone. A confirmed break above this range, especially with a spike in buying volume, could pave the way for a stronger upside move. Traders are advised to watch the Bollinger Bands and RSI closely for signs of continued bullish momentum as Bittensor attempts to reclaim higher ground. Remittix sets the standard for utility-driven crypto as presale heats up Remittix is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in crypto. It offers what many others promise but rarely deliver—real-world financial utility. Its PayFi protocol allows users to send crypto and have it arrive as fiat directly in global bank accounts. With support for over 100 cryptocurrencies and over 30 fiat currencies, Remittix enables same-day settlements through local payment networks at a 1% fee. It’s fast, simple, and removes the usual roadblocks of cross-border finance. Currently in presale at just $0.0781, the native RTX token is drawing serious attention. Over two-thirds of the token supply has been claimed, and analysts are forecasting a strong debut once RTX hits major exchanges. Backed by a BlockSAFU-audited wallet system and offering staking rewards between 4% and 8% annually, RTX is built for utility and long-term investor appeal. Unlike meme-driven hype or slow-to-develop roadmaps, Remittix is already functional and focused. It’s connecting the speed of DeFi with the stability of traditional banking, providing a seamless bridge that many crypto projects only aim for. Conclusion With its PayFi protocol, strong investor momentum, and practical use case, Remittix is now positioning itself as the most compelling crypto to buy. While XRP and Bittensor may recover with time, RTX is already solving real-world problems, making this presale a rare opportunity in today’s crowded market.

By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape. Overview Cryptocurrency Celestia Token TIA Price $2.37 (-5.4%) Market cap $1.68 Billion Trading volume (24-hour) $87.3 Million Circulating supply 639.85 Million TIA All-time high $20.91; Feb 10, 2024 All-time low $2.03; Oct 31, 2023 24-hour high $2.57 24-hour low $2.34 TIA price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $2.37 Price Prediction $8.48 (+400%) Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 9.33% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $2.72 200-Day SMA $4.07 14-Day RSI 47.26 TIA price analysis: TIA price faces a bearish pressure toward $2.3 TIA price analysis shows bearish volatility toward $2.3 Resistance for TIA is present at $2.724 Support for TIA/USD is present at $2.28 The TIA price analysis for May 30 confirms that TIA is witnessing bearish volatility toward $2.3 level.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price attempted to hold above $2.5 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. However, buyers’ failure triggered a bearish rally toward $2.3. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction May 2025 Celestia’s price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $100K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.8 and a maximum of $3.4, with an average of $2.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction May 2025 $1.8 $2.5 $3.4 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $2.3, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Experienced Analyst Evaluated!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-does-the-pullback-in-bitcoin-tell-us-what-to-expect-from-btc-next-experienced-analyst-evaluated/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) falls to $105,000 after hitting a record high of $111,000, investors are wondering whether this is a healthy pullback or a turning point that could lead to further declines. While there are many predictions at this point, Derive founder Nick Forster stated that the pullback is healthy and that recent movements show that Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase rather than a downward trend. Nick Forster noted that Bitcoin’s current consolidation will give the market time to digest recent gains before it enters a new uptrend. Stating that this consolidation phase will prepare Bitcoin for the next rise, the analyst stated that it is healthy and not a bearish signal. “While the recent rally above $111,000 in Bitcoin is noteworthy, the current price action suggests a consolidation phase rather than an imminent uptrend or downtrend. “Such a consolidation phase would be healthy ahead of another significant rally and would give the necessary time to prepare for the next rally.” Forster said that according to historical data, the third quarter was a weak period for Bitcoin, but argued that a different scenario could occur in 2025. “Historically, Q3 is seen as a bearish period, but this year, with positive factors such as regulatory changes and increased institutional inflows, Bitcoin has the potential to deliver exceptional and surprising performance in Q3. At this point, the FED's interest rate decision on June 18 could be a critical and important turning point for the market.” *This is not investment advice.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Sui: An Object-Centric Blockchain Platform Enhancing Web3 Usability Sui is a layer-1 blockchain platform designed to support global adoption by offering a secure, scalable, and powerful development environment. It utilizes a novel object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address inefficiencies in existing blockchain architectures. This approach aims to improve the creation and management of digital assets efficiently and securely. Prioritizing user experience, Sui eliminates common barriers in blockchain interactions. Innovations such as zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks enhance accessibility and usability within the Web3 ecosystem. These features may contribute to the potential of the SUI coin in the current market cycle, positioning it as a technology-focused asset in the blockchain space. Chainlink: Decentralized Network Bridging Smart Contracts and Real-World Data Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts to external data sources, APIs, and systems. It enables smart contracts on blockchain platforms to securely interact with real-world data, bridging the gap between blockchain and off-chain applications. The network uses a reputation score mechanism to ensure data accuracy. Chainlink operates through a three-step process: data retrieval by oracles, data aggregation to verify accuracy, and secure delivery of data to smart contracts. It incorporates both on-chain and off-chain components for efficient data processing, with on-chain contracts managing data requests and off-chain oracles fetching and delivering external data. The LINK token is essential to Chainlink’s ecosystem. Node operators are rewarded with LINK tokens for providing data services, which supports the network’s security and decentralization. Users pay with LINK tokens for access to data, and staking mechanisms help maintain the system’s reliability. Chainlink’s ability to enhance smart contract functionality by enabling interaction with real-world data may increase its significance in blockchain applications. In the current market cycle, the demand for decentralized oracle services like Chainlink may influence its attractiveness, but market conditions can vary. Consideration of the technology’s role in the broader blockchain ecosystem may be important for potential users. NEAR Protocol: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications NEAR Protocol is a blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications. It uses sharding technology, called Nightshade, to improve efficiency and scalability. This allows the network to process many transactions quickly. NEAR operates on a distributed network, similar to traditional data storage systems, but it is decentralized. The protocol was founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin and raised over $20 million from major venture firms. NEAR offers features such as the Rainbow Bridge, which enables transfers of tokens from Ethereum, and Aurora, a Layer 2 solution that leverages Ethereum’s technologies for better performance and lower fees. These tools make NEAR compatible with Ethereum, potentially attracting developers and users from that ecosystem. Considering the current market cycle, NEAR’s focus on scalability and interoperability may make it an attractive option for those interested in decentralized applications and blockchain technology. Avalanche (AVAX): A Fast and Eco-Friendly Blockchain with Customizable Subnets Avalanche is a Layer-1 blockchain platform known for its low fees and rapid transactions, capable of processing up to 4,500 transactions per second. It utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, aiming for transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that facilitate various operations, including asset transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, used for transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and operating customizable Subnets. The unique features of Avalanche, such as its eco-friendly operations and the ability to launch customizable Subnets, position it as a versatile platform in the blockchain space. Its fast transaction speeds and low fees make it suitable for a range of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise solutions. The hybrid consensus mechanism enhances scalability and security, potentially addressing some of the limitations found in other blockchain platforms. The strong utility of AVAX within the ecosystem, from payments to staking and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains, suggests significant potential for adoption and development.

We’re seeing something remarkable happening with Bitcoin inflows – the sheer amount of capital pouring into the leading cryptocurrency is starting to look eerily similar to the peak of the last major Bitcoin bull run in 2021. This isn’t just a small uptick; it’s a significant trend that could have major implications for the future BTC price and the overall Crypto market analysis . What Do These Massive Bitcoin Inflows Tell Us? According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr, who shared his insights on X, the daily capital inflows into Bitcoin are currently averaging around $1.8 billion. To put that into perspective, this figure is comparable to the levels witnessed in November 2021. Why is that date significant? Well, that’s when Bitcoin was trading near its then-all-time high, hovering around the $64,000 mark. But it gets even more interesting. The current cycle has already seen days with even larger inflows. Peaks near the $73,000 and $92,000 price levels saw astonishing inflows of $3.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. These numbers are not only higher than the recent daily average but also surpass many peaks from previous cycles. What does this data fundamentally mean? Capital inflows represent the money moving into Bitcoin, whether through direct purchases, exchange deposits, or investment vehicles like ETFs. High inflows indicate strong buying pressure and, crucially, robust investor demand . It suggests that market participants, both large and small, are actively accumulating BTC, even at relatively high price levels. Here’s a quick look at the inflow comparison: Current Average Daily Inflows: ~$1.8 billion 2021 Peak Inflows (around $64k BTC price): Comparable to $1.8 billion average Recent Peak Inflows (near $73k BTC price): $3.6 billion Recent Peak Inflows (near $92k BTC price): $4.5 billion This comparison highlights that not only is the *average* inflow rate returning to previous bull market highs, but the *peak* inflow events in this cycle have already exceeded those from 2021. This is a powerful indicator of sustained and growing interest in Bitcoin. Comparing Today’s Bitcoin Inflows to the 2021 Bitcoin Bull Run Peak Drawing parallels between the current market environment and the 2021 Bitcoin bull run peak is essential for understanding the potential trajectory of BTC price . In November 2021, the market was characterized by euphoric sentiment, widespread retail participation, and significant institutional interest following a strong upward trend throughout the year. Today, while sentiment might not be pure euphoria across the board, the data on Bitcoin inflows suggests a level of capital commitment that mirrors, or even surpasses, that peak period. This is happening even after Bitcoin has already achieved new all-time highs in this cycle. This persistent buying activity, even above previous peaks, is a strong signal of underlying strength and confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. One key difference between now and 2021 is the regulatory landscape and the availability of investment products. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year has opened up a significant new channel for capital to flow into Bitcoin, particularly from institutional investors and traditional finance platforms. This structural change could be a major driver behind the sustained high investor demand we are observing. While the dollar amounts of inflows are comparable or higher, it’s also worth considering the context of market capitalization. Bitcoin’s market cap is significantly larger now than it was in 2021. However, the *rate* of capital inflow relative to market cap or trading volume still provides valuable insight into the intensity of buying pressure. What’s Driving This Strong Investor Demand for BTC Price? Several factors likely contribute to the impressive investor demand reflected in the recent Bitcoin inflows : Spot Bitcoin ETFs: As mentioned, these vehicles provide easy, regulated access to Bitcoin exposure for a wide range of investors, including institutions and wealth managers who were previously hesitant or unable to invest directly. The daily flows into these ETFs are closely watched indicators of institutional interest. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In an environment of inflation concerns, geopolitical tensions, and unpredictable monetary policies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by some as a potential hedge or store of value, similar to digital gold. The Halving Event: While the most recent Bitcoin halving occurred recently, the narrative surrounding the event – which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market – has been a major catalyst for price speculation and accumulation in the months leading up to it. Investors anticipate that reduced supply combined with increasing demand will drive up the BTC price . Growing Adoption and Recognition: Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream recognition and adoption, with more companies and individuals understanding its technology and potential. This increasing awareness fuels broader investor demand . FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): As Bitcoin’s price rises and positive news circulates, retail investors may experience FOMO, leading to increased buying activity and contributing to inflows. Understanding these drivers is crucial for any comprehensive Crypto market analysis . They paint a picture of a market where conviction remains high, despite price volatility. How Do High Inflows Impact the BTC Price and Crypto Market Analysis? High Bitcoin inflows are generally interpreted as a bullish signal for the BTC price . Increased buying pressure, especially at scale, tends to push prices upward, assuming supply remains constant or grows at a slower pace (which is the case with Bitcoin’s fixed supply and halving mechanism). The fact that significant inflows are occurring even after Bitcoin has surpassed previous all-time highs suggests that investors are not just buying dips but are confident in its potential for further appreciation. The large peak inflows near $73k and $92k indicate that new capital is entering the market at higher price points, absorbing supply and potentially setting new support levels. For broader Crypto market analysis , strong Bitcoin performance often has a ripple effect. Bitcoin is the market leader, and its trends frequently influence altcoins. Sustained Bitcoin inflows and a rising BTC price can boost overall market confidence, leading to increased activity and inflows into other cryptocurrencies as well. However, it’s important to remember that inflows are just one metric. While they indicate strong buying pressure, they don’t guarantee a linear price increase. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and large outflows can occur, potentially leading to price corrections. External factors, regulatory news, and global economic events can also significantly impact the market. Are There Any Challenges or Risks Associated with These Inflows? While high Bitcoin inflows are generally positive, they aren’t without potential risks: Potential for Rapid Outflows: Just as capital can flow in quickly, it can also flow out rapidly, especially if market sentiment changes or a significant negative event occurs. This can lead to sharp price declines. Market Overheating: Extremely high inflows coupled with rapid price increases could indicate an overheated market, potentially leading to speculative bubbles that are prone to bursting. Concentration Risk: If a significant portion of inflows is concentrated among a few large players (like specific ETFs or institutions), their actions could have a disproportionate impact on the market. A thorough Crypto market analysis must consider both the positive signals from inflows and these potential risks. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts What can you take away from this analysis of Bitcoin inflows and investor demand ? Monitor Inflow Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange net flows, ETF flows, and on-chain analysis of capital movements. These provide real-time insights into buying and selling pressure. Understand the Context: Don’t look at inflow data in isolation. Consider it alongside other factors like macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and technical analysis of the BTC price charts. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: While high inflows are bullish, the crypto market remains volatile. Ensure your investment decisions align with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. Focus on Long-Term Trends: The sustained nature of these high inflows, mirroring the 2021 Bitcoin bull run levels, suggests a potentially enduring shift in investor demand . Consider the long-term implications rather than just short-term price movements. Conclusion: Bitcoin Inflows Signal Enduring Strength The data is compelling: Bitcoin inflows are currently rivaling, and in some instances exceeding, the levels seen during the peak of the 2021 Bitcoin bull run . This isn’t a fleeting trend; it reflects powerful and sustained investor demand , likely fueled by new investment vehicles like spot ETFs, macroeconomic factors, and the inherent appeal of Bitcoin as a scarce digital asset. While the current BTC price fluctuates (CoinMarketCap data shows BTC trading around $106,142.73, down 1.38% over the past day at the time of the original analysis), the underlying capital flows suggest a market with strong conviction. This robust buying pressure is a significant factor to consider in any Crypto market analysis and points towards continued potential for growth, although vigilance regarding market risks remains essential.

Since then, Bitcoin has had multiple failed attempts to break above this level, which has led to an increase in bearish pressure. Over the past several days, price action has begun forming a sequence of lower highs on the 4-hour timeframe, which, according to technical analysis on the TradingView platform, is interpreted as a signal that bullish momentum may be losing steam. Resistance Rejects Again With Double Top Risk The analyst behind the TradingView post highlighted the clear rejection pattern near the $111,000 to $112,000 zone, which Bitcoin has repeatedly tested since last week but has failed to break through. This repeated failure to break higher says that bullish momentum is fading fast, especially as retail buyers are now somewhat hesitant to buy at this zone. Related Reading: Crypto Market Today: 5 Bullish Catalysts To Watch That Say Bitcoin Price Is Going Higher According to the chart analysis, the current price movement is beginning to resemble a classic double top structure, which is a technical formation that often signals a shift from bullish control to bearish dominance. Given the weakening follow-through on each upward attempt, this setup could be the early signal of a more significant market reversal in the days ahead. With this in mind, the analyst illustrated this outlook with a projected zigzag path on a 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart, anticipating that another rejection from the resistance band could trigger a cascading move downward. Furthermore, these multiple rejections have led to a simultaneous weakening of support around $105,000, and this level could give way at any time soon. Bitcoin Might Drop To $102,000 Support Zone If this projected zigzag path plays out, Bitcoin’s price could break lower in the coming days and head toward a support area located between $101,000 and $102,000. This zone comes into focus because it acted as a strong support level between May 14 and May 19. Bitcoin eventually found footing around this level to stage a rebound that ultimately pushed it to the all-time high of $111,900 reached on May 22. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next Although the bull market narrative is still dominant in the long term, the current price action has shifted the short-term tone of the market to bearish. This analysis addresses that potential, and Bitcoin could revisit the $101,000 to $102,000 before another leg up. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,272, down by 2.5% in the past 24 hours. The $106,800 support level has already given way, and the focus is now on holding above $105,000. If Bitcoin fails to hold above $105,000 in the coming trading sessions, it could lead to a cascading downturn towards $101,000 during the weekend.

Keeping a pulse on the market is crucial, and one powerful tool in a trader’s arsenal is the long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures . This metric gives us a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment among traders on derivatives exchanges. Today, we’re diving into the data from the past 24 hours to see where traders are leaning. Are they betting on Bitcoin’s price going up (long) or down (short)? Let’s break down the numbers and see what they might tell us about the current market sentiment . What Exactly is the Long-Short Ratio? Before we look at the data, let’s quickly clarify what the long-short ratio represents. In simple terms, it’s the ratio of the total number of long positions to the total number of short positions open on a particular exchange or across multiple exchanges for a specific asset, like BTC perpetual futures . Perpetual futures contracts are popular in crypto trading because they don’t have an expiry date, unlike traditional futures. A ratio above 1 suggests more traders are holding long positions than short positions, indicating a generally bullish sentiment. A ratio below 1 suggests more traders are holding short positions, indicating a generally bearish sentiment. A ratio close to 1 suggests a relatively balanced sentiment. This ratio is a valuable piece of data for anyone involved in Bitcoin analysis and derivatives trading. Why Does This Ratio Matter for Crypto Trading? Understanding the long-short ratio is vital for several reasons: Gauging Market Sentiment: It provides a direct look into whether the crowd is predominantly bullish or bearish on BTC perpetual futures . This is a key indicator of market sentiment . Identifying Potential Reversals: Sometimes, extreme ratios can signal potential price reversals. For example, an excessively high long ratio might indicate an overheated market ripe for a correction as crowded long positions get liquidated. Informing Trading Strategies: Traders use this data alongside other technical and fundamental analysis to make informed decisions about opening or closing positions. It’s not a standalone predictor, but it’s a significant puzzle piece in the complex world of crypto trading . Analyzing the Latest 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Data Let’s get straight to the numbers for BTC perpetual futures over the last 24 hours: Total Across Sampled Exchanges: Long Positions: 48.57% Short Positions: 51.43% This overall figure shows a slight lean towards short positions globally across the exchanges included in this aggregation. The long-short ratio here is just under 1 (approximately 0.94), indicating a marginally bearish bias in aggregate market sentiment . How Do Top Exchanges Compare in Long-Short Ratios? Looking at individual exchanges gives us a more granular view. Here are the figures for three major platforms known for their high volume in BTC perpetual futures : Exchange Long % Short % Long-Short Ratio Binance 48.63% 51.37% ~0.95 Bybit 47.20% 52.80% ~0.89 Gate.io 47.42% 52.58% ~0.90 As you can see, all three top exchanges mirror the overall trend, showing a slight majority of short positions over long positions. Bybit and Gate.io show a slightly stronger short bias compared to Binance, although the differences are not dramatic. This consistency across major platforms reinforces the observation of a prevailing, albeit slight, bearish edge in market sentiment for BTC perpetual futures during this period. What Can We Infer from This Bitcoin Analysis? Based on these long-short ratio figures for BTC perpetual futures : The immediate market sentiment appears cautiously bearish. More traders are positioned to profit from a price decline than a price increase. The ratios are not extremely skewed in either direction (e.g., 70% long or short), suggesting that while there’s a short bias, it’s not an overwhelming consensus. This might indicate uncertainty or a lack of strong conviction for a major move in either direction based solely on this data point. Consistency across major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io adds some weight to the observed trend. For those performing Bitcoin analysis , this data point suggests vigilance. While a slight short bias exists, it’s crucial to combine this with other indicators. Actionable Insights for Crypto Trading How can traders use this long-short ratio information when trading BTC perpetual futures ? Context is Key: Don’t trade based on the ratio alone. Use it as one data point among many (price action, volume, funding rates, news). Watch for Changes: Monitor how the ratio evolves over time. A rapid shift towards one side could signal changing sentiment or potential volatility. Consider Counter-Trend Strategies: In some cases, extreme ratios can be contrarian indicators. However, the current ratios are not extreme, so this is less applicable here. Manage Risk: Regardless of the ratio, always use stop-losses and manage your position size when trading leveraged products like BTC perpetual futures . Challenges and Limitations of Using Long-Short Ratios While helpful, relying solely on the long-short ratio has limitations: Data Source: Ratios can vary slightly depending on the data provider and the exchanges included in their aggregation. Trader Intent: The ratio reflects open positions, but doesn’t reveal the full strategy or conviction behind them. Some short positions might be hedges, not speculative bets on a price drop. Lagging Indicator: The ratio reflects positions already taken, not necessarily future actions. Therefore, integrate this Bitcoin analysis tool wisely into your broader crypto trading framework. Conclusion: What Does This Mean for BTC Perpetual Futures? The recent 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures reveals a slight lean towards short positions across major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io. This indicates a marginally bearish market sentiment among derivatives traders during this specific period. While not an extreme deviation, this trend is consistent and provides valuable insight for those engaged in crypto trading and Bitcoin analysis . Remember to use this data point in conjunction with other market indicators to make informed trading decisions.

Also, Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, could surge to $10,000, driven by growing institutional demand. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL) , an AI-based DeFi cryptocurrency, is projected to explode toward $0.90 thanks to its unique, innovative platform. Unilabs is adopting AI to take DeFi investment to the next level by helping its users find the best crypto investment options. Ripple (XRP) Price Predicted To Hit $5 As Active Addresses Hit New High The Ripple price showed poor performance in the last week of May. The Ripple price has been consolidating between $2.30 and $2.50, according to CoinMarketCap data. Nevertheless, Glassnode reveals that the number of active addresses on the XRP Ledger has crossed 360k, the highest ever. This rise in addresses shows positive sentiment from the market, especially now that they expect the Ripple price to soar to a new peak. A post by Brett, meanwhile, shows the Ripple coin breaking out of a 7-year triangle this year. The analyst says momentum is building in the market, and this could push the price of Ripple to $4.43. Another commentator, Crypto Tony, also thinks the Ripple price may climb to $5.00 after the start of the bull run. From a technical perspective, the $2 has been a strong support region for the Ripple price over the past month. The Stochastic Fast (14) flashes a buy signal, supporting a potential uptrend. Ethereum (ETH) Breaks Out; Analyst Says $10,000 is Possible The Ethereum price has broken past the $2,600 level after a period of sideways trading. It appears positive momentum is gradually returning to the market, and the Ethereum price might set a new weekly high in the next few days. Currently, CoinMarketCap data shows the price of Ethereum has soared by 6.1% in the weekly timeframe. In terms of future targets, CryptoGoos believes the value of ETH could rise to $10,000 this cycle. Another top expert called Kaleo told his followers the Ethereum price might soar to $20,000 this cycle. Meanwhile, VikingXBT said the altcoin price could rise to $4,100 in the short term. However, the analyst says it must flip $2,720 and $2,850. On the flip side, the Ethereum price has very strong support around the $2,500 region. This level has to hold in the coming weeks. Otherwise, the ETH price will soar to upper levels. Unilabs (UNIL) Taps Into AI To Offer Investors Automated Earnings Potential Recent data from Statista projects the AI market to surpass $826 billion by 2030, while DeFi continues expanding with over $120 billion locked-in protocols as of Q2 2025. This convergence of AI and DeFi is creating a golden opportunity, and Unilabs (UNIL) is leading the charge with a powerful, all-in-one crypto investment platform. Unilabs is a next-gen DeFi protocol powered by artificial intelligence, built to automate portfolio strategies, reduce risk, and maximize returns. At its core, the platform offers four specialized funds (AI, BTC, RWA, and Mining) giving investors diversified exposure to top-performing sectors without the need for active management. One standout feature is the Dynamic Asset Rebalancer, which uses real-time AI analytics to shift fund allocations based on volatility, sentiment, and market momentum. This helps preserve gains and protect capital during unpredictable market swings. Unilabs’ token, $UNIL, is now in presale at $0.0051, with over $1.37 million raised. Investors using the referral code UNIL30 receive a 30% bonus on their deposits. If the token captures a fraction of the DeFi market, it could spike to $0.9, making it a good crypto to buy. The Best Cryptos To Buy for Profit in 2025 The crypto space is entering a new era, one not defined by hype but by real value. Ripple’s strong payment infrastructure, Ethereum’s ecosystem leadership, and Unilabs’ AI-based investment model position them as the best altcoins to watch out for. While the Ripple price could rally to $5, Ethereum price may hit $10,000. UNIL, on the other hand, could outshine both, given its low market cap.

Despite recent volatility reflected in the latest crypto prices today, SHIB’s strong community backing and expanding use cases keep it in the conversation as a popular crypto coin for both short-term and long-term investors. While SHIB rides waves of hype and speculation, the market is also turning its focus towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency poised to deliver explosive returns and possibly outperform established tokens in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a total of $9.5 million from over 11,400 purchasers of its tokens. The official presale structure has then priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, ahead of a Phase 6 price of $0.035. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment. Shiba Inu’s Struggle to Break Through Key Levels Amid Market Uncertainty Trading at $0.000014, Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most talked-about cheap cryptos to invest in today, underpinned by its loyal fan base and history of wild price swings. Despite this, SHIB has failed to overcome above the $0.00002 resistance level, depicting more widespread market hesitation and unpredictable cryptocurrency prices today. Its current price indicates recurrent supply concentration and sentiment issues, issues that continue to leave investors in a state of wariness. However, its solid standing in the memecoin universe ensures that it is still a popular darling among those seeking to balance whether to invest in today for near-term gains. In the meantime, as new cryptocurrencies pop up with new models, tokens such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are attracting early attention for their promising potential upside leading into 2025. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. The periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stablecoin Secures Future with Completed Certik Audit A new USD-pegged stablecoin protected by the Ethereum network and built on it is being introduced by Mutuum Finance. Thanks to its extra collateral, the MUTM stablecoin can prevent the type of collapse that algorithmic tokens cannot avoid. By running on smart contracts recently audited and confirmed by Certik, Mutuum Finance becomes a trustworthy solution used by a wide variety of users and large entities. Using a one-of-a-kind buy-and-distribute method and an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM unites innovation, security and community trust. Investing early allows adventurous traders to join long-term successful companies in this new altcoin. Shiba Inu (SHIB) may push for $0.0001, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining faster momentum. With $9.5M raised, 11,400+ investors, and 2x ROI baked in at launch, MUTM is built on real DeFi use, a Certik audit, and a strong token model. Don’t miss out—join the presale now.

The world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, finding new ways to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and everyday life. A significant step in this direction has just been taken by Ether.fi , a prominent player in the Ethereum ecosystem. What is Ether.fi and Why is This Launch Significant? Ether.fi began its journey primarily as a leading liquid restaking protocol on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and receive eETH, a liquid token representing their staked and restaked position. This model quickly gained traction, accumulating substantial user deposits, reportedly reaching $6.8 billion. However, Ether.fi’s ambitions clearly extend beyond just restaking. They are actively transforming into what some might call a ‘neobank’ for the decentralized age, offering services that enable users to interact with traditional finance and commerce using their crypto holdings. The launch of Ether.fi Hotels is a powerful illustration of this transformation. It’s not just another feature; it’s a direct pathway for users to leverage their Ether.fi ecosystem participation for tangible benefits in the physical world. This move is significant because it: Enhances Utility: Provides a practical, high-value use case for funds within the Ether.fi ecosystem and the broader crypto space. Promotes Adoption: Makes crypto assets more appealing to a wider audience by demonstrating their utility beyond trading or holding. Bridges Web3 and Real-World: Directly connects decentralized finance activities (like restaking) with traditional commerce (like travel booking). Increases Ecosystem Stickiness: Offers compelling reasons for users to keep and utilize funds within the Ether.fi platform. By enabling crypto hotel booking , Ether.fi is tapping into a massive global market, offering a unique value proposition that could attract both existing crypto holders and newcomers interested in the benefits. How Does Ether.fi Hotels Work? Booking Your Stay with Crypto The new service, Ether.fi Hotels , allows users to book luxury hotels across the globe. The key to unlocking this service lies with the Ether.fi Cash Card . While the original source is concise, the implication is that users fund their Cash Card using assets within the Ether.fi ecosystem (likely converted from their crypto holdings), and then use this card to make bookings through the dedicated hotel service platform. The service is offered in collaboration with Entravel, a global travel platform. This partnership is crucial as it provides the necessary infrastructure and access to a wide inventory of hotels worldwide. Users are directed to the Entravel platform, presumably via a link or integration within the Ether.fi interface, to search for and book their accommodations. The process is designed to be straightforward, mirroring traditional online travel booking experiences but powered by a crypto-native backend and funding mechanism. Unlock Value: The Allure of 5% Crypto Rewards One of the most attractive aspects of Ether.fi Hotels is the generous reward structure. Users receive a substantial 5% cash back on every booking made through the service using their Ether.fi Cash Card. In the context of luxury hotel bookings, where costs can be significant, a 5% reward can translate into substantial savings or accumulated value. These rewards are likely distributed back to the user within the Ether.fi ecosystem, potentially as crypto or a form of credit usable within the platform. This incentivizes users not only to book through the service but also to remain engaged with Ether.fi’s broader offerings. Consider the benefits: Direct Savings: A percentage of your travel spending is returned to you. Value Accumulation: Rewards can be held, potentially appreciating in value, or used for future services. Incentive for Crypto Spending: Encourages using crypto assets for practical purposes rather than solely holding them. Competitive Edge: A 5% reward rate is highly competitive compared to many traditional travel rewards programs. This reward mechanism is a smart play by Ether.fi to drive adoption and usage of both their Cash Card and the new hotel booking feature, positioning it as a compelling option for travelers who are also crypto holders. Exploring the Potential of Web3 Travel The launch of Ether.fi Hotels is a significant step in the emerging sector of web3 travel . This concept envisions a future where travel services – from booking flights and hotels to managing loyalty points and accessing unique experiences – are facilitated by blockchain technology and decentralized applications. Web3 travel promises benefits such as: Web3 Travel Benefit Description Increased Transparency Booking details and loyalty points potentially recorded on a transparent ledger. Enhanced Security Cryptographic security protecting transactions and personal data. New Ownership Models Possibility of owning fractional stakes in travel assets or unique travel NFTs. Loyalty Program Innovation Tokenized loyalty points that can be traded or used across different platforms. Direct Peer-to-Peer Interaction Potentially cutting out intermediaries, leading to cost savings. While Ether.fi’s current offering focuses on the booking and rewards aspect using their existing infrastructure, it contributes to building the foundation for a more decentralized and user-centric travel ecosystem. By demonstrating the viability and appeal of using crypto for travel, they pave the way for future innovations in this space. Challenges and Considerations for Crypto Travel While the concept of using crypto for travel is exciting, there are challenges to consider: Price Volatility: The value of crypto assets can fluctuate significantly, which could impact the effective cost of a booking or the value of earned rewards. User Friendliness: Despite efforts, interacting with crypto platforms and concepts like Cash Cards might still be complex for mainstream users. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto and its intersection with traditional finance (like payments and travel) is still evolving globally. Limited Acceptance (Currently): While Ether.fi’s service offers global hotel booking, the broader acceptance of direct crypto payments for travel is still limited compared to traditional methods. Ether.fi’s approach of using a Cash Card acts as a buffer against direct crypto volatility during the transaction itself (as the card likely uses converted fiat or stablecoins), but the underlying value of the user’s holdings remains subject to market swings. Educating users and simplifying the process will be key to overcoming these hurdles. Getting Started: How Can You Book Your Next Trip? Based on the announcement, the first step would be to be an Ether.fi user, likely with an activated Ether.fi Cash Card. Users would then access the hotel booking service, presumably through the Ether.fi dashboard or a dedicated link provided by the protocol in partnership with Entravel. From there, the experience should be similar to booking on any major travel website: Log in to your Ether.fi account/dashboard. Navigate to the ‘Hotels’ or ‘Travel’ section. Search for your desired destination, dates, and hotel. Select your room and proceed to payment. Choose the Ether.fi Cash Card as your payment method. Complete the booking and automatically qualify for the 5% cash back rewards. Specific details on funding the Cash Card and the exact interface flow would be available directly on the Ether.fi platform. The Future is Bright for Ether.fi and Crypto Travel The launch of Ether.fi Hotels is more than just a new feature; it’s a statement about the protocol’s vision to become a comprehensive financial platform that bridges the crypto world with real-world utility. By starting with high-value services like luxury hotel booking and offering compelling incentives like 5% crypto rewards , Ether.fi is positioning itself at the forefront of the nascent web3 travel sector. As the restaking protocol continues to grow its user base and integrated services, we can anticipate further expansion into other areas of traditional finance and commerce. This move sets a precedent for other crypto platforms looking to increase the utility and adoption of their ecosystems. Conclusion Ether.fi’s foray into the travel industry with its global hotel booking service, powered by the Ether.fi Cash Card and offering attractive 5% rewards, marks a significant milestone. It demonstrates the growing potential for crypto protocols to evolve into full-fledged financial platforms providing tangible benefits for users in their everyday lives. This development is a win for Ether.fi users and a promising sign for the broader adoption of crypto and the future of web3 travel.

We still hold our Bitcoins. And as one of the biggest clubs in the world, we are the biggest player in the sports ecosystem buying Bitcoin.” This is not PSG’s first foray into crypto. One of the club’s first blockchain activities was launching a fan token and running a validator node on the Chiliz blockchain. PSG also became the first major football club to launch a fan token on Socios.com. PSG also has multi-year agreements with Crypto.com and Bitpanda as exchange partners.

Over the past few days, XRP has experienced significant short-term price action, moving within the precise parameters EGRAG had outlined. Whether it was a bounce off key support levels, a breakout over resistance, or a consolidation pattern leading to a surge, the price behavior aligned point-for-point with his forecast. Such accuracy is particularly impressive given the complex mix of market factors currently weighing on XRP, from macroeconomic pressures to ongoing regulatory headlines. EGRAG’s analysis provided clarity for many traders, offering a roadmap in an environment where noise often drowns out the signal. His correct short-term call not only reinforced his standing as a top analyst but also gave XRP traders a valuable advantage in navigating volatile conditions. Why This Matters for the XRP Community The XRP community is no stranger to bold predictions and flashy promises. However, not all analysts bring the same level of rigor or accountability to their forecasts. EGRAG stands apart by consistently backing his claims with detailed reasoning and by following up on his calls, whether right or wrong. This builds trust and encourages a culture of learning, where followers are not just handed predictions but are also given the tools and insights to understand the “why” behind them.

EGRAG’s success isn’t just about guessing price movements; it’s about interpreting the underlying market structure and offering realistic, data-backed expectations. The Bigger Picture for XRP While short-term price predictions grab attention, they are only part of XRP’s broader narrative. Ripple, the company closely linked to XRP, continues to expand its global footprint despite regulatory battles, particularly in the United States. Institutional interest, cross-border payment solutions, and technological upgrades on the XRP Ledger all contribute to the asset’s long-term value proposition. Analysts like EGRAG provide the community with short-term tactical insight, but the fundamental case for XRP extends beyond charts. Long-term holders remain focused on utility, adoption, and Ripple’s evolving role in the global financial landscape. Nevertheless, short-term calls like this one keep traders engaged and informed, adding an important layer to the multi-dimensional XRP story. EGRAG Crypto’s recent short-term prediction for XRP has once again proven accurate, reinforcing his reputation as one of the community’s most reliable analysts. His combination of technical expertise, transparent communication, and track record of accountability continues to provide XRP traders and enthusiasts with valuable insights in an often turbulent market. As XRP navigates both short-term volatility and long-term growth opportunities, voices like EGRAG’s will remain essential for those seeking not just hype but grounded, informed guidance.

According to well-known on-chain analyst Willy Woo, Bitcoin is currently navigating a critical window that could determine its near-term trajectory. His recent commentary has put traders and investors on high alert regarding the potential for a Bitcoin bearish divergence on a key technical chart. The Critical Window for Bitcoin Price Prediction Willy Woo, sharing his insights on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted a specific deadline looming for the flagship cryptocurrency. He stated that Bitcoin has a limited time frame – just two days and sixteen hours from his post – to stage a significant price rally. This isn’t an arbitrary deadline; it’s tied directly to the closing of the weekly price candle, a crucial point for technical analysis. Why is this timeframe so important? The weekly chart provides a higher-level perspective on market trends, often filtering out the noise seen on daily or hourly charts. Technical patterns that appear on the weekly scale are typically considered more significant and potentially indicative of longer-term moves. Woo’s analysis suggests that the current price action relative to other indicators (like momentum oscillators) is setting up a specific pattern that will finalize when the current weekly candle closes. Understanding Bitcoin Bearish Divergence Let’s break down what a bearish divergence means in technical analysis terms. A divergence occurs when the price of an asset moves in one direction, while a technical indicator (like the Relative Strength Index – RSI, or MACD) moves in the opposite direction. A Bitcoin bearish divergence specifically happens when the price makes a higher high, but the indicator makes a lower high. This often signals that the upward momentum is weakening, even though the price is still climbing, and it can be a precursor to a price reversal or a significant downturn. On a weekly chart, such a divergence is particularly noteworthy because it reflects weakening momentum over a longer period. If Bitcoin fails to rally convincingly before the weekly close, the pattern could be confirmed, potentially signaling a shift in market sentiment and price direction. Key points about bearish divergence: Occurs when price makes higher highs, but an indicator makes lower highs. Suggests weakening upward momentum. On a weekly chart, it’s considered a strong signal. Can precede a price correction or extended sideways movement. What Willy Woo Bitcoin Analysis Reveals According to Willy Woo Bitcoin analysis, the risk isn’t just a minor dip, but potentially a ‘prolonged period of sideways or dull market activity’. This suggests that a confirmed weekly bearish divergence might not immediately trigger a sharp crash, but rather lead to a frustrating period for bulls, characterized by: Limited price volatility. Range-bound trading within a relatively tight channel. Lack of strong directional moves. Reduced trading volume and general market apathy. This kind of market environment can be challenging for traders seeking quick profits and may test the patience of long-term holders hoping for a swift continuation of an uptrend. Woo’s warning implies that the current juncture is pivotal – either Bitcoin finds the strength for a breakout rally now, or it risks getting stuck in a less exciting phase. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Market Analysis For those following Bitcoin market analysis , this warning from a respected on-chain analyst provides a crucial data point. While technical analysis should never be the sole basis for investment decisions, understanding potential chart patterns like a bearish divergence is vital for managing risk and setting expectations. Actionable Insights: Watch the Weekly Close: Pay close attention to Bitcoin’s price action leading up to and at the weekly candle close (typically Sunday evening UTC). This is when the potential divergence pattern will either be confirmed or invalidated. Monitor Momentum Indicators: While Woo didn’t specify which indicator, keep an eye on common ones like RSI and MACD on the weekly chart to see if their movement aligns with the price or shows divergence. Consider Risk Management: If the divergence is confirmed, be prepared for the possibility of reduced volatility or downward pressure. This might involve adjusting trading strategies, setting stop-losses, or reducing position sizes. Look for Confirmation: A single technical signal is rarely definitive. Look for confluence with other indicators, on-chain data, or fundamental news before making significant moves. Challenges: Technical analysis is probabilistic, not guaranteed. Divergences can sometimes resolve without a major price move. Unexpected news or events can override technical patterns. The exact timing and magnitude of any subsequent move after a confirmed divergence are uncertain. Implications for the Crypto Market Outlook As Bitcoin often acts as the tide for the broader cryptocurrency space, a period of sideways or dull activity for BTC could have ripple effects across altcoins. The overall Crypto market outlook could become less bullish in the short-to-medium term if Bitcoin loses momentum and enters a consolidation phase following a confirmed weekly bearish divergence. Investors in altcoins should consider how their portfolios might perform in a less volatile or potentially downward-trending Bitcoin environment. Historically, altcoins can sometimes see independent rallies, but often they are highly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements. Summary: Time is Running Out for a Bitcoin Rally Willy Woo’s recent analysis serves as a timely reminder of the importance of key technical levels and timeframes. The potential for a significant Bitcoin bearish divergence on the weekly chart hangs in the balance, contingent on price action over the next couple of days. If Bitcoin fails to rally and close the week strongly, the market could face a period of stagnation, impacting the overall Crypto market outlook . While not a guarantee of a crash, this warning from a respected voice in Bitcoin market analysis highlights a critical point for observation and potential strategy adjustment. Keeping a close watch on the weekly candle close and combining this technical insight with other forms of analysis will be crucial for navigating the market in the coming days and weeks.

Germany’s 3,352 tonnes of gold is the topic of headlines as lawmakers call for their gold to be returned to German soil. Lawmakers, economic watchdogs, and public broadcasters have come together to express their renewed concern regarding the safety of the country’s gold stored at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Germany wants its gold back Germany has 1,120 tonnes of gold, representing about one-third of its 3,352-tonne national reserve currently in U.S. custody. The U.S.-Germany arrangement started during the Cold War, as storing gold far from Soviet threats served strategic interests. But today, Trump’s recent combative stance towards international alliances, his attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve , and the overall unpredictability of his policies are leading to calls for Germany to reassess where its gold should be held. This week, the German Taxpayers Federation, Bund der Steuerzahler, issued formal letters to both the Bundesbank and the Finance Ministry, urging for the immediate return of the gold stored in New York. “Trump wants to control the Fed, which would also mean controlling the German gold reserves in the U.S.,” Michael Jaeger, the organization’s vice president, said. “It’s our money, it should be brought back.” Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and gold enthusiasts suspicious of U.S. intentions were the usual culprits in demanding that the country’s gold be returned. Peter Boehringer, who is both an AfD lawmaker and a long-time advocate for returning the gold, also weighed in. “When I started asking about the gold, I was dismissed as a conspiracy theorist,” he said. “Today, after Trump, my concerns are shared widely.” Markus Ferber, a senior member of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and an influential voice in the European Parliament, also warned against keeping the gold in U.S. custody. “The United States is no longer the reliable partner it used to be. Trump is erratic, and one cannot rule out that someday he will come up with creative ideas on how to treat foreign gold reserves.” Bundesbank backs the U.S. as a reliable partner Despite the rising concerns, the Bundesbank has remained publicly committed to its current storage arrangement. Responding to questions from Reuters, Germany’s central bank said that it considered the New York Fed “a trustworthy, reliable partner for the storage of our gold holdings.” The German Finance Ministry, when asked for comment, agreed with the Bundesbank and also emphasized the central bank’s operational independence. The European Central Bank (ECB) recently issued a statement reaffirming its trust in the Fed as a partner. Germany’s decision to store gold abroad dates back to the post-WWII era and its subsequent economic boom. The 1950s and 60s export surpluses enabled the country to amass one of the world’s largest gold reserves. With the threat of potential Soviet aggression, storing gold in New York was the country’s safest bet. In partial response to pressure from German lawmakers, the Bundesbank previously returned 300 tonnes of gold from New York to Germany between 2014 and 2017, citing a desire to “build confidence at home.” Today, Germany’s gold is spread across three locations: the Bundesbank headquarters in Frankfurt, the Bank of England in London, and the Federal Reserve in New York. Ferber argues that the current geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the trade tensions with China, may call for further diversification. “For gold reserves, diversification is key. Having all eggs in too few baskets is never advisable,” he said, stopping short of naming alternative storage sites. Fritz Güntzler, another CDU official and finance spokesperson in the Bundestag, emphasized ongoing accountability rather than relocation. “I have no reason to mistrust the Fed, but the Bundesbank should continue regularly inspecting the stocks,” he said. The Bundesbank says it already conducts regular sample inspections, having verified about 13% of the New York holdings over the years. But critics argue that even such checks may not be enough if political circumstances change dramatically under Trump’s administration.

Active management allows MSTY to generate strong premiums even as MSTR's volatility declines, supporting robust and growing monthly payouts. MSTY's structure (blending Treasuries, cash, and covered calls) mitigates downside risk and enhances yield potential in choppy or range-bound markets. Even with potential declines in volatility, MSTY is likely to provide huge yields, making it an incredible income vehicle. About four months ago, I covered the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: MSTY ) for the first time, explaining why I believed that its 100% dividend yield was sustainable. My argument has played out well, with MSTY not only sustaining hefty payouts, but even raising them. Even in what has been a rather challenging period for Strategy ( MSTR ), including its shares experiencing a significant m/Nav compression in recent months, MSTY's yield farming strategy keeps going strong. In fact, the ETF has achieved a total return of 6.64% since my article on Jan. 25th, outperforming the S&P 500's total return of -0.8%, even with some NAV erosion on the way. Today, I aim to revisit the ETF's investment case, and explain why today's 140% dividend yield (on a TTM basis or 134% yield based on the latest payout's run rate), not only remains sustainable, but could even move higher, much like what happened since my previous article. The MSTY Magic: It's All About Harvesting Volatility Now, for those unfamiliar with the ETF, allow me to provide a quick overview of what it's all about. So, at its core, MSTY is an engine turning the chaos carried by MSTR stock into cash flow. MSTY doesn’t own MicroStrategy shares directly. Instead, it uses a synthetic covered call strategy, blending U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and short-term call options on MSTR to monetize the stock's underlying volatility. By selling out-of-the-money call options, like the ones you can see in the table below as per its latest holdings, MSTY collects hefty premiums, which it distributes as monthly dividends to investors. These payouts tend to be huge relative to the ETF's NAV previously due to the massive premiums in MSTR's options market. MSTY Holdings (Seeking Alpha) The reason this strategy performs so well with MSTR is that Strategy is no ordinary company. With over 568,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, it’s the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency and a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s price. With trades and investors from all backgrounds utilizing the stock and its underlying derivatives for different strategies (e.g., holding a levered regulated play on BTC, betting on moonshot call options, or selling the volatility to generate income), MSTR moves more than Bitcoin itself. This volatility fuels rich option premiums, and MSTY captures exactly that (on the selling of the volume front). Defying the Odds: Stronger Dividends Despite Declining Volatility Typically, you’d think a dip in MSTR’s volatility would spell trouble for MSTY’s payouts. After all, lower volatility should mean slimmer option premiums. But surprisingly, MSTY has bucked this trend. As you can see, MSTR's 30-day implied volatility has now declined to around 51%, a notable decline from its 2024 peak of over 150%. MSTR 1M Vol (Koyfin) Yet, MSTY’s dividends have held strong, even growing in recent months. How is this possible? MSTY Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) The answer lies in MSTY’s active management and overall flexibility. The fund doesn’t just blindly sell calls on 100% of its synthetic MSTR exposure. In fact, a few days ago, MSTY adjusted its strategy, writing calls on only about 75% of its holdings, leaving room to capture more upside during MSTR rallies. It also added out-of-the-money long calls at higher strike prices, like $455 and $475, to hedge against parabolic moves. This approach seems to allow MSTY to generate substantial premiums, even in calmer markets. But more importantly, even with the stock's volatility on the decline, MSTR’s option premiums remain very rich, particularly due to the levered nature of MSTR. For instance, YieldMax’s Bitcoin ETF-focused ( YBIT ) yields around 81%, significantly lower than MSTY’s 140%. The difference? MSTR’s unique position as a leveraged Bitcoin play keeps its options pricier and way more active overall. The 140% Yield: Sustainable and Poised to Grow Of course, sustainability is the big question with any high-yield investment, let alone one with such a crazy high yield. Can MSTY’s 140% yield hold up, or is it going to all come crashing down? As I said in my initial article, there is no reason to think that MSTR's high-premium options market is going to fade out any time soon, especially considering that MSTR has both accelerated its BTC accumulation trajectory and actively leveraged up its balance sheet through its two high-yield preferreds ( STRK )( STRF ). In fact, MSTY's yield could very well climb higher under the right conditions. At the end of the day, MSTY’s yield is driven by MSTR’s volatility (even if that hasn't prevented the fund from generating massive premiums, as I was just discussing). So if Bitcoin’s price swings become more violent (up or down), which is not unlikely after several weeks of tight consolidation, we could see premiums move even higher, and thus dividends move higher. In the meantime, even if volatility/premium/dividends were to all unwind, it's still likely that MSTY will be yielding 50%/60%/70%, which would obviously continue to make it a highly attractive investment. The premiums are so high that even a meaningful decline would still make MSTR one of the best yield-farming vehicles. Another engineering beauty is that MSTY’s share price stability enhances its yield potential. Unlike MSTR, which can plummet in a BTC bear market, MSTY’s structure mitigates some downside through its Treasury and cash holdings. If its share price holds steady while dividends grow, the effective yield rises. This dynamic makes MSTY appealing in choppy or range-bound markets, where option premiums shine without the full downside risk of owning MSTR outright. Take the past six months, for example, where you've had MSTY outperform MSTR notably during the latter's mNAV compression. MSTY/MSTR Returns (Koyfin) And yet, MSTY maintains the potential to outperform BTC over the long term, even if it does give some upside away against MSTR due to covered calls capping some of its gains during bigger common stock runs. MSTY/MSTR/BTC Returns (Koyfin) The Risk No investment is without risks, and MSTY is no exception. However, given the nature of the ETF, I believe that the only noteworthy risk is the possibility of a capped upside in a runaway MSTR bull market, as sold calls limit participation in sharp rallies, as I mentioned earlier. If Bitcoin soars to $200,000 and MSTR triples on a multiple expansion-driven enthusiasm, MSTY investors will miss out on some of those gains. Also, a prolonged Bitcoin bear market could slash MSTR’s volatility and stock price, shrinking option premiums and distributions. But still, I find it extremely unlikely that MSTR's volatility will drop to levels that don't produce at least a 30%, 40%, or 50% yield per year, as it will remain a levered BTC play that draws all types of investors who want to bet on each side of the equation that will keep premiums very high. This is the whole ""volatility is vitality"" argument Mr. Saylor has been trying to explain since MSTR adopted a BTC treasury strategy, after all. Why MSTY Shines for the Bold Look, MSTY isn’t for everyone. You need to buy into the idea that MSTR’s volatility, driven by Saylor’s innovative capital-raising strategies, is a deliberate feature. Once you understand why MSTR is inherently volatile and an ideal playground for market speculators, it becomes clear that an ETF like MSTY, designed to harness this volatility, can deliver exceptionally high, sustainable yields. If that clicks, holding MSTY makes perfect sense.",MSTR|STRK|STRF|MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-30 15:16:46

According to a key figure in the market, the answer might lie in two seemingly disparate regions: the United States and China. Recent comments from Andrei Grachev, co-founder of prominent crypto market maker DWF Labs, suggest that a strategic focus on projects originating from or heavily backed by entities in these global powerhouses could yield significant rewards. This perspective is particularly interesting given the evolving landscape of U.S. Crypto Regulation and the unique dynamics of the China Crypto Market . What’s Driving the Optimism? The Role of U.S. Crypto Regulation Andrei Grachev’s remarks on X pointed directly to the United States’ increasing efforts to clarify its stance on digital assets. He stated that the U.S. is accelerating its initiatives to establish what he believes will be the most advanced and crypto-friendly regulatory framework globally. This is a crucial development because regulatory clarity often precedes institutional adoption and broader market participation. Uncertainty has long been a major hurdle for the crypto industry in the U.S. A clear and supportive regulatory environment in the U.S. could: Encourage more traditional financial institutions to enter the crypto space. Provide legal certainty for businesses building on blockchain technology. Attract significant capital investment from both domestic and international sources. Foster innovation by providing clear guidelines for development and deployment. The move towards a potentially ‘crypto-friendly’ framework signals a shift that could unlock substantial value within the U.S. market, benefiting projects based there or targeting U.S. users. Investors paying close attention to how U.S. Crypto Regulation develops could gain an edge in identifying promising opportunities. Exploring the China Crypto Market Opportunity While China has maintained a restrictive stance on domestic cryptocurrency trading and mining, its influence on the global crypto ecosystem remains undeniable. Chinese developers, entrepreneurs, and capital continue to play a significant role in building blockchain infrastructure, protocols, and applications that operate outside mainland China. Grachev’s advice to consider projects backed by major Chinese funds acknowledges this reality. Key aspects of the China Crypto Market influence include: Talent Pool: China has a vast pool of skilled blockchain developers and researchers. Technological Innovation: Many foundational blockchain technologies and layer-2 solutions have significant contributions from Chinese teams. Global Reach: Chinese capital and companies are active investors and participants in crypto projects registered and operating in other jurisdictions. Market Influence: Despite restrictions, sentiment and developments related to China can still impact global market dynamics. Focusing on projects with strong backing from reputable Chinese funds or teams operating internationally allows investors to tap into this pool of talent and capital without necessarily engaging directly with the restricted mainland market. Understanding the nuances of the China Crypto Market ‘s global impact is key for a diversified investment approach. DWF Labs’ Perspective: Why Focus on These Regions? As a major crypto market maker, DWF Labs has a unique vantage point on market flows, liquidity, and project health. Their business involves providing liquidity to various digital assets, often working closely with project teams. Andrei Grachev’s insights are therefore grounded in direct market experience and relationships. From the perspective of DWF Labs , the emphasis on U.S. and China-backed projects likely stems from: Capital Concentration: Both regions represent significant sources of capital and investment in the crypto space, even if deployed differently. Innovation Hubs: The U.S. is a hub for Web3 innovation, particularly around decentralized finance (DeFi) and regulatory compliance. China, despite restrictions, remains a source of fundamental blockchain technology development. Market Depth: Projects with strong U.S. or Chinese ties often have access to deeper liquidity pools and larger potential user bases globally. When a market maker like DWF Labs points towards specific areas of opportunity, it’s often worth noting, as their operations require a deep understanding of where value and activity are likely to converge. Developing Your Crypto Investment Strategy Grachev’s comments provide a directional signal, but implementing a successful Crypto Investment Strategy requires careful consideration and research. Simply investing in any project with U.S. or Chinese ties is not a guarantee of success. The market is complex, and due diligence is paramount. Consider these steps when incorporating this insight into your Crypto Investment Strategy : Research Projects: Look for projects with transparent teams, clear use cases, and strong backing from known U.S. or Chinese venture funds (operating legally in their respective or international jurisdictions). Understand the Backing: Distinguish between projects targeting the U.S. market, projects founded by U.S. teams, projects backed by U.S. funds, and similarly for China (focusing on teams/funds operating internationally or building global infrastructure). Assess Technology and Team: Evaluate the underlying technology and the experience and reputation of the development team. Analyze Market Potential: Does the project address a real problem? Is there a potential user base? Consider Regulatory Risk: While the U.S. is moving towards clarity, regulatory environments can change. Understand the specific regulatory landscape relevant to the project’s operations and target market. A robust Crypto Investment Strategy should always involve diversification and a long-term perspective, rather than chasing short-term trends based on regional speculation alone. Identifying Crypto Growth Potential in US/China Projects The confluence of potential regulatory clarity in the U.S. and the persistent innovation and capital flow from China creates unique avenues for identifying Crypto Growth Potential . Projects that can successfully navigate these complex geopolitical and regulatory landscapes are particularly well-positioned. Areas exhibiting strong Crypto Growth Potential related to these regions might include: U.S.-Based DeFi Protocols: Projects building decentralized finance applications with a focus on regulatory compliance and institutional appeal. U.S.-Focused Infrastructure: Companies providing essential services like custody, brokerage, or compliance tools for digital assets in the U.S. market. Globally Focused Layer-1/Layer-2 Chains: Protocols developed by teams with significant Chinese talent or backing, aiming for broad international adoption and scalability. Cross-Border Solutions: Projects facilitating interoperability or transactions between different blockchain networks or jurisdictions, potentially bridging Eastern and Western markets. NFT and Gaming Projects: Teams from both regions are active in the NFT and blockchain gaming space, targeting global audiences. Identifying true Crypto Growth Potential requires looking beyond the hype and understanding the fundamental value proposition and market fit of these projects within the context of their regional ties. Challenges and Considerations While the outlook presented by Grachev is optimistic, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty (Still): Even with efforts towards clarity, the U.S. regulatory landscape is not fully settled and remains subject to political shifts. Geopolitical Risks: Tensions between the U.S. and China could impact projects with ties to both regions or create unpredictable market reactions. Execution Risk: Project success ultimately depends on the team’s ability to build and deliver, regardless of their geographic origin or backing. Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile, and regional focus does not eliminate this risk. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on this analysis, here are some actionable steps for investors: Stay informed about developments in U.S. Crypto Regulation . Follow official announcements and reputable news sources. Research projects with known backing from established U.S. venture capital firms active in crypto. Investigate global crypto projects that have received funding from prominent Chinese crypto funds or feature well-known Chinese developers on their teams (ensuring they operate internationally and comply with relevant laws). Diversify your portfolio; do not put all your funds into projects from just these two regions. Consider the long-term vision and technology of the project, not just its regional ties or current price. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity Andrei Grachev’s perspective from DWF Labs offers a compelling argument for focusing investment attention on projects with strong ties to the U.S. and China. The potential for clearer U.S. Crypto Regulation to unlock significant capital and innovation, combined with the persistent influence and talent emanating from the China Crypto Market globally, points towards areas with substantial Crypto Growth Potential .

After publicly declaring his exit from leverage trading earlier this month, on-chain data shows Wynn has now opened a fresh $50 million long position on Bitcoin ( BTC ), a striking reversal from his earlier stance, and one that puts him back in the line of fire. According to data tracked via Arkham and Hyperliquid , the new BTC position sits at 437 BTC with 40x leverage, valued at just over $46.1 million at an entry price of $105,560. The mark price at last check was hovering around $105,571, leaving the position nearly breakeven with a razor-thin unrealized profit of $2,086 — a +0.2% move, essentially noise at this scale. https://twitter.com/arkham/status/1928457983639396586 With a liquidation level of $102,849, even a modest 2.5% dip from current price action could wipe out the position entirely.

The trader has been moving capital aggressively. Blockchain data shows multiple high-value inflows and outflows between Binance, Hyperliquid, and self-custodial wallets. In just the past 48 hours, over $8 million in USDC has been routed through Wynn’s wallets, with several tranches split between 500K and 2.7M USDC at a time, typical of positioning behavior for large directional bets. For context, Bitcoin is currently trading just above $105,500, down 3% in the past 24 hours and over 5% from recent local highs. Price action remains volatile, especially as funding rates reset and liquidity thins ahead of the weekend.

The recent decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has sent ripples through the Forex Market , causing the NZD USD currency pair to climb. This move wasn’t quite what many analysts had predicted, leading to a significant reaction. Understanding the RBNZ’s Stance The Reserve Bank of New Zealand recently concluded its latest monetary policy meeting. The widely anticipated outcome was that the Official Cash Rate (OCR) would remain unchanged. This part of the decision was indeed met, with the OCR held steady. However, the devil, as they say, was in the details of the accompanying statement. Market participants had largely priced in a relatively ‘dovish’ tone – meaning hints or signals that the central bank was getting closer to cutting Interest Rates in the near future due to concerns about the economy slowing or inflation falling faster than expected. Here’s where the surprise came in: The RBNZ’s language was less explicitly focused on the need for future cuts than anticipated. While acknowledging economic headwinds, the central bank maintained a relatively cautious stance regarding the inflation outlook. Their forward guidance, or hints about the future path of the OCR, suggested a longer period of maintaining current rates than the market had expected. This less-than-anticipated dovishness signaled that the RBNZ is not in a hurry to ease monetary conditions, which is generally supportive of the local currency. Why Did This Boost NZD USD? Currency values are heavily influenced by relative Interest Rates and the expected future path of those rates. When a central bank maintains a firmer stance than its peers, or than the market expected, it makes holding that country’s currency and assets more attractive relative to others where rates might be expected to fall sooner. In the case of the NZD USD pair, the US Federal Reserve’s future path on interest rates is also a key factor. If the RBNZ appears less likely to cut rates soon compared to expectations for the Federal Reserve or other central banks, the interest rate differential can become more favorable for the New Zealand Dollar. The reaction in the Forex Market was swift. Traders who had bet on a more dovish RBNZ quickly adjusted their positions, buying NZD and selling USD, driving the pair higher. This highlights how sensitive currency markets are to even subtle shifts in central bank communication. Implications for the Forex Market and Beyond The RBNZ’s decision is a key piece of the puzzle in the global Forex Market . It reinforces the idea that central banks are still navigating a complex economic environment, balancing inflation concerns with growth risks. While some central banks are signaling readiness to cut rates, others, like the RBNZ in this instance, are proving more patient. This divergence in central bank approaches can lead to increased volatility and trading opportunities across various currency pairs, not just NZD USD . Traders are now scrutinizing upcoming economic data from New Zealand even more closely, looking for confirmation or contradiction of the RBNZ’s current outlook. Furthermore, shifts in the Monetary Policy landscape can indirectly impact other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, by influencing overall market liquidity, risk sentiment, and the relative attractiveness of different investments. A firmer stance on interest rates in a developed economy like New Zealand can contribute to a broader environment where yield becomes more important, potentially drawing some capital away from riskier assets, though the direct link is complex and influenced by many factors. What’s Next for NZD USD and Interest Rates? The market’s focus now shifts to incoming economic data from New Zealand, such as inflation reports, employment figures, and GDP growth. These will be crucial in shaping expectations for the RBNZ’s future Monetary Policy decisions. The next RBNZ meeting will be keenly watched for any evolution in their stance. Similarly, developments regarding Interest Rates in the United States, particularly signals from the Federal Reserve, will continue to play a major role in the direction of the NZD USD pair. The interplay between the economic performance and central bank intentions of both countries will dictate the pair’s trajectory. Challenges remain, including global economic uncertainty and potential shifts in risk sentiment. However, for now, the RBNZ’s less dovish posture has provided a clear boost to the New Zealand Dollar against the US Dollar, setting the stage for continued attention on this pair in the Forex Market . Summary In conclusion, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s recent decision to hold Interest Rates steady, accompanied by a statement that was less dovish than the market had anticipated, provided significant support for the New Zealand Dollar. This unexpected firmness from the RBNZ led to a notable rise in the NZD USD currency pair, highlighting the importance of central bank communication in the Forex Market . Traders and investors will continue to monitor economic data and future Monetary Policy signals from both New Zealand and the United States to gauge the future direction of this key pair.

45294319,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25305,1748619025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,Highlights from the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/highlights-from-the-bitcoin-2025-conference-in-las-vegas/,"From May 27th to 29th, 2025, Las Vegas became the epicenter of the global Bitcoin community as Bitcoin 2025 convened, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. Bitcoiners, digital asset-aligned politicians, and leading Bitcoin companies converged to forge connections and strategise as increasing regulatory acceptance and integration into traditional finance has already begun to reshape the landscape. The atmosphere buzzed with optimism as participants explored the growing momentum of Bitcoin’s adoption, solidifying its position as a significant force within the rapidly evolving global financial system. The Most Important Announcements to Emerge from Bitcoin 2025 The Bitcoin 2025 conference represents a cornerstone gathering for the global Bitcoin community, uniting individuals from diverse backgrounds, including developers, miners, and institutions, to champion the vision of sound money and financial freedom through collaboration, innovation, and a shared belief in the enduring potential of Bitcoin as a decentralised and resilient monetary network. Let’s take a look at some of the most exciting news to be announced at this year’s event. US Vice President JD Vance Gives a Powerful Pro-Bitcoin Speech During his address at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Vice President JD Vance articulated a significant shift in the US government’s approach to digital assets, framing Bitcoin’s growth not just as a technological innovation, but as a reflection of a broader, decentralised movement. He emphasised a deliberate alignment between the administration’s priorities and the values of the Bitcoin community, asserting a commitment to fostering its expansion and resisting what he characterised as undue bureaucratic interference. Vance laid out a strategic vision for the future, focusing on promoting widespread adoption amongst American citizens and advocating for a regulatory framework designed to support Bitcoin’s integration into the national economy. He accentuated the importance of empowering the community itself, arguing that Bitcoin’s continued success hinged on active participation and a direct dialogue between the people and their government, suggesting a departure from previous administrations’ approaches to the sector. Don Trump Jr. and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski Announce Bitcoin Treasury Don Trump Jr. and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski articulated a strategic alignment with the current administration’s approach to digital assets, characterised by the establishment of a significant crypto treasury and a deliberate investment in Bitcoin’s potential. The pair emphasised the evolving political landscape, framing the administration’s support as a catalyst for a wider shift within the financial sector. Highlighting the formation of a substantial $2.5 billion crypto treasury and a series of strategic partnerships, including an alliance with the mining company Hut 8 , Trump Jr. and Pavlovski positioned Rumble as a key participant in a rapidly developing landscape. They underscored a belief that the administration’s pro-crypto stance represented a fundamental change, suggesting a broader adoption trend and a repositioning within the industry, referencing a shared vulnerability to regulatory scrutiny. US Senator Cynthia Lummis Discuss BTC Reserve & Stablecoin Legislation US Senator Cynthia Lummis outlined a strategic approach to regulating and integrating digital assets, emphasising the necessity of addressing market structure and stablecoin legislation to support evolving industry practices. She acknowledged the crucial role of supporting businesses involved in Bitcoin transactions, from custodial services to lending, and highlighted the need for a flexible regulatory framework capable of accommodating diverse applications. Senator Lummis emphasised the importance of establishing a streamlined tax system for smaller Bitcoin transactions and addressed the challenges presented by the US government’s historically cautious stance toward digital assets. She expressed a perspective where Bitcoin could serve as a critical strategic asset, not just for economic stability but also for bolstering national defence and mitigating potential geopolitical risks, particularly concerning global economic influence. Paolo Ardoino Announces That Tether Will Become World’s Biggest Bitcoin Mining Company During his presentation at Bitcoin 2025, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether & CTO at Bitfinex , unveiled a significant strategic shift, asserting that the company would become the world’s largest Bitcoin mining operation. Ardoino detailed Tether’s Bitcoin holdings, exceeding 100,000 coins, alongside substantial reserves of US Treasury bonds totaling $120 billion. He underscored Tether’s origins as a Bitcoin-centric organisation, emphasising the company’s deep-rooted commitment to the cryptocurrency’s underlying principles. Ardoino highlighted a considerable investment, estimated at $2 billion, dedicated to energy production and Bitcoin mining activities, positioning Tether as a key player in decentralised infrastructure. Ardoino introduced a novel AI system, dubbed “QVAC,” designed with societal rather than corporate objectives in mind. Notably, he described QVAC’s operational structure: an AI agent possessing its own non-custodial wallet,and operating independently under pre-determined terms. Alongside this development, Tether announced a collaboration with Rumble to launch a dedicated Bitcoin wallet, alongside a supplementary stablecoin portfolio, signalling a broadening strategy to integrate Bitcoin into broader financial applications. Ark Labs Announces Arkade Native Bitcoin Execution Layer At Bitcoin 2025, Ark Labs unveiled Arkade, a novel application designed to introduce programmable capabilities directly onto the Bitcoin network, operating as a dedicated execution layer. Following a recent funding round, Arkade seeks to unlock new possibilities for financial applications while preserving the core security and decentralised nature of Bitcoin itself, eschewing the use of sidechains or alternative consensus mechanisms. Arkade functions by virtualising Bitcoin’s transaction layer, allowing developers to build sophisticated applications without requiring modifications to the underlying protocol. Early collaborations with established players like Tether, Boltz , Breez , and Mempool demonstrate the growing interest in this approach, which aims to transform Bitcoin from solely a store of value into a dynamically adaptable and universally accessible financial platform, a shift anticipated to represent a significant advancement within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Saylor Expresses Doubt About Proof of Reserves for Strategy Michael Saylor voiced strong opposition to publishing on-chain proof of reserves for Strategy , arguing that the practice inherently compromises the security of institutions employing this method. He presented a core concern: the increased vulnerability of custodians, exchanges, and investors due to the public disclosure of their Bitcoin holdings. Saylor’s resistance stemmed from two primary arguments. Firstly, he asserted that publishing wallet addresses creates an amplified attack vector, exposing institutions to heightened risks from hackers, hostile actors, and nation-state interference. Secondly, he emphasised that existing proof-of-reserves systems only demonstrate asset ownership without addressing potential liabilities, advocating instead for robust, legally-backed audits conducted by established, “Big Four” accounting firms to provide a more secure and verifiable assessment of financial health. NYC May Eric Adams Announces Bit-Bond New York City Mayor Eric Adams formally announced the city’s intention to issue a “Bit Bond,” a novel financial instrument designed specifically for Bitcoin holders. Framing this move as a deliberate step toward embracing innovation, Adams expressed a return to welcoming the cryptocurrency community, particularly those who had previously sought refuge outside of New York due to regulatory challenges. Adams’ announcement was characterised by a desire to reassert the city’s leadership within the digital asset space. He framed the Bit Bond as a tangible signal of New York’s commitment to fostering a supportive environment for Bitcoin, alongside plans to integrate blockchain technology into city services like record keeping and revenue collection, reflecting a broader strategy to engage and empower its residents within the digital economy. Adam Back Unveils Blockstream’s Plan to Boost Bitcoin Infrastructure Adam Back announced a strategic vision for Blockstream , based on scaling Bitcoin’s adoption to encompass a projected trillion-dollar market. He discussed the nascent stage of Bitcoin’s evolution, highlighting growing engagement from major players, from governmental figures to institutional leaders, and framed the company’s role as a foundational contributor to this expansion. Back detailed Blockstream’s planned infrastructural developments, focusing on simplifying the user experience for Bitcoin adoption and focusing on self-custody as a core component. The company’s roadmap included the creation of a unified platform integrating consumer-grade tools with enterprise solutions, alongside a strong commitment to robust security and a “Bitcoin-first” architectural approach, ultimately aiming to establish Bitcoin as the dominant foundation for global finance. Saifedean Ammous Comments on Tether and Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Saifedean Ammous presented a compelling case for Bitcoin’s eventual dominance in the global financial system, arguing that the U.S. dollar’s decline was an inevitable consequence of its inflationary nature. He highlighted Tether’s role as a critical bridge in this transition, anticipating a scenario where Bitcoin reserves would significantly surpass U.S. dollar holdings. Ammous’ argument centered on a self-reinforcing cycle: increasing demand for Tether, driven by concerns over the devaluing dollar, would spur Tether to acquire more Bitcoin, which in turn would drive up the price of Bitcoin. He characterised this process as a “transition monetary system,” predicting a future where Bitcoin, rather than the dollar, would represent the primary store of value, a future he described as unstoppable. Human Rights Foundation Donates 8 BTC to Freedom Projects The Human Rights Foundation has announced a transformative investment of $80 million in Bitcoin, distributed through its Bitcoin Development Fund to 298 projects operating across 62 countries worldwide. This substantial grant program strategically targets the development of decentralized technologies and their application in regions grappling with economic instability, political repression, and limited access to traditional financial systems. The fund’s focus extends beyond simply providing capital, it’s designed to build resilient infrastructure encompassing open-source Bitcoin development, localised educational programs, and the creation of secure, self-custodial wallets, all with the ultimate goal of empowering individuals to circumvent censorship and safeguard their assets. This initiative directly addresses critical gaps in financial inclusion, particularly in underserved communities where traditional banking systems offer little recourse. Projects like “Bitcoin Boma” in Malawi, which teaches Bitcoin in local languages, and “Stringer News,” a censorship-resistant media platform, demonstrate a targeted approach to building financial freedom and promoting secure communication in regions facing economic and political restrictions. By fostering a network of decentralised solutions, the HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund represents a powerful tool for safeguarding human rights and promoting a more equitable and resilient global financial landscape. Block Announces Lightning Network Payments Strategy At Bitcoin 2025, Block unveiled a strategic push to establish Bitcoin as a viable everyday currency, centered around expanding access through integrated payment solutions and bolstering the Lightning Network. Following the official launch of Bitcoin payments through Square POS, allowing merchants to accept Bitcoin directly in-store, Block simultaneously orchestrated a world-record Lightning event, showcasing the network’s scalability and speed. This initiative directly addresses the challenge of transitioning Bitcoin beyond its role as a store of value, prioritizing its utility within daily transactions. Block’s efforts extend beyond a single product launch. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin’s adoption is underscored by its operational infrastructure, including operating one of the world’s largest Lightning Network nodes and facilitating automated Bitcoin conversions for over 1,700 merchants. By actively integrating Bitcoin into its existing financial platforms, including Cash App, Block aims to reinforce Bitcoin’s legitimacy and accelerate its integration into the global financial system, effectively validating Bitcoin as a functioning currency. Sati Rolls Out Lightning Payments to Xverse Users At Bitcoin 2025, Sati announced the integration of the Lightning Network into its Xverse wallet, extending instant, borderless Bitcoin transactions to over 1.5 million users. This move leverages the Lightning Network’s capabilities, facilitating rapid, low-cost payments without requiring users to manage channels or switch between applications. By connecting Xverse to the Lightning Network, Sati aims to restore Bitcoin’s original design, as a peer-to-peer payment system, and directly addresses the growing demand for scalable, efficient digital transactions. Beyond simply enabling Lightning payments, Sati’s rollout is underpinned by supporting infrastructure, including the recently launched Parasite Pool mining pool. This pool, utilising Sati’s core technology, caters specifically to smaller-scale miners, offering a low-fee, instantly-paid system. The initiative reflects Sati’s strategy of providing comprehensive Lightning infrastructure solutions, attracting a broader user base and solidifying its role as a key facilitator of Lightning Network adoption.

In 2025, memes aren’t just jokes—they’re blue-chip chaos. From absurd names to wild communities, the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold are commanding serious investor attention, with diamond paws jumping in early and laughing later. Goatseus Maximus is charging through social feeds. SPX6900 is parodying Wall Street with brute force. Bone ShibaSwap is snapping back into focus. And Osaka Protocol is steadily building clout. But there’s one mysterious feline that isn’t just participating—it’s pouncing. Troller Cat ($TCAT) launched its presale on May 2, 2025, at 6 PM UTC and has already raised over $150,000 with more than 900 holders locked in. The project is currently in Stage 6, priced at just $0.00001458. Investors from Stage 1 are already up 191.6%, but buyers today are still staring down a jaw-dropping 3,541.29% ROI potential before its final listing at $0.0005309. And with a 19.95% price increase set to drop this Friday, the clock is ticking. Every moment you wait? That’s this cat slipping through your fingers. Here are the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold—led by the purring predator rewriting the presale playbook. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Stage 6 is live, and Troller Cat is hunting the spotlight. With a 26-stage Ethereum-based presale, this feline-themed crypto started at $0.00000500 and now sits at $0.00001458. That structured increase means every new stage rewards early adopters and punishes hesitators. By Stage 26, $TCAT will list at $0.0005309—giving anyone jumping in during Stage 6 the potential for 3,541.29% returns. If someone throws in $40,000 right now, that multiplies to over $1.4 million at launch. But Troller Cat isn’t just fluff. It’s clawed out a real foundation with fully audited smart contracts, locked liquidity for two years, and a Game Center that burns tokens monthly using ad revenue. Add in 69% APY staking starting at Stage 9 and a referral system with 10% bonuses, and this cat isn’t just trolling—it’s transforming. Deflationary Model: Burn Baby Burn What sets Troller Cat apart from the copycats? A revenue-generating Game Center that funds a monthly buyback-and-burn cycle. Players must watch ads during gameplay. That ad revenue is converted to crypto, used to buy $TCAT on the open market, and burned—forever. The more people play, the fewer tokens exist. It’s deflation by design, built to strengthen price, reduce supply, and keep this coin meowing higher with every month. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Troller Cat’s combination of structured ROI, staking, Game Center economics, and a permanent deflationary engine makes it a standout. It’s more than a meme—it’s a market disruptor with paws on the wheel. Easily one of the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold this year. 2. SPX6900 ($SPX) $SPX isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a finance parody turned power play. Named after the joke of the S&P 500 reaching 6900 (nice), this token pokes fun at traditional markets while giving traders an actual memetic vehicle for speculation. Its branding mimics Wall Street with a twist: think charts drawn in MS Paint, ticker memes, and hedge fund satire. But beneath the humor lies solid tokenomics: capped supply, anti-whale mechanisms, and liquidity pool incentives that have quietly kept this token trending on DEX dashboards. Why This Coin Made It to the List: SPX6900 blends satire with smart mechanics. It turns mockery of TradFi into memecoin momentum, earning it a top spot on the list of top 5 meme coins to buy and hold in 2025. 3. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) The self-proclaimed god of goat memes, $GOAT takes absurdity to divine heights. With Greek-god meme art, absurd arena-style staking games, and a Telegram army of goat-themed GIF warriors, Goatseus has meme magic written all over it. What started as a niche parody now has utility: NFT drops themed around mythological creatures and a yield farm called “Mount Bleatlympus.” The coin also gained attention for surprise token burns triggered by community sacrifices (literally sending tokens to the burn address while posting goat emojis). Why This Coin Made It to the List: It’s wild. It’s creative. It’s unpredictable. But most importantly, Goatseus Maximus continues to attract fresh holders and build viral momentum. That makes it a certified addition to the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold. 4. Bone ShibaSwap ($Bone) $Bone remains one of the most functional meme tokens in the ecosystem. As the governance and gas token of Shibarium, it cemented itself as the utility-driven backbone of the SHIB universe. While its price fluctuates, its value rises as more features come online—from NFT staking in ShibaSwap 2.0 to upcoming games and community DAO votes. New use cases continue to stack up, and exchange activity has picked up again as meme season heats up. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It’s not just part of the Shiba family—it’s what makes the whole thing run. With growing on-chain applications, Bone is more than bark—it’s got a serious bite. A must-watch in the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold. 5. Osaka Protocol ($OSAK) Osaka Protocol plays the long game. Its rise was slow and steady, fueled by quiet accumulation, low initial volume, and a powerful narrative. With anime-inspired branding, community-run governance, and timed release tokenomics, $OSAK has attracted diamond-hand believers who see it as the next sleeper hit. It features time-locked vaults that release liquidity in phases, paired with a meme-heavy rollout including “Osaka Lore” comic drops, and meme-making contests hosted directly in the app. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Osaka Protocol is built for long-term believers who understand slow and steady can still send it. Its consistent traction puts it on the radar of smart holders looking for the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Best Meme Coins to Invest in May 2025 are Troller Cat , SPX6900, Goatseus Maximus, Bone ShibaSwap, and Osaka Protocol. Among these, Troller Cat is the only one still in presale, and that means time-sensitive upside. With a Stage 6 price of $0.00001458 and a 3,541.29% ROI target before it lists at $0.0005309, the potential is wild. Add staking at 69% APY, a deflationary ad-fueled Game Center, and over 900 holders already in—this isn’t just a meme, it’s a movement. Buy now before this cat claws its way out of reach. For More Information: Website: https://www.trollercat.com/ Buy Now: https://www.trollercat.com/buy-now/ X: https://x.com/trollercat_ FAQs How much could a $40,000 investment in Troller Cat return? At the current Stage 6 price, it could turn into over $1.4 million by the time it lists. What’s unique about SPX6900? It’s a TradFi parody with actual tokenomics, utility, and anti-whale functions—blending satire and sustainability. Can Goatseus Maximus sustain hype long-term? Its creative community events, NFT ecosystem, and staking games give it more legs (or hooves) than most meme coins. Does Bone ShibaSwap still have upside? Yes, its utility in Shibarium keeps it relevant as more SHIB-based apps come online. What is Osaka Protocol’s main appeal? It’s a slow-burn memecoin with serious storytelling and time-locked tokenomics to support longevity. Glossary Presale – The initial offering of tokens to early buyers before they hit exchanges.

Bitcoin ETFs Emerge As Preferred Safe Haven According to a Bloomberg report, US Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $9 billion in inflows in the past five weeks, primarily driven by BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). In contrast, gold-backed funds have seen outflows exceeding $2.8 billion during the same time frame. Related Reading: Can XRP Market Cap Touch $1.5 Trillion? Analyst Reveals The Math Behind It This divergence in investor behavior comes as easing trade tensions have diminished demand for traditional safe havens like gold. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a viable alternative store of value amid growing concerns about US fiscal stability. Furthermore, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached a record high of $111,980, buoyed by favorable regulatory developments and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Although gold remains up more than 25% this year, it has retreated from its recent peaks, currently trading approximately $190 below its all-time high. BTC’s Advantages Over Gold Analysts suggest that this rotation towards Bitcoin ETFs indicates a growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency as a legitimate hedge within investment portfolios. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, expressed optimism for both gold and Bitcoin, noting their effectiveness as hedges against currency debasement in the G7 nations. However, skeptics argue that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility still undermines its position as a true safe haven. Historical instances of macroeconomic shocks have shown Bitcoin falling sharply alongside other risk assets. Yet, some experts believe that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature gives it an advantage over gold in times of financial system risks. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted Bitcoin’s dual role as a hedge against both private sector risks, such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, and government-related concerns, including the stability of the US Treasury. Kendrick pointed out that recent threats to Federal Reserve (Fed) independence, alongside tariff escalations and broader concerns about US policy credibility, further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal.

Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that Bitcoin’s intraday correlation with major indices like the Nasdaq, as well as with the dollar and gold, has significantly decreased. The backdrop of growing fiscal strain has intensified the discourse surrounding these assets. Moody’s recently downgraded the US from its last triple-A credit rating, citing concerns over ballooning deficits and national debt. This downgrade aligns the US with other ratings agencies, including Fitch and S&P Global, which already rate the country below the top tier. Despite the recent surge in Bitcoin’s popularity, gold continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis, boasting gains of about 25% compared to Bitcoin’s rise of approximately 15%.

The relaunch signals Revolut’s strategic intent to deepen its presence in the rapidly evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) space, reflecting broader momentum toward integrated financial ecosystems. The announcement also aligns with the firm’s wider strategy to connect traditional finance with Web3 by building strategic industry partnerships and developing product offerings. Revolut eyes US for expansion After announcing plans to revive its US cryptocurrency services , Revolut is expected to reintroduce Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens previously available on the platform. However, the official list of supported assets has yet to be confirmed. The move underscores the British fintech firm’s commitment to capitalizing on the growing demand for crypto and blockchain-based payment solutions in the US. Revolut also announced its partnership with Pyth Network . ElJundi commented on the company’s announcements revealing the role of reliable market data for advances in the DeFi space. ElJundi said their collaboration with Pyth marks a key moment in Revolut’s mission to update the world of finance. He further stated that as decentralized finance becomes more popular, Pyth’s role as a core part of the industry will enable the bank to take advantage of this change. Martin Mignot, a partner at the European venture capital firm Index Ventures and an early investor in Revolut, emphasized that one can not truly be the top player if they are not number one in the US. He referred to the US as the biggest consumer market globally. Moreover, Siddhartha Jajodia, the CEO of Revolut in the US, states that the country is essential for its goal to become a “global bank.” This made their mission clearer: to connect with millions more customers targeting the US. Analysts speculate Revolut’s arrival in the US could spur more competition for crypto offerings. This strategic move may attract regulatory attention and technological progress to achieve a significant share of the retail investment sector. Revolut previously launched its cryptocurrency services in the EU and UK Previous expansions by Revolut in regions including the EU and UK have led to incremental user growth, though they have not directly impacted major asset prices. Revolut, the biggest digital bank in the UK, stormed onto the UK scene a decade ago. Its easy-to-use mobile apps and lower fees for services such as overseas transactions and cross-border transfers have won millions of customers. The proportion of UK adults using neobanks soared from 16% in 2018 to 50% last year, according to data providers from reliable sources. Revolut is a neobank, which means it is a digital bank that provides different banking and financial services mainly through its mobile app, without the need for regular physical branches. It stands out as one of the leading neobanks, competing with other companies like Wise, N26, and Nubank. The fintech firm wants to increase this user percentage further, focusing on the larger US market with $24tn of assets. This is because the US market has several elements that may be attractive to its users. For example, interchange fees—the charges imposed by card networks like Visa and Mastercard on behalf of banks—are significantly higher in the US than in the EU or UK, where such fees are capped. As a result, a US customer generates more profit for the same volume of payments. The US is also super competitive in retail banking, where over 3,000 institutions offer attractive customer rewards and loyalty deals. Some critics say that European fintechs may not offer enough yet to attract customers away from their existing banks.

The rising exchange outflows and other essential factors are also bullish factors, suggesting that the asset’s price may head north soon. Whales Filled Their Bags The renowned analyst Ali Martinez unveiled on X that large investors scooped up more than 20,000 BTC in the past two days alone. Whales have bought over 20,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/cCmQOpUV8X — Ali (@ali_charts) May 29, 2025 According to Martinez’s chart, the collective bitcoin holdings of this investor cohort are just north of 4.7 million assets, which represents around 23.7% of the circulating supply. Accumulation from whales is generally viewed as a bullish factor that may be a precursor of a price rally. It shows that such investors have increased their confidence in the asset, which could encourage smaller players to join the bandwagon as well . Numerous X users reacted to the post, with some assuming that Michael Saylor could be among the individuals contributing to the buying spree. The company he co-founded has become the world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin, while he personally owns over 17,000 BTC, as he confirmed last year. Additional Bullish Elements The aforementioned actions of the whales are not the only factor suggesting that the price of BTC could be on the verge of a rally. Over the past month, the supply of the asset on exchanges has dried up. Ali Martinez revealed that 30,000 BTC had been moved off centralized platforms within the timeframe, while the chart below shows that the exchange netflows were positive in only seven out of the last 30 days. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant This suggests a shift from these entities toward self-custody solutions, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) should also be taken into account . The momentum oscillator measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes and varies from 0 to 100. When the ratio drops below 30, it typically indicates that the asset may be oversold and could be poised for a resurgence. Conversely, anything above 70 is interpreted as a bearish element. Over the past several hours, the RSI has been on a downward trend , currently standing just north of the lower mark.

While headlines often focus on major pairs like EUR/USD or GBP/USD, shifts in smaller, yet significant, currencies can offer valuable insights and opportunities. Recently, the Swedish Krona (SEK) has captured attention, particularly following an optimistic assessment from a major financial institution. What exactly is happening with the SEK, and why is one of the world’s leading banks predicting a brighter future for this Nordic currency? UBS, the Swiss multinational investment bank and financial services company, has issued a notable forecast regarding the Swedish Krona . Their analysis suggests that the SEK is well-positioned for further gains in the near term. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a view rooted in a detailed examination of economic indicators, monetary policy expectations, and the broader global financial landscape. For anyone tracking the Currency market , this prediction from a respected institution like UBS warrants close examination. What is Driving the Swedish Krona’s Recent Performance? Before diving into the specifics of the UBS forecast , it’s helpful to understand the context. The Swedish Krona has experienced periods of volatility. Its performance is influenced by a mix of domestic factors, such as Sweden’s economic growth, inflation rate, and the Riksbank’s (Sweden’s central bank) monetary policy decisions, as well as external forces, including global risk sentiment, commodity prices, and the performance of major trading partners’ economies, particularly the Eurozone. Recent months have seen the SEK grappling with various pressures. Like many currencies, it has been sensitive to shifts in global interest rate expectations and economic growth prospects. However, underlying strengths in the Swedish economy, coupled with evolving monetary policy stances from the Riksbank, are starting to paint a more positive picture for the currency’s future trajectory. Decoding the UBS Forecast: Why SEK is Poised for Gains UBS’s optimistic outlook for the Swedish Krona is based on several key pillars. Their analysts point to a convergence of factors that they believe will support the currency’s appreciation. Here are some of the core arguments underpinning the UBS forecast : Riksbank’s Stance: The Riksbank has been actively managing monetary policy to combat inflation. While they have navigated different phases, their current posture and future intentions regarding interest rates are crucial. UBS likely sees the Riksbank’s path as supportive of the SEK, perhaps anticipating rate differentials that favor the Krona or a more hawkish stance relative to some peers. Inflation Dynamics: The trajectory of inflation in Sweden is a major factor. If inflation proves persistent, it could necessitate tighter monetary policy, which is generally positive for a currency. Conversely, rapidly falling inflation might allow for earlier rate cuts, potentially weakening the currency. UBS’s view suggests they see inflation dynamics or the Riksbank’s reaction function as SEK-positive. Economic Resilience: Despite global headwinds, signs of resilience in the Swedish economy can bolster confidence in the SEK. UBS’s forecast likely incorporates their view on Sweden’s growth outlook, labor market strength, and overall economic stability compared to other regions. Global Risk Sentiment: The SEK, like other smaller, open economy currencies, can be sensitive to global risk appetite. In periods of increasing risk tolerance, investors might be more willing to invest in currencies perceived as having solid fundamentals, benefiting the SEK. UBS might be anticipating a shift in global sentiment that favors the Krona. Relative Valuation: Currency markets often correct over time based on relative value. UBS may see the Swedish Krona as undervalued compared to its fundamental drivers or historical averages against key pairs like the Euro or US Dollar, presenting an opportunity for appreciation. These factors, taken together, form the basis for UBS’s expectation of further gains for the Swedish Krona . It’s a view that contrasts with periods where the SEK has faced significant selling pressure, highlighting a potential turning point in the currency’s performance. Navigating Forex Trends: Factors Supporting the SEK Outlook Understanding the broader Forex trends is essential to appreciating the SEK forecast . Currency markets are interconnected, and the performance of one currency is always relative to another. UBS’s prediction implies specific expectations about how the Swedish Krona will fare against its major counterparts, particularly the Euro (EUR) and the US Dollar (USD). Several macro factors contribute to the Forex trends that could support the Swedish Krona ‘s rise: Interest Rate Differentials: When a central bank raises interest rates or is expected to keep them higher for longer than others, it makes that country’s assets (like bonds) more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields. This increased demand for assets denominated in that currency leads to increased demand for the currency itself, pushing its value up. UBS’s view on the Riksbank relative to the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Federal Reserve (Fed) is key here. If the Riksbank is seen as maintaining a tighter policy than expected by the market for its peers, it supports the SEK. Economic Growth Prospects: Stronger economic growth relative to trading partners can attract foreign investment, boosting demand for the domestic currency. A robust economy also provides the central bank more flexibility to maintain a firm monetary policy stance if needed to control inflation. Current Account Balance: A country’s current account reflects its balance of trade in goods and services, as well as net income from investments abroad. A surplus means the country is earning more foreign currency than it is spending, creating demand for its own currency as foreign earnings are converted back. A healthy current account can provide underlying support for the Swedish Krona . Global Liquidity and Capital Flows: Broad shifts in global liquidity and investor capital flows can significantly impact smaller currencies. When global risk appetite is high, capital tends to flow towards potentially higher-yielding or faster-growing economies, which can benefit currencies like the SEK. UBS’s analysis likely weighs these factors, concluding that the balance is tipping in favor of the Swedish Krona gaining ground within the current global Forex trends . Understanding the Currency Market: Potential Headwinds for SEK While UBS is optimistic, no forecast is without risks. The Currency market is influenced by a multitude of unpredictable events, from geopolitical developments to unexpected shifts in economic data or central bank communication. What could potentially derail the SEK forecast for further gains ? Potential challenges and headwinds include: Global Economic Slowdown: A deeper or more prolonged global recession than currently anticipated would likely reduce demand for exports and could dampen investor sentiment, weakening the SEK. Riksbank Policy Reversal: If the Riksbank signals a more dovish stance sooner than expected, perhaps due to rapidly falling inflation or concerns about economic growth, it could remove a key support for the Krona. Geopolitical Events: Unexpected political instability or conflicts in Europe or globally can trigger flights to safety, typically benefiting major safe-haven currencies like the USD or CHF at the expense of others like the SEK. Commodity Price Volatility: While not as commodity-dependent as some currencies, swings in global commodity prices can still impact Sweden’s terms of trade and indirectly affect the SEK. Domestic Issues: Specific domestic challenges, such as issues in the housing market or political uncertainty, could weigh on the currency. Navigating the Currency market requires acknowledging these potential risks. While the UBS forecast is positive, it’s based on current information and projections, which can change. Implications of the SEK Forecast: What Investors Should Consider For investors, the SEK forecast from UBS presents potential opportunities and points for consideration. Whether you are involved in Forex trading, have investments denominated in SEK, or are simply monitoring global economic signals, this outlook is relevant. For Forex Traders: The forecast suggests potential long opportunities in SEK pairs, particularly against currencies where the central bank is expected to be more dovish (e.g., potentially EUR or even USD if the Fed pivots sooner). Identifying specific entry and exit points requires technical analysis and careful risk management, but the fundamental view from UBS provides a directional bias. For Investors with SEK Exposure: If you hold assets denominated in Swedish Krona (like stocks on the Stockholm exchange) and live outside Sweden, a strengthening SEK increases the value of those assets when converted back to your local currency. Conversely, if you have liabilities in SEK, a stronger Krona makes them more expensive to service in your local currency. For Global Macro Watchers: The SEK forecast serves as a signal about broader economic health and monetary policy trends in Europe and globally. A strengthening SEK could reflect confidence in European economic stability or a shift in central bank policies that impacts the Eurozone and its neighbors. Even for those focused primarily on the crypto market, understanding these traditional financial market movements is valuable. Shifts in currency strength and interest rates can influence global liquidity, investor risk appetite, and capital flows – factors that indirectly impact the crypto space. Conclusion: The Swedish Krona on the Rise? UBS’s assessment provides a compelling case for anticipating further gains in the Swedish Krona . Their analysis, grounded in the expected path of the Riksbank’s monetary policy, Sweden’s economic fundamentals, and the global financial environment, paints an optimistic picture for the SEK’s performance against other major currencies. While potential headwinds exist, the UBS forecast highlights a significant shift in sentiment towards the Krona. Monitoring the SEK forecast and related Forex trends will be crucial in the coming months. Whether the predicted gains materialize as expected will depend on the interplay of the factors outlined above. For market participants, this outlook from a major bank offers a clear perspective to consider when navigating the complexities of the Currency market .

Market Response: Volume and Open Interest Soar WHITE briefly touched an intraday high of $0.00138 before returning to $0.00104. Its market cap ebbed and flowed at $780 million, with its daily volume rising by 500% to near $10 million. Open interest also caught up, rising 240% to a record high of $998.55k. The speculative frenzy signals a rush of retail and derivatives traders betting on a high-profile alliance. Since bottoming in March, WHITE is up over 280%. Rumors Target Ripple and Saudi Aramco The rally was fueled mainly by rumors circulating on X (formerly Twitter) . Anonymouse trader Amonyx indicated WhiteRock is partnering with Ripple to tokenize oil supply chains—allegedly involving Saudi Aramco. The letter was allegedly signed by a Saudi government representative and referred to the “largest blockchain tokenization deal in history.” It gathered over 254,000 views within a day. However, none of the three companies involved—Ripple, WhiteRock, or Aramco—announced the deal. Red Flags Surround the Leaked Document Investigation of the shared document raised grave concerns. The alleged signatory, “Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalid Al-Falih,” doesn’t appear on any official Saudi government records. Worse, a reverse image search reveals that the signature closely resembles that of Iranian actress Mahtab Keramati. Apart from that, Saudi Aramco has publicly announced no oil tokenization or blockchain collaboration save for its 2023 investment partnership with SBI Holdings—a venture that bypassed XRP or oil assets to some attention. WhiteRock’s Ripple Link and What is Real WhiteRock is indeed rooted in the XRP Ledger, having launched in March 2025 to provide institutional-grade tokenized assets. But there has been silence on oil-based products. The speculated Aramco connection looks speculative at best and, without confirmation , the recent momentum is vulnerable to correction. Conclusion: Warning Signs Ahead of Hype WHITE’s rally may be a reflection of market enthusiasm, but it’s essential to separate sentiment from reality.

Taking to X, Kusama declared, “My plans never changed,” signaling both reassurance and renewed determination to an audience that has long looked to him for leadership. The statement comes at a critical juncture for Shiba Inu, as the project balances heightened community expectations with ambitious technical developments that aim to solidify SHIB’s place in the evolving crypto landscape. GOOD. my plans never changed. Can we actually build stuff PLEASE?? — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) May 29, 2025 Reaffirming the Vision: Building Amid Challenges Shytoshi Kusama’s message underscores a fundamental point: despite market fluctuations, external skepticism, and the occasional wave of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), the SHIB team remains laser-focused on execution. His call — “Can we build stuff, PLEASE?” — strikes at the heart of the project’s ethos, pushing the community to prioritize tangible progress over mere hype or speculative frenzy. For many SHIB holders, this public declaration comes as both a rallying cry and a reassurance that the original goals set out in Shiba Inu’s expansive roadmap remain intact. From the inception of ShibaSwap to the launch of Shibarium, the project’s Layer-2 blockchain, Shiba Inu has consistently evolved beyond its origins as a meme token. Kusama’s leadership has been pivotal in steering the ecosystem toward utility, decentralization, and innovation, laying the groundwork for DeFi integrations, gaming initiatives, and a robust token economy built around SHIB, LEASH, and BONE . His recent statement signals that these ambitions have not wavered — if anything, they are intensifying. The Shiba Inu Ecosystem: More Than Just Hype Over the past year, Shiba Inu has undergone a remarkable transformation. With the rollout of Shibarium, the team has introduced scalable infrastructure capable of handling decentralized applications (dApps), reducing gas fees, and fostering an environment ripe for developer engagement. This shift has opened doors for new projects, partnerships, and on-chain activity, positioning Shiba Inu as more than just a speculative meme coin. Kusama’s consistent messaging has been critical in managing expectations, especially as the team juggles multiple development tracks and prepares for future expansions, including the much-anticipated Shiba Inu metaverse. Beyond the technical milestones, Shiba Inu’s vibrant and often passionate community remains its beating heart. Kusama’s latest remarks are a direct appeal to this base, encouraging holders to stay focused on the long-term vision rather than getting sidetracked by short-term price movements or external noise. For developers, partners, and collaborators, the message is equally clear: Shiba Inu’s leadership is here to deliver, and the time for building is now. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Looking Ahead: What Comes Next for SHIB? As the SHIB ecosystem moves deeper into 2025, several key initiatives remain on the horizon. The development team continues to refine Shibarium, aiming to onboard more projects and increase network activity. The planned launch of Shiba Inu’s metaverse also looms large, promising to integrate digital real estate, NFTs, and interactive experiences into the SHIB universe. Meanwhile, community-driven governance through the Doggy DAO is set to play a larger role, empowering holders to have a direct say in the project’s future direction. Shytoshi Kusama’s declaration that his plans have never changed reinforces the sense of continuity and purpose guiding these efforts. While the crypto industry at large faces a dynamic and often unpredictable landscape, Shiba Inu’s leadership appears resolute in its commitment to turning vision into reality. Whether SHIB can break through as a long-term, utility-driven ecosystem will ultimately depend on sustained development, strategic execution, and the continued support of its vast global community. For now, Kusama’s words stand as a clear signal: the time for distraction has passed. For Shiba Inu, the mission remains the same — to build, innovate, and deliver on the promises that have made SHIB one of the most recognizable names in the crypto world.

For many observers, seeing large amounts of Bitcoin move after significant price increases triggers alarm bells, conjuring fears of a market top. However, according to insights from leading crypto analytics firm Santiment, this particular instance of profit taking might be a fundamentally different signal – one that actually supports the continuation of the bullish trend in the crypto market . Understanding Holder Behavior in the Crypto Market In any market, understanding the actions of participants is crucial. In the volatile crypto market , deciphering holder behavior can offer unique insights into potential future price movements. Santiment, known for its on-chain data analysis, points to a specific metric that sheds light on what long-term holders are doing: the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA). What exactly is MDIA? It’s a metric that calculates the average age of all Bitcoin on the network, weighted by the price at which each coin last moved. Think of it as tracking how long, on average, investors have held onto their Bitcoin without selling or moving it. When MDIA increases, it suggests that coins are sitting idle in wallets, indicating accumulation or HODLing behavior. When MDIA decreases, it means older coins are being moved, typically signifying selling or spending by those who acquired Bitcoin some time ago. Santiment’s recent data shows a notable decline in Bitcoin’s MDIA since roughly mid-April. This decline is the key indicator of increased coin circulation, driven by holders who have been in the market for a while – the ones now engaging in profit taking . Why Profit Taking Might Fuel the Bitcoin Rally Traditionally, a decrease in MDIA due to selling might be seen as bearish. However, Santiment argues that a falling MDIA during an ongoing bull market is historically a strong bullish indicator. This seems counter-intuitive at first glance, but here’s the logic: When long-term holders, who bought Bitcoin at much lower prices, start selling, they are essentially taking profits. This action does several things that can sustain a Bitcoin rally : Provides Liquidity: Their selling provides the necessary supply for new buyers entering the market or existing holders wanting to increase their position. This prevents the rally from stalling due to a lack of available coins at current prices. Redistributes Supply: Bitcoin moves from ‘old hands’ to ‘new hands’. If the new buyers are accumulating with a long-term perspective, this fresh capital and renewed conviction can add momentum. Prevents Overheating (Initially): Unlike speculative short-term traders who might panic sell at the first sign of trouble, long-term holders selling into strength can create healthy pullbacks or consolidations, preventing the market from becoming excessively parabolic and prone to a sharp crash. It’s a more controlled distribution. Confirms Price Levels: The fact that there is sufficient demand to absorb the selling pressure from profitable holders validates the current Bitcoin price levels and builds a stronger foundation for further increases. Santiment emphasizes that this type of circulation, where older coins move, is characteristic of healthy bull markets where value is being transferred and new capital is entering. It’s distinct from a scenario where short-term holders are rapidly trading back and forth, which can indicate frothiness and potential tops. Is This Holder Behavior Different This Time? Every market cycle has unique characteristics, but the underlying principles of holder behavior often rhyme. The current decline in MDIA suggests that the long-term conviction that defined the earlier stages of accumulation is now transitioning into strategic distribution by those who have held for years. This is a natural phase in a bull market. Consider the alternative: if MDIA continued to rise indefinitely during a rally, it would mean virtually no one is selling. While this might sound bullish (extreme HODLing), it would actually make the market illiquid, leading to extremely volatile price spikes followed by potential crashes when the inevitable selling eventually occurs from fewer, larger holders. The current pattern, according to Santiment’s analysis, suggests a more sustainable, albeit potentially choppy, ascent for the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights For those navigating the crypto market , understanding metrics like MDIA and the implications of profit taking by different types of holders is invaluable. Here are some actionable insights: Look Beyond Simple Price Action: Don’t just react to price dips or large sell orders. Investigate the underlying on-chain data. Monitor MDIA: A falling MDIA during a bull trend is often a positive sign, indicating healthy market activity rather than capitulation. Distinguish Holder Types: Recognize that selling by long-term holders can have a different market impact than selling by short-term speculators. Stay Informed: Follow analyses from reputable firms like Santiment to get deeper insights into market dynamics beyond basic charts. While no single metric guarantees future performance, the MDIA provides a powerful lens through which to view the current Bitcoin rally . It suggests that the recent increase in coin movement isn’t a red flag waving goodbye to the bull market, but potentially the necessary fuel to keep the engine running. Conclusion: Why Profit Taking May Sustain the Rally In conclusion, the recent trend of profit taking observed among Bitcoin holders, as indicated by the declining Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), appears to be a constructive development for the ongoing Bitcoin rally . Rather than signaling an impending top, this movement of older coins into circulation provides essential liquidity, facilitates redistribution to new market participants, and helps create a more stable foundation for the rising Bitcoin price within the broader crypto market . By analyzing metrics like MDIA and understanding the nuances of holder behavior , investors can gain a clearer perspective on the market’s health and potential trajectory, recognizing that sometimes, selling isn’t a sign of weakness, but a necessary component of continued growth.

Ethereum (ETH) remains a foundational asset thanks to its dominance in smart contracts and DeFi. Shiba Inu (SHIB), once labeled a meme coin, is showing surprising strength as it builds real utility through its expanding ecosystem. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly rising as a low-price altcoin with high-growth potential, positioning itself among the top cryptos to buy now for those seeking outsized returns. As the crypto fear and greed index edges toward optimism, these three tokens are making a compelling case for inclusion in any forward-looking crypto portfolio. Ethereum and Shiba Inu Stay in Focus as Market Shifts Ahead of 2025 Ethereum (ETH) is priced at approximately $2,558, holding onto slight losses after a strong month following the smooth rollout of its Pectra upgrade, something that improved on-chain scalability and reignited institutional confidence. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is sitting at approximately $0.00001435, holding firm despite a small daily loss, with investor demand boosted by continued advancements in its Layer 2 network, Shibarium. Both holdings are in the spotlight as the market moves into long-term positioning in the run-up to 2025 cycle. Though ETH and SHIB have shown attraction, rising altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are coming under greater attraction from investors seeking high-growth prospects. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.5 million and accumulated 11,400 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position.

Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. It offers decentralization, security, and efficiency. Certik Audit Officially Completed, Stablecoin Secures Trust and Stability Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network.

Recently, attention has turned to Pump.fun , a prominent platform on the Solana network known for enabling the rapid creation and trading of memecoin tokens. According to data shared by the on-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens, an address believed to be linked to Pump.fun made a substantial deposit of 156,425 SOL , valued at approximately $25.74 million at the time, into the Kraken exchange. This single transaction occurred just moments before the report, highlighting the platform’s active engagement with centralized exchanges. Understanding Pump.fun’s Role on Solana Pump.fun has carved out a unique niche within the Solana ecosystem. It simplifies the process of launching new tokens, particularly memecoin projects, by providing a bonding curve mechanism directly on the blockchain. This allows anyone to create a token with minimal technical knowledge and initial capital, fostering a highly experimental and often volatile market environment. Ease of Creation: Low barrier to entry for launching tokens. Built-in Liquidity: Bonding curve ensures initial trading liquidity. Solana Integration: Leverages Solana’s speed and low transaction costs. Focus on Memecoins: Primarily used for launching community-driven, often speculative, tokens. The platform’s success is evident in the sheer volume of tokens launched and the significant amount of SOL that flows through it, generated from trading fees and potentially other operational aspects. Why Large SOL Deposits to Kraken Matter Centralized exchanges like Kraken serve as critical gateways between the crypto world and traditional finance, as well as major liquidity hubs for trading. When a platform like Pump.fun moves significant amounts of SOL to an exchange, it typically suggests several potential activities: Potential Reasons for Deposits: Operational Costs: Converting platform revenue (earned in SOL) into stablecoins or fiat to cover business expenses, development, or payroll. Liquidity Management: Preparing funds for potential market-making activities or managing internal liquidity needs. Profit Taking: Realizing gains from platform operations or treasury holdings. Security/Custody: Utilizing the exchange’s infrastructure for holding or managing a portion of assets. The recent $25.74 million deposit is notable on its own, but the cumulative total reported is even more striking. Since the start of the year, Pump.fun has reportedly deposited a staggering 2,344,517 SOL into Kraken , amounting to approximately $384 million based on recent prices. This figure underscores the scale of the platform’s activity and the substantial value it is processing and moving off-chain or into exchange custody. The Impact on the Memecoin Ecosystem and Solana The continuous flow of large SOL sums from Pump.fun to exchanges like Kraken has potential implications for the broader Solana and memecoin markets. Market Considerations: Potential Selling Pressure: If these deposits are intended for sale, they could contribute to selling pressure on SOL , depending on how the funds are utilized by Pump.fun . Platform Health Indicator: Consistent, large deposits could indicate significant revenue generation for Pump.fun , suggesting the platform is highly active and successful. Ecosystem Dynamics: It highlights the role of platforms like Pump.fun as major economic actors within the Solana ecosystem, influencing liquidity flows. Memecoin Cycle: The volume of deposits might correlate with peak activity or phases within the memecoin hype cycle on Solana . While a $25.74 million deposit is substantial, the market’s reaction depends on various factors, including overall market sentiment, the volume of trading on exchanges, and how the deposited funds are ultimately used. However, the cumulative $384 million figure provides a clear picture of the significant financial scale at which Pump.fun operates. What This Means for Pump.fun and SOL Holders For users of Pump.fun and participants in the memecoin frenzy on Solana , these large transfers are a reminder of the real-world value being generated and moved by platforms in this space. For SOL holders, it’s a data point indicating large movements by a key ecosystem participant. Actionable Insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on large movements from known platform addresses to exchanges as potential indicators of future activity. Understand Platform Economics: Recognize that platforms like Pump.fun generate revenue, which needs to be managed and potentially converted via exchanges. Consider Market Context: Evaluate these deposits within the broader context of Solana ‘s performance and the overall crypto market trend. These deposits are likely part of Pump.fun ‘s standard operational procedures, reflecting the platform’s success and its need to interact with centralized financial infrastructure. However, the sheer scale of the funds involved makes it a noteworthy event for anyone tracking the pulse of the Solana ecosystem and the ever-evolving memecoin landscape. The recent $25.74 million SOL deposit into Kraken by an address linked to Pump.fun is a testament to the platform’s significant activity and revenue generation within the Solana network. Coupled with the cumulative $384 million deposited this year, it underscores the massive financial flows driven by the memecoin phenomenon. While large deposits can sometimes precede selling activity, they are also a necessary function for platforms managing substantial revenue and operational needs. This ongoing interaction between decentralized platforms like Pump.fun and centralized exchanges like Kraken remains a key dynamic to watch in the crypto market.

The inflation data also came in slightly hotter than analyst estimates and is approaching the European Central Bank’s 2% target. Germany’s core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, dropped slightly from April’s 2.8% to 2.9% in May. The country’s services PMI decreased to 47.20 points this month, down from 49 points in April. Its energy prices also plummeted for the second month in a row, dropping by 4.6% in May. Germany’s CPI nears ECB’s 2% target GERMANY MAY HICP M/M RISES ABOVE FORECAST Preliminary Harmonized CPI rose 0.2% m/m in May, slightly above the 0.1% estimate. Indicates mild monthly inflation pressure, possibly driven by energy or services. GERMANY MAY HICP Y/Y AT 2.1%, TOPS ESTIMATE Harmonized CPI rose 2.1%… — Naeem Aslam (@NaeemAslam23) May 30, 2025 Germany’s consumer price index has been inching up towards the European Central Bank’s 2% target over recent months, giving a positive signal amid ongoing uncertainty about the economic outlook for Europe’s largest economy. Global trade tensions emanating from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have mired expectations for Germany’s financial future. Sebastian Becker, an economist at Deutsche Bank, argued last month that while the inflation rate closing in on the ECB’s 2% mark is good news for consumers at first glance, there are some less positive points about the data on a closer look. He noted that the slight decrease in the headline figures only took place due to lower energy and food costs. The European Central Bank is set to make its interest rate decision on June 5. According to LSEG data, traders last priced in an over 96% chance of a quarter-point interest rate reduction. Last month, the ECB cut its deposit facility rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%. Preliminary data also showed that the country’s economy expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter from the previous three-month period. The German Federal Statistics Office attributed the quarterly increase to the fact that both household final consumption expenditure and capital formation were higher than in the previous quarter. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, argued that though the figures were positive, the quarterly increase was still far too small to end the country’s long-lasting stagnation. Last month, the German government cut its economic outlook to predict stagnation in 2025, with outgoing economy minister Robert Habeck saying that Trump’s trade policies and their impact on the country were the main factors behind the revision. “The economic outlook in Germany and the eurozone remains gloomy, and the risks for the economy are high due to the drastic and erratic tariff policy of the U.S. president. With the aim of strengthening domestic demand, the ECB should therefore, ease monetary policy further in the near future.” -Silke Tober, Economist at Macroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK). Germany is still forecasting stagnation in 2025, which could result in the longest period without growth in its post-war history. Trump’s trade policies could also damage economic growth in the European nation, given Germany’s status as an export-reliant country, though the potential impact of such duties remains unclear. Trump pushes EU’s tariff deadline to July TRUMP: I AGREED TO EXTEND EU 50% TARIFF DEADLINE TO JULY 9 Captain Caveman strikes again. Trump has folded on just about every tariff threat within 48 hours. 😆 — Alex Cole (@acnewsitics) May 26, 2025 Trump backed down from imposing steep levies on the European Union two days after threatening the bloc with 50% tariffs on May 25, the President agreed to extend his deadline for trade talks until July 9, from the June 1 deadline he set previously. Trump’s decision came after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told him the 47-nation bloc needed more time to reach a good deal. Leyen reportedly spoke to Trump via phone, saying the EU needed more time to agree and asking him to delay the trade duties until July. Trump had imposed a 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariffs on all countries worldwide on April 9. During a trip to Vietnam on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said he hoped Washington and Brussels could achieve a deal with the lowest tariffs possible. He also believes that the discussions are advancing, with EU commissioner for trade, Marcos Sefcovic expected to meet the U.S. trade representative, Jamieson Greer, on the sidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meeting in Paris on Tuesday next week.

The move, justified as part of a crackdown on illicit business and money laundering, is already sending shockwaves through the region's crypto community. The Thai SEC cited the platforms as being in operation in Thailand without local licenses under the Royal Decree on Digital Asset Businesses. Official complaints were lodged with the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES), which can now block access under new anti-cybercrime laws implemented in April. The SEC warning to investors was blunt: transfer your assets before closure or risk losing legal protection. “🚨NEW: Thailand’s SEC is cracking down on unlicensed crypto platforms. In a notice today, the regulator said it will block access to @Bybit_Official, @OKX, @coinexcom, @1000X_Official, and @XTexchange on June 28 for operating without a license.” — @kyle_chasse, May 30, 2025 Mapping the Exodus: Capital Flight in Real Time On-chain data already showed a spike in withdrawals by wallets of Thai origin that are linked to the hacked exchanges. Nansen and Arkham Intelligence statistics have shown that, within 48 hours of the SEC reveal, over $120 million worth of BTC, ETH, and USDT were taken out of OKX and Bybit wallets labeled with Thai user accounts. The capital flight serves as a reminder of the need for traders to hedge their assets before the blackout date. The SEC action follows a string of amendments to Thailand's cybercrime and digital asset law that give regulators greater authority to close down illegal sites and also pursue offshore sellers offering to Thai customers. Exchanges need to register, with a Thai entity, pass rigorous capital tests (50M THB, or approximately $1.4M USD), and meet domestic AML/KYC standards to be legal. Legal Loopholes and the MiCAR Issue Local lawyers call Southeast Asia's fragmented licensing system ripe for change. ”Thailand takes a hard line, but a lack of regional harmonization has capital and users simply move across the border to the next easy-going jurisdiction,” says crypto attorney Somchai Phanich. ”MiCAR in the EU is becoming the template because it weighs innovation against robust consumer protection and integrity of market.” “Thailand’s ban on OKX, Bybit, etc. is a wake-up call for Southeast Asia. MiCAR-style rules could bring much-needed clarity and stability.” — @RegAsiaLaw, May 30, 2025 What's Next for Thai Crypto Users and the Region? For the time being, Thai investors are rushing to withdraw capital and seek compliant platforms. The SEC has encouraged the public to verify its official list of approved exchanges and cautioned that assets on non-approved platforms are not insured under Thai law. As Southeast Asian regulators watch the situation unfold, if legal uncertainty and capital flight persist, the region will see pressure building for single, MiCAR-style regulations to preclude regulatory arbitrage and restore investor confidence. Key Takeaways Thailand's move to ban OKX, Bybit, and three others marks a new era of regulatory seriousness in Southeast Asia. As capital flees and lawsuits escalate, the region is at a crossroads: keep playing regulatory whack-a-mole, or implement a concerted, MiCAR-type response to the next phase of crypto growth.

Governor Fabio Panetta stressed the urgent need for a coordinated and comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, especially as they become increasingly integrated into mainstream finance. A Risky Integration with Traditional Finance Governor Panetta noted the growing number of agreements between crypto firms and financial intermediaries. A growing number of large, publicly traded U.S. firms now park substantial Bitcoin holdings on their balance sheets, putting everyday investors on the hook for the coin’s sharp price swings. At the same time, the boom in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has woven crypto even more tightly into traditional markets. Panetta cautioned that this overlap comes with serious dangers. Unlike standard financial assets, most cryptocurrencies—including Bitcoin—have no underlying value and can swing wildly in price. Since they are typically traded on lightly regulated, opaque platforms, these assets could set off shocks that reverberate through the wider financial system. Stablecoins and Systemic Threats Panetta also focused on the emergence of stablecoins—digital assets designed to maintain value relative to fiat currencies or other assets. While they seek to offer price stability, their utility as a payment instrument remains questionable in the absence of robust regulation. Risks related to issuer reliability and the underlying collateral persist, raising concerns for consumers and regulators alike. The Governor warned that if major global tech companies were to adopt stablecoins for payments across their platforms, they could create powerful, systemically important networks beyond the reach of national regulators. These shifts could erode governments’ control over their own currencies, put people’s data at risk, and upend core banking services such as lending. Panetta also warned that the anonymity built into many crypto-assets makes them attractive for bad actors, who could use them to launder money, trade illegally, or dodge international sanctions. MiCA: Strengthening Rules for Safer Crypto Markets Governor Panetta noted the importance of regulatory progress in Europe, pointing to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as a step toward a safer and more transparent digital asset market. He noted that MiCA introduces clearer rules designed to protect consumers and ensure the orderly development of crypto markets. The regulation distinguishes between different types of stablecoins, granting payment legitimacy only to those backed by a single official currency, referred to as electronic money tokens (EMTs). According to Panetta, only these EMTs offer sufficient safeguards to qualify as a reliable means of payment under the new framework.

Investors are watching closely to see if these altcoins will hit new highs. This article explores the potential for growth in these digital assets and what factors might drive their anticipated rise. Uptrend Sparks Debate: Ethereum’s Mixed Performance and Key Levels Ethereum advanced by 46.35% over one month while dropping 28.94% across six months. A one-week decline of 1.14% reflects volatile swings amid rising gains. Price moves have shown brisk rallies followed by marked pullbacks, painting a picture of uneven momentum. Recent behavior underscores a market that reacts sharply to news and liquidity shifts. Current price sits between $1468.66 and $2037.85, with a key support at $1142.44 and resistance at $2280.82. Bulls have pushed prices upward into a range with promise, yet bears lurk below support. Trading ideas suggest watching for a break above $2037.85 toward the next hurdle or a dip under $1142.44 to trigger caution. Solana Market Dynamics: Past Volatility and Today's Key Levels SOL experienced a 13.11% rise in the past month, contrasting with a significant 30.35% decline over the last six months. Price behavior suggests the coin undergoes brief rallies followed by steep pullbacks. The data indicates occasional recoveries, but the market remains under prolonged downward pressure, reflecting both bullish bursts and sustained bearish sentiment. Currently, trading is confined within a range of approximately $109 to $171, with resistance around $194.93 and support at $71.65. Market indicators show a slight short-term bearish bias after a nearly 7.8% weekly decline, despite hints of recovery over the month. Buyers may focus on support levels, while sellers eye resistance, waiting for clearer directional signals to materialize. Conclusion ETH shows strong potential with its aim of reaching $4K. SOL also demonstrates a steady path toward $250. Both coins are pushing towards new highs, indicating bullish momentum in the market. Current trends suggest that investor interest and positive sentiment are high. ETH and SOL remain key players to watch as they drive forward in their respective price targets. The future could see these altcoins achieving significant milestones if the momentum continues. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The company also provides services that make it easier for bad actors to impersonate trusted brands and allow them to quickly change to a different domain name and IP address when the legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down. In 2014, Funnull bought and altered a repository of codes used by web developers to redirect visitors of legitimate sites to scam and online gambling sites, some of which are associated with Chinese criminal money laundering operations. The Treasury Department says that Funnull has ties to the majority of the crypto investment scam websites that were reported to the FBI. US-based victims claim losing over $200 million to these schemes, or an average of $150,000 per individual. The OFAC is also imposing sanctions against Funnull’s administrator, Chinese national Liu Lizhi, who was in possession of documents that contain information about the company’s employees, including their performance and progress on tasks.

With over $40 million worth of Solaxy tokens sold and more than 7 million units locked in a passive income protocol, it has emerged as the largest presale meme coin of 2025. However, some investors may still miss the opportunity to buy into it. But this won’t be much of a problem because the Wall Street Ponke (WPonke) has emerged to take over the mantle as the most traded presale memecoin of 2025, getting ready for a possible 100X. This piece reviews the advantages Ponke has over Solaxy hence making it a viable replacement while the launch date approaches. Solaxy Whales Maintains Steady Patronage, Makes Last Minute Movement As a beneficiary of the 21st Century Act (FIT21) regulation, the latest data shows that Solaxy has gone up by 57.4% one week after its official launch. This was after some anonymous whales had bought $400,000 worth of Solaxy on May 14 alone. Solaxy whales have somehow uncovered the token’s ability to solve the few challenges experienced in Solana, some of which include network congestion, scalability limitations, and failed transactions. With a presale price of $0.001738, more investors are making haste to meet up with the presale date before its 18-day closing window. Ponke’s Interest in Education Increases Its Awareness Investors that’s likely to miss Solaxy’s pre-launch are not only wooing Ponke for its profitability, butalso the practical functioning of the Ponke team. The management, in a bid to promote the popularity of Ponke, has introduced an E-learning section of the Ponke platform. This includes a functional educational hub where users can share working methods, signals, and courses. With over 20 billion units of Ponke in total supply, this arrangement has proven to be the best way to encourage collaboration and knowledge-sharing among traders. What Lies Ahead for Ponke Investors In the Future? The project (Ponke) has already raised $317,000 and $328,000 in its pre-sale stage and has recorded slightly over 1.2 billion tokens staked. The presale price for Ponke is currently $0.000263 and is expected to be 100X in its post-launch stage. However, the staking reward is placed at 10%, while the exchange liquidity is at 15%. For Solaxy investors who are lucky enough to buy into Ponke before its official launch, a futuristic attribute of the Ponke project awaits them. They should expect an advanced detection system that automatically identifies con developers and tokens on the blockchain. https://twitter.com/Wallstreetponke/status/1922793562091008367 They should also expect an improved privacy feature that protects users against wallet tracking. This is expected to happen through the improvement of its layer 2 privacy features. This privacy feature also extends to personal data protection: it protects users’ data against external factors. When officially launched by Q4 of 2025, Ponke will practically change cryptocurrency investment as we know it; it will move assets from whales to developers, recognizing them as the backbone of the project. And because of its community-oriented markup, it is expected to become the hub of knowledge exchange, where traders can share signals, strategies, and trading insights. About Wall Street Ponke Wall Street Ponke (WPonke) is a memecoin developed to enable a more transparent, fraud-free cryptocurrency transaction. Operating on the Ethereum Layer 2 technology, Ponke comes with some useful features that set it apart from others. As the first AI-enabled memecoin, it is set to bring back integrity in the market. It’s set to achieve this through its many useful features like a fraud detection feature, AI-assisted trading, and an anti-wallet tracking feature, all in a bid to protect an average trader.

These 5 Catalysts Could Ignite ADA,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-to-10-in-2025-5-catalysts/,"Cardano staking pool operator (SPO) Sssebi (@Av_Sebastian) has ignited a debate by asserting that Cardano’s ADA could reach double-digit territory this year. In a thread that began, “These are the ingredients for $10 $ADA in 2025,” he listed five developments he believes will transform the eighth-largest cryptocurrency from a $0.70 token into a $10 asset. Each of those “ingredients” is now taking shape—and each comes with its own uncertainties. #1 Cardano Becomes Bitcoin’s DeFi Layer At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Input Output (IO) stunned attendees by moving a live Bitcoin Ordinal across a new BitVM-based bridge to Cardano. IO called the demonstration “a preview of what is to come,” adding that the “Cardinal” protocol aims for full integration so BTC holders can lend, borrow and stake inside Cardano’s extended-UTxO environment. By transplanting Bitcoin liquidity onto a programmable ledger without wrapped custodial tokens, Cardano positions itself as a settlement layer for so-called BTCFi applications—an addressable market that today tops $1 trillion in dormant value. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out #2 The Midnight “Glacier Drop” Airdrop Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson told Consensus 2025 in Toronto that Midnight, his privacy-focused sidechain, will airdrop both NIGHT governance tokens and DUST privacy tokens to “approximately 37 million wallets across eight major blockchains”—with “zero allocation to venture capitalists.” “Every Consensus there’s a new token saying, ‘my thing is better,’” he said. “We’re going to give this away and let users decide.” The sheer scale dwarfs recent airdrops and could seed tens of millions of new ADA-capable addresses once Midnight’s cross-chain fee model pushes traffic back to the base chain. #3 A US Listed Cardano Spot ETF In February NYSE Arca filed to convert the Grayscale Cardano Trust into a spot ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged the application on 24 February, starting a 240-day clock that now runs to 22 October 2025. The agency’s first-phase deadline of 29 May was pushed to 15 July, following the pattern that preceded January’s Bitcoin ETF approvals. Grayscale has argued that ADA’s on-chain transparency and staking mechanics make it “substantially resistant to manipulation,” echoing the language that ultimately persuaded regulators on Bitcoin. An approval would give traditional investors a regulated conduit to stake-enabled yield—something no US crypto ETF yet offers. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours #4 ADA In The US Strategic Reserve President Donald Trump’s March executive order created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile to hold crypto seized in federal cases. A subsequent Truth Social post surprised markets by naming “XRP, Solana and Cardano” for inclusion alongside Bitcoin and Ether; ADA jumped more than 70% intraday. Though the order bars fresh purchases of altcoins, Treasury accounting shows roughly $493 million in non-Bitcoin assets—ADA among them—already earmarked. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov called the move “a reputational boost, signaling the US. views digital assets as strategic.” Inclusion in a sovereign reserve legitimises ADA for conservative allocators and could ease the path for futures and options listings. #5 The Ouroboros Leios Upgrade Hoskinson labels Leios “the capstone of the entire Ouroboros agenda … the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet.” In a May 1 livestream he said simulations show “tens of thousands of transactions per second” without sacrificing decentralization. The upgrade introduces parallel input, ranking and endorsement blocks, allowing throughput to be dialed up as adoption demands. If main-net integration lands in H2 2025, Leios would coincide with Midnight’s launch and the ETF review window—an alignment bulls see as catalytic. ADA trades near $0.70 today, implying a market capitalization of roughly $25 billion. A jump to $10 would push valuation toward $350 billion, rivaling Ethereum’s 2024 peak.

From Trump’s meme coin dinner to the SEC’s stunning reversal on Binance, a new era in crypto regulation may be dawning—and not without controversy. Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner Sparks Transparency Backlash On May 25, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson dodged pointed questions about a private meme coin dinner hosted by President Donald Trump at his Virginia golf club earlier in the week. Speaker Mike Johnson sidestepped transparency questions on Trump’s meme coin dinner, as Democrats call for a DOJ probe. #trump #memecoin https://t.co/IST3Gu2foM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 26, 2025 The event, reportedly attended by top investors in the Trump-themed “TRUMP” meme coin, has raised red flags among Democrats, 35 of whom have called on the Department of Justice to investigate possible corruption and foreign influence. In a CNN interview, Johnson claimed ignorance of the May 22 event and refused to comment on whether the guest list should be released. With crypto now playing a visible role in campaign fundraising and narrative-building, critics argue that unchecked intersections between politics and digital assets pose serious ethical questions. Banking Lobby Pushes Back Against SEC Cyber Rule While political tensions flared, financial institutions were busy behind the scenes. On May 22, U.S. banking heavyweights—including the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, and SIFMA—petitioned the SEC to withdraw its controversial cybersecurity incident disclosure rule. The regulation, known as Item 1.05 in Form 8-K, mandates disclosure of material cyber incidents within four business days. However, industry groups warn that this requirement endangers national security, disrupts law enforcement efforts, and causes unnecessary panic. Their message: transparency shouldn’t come at the cost of an effective cybersecurity response. David Sacks Floats ‘Budget-Neutral’ Bitcoin Reserve Strategy In a more surprising development, David Sacks—a key White House adviser on crypto and artificial intelligence—proposed that the U.S. could begin acquiring Bitcoin without increasing the national debt. White House’s David Sacks Hints at Budget-Neutral Path for U.S. Bitcoin Purchases through asset reallocation rather than new spending. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin2025 https://t.co/xX9g1PBwWs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, Sacks hinted that Treasury assets could be reallocated to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve, suggesting a shift toward digital gold without new government spending. This “budget-neutral” strategy could become a foundational talking point if the next administration, potentially Trump-led, leans further into Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. Trump Media Bets $2.5 Billion on Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In tandem with the government’s speculative interest in Bitcoin, Trump Media & Technology Group is taking decisive action. The company behind Truth Social announced a private placement offering worth $2.5 billion to amass what could become one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in history. The funding, split between $1.5 billion in common stock and $1 billion in convertible notes, is expected to close by May 29. With the president’s brand directly tied to both political and crypto narratives, this move solidifies Trump’s role as an emerging Bitcoin maximalist, at least in the public eye. Departing CFTC Commissioner Warns of ‘Big Swings’ in Oversight Even as crypto gains institutional favor, regulatory instability looms. Christy Romero, outgoing commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), issued a cautionary note during her farewell remarks at the Brookings Institution. As she exits the CFTC, Christy Romero issues a warning: “big swings” in regulatory policies could crack the foundation of U.S. markets. #ChristyRomero #CFTC https://t.co/w1aSAb44E5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 Romero warned that “big swings” between aggressive regulation and hands-off deregulation could jeopardize the integrity of U.S. financial markets. While she didn’t name names, the remarks are widely seen as a critique of the Trump administration’s shifting stance on digital assets and market oversight. Department of Labor Reverses 401(k) Crypto Ban Another reversal this week came from the U.S. Department of Labor. On May 28, it rescinded its 2022 guidance that discouraged cryptocurrency in workplace retirement plans. The prior policy had warned plan sponsors to exercise “extreme care” and triggered investigations into firms offering crypto options. U.S. Department of Labor Reverses Crypto Guidance, Opens Door for 401(k) Bitcoin Exposure, ending Biden-era restrictions. #Crypto #401k https://t.co/9Pw4USYtwS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Now, the reversal indicates a more neutral stance on crypto regulation, opening the door for Bitcoin to return as a viable 401(k) asset—a potentially transformative development for crypto adoption among retail investors. SEC Ends Lawsuit Against Binance, CZ In perhaps the week’s most jaw-dropping twist, the SEC dropped its high-profile lawsuit against Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The case, filed in June 2023, accused the exchange of inflating volumes and mishandling customer funds. @SECGov and @binance legal clash ends as U.S. regulator drops landmark lawsuit. #binance #SEC https://t.co/Qlz11yoG4n — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 On May 29, both parties jointly signed a dismissal, bringing an end to a two-year saga that had cast a shadow over the global exchange. The sudden conclusion leaves observers wondering: Is the crypto industry’s biggest regulatory battle truly over or just entering a new phase? This week revealed a U.S. crypto sector at an inflection point. While Trump allies promote digital assets through political events and billion-dollar treasuries, regulators are struggling to keep pace—and often stepping back.

The token is pegged to fiat currencies and built for cross-border and retail transactions. JD Chain CEO Liu Peng warned against unauthorized purchase offers during the test period. JD.com is moving forward with the rollout of its blockchain-based stablecoin, which is currently undergoing the second phase of sandbox testing in Hong Kong , according to a report published by Guandian on May 30. The update was shared by Liu Peng, CEO of JD Chain, stating that the token is pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies like the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. JD.com Prepares Official Stablecoin Launch The stablecoin is built on a public blockchain infrastructure and is intended to support cross-border payments, enterprise settlement, and everyday retail use. Liu said it will be available for broader use after completing the sandbox program. “We hope this project contributes to payment efficiency not only within JD’s ecosystem but also for businesses and individuals worldwide,” Liu said. The initiative has been accepted into Hong Kong’s stablecoin issuer sandbox following a year of preparation. JD.com cited the regulatory environment and government support for digital assets as key reasons for launching the project in the city. The company said it is prioritizing compliance and infrastructure readiness before releasing the stablecoin to the public. Liu warned that any unofficial purchase offers currently circulating are unauthorized. The project showcases JD.com’s strategy to enhance its cross-border transaction systems and expand its role in global commerce through blockchain tools.

It operates across retail, supply chain, and fintech segments. JD Chain is its dedicated blockchain unit, focusing on developing digital infrastructure for enterprise applications, including payments, asset management, and smart contracts. While crypto trading remains banned in mainland China, Hong Kong operates under a separate regulatory system that permits controlled digital asset pilots. JD Chain’s sandbox participation is legally viable under this structure, allowing the company to test blockchain-based payments without violating national policy. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been active in stablecoin oversight, backing sandbox trials and CBDC pilots for cross-border use. JD.com’s stablecoin joins a wave of enterprise-led experiments exploring legal frameworks for tokenized payments in the region. The move could indicate a trend among major Chinese firms toward blockchain infrastructure. Though speculative crypto remains restricted, state guidance has supported applications focused on payments, logistics, and compliance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Why is JD Chain building on a public blockchain? Using a public blockchain allows greater transparency and potential interoperability with other systems, which could make the stablecoin more versatile in global transactions. What precedent does this set for other Mainland firms? JD.com’s pilot could open a pathway for state-aligned companies to explore blockchain payments through Hong Kong. This model provides legal cover while allowing firms to collect real-world data, which could influence future policy directions in mainland China. Is this a shift in China’s blockchain policy, or an exception? Rather than a policy shift, it represents a tactical use of regulatory segmentation.

Since its launch in 2014, the Stellar network has specialized in fast, low-cost cross-border payments. Its native token, Lumens (XLM), facilitates frictionless currency conversions and micropayments while maintaining decentralization through the Stellar Consensus Protocol. As of Q2 2025, Stellar is trading near $0.27 with a market cap exceeding $8.4 billion. DigitalCoinPrice projects a bullish yet measured outlook, with estimates ranging between $0.24 and $0.60 for 2025. These projections are rooted in growing enterprise adoption, increasing developer activity, and the network’s utility in real-world applications like remittances and stablecoin issuance. Increased institutional use cases are also adding momentum. Projects like Franklin Templeton’s tokenized U.S. mutual fund and partnerships with financial giants have positioned Stellar as more than just a transactional layer. Its on-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) and asset issuance capabilities provide a foundation for programmable money and financial services that operate without intermediaries. Stellar Price Prediction 2025: Can Stellar Reach the $0.60 Mark? The possibility of Stellar hitting $0.60 depends on both macroeconomic and on-chain catalysts. From a technical standpoint, XLM is forming higher lows and consolidating within a symmetrical triangle. If Bitcoin maintains its strength and altcoins follow, Stellar could see a breakout toward the $0.50 to $0.60 range. Fundamentally, Stellar’s roadmap includes upgrades to network throughput and improvements in smart contract flexibility via Soroban. Increased engagement from traditional finance could also act as a bullish catalyst. Regulatory clarity across jurisdictions further supports the long-term viability of protocols like Stellar, especially those aligned with financial compliance frameworks. Historically, XLM has shown explosive growth during bullish market cycles. Its all-time high of $0.93 in 2018 occurred during a market-wide rally. With growing momentum in tokenized assets and real-world finance, a climb toward $0.60 would represent a moderate but realistic recovery, not an extraordinary leap. However, it’s important to acknowledge volatility and downside risks. Price fluctuations, evolving regulatory landscapes, and competition from other payment-focused blockchains like Ripple and Algorand could limit upside. Adoption curves and market cycles rarely progress linearly. Why Technical Analysts Are Watching Stellar Closely Stellar’s trading volume has remained stable, suggesting active market engagement. Daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings hover near neutral, indicating room for upward movement. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is on the verge of a bullish crossover. Whale accumulation is also being observed on-chain, with large transactions increasing in volume. This activity often precedes price rallies, particularly when accompanied by positive news or development milestones. If XLM breaks resistance at $0.30 with volume confirmation, the next targets are $0.42 and $0.58. Sentiment indicators show a neutral-to-bullish bias, fueled by renewed interest in utility-based cryptocurrencies. Compared to speculative tokens, Stellar offers tangible applications in finance, making it a more grounded asset for mid- to long-term portfolios. Qubetics: A New Contender in Decentralized Infrastructure While Stellar continues to dominate cross-border payments, Qubetics is rapidly gaining attention for redefining decentralized infrastructure through real-world utility applications. One of its core innovations is a decentralized VPN system that leverages blockchain to provide censorship-resistant, secure, and anonymous internet access. Unlike centralized VPN providers, Qubetics offers a peer-to-peer architecture that prevents single points of failure and data exposure. The decentralized VPN enables users to relay encrypted traffic through a global network of nodes, incentivized by the native $TICS token. This use case holds strong relevance in an age of digital surveillance and growing concerns over internet privacy. Crypto Presale Performance and ROI Projections Beyond the decentralized VPN, Qubetics is making headlines with its robust token presale metrics. As of Stage 36, the Qubetics crypto presale has secured over 27,300 holders, selling more than 514 million tokens. The project has raised more than $17.5 million in funding, indicating strong community backing and long-term belief in its roadmap. $TICS tokens are currently priced at $0.3064 in this stage. Analysts have laid out compelling ROI projections based on post-presale price targets. If $TICS reaches $1, the return on investment stands at 226%. A $5 target yields 1,531% gains, while a $10 valuation translates to a staggering 3,163% ROI. Long-term holders are especially eyeing the $15 mark post-mainnet launch, which represents a 4,794% return. These figures are attracting a mix of early adopters and blockchain advocates who see Qubetics as an infrastructure coin rather than just another speculative asset. Its focus on privacy, interoperability, and community-driven scaling makes it stand out in a saturated market. How Qubetics and Stellar Could Shape the Next Phase of Crypto Utility Both Stellar and Qubetics are focused on utility, though in different sectors. While Stellar emphasizes financial access and tokenized money, Qubetics aims to fortify the digital rights of users through decentralized services. Together, they reflect a maturing blockchain ecosystem that prioritizes real-world solutions over hype. Stellar’s integration with banks and fintech platforms could serve as a springboard for broader adoption, particularly if CBDCs and stablecoins gain traction. At the same time, Qubetics may become foundational in Web3 infrastructure by offering secure access layers to decentralized applications and services. For analysts and blockchain developers, the complementary nature of these platforms opens up cross-chain collaboration possibilities. Both tokens—XLM and $TICS—offer potential exposure to the infrastructure backbone of the next internet, each with different risk profiles and growth pathways. Final Thoughts Stellar’s price prediction for 2025 suggests a range between $0.24 and $0.60, with multiple factors influencing the outcome. These include macro trends, institutional interest, and technical developments. While reaching $0.60 is not guaranteed, it remains within striking distance if network utility continues to expand. In parallel, Qubetics is building momentum as a decentralized infrastructure pioneer. Its presale success and VPN use case position it as a contender for outsized returns in the current cycle. With over 27,300 holders and strong technical fundamentals, Qubetics is on the radar of seasoned participants seeking exposure to early-stage blockchain solutions.

On May 30, ECB policymaker and Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fabio Panetta, gave a severe warning. He said that banks working closely with crypto companies could risk customer trust, which, if lost, could cause the whole financial system to suffer. ECB Warns Crypto Losses Could Damage Trust in Banks Panetta shared his thoughts during the Bank of Italy’s annual report presentation. He explained that many people do not fully understand the risk associated with crypto assets. If banks start offering these assets, customers might believe they are as safe as regular savings or investment products. However, they are not. Digital currencies are risky and not protected in the same way as normal bank services. He explained that the concern is about individual losses and trust. If enough people lose confidence in banks because of crypto losses, it could harm the entire credit system. Panetta’s view on crypto aligns with that of Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Martin Schlegel. Schlegel said the bank will not hold Bitcoin as a reserve in April. He explained that Bitcoin’s well-known price swings made it unsuitable for the bank’s needs . Schlegel stated that stability is critical for any asset worthy of national reserve inclusion. Banks Are Moving Ahead With Crypto Plans Even with these warnings, some banks are already making moves in the crypto space. Earlier this year, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Italy’s largest banks, bought €1 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). The bank’s CEO, Carlo Messina, called this acquisition a “test.” On the other hand, it is also part of a larger plan. The bank now has its digital asset trading desk and handles crypto trades. In Spain, Santander is also preparing to enter the crypto market . According to reports, the bank is considering creating its stablecoin and offering crypto services through its digital app. Reportedly, top banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are working together to launch a joint stablecoin project . These steps show that major banks are becoming more active in crypto. This is happening quickly, and some experts believe that regulations are not keeping up. ECB Calls for Caution It is important to note that Fabio Panetta is not against change. However, he believes that banks and regulators need to be more careful. He highlighted that the main problem is trust. Banks are seen as safe and reliable. If people lose money through crypto services offered by banks, that trust could break. He emphasized that rebuilding may be difficult to rebuild once it is broken.

Learn how to get started, earn daily crypto rewards, and explore flexible, eco-friendly mining contracts. Cloud mining has emerged as a compelling alternative for individuals seeking to profit from digital assets like Bitcoin without the complexities associated with traditional mining or trading. Platforms such as HashFly are at the forefront, offering accessible and potentially lucrative avenues for both novices and seasoned investors.​ The Appeal of Cloud Mining Cloud mining involves renting computing power from remote data centers to mine cryptocurrencies. This model eliminates the need for personal mining equipment, thereby reducing concerns related to hardware costs, maintenance, and energy consumption. In 2025, cloud mining has become particularly appealing due to several factors:​ Lower Upfront Costs: Traditional mining requires significant investment in hardware and infrastructure. Cloud mining allows users to participate without these substantial initial expenses. ​ Operational Efficiency: By outsourcing the technical aspects of mining to specialized providers, individuals can avoid the complexities of hardware setup and maintenance. ​ Accessibility: Cloud mining opens the door for those who may lack the technical expertise or resources to engage in traditional mining, democratizing access to cryptocurrency profits. ​ Regular Passive Income: Participants can earn a consistent stream of cryptocurrency rewards, providing a potential source of passive income. ​ Positive Outlook for the Cryptocurrency Market The cryptocurrency market in 2025 is experiencing transformative growth, bolstered by increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach between $190,000 and $210,000 by the end of the year, driven by its finite supply and rising institutional demand. Additionally, the global market for cryptocurrency trends is projected to grow from $2.1 billion in 2024 to $5 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4%. ​ Cloud Mining vs. Traditional Trading While traditional cryptocurrency trading involves buying and selling digital assets to capitalize on price fluctuations, it requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and can be highly volatile. Cloud mining offers a more stable and predictable alternative:​ Predictable Returns: Cloud mining contracts often provide fixed returns, offering a level of predictability not typically found in trading. ​ Reduced Risk Exposure: By participating in mining, individuals can earn cryptocurrency rewards without being directly exposed to market volatility. ​ Diversification: Engaging in cloud mining allows investors to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolio, balancing the risks associated with trading. Comparing Cloud Mining to Other Crypto Income Models In the broader context of earning through crypto, cloud mining offers an attractive alternative to other models like staking, yield farming, or day trading. Each method has its own risk-reward dynamics: Staking requires locking up assets for a period of time and is generally limited to proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. While it’s relatively low-risk, the returns can be modest compared to cloud mining. Yield Farming, largely driven by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, is highly volatile and often exposed to smart contract risks, rug pulls, and impermanent loss. Day Trading, while potentially lucrative, demands constant monitoring, technical expertise, and a high tolerance for market volatility. Cloud mining , by contrast, provides a more passive and predictable income stream, especially for those who want exposure to the crypto economy without devoting full-time effort or technical know-how. And with platforms like HashFlyoffering contracts starting as low as $50, it also opens the door for low-risk experimentation. ​ HashFly: Leading the Way in Cloud Mining Founded in 2013, HashFly has established itself as a prominent player in the cloud mining industry, offering services for major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).

While XRP and ADA remain strong coins with strong upside, the DeFi market and projects are reshaping where smart money flows. As the crypto fear and greed index stabilizes, now might be the perfect time to explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency gaining traction as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. Mutuum Finance has entered phase 5 of its presale following phase 4 selling out in less time than projected. MUTM will enter the markets officially at $0.06, while currently up 200% since its presale launch. The next phase prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035. The tokens are available at $0.03, with listing at $0.06, offering early investors up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.4 million raised and attracting more than 11,400 investors. XRP and ADA Experience Consolidation Amid Market Shifts XRP is trading at about $2.30, 2.13% lower than the previous close. This is proof that it is in a consolidation stage after its recent push. The current zone for XRP of $2.20 to $2.50 is critical, and breaking through $2.50 could be a sign of a rising trend. Among the drivers behind a cautious short-term positive outlook for XRP are the impending approval of a U.S. spot XRP ETF and Ripple’s expansion into tokenized assets. Similarly, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.7567, down slightly by 0.68%. ADA still has a strong position among top cryptocurrencies backed by its solid development community and strategic partnerships. Recent inclusion of ADA in the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, along with XRP and other top cryptocurrencies, is a testament to its growing institutional adoption and future appreciation value. As XRP and ADA weather these periods of consolidation, new entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are making headlines for their revolutionary innovation and high return on investment, positioning themselves as strong alternatives in the evolving world of cryptocurrencies. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency Delivered: Stablecoin and Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance is not only innovating, it is establishing trust. The platform’s open-source smart contracts have undergone a rigorous, officially completed audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin that is engineered to steer clear of pitfalls that have toppled algorithmic stablecoins. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the stablecoin is a keystone of the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are always primary pillars of the ecosystem. As XRP and ADA cool off, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the altcoin to watch. With over $9.4 million raised, 11,400+ investors onboard, and a presale price of $0.03 ahead of a $0.06 launch, early buyers can secure up to 100% gains. Backed by a completed Certik audit, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and hybrid DeFi lending, MUTM offers real innovation and strong upside potential. Don’t wait—join the presale now.

While the SEC continues to delay ETF applications, new ETF applications are also coming in. At this point, the last application came from ETF issuer Canary Capital. Accordingly, Canary Capital has filed a spot ETF application for staked Cronos (CRO) with the SEC. The ETF being applied for aims to provide direct exposure to the price of CRO, the native cryptocurrency of the Cronos blockchain and associated with the Crypto.com ecosystem. According to the filing, Crypto.com will serve as the custodian and liquidity provider for the fund. The fund intends to stake a portion of its assets through one or more staking providers, potentially providing additional returns for investors. Eric Anziani, COO of Crypto.com, said: “ETFs have been an effective tool to expand investor participation in crypto and further integrate digital and traditional finance capabilities. We are excited about this important step towards all investors in the U.S. having the opportunity to engage with CRO through an ETF with Canary Capital.” This ETF filing follows Canary Capital and Crypto.com’s recently announced partnership to establish the Canary CRO Trust, CRO’s first dedicated investment vehicle for U.S. accredited investors. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin BTC is down 2.1% in the last 24 hours, trading just above $104,000 after briefly hitting a session low of $103,900. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — slumped even further, by 4.2%. Smart contract platforms were particularly affected, with solana SOL, sui SUI and avalanche AVAX losing 6.3%, 7.8% and 7.3% respectively. Crypto stocks also took a hit, especially bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer (BTDR), down 8.3% on the day after a run-up that saw the stock rise 132% from April 16 to May 21. Strategy (MSTR) slid 2.7%, and Coinbase (COIN) 1.3%. The bleeding wasn’t contained to crypto. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 1% and 1.5% respectively, while gold lost 0.7%. U.S.-China tariff clash: Round 2? Behind the price action was the flare-up of U.S. trade tensions once again after an agreement was struck earlier this month. The concerns came after President Donald Trump accused China in a post on Truth Social of ""violating"" the tariff truce between the countries. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview that talks had ""stalled"" with the Chinese representatives. China, in response, urged the U.S. to ""immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions,"" BBC reported. The cool-off between U.S. and China helped risk assets rally in May, providing a tailwind for BTC to clinch a new record high. The re-escalation now threatens to unwind some of those gains.

However, while Bitcoin’s entry point may seem appealing, analysts are increasingly directing attention toward Ruvi AI, an emerging cryptocurrency with exponential potential. With a record-breaking presale and significant partnerships, Ruvi AI is positioned to deliver stronger gains than the established Bitcoin. Here’s how Bitcoin’s dip compares to Ruvi AI’s rise and why it’s being hailed as the smarter investment choice. Bitcoin’s decline creates market entry opportunities Bitcoin’s recent downturn may appear disheartening to long-time investors but has opened the door for new market participants. Lower prices provide an opportunity to buy into a well-established cryptocurrency without the high costs associated with Bitcoin’s all-time highs. Bitcoin’s reputation as a decentralized digital asset and its wide acceptance in traditional and emerging markets make it a staple in the crypto world. However, price stagnation and high market cap have created limitations for Bitcoin’s future growth. Its dominance, while notable, has somewhat plateaued, providing modest returns for those entering now. While Bitcoin’s reputation as a high-value asset remains intact, its growth potential pales in comparison to opportunities in more dynamic, emerging cryptocurrencies. Ruvi AI’s utility and early-stage potential Unlike Bitcoin, Ruvi AI is rooted in utility and innovation, making it a compelling investment for those seeking substantial returns. By combining artificial intelligence and blockchain, Ruvi AI addresses real-world challenges in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Industry applications driving growth Healthcare: Ruvi AI facilitates AI-powered solutions for diagnostics and improved patient care, streamlining medical processes. Logistics: Its advanced algorithms optimize supply chains, reducing inefficiencies and operational costs. Finance: Ruvi AI offers AI-driven tools for fraud detection and secure transactions, making it invaluable for financial institutions. Rather than relying solely on market trends like Bitcoin, Ruvi AI’s adoption in these scalable industries ensures consistent demand and long-term relevance. Enhancing accessibility with WEEX partnership Ruvi AI recently partnered with WEEX Exchange, a collaboration that enhances liquidity and ensures global access. This partnership allows investors from across the world to trade Ruvi AI tokens effortlessly, broadening the project’s user base and improving token usability. The WEEX partnership cements Ruvi AI’s vision of becoming a globally recognized and utility-driven cryptocurrency. Record-breaking presale and investment potential Ruvi AI’s early momentum has been hard to ignore. The project’s presale has already sold 125 million tokens, raising an impressive $1.4 million. With an entry price of $0.015 per token, even small-scale investors can participate in its planned growth. Its VIP bonus structure makes the investment even more attractive, offering scalable rewards: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment with 40% bonus): Total Tokens: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $1: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus): Total Tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $1: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus): Total Tokens: 1,280,000 (double the base allocation). Value at $1: $1,280,000. With analysts projecting Ruvi AI to reach $1 by Q4 2025, the potential 100x return is far more exciting compared to Bitcoin’s current growth trajectory. Bitcoin vs Ruvi AI: the smarter investment While Bitcoin remains a trusted name in cryptocurrency, its growth potential is relatively limited due to its maturity and high market cap. Ruvi AI, by contrast, offers early-stage growth, practical utility, and groundbreaking technologies that align with industries demanding immediate solutions. Its affordable entry point, presale success, and global reach through partnerships like WEEX make it a standout choice for forward-thinking investors. Final thoughts Bitcoin’s decline may be a tempting opportunity, but for those seeking larger and faster returns, Ruvi AI presents a more exciting avenue. Its utility-driven roadmap, ongoing partnerships, and exponential ROI potential set it apart from traditional players in the crypto landscape. For investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation, Ruvi AI could very well be the smartest investment choice of 2025.

From Bitcoin’s trailblazing role to Ethereum’s rise as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), each has left a lasting impact. Now, with the rapid growth and soaring token demand for Ruvi AI, analysts and investors alike are starting to ask an intriguing question: Could this AI-powered cryptocurrency be on track to follow in Ethereum’s footsteps? Here’s a closer look at Ruvi AI’s potential trajectory and the unique factors that could drive its success. Ruvi AI’s record-breaking presale Ruvi AI has grabbed headlines with its record-breaking presale, where 125 million tokens were sold, raising $1.4 million in the process. At an entry price of just $0.015 per token, the project immediately positioned itself as an accessible investment with the potential for skyrocketing returns. This buzz around Ruvi AI reflects not just market speculation but a strong belief in the platform’s utility, something that echoes Ethereum’s early days. Much like Ethereum introduced smart contracts and dApps, Ruvi AI brings a fresh wave of innovation by combining blockchain with artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. Projected growth to $1 by Q4 2025 Experts predict Ruvi AI could reach a token value of $1 by Q4 2025, marking a staggering 6,566% return on investment (ROI) for early adopters. This kind of exponential growth is reminiscent of Ethereum’s meteoric rise after its launch, which saw early investors reaping massive rewards. Utility-driven innovation Ruvi AI’s edge lies in its focus on utility. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that rely solely on market hype, Ruvi AI utilizes blockchain and AI to address challenges in three critical sectors: Healthcare: By integrating AI-powered diagnostics, Ruvi AI improves accuracy and efficiency in patient care, enabling better decision-making for medical professionals. Logistics: Through advanced algorithms, Ruvi AI optimizes supply chain management, reducing waste and increasing reliability for global businesses. Finance: Ruvi AI enhances financial security with robust fraud detection tools and secure data management, creating safer ecosystems for consumers and institutions alike. This foundation of real-world application mirrors Ethereum’s strategy of utility-first adoption, positioning Ruvi AI as a cryptocurrency with long-term relevance. Strengthening liquidity and global reach Ruvi AI has also made strategic moves to enhance its liquidity and broaden accessibility. Its partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures that investors worldwide can trade Ruvi AI tokens with ease. This collaboration boosts trading volumes and increases the cryptocurrency’s visibility, laying a strong foundation for global adoption. Ethereum’s early success stemmed partly from its ecosystem of developers and widespread utility. Ruvi AI leverages partnerships like WEEX to create a similar environment that promotes liquidity and scale, pointing to its potential for broad market appeal. VIP investment options for massive returns One of Ruvi AI’s standout features is its VIP bonus structure. Designed to maximize returns for early investors, the tiered rewards system has played a key role in driving token demand. Here’s how the VIP structure works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment with 40% bonus): Total Tokens: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07: $4,900. Value at $1: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus): Total Tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07: $15,680. Value at $1: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus): Total Tokens: 1,280,000 (double the base allocation). Value at $0.07: $89,600. Value at $1: $1,280,000. Given Ruvi AI’s projected growth, these VIP tiers could enable early investors to achieve returns beyond their wildest expectations. Could Ruvi AI be the next Ethereum? While no cryptocurrency can guarantee the same trajectory as Ethereum, the parallels are hard to ignore. Both projects started with disruptive ideas and have evolved to offer tangible outcomes. Where Ethereum introduced revolutionary smart contracts, Ruvi AI is advancing artificial intelligence integration across critical industries. Additionally, the combination of a low entry price, high growth projections, and a strong focus on utility-driven applications gives Ruvi AI the potential to rival Ethereum’s impact on the market. For investors looking for the next big opportunity in crypto, Ruvi AI offers a chance to get in early on a high-potential project. Final thoughts The cryptocurrency market rewards innovation and utility, and Ruvi AI is delivering on both counts. Its record-breaking presale, projected 6,566% growth, and commitment to solving industry challenges make it a compelling contender in the crypto space. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have paved the way, Ruvi AI represents the future of blockchain technology. For those ready to be part of the next major success story, the time to act is now. Could Ruvi AI mirror Ethereum’s meteoric rise? Only time will tell, but the early signs suggest it’s a possibility investors shouldn’t overlook.

Detective Drove Victim to Kidnap Site, Reports Claim According to reports , both detectives in question were working as off-duty security for the alleged crypto criminal, though whether they received prior approval from the department is unknown. New: The NYPD stripped 2 detectives of their guns /badges & placed them on desk duty after the dept. learned they'd had been working security for William Duplessie & John Woeltz, the crypto investors recently arrested for allegedly kidnapping a man & torturing him. @CBSNewYork pic.twitter.com/BBsS9uVR2U — Tim McNicholas (@TimMcNicholas) May 29, 2025 One of the detectives, a veteran with nearly 20 years of experience, reportedly drove the Italian crypto kidnapping victim from the airport to the luxury SoHo apartment where he was eventually held captive. “Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. “We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.” Two Arrested in Shock Crypto Kidnapping News of the scandal comes just one week after the unidentified Italian businessman escaped the weeks-long crypto crime ordeal that saw him shocked, tortured and held at gunpoint. Crypto businessmen John Woeltz and William Duplessie allegedly lured the victim to New York City on May 6 after threatening to kill his family in a bid to gain access to his Bitcoin . The hostage escaped barefoot when Duplessie and Woeltz turned their backs on him shortly after he revealed his Bitcoin password. Reports indicate that the anonymous victim may have been a business partner of Duplessie and Woeltz, although this has not been confirmed. The family of Woeltz told The New York Post on Monday that the multimillionaire may have been “manipulated” into the crime himself. “He’s a kind, caring, loving person, so he was completely controlled by other people,” Woeltz’s relative told the media outlet.

Pepe and SHIB are drawing attention with their recent price surges. Could these tokens be the hottest picks for the upcoming week? The article explores whether these altcoins could see significant gains soon. Pepe Altcoin Market Analysis Amid Sharp Swings Pepe experienced a 47% surge in price over the last month, but it faced a 35% drop in the past six months. The recent weekly decline of nearly 16% highlights the coin's volatility. Price movements have shown sharp increases followed by notable corrections, indicating a mixed trend for the longer term. The trading range currently sits between $0.00000647 and $0.00001057 dollars, with resistance at $0.00001223 and support at $0.00000404. A further resistance at $0.00001633 adds to the uncertainty in the market. The moving average is nearly neutral, and the RSI stands at 53, showing a balance between bulls and bears. Caution is advisable when trading within these ranges. Shiba Inu: Volatility and Current Price Analysis Shiba Inu recorded a minor gain of nearly 0.9% in the past month but faced a significant decline of 49.4% over the last six months. Price action indicated mixed signals, as a brief recovery was overshadowed by ongoing weakness. The fluctuations illustrate a hesitant investor sentiment and limited short-term gains, which were insufficient to counteract the overall downtrend. The coin is currently trading between $0.00001 and $0.00001556 dollars, with resistance at $0.00002 and support near $0.000008. Technical indicators show a slight bearish tilt, with momentum suggesting bears have the upper hand, as evidenced by an RSI around 42.5. Traders could look for potential bounces at support or consider shorting near resistance within this trading range. Conclusion PEPE and SHIB are showing strong performances due to meme hype. Both coins have the potential to be top altcoins in the coming week. Their recent rallies suggest growing interest and momentum. However, it's important to monitor market trends and investor sentiment. The hype surrounding these coins can drive short-term gains.

Judge Katherine Polk Failla also ruled that there were no Brady violation concerns with the Department of Justice's conversations with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) about whether mixers needed to register as money transmitters — the conversation that prosecutors pursuing Samourai Wallet developers had with FinCEN officials, but not the prosecutors on Storm's case — one of the DOJ representatives said in the phone conference on Friday. If the judge had found that prosecutors had withheld information, it could affect the case moving forward. ""I'm not going to require a further review based on the representations made that there's no additional material of this type, and based on my views that I don't believe the material was exculpatory,"" she said. ""There's a difference between 'this is something I'd like to know' and 'this is a Brady violation,'"" the judge said, referring to a Supreme Court precedent that requires prosecutors to share any and all information that might help a defendant with the defendant's team. Storm's defense attorneys argued during the hearing that they needed to know when the prosecutors in their case learned about the FinCEN conversation. ""They do plan to say they're charging a conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter,"" said defense attorney Brian Klein. ""My question is who are they supposed to be licensed with? … this is all in the same issue. They've only dropped one subpart … but they're still going to say they're charging an unlicensed money business."" Thane Rehn, a prosecutor who worked on the DOJ case against Sam Bankman-Fried, said that his team wouldn't argue that Tornado Cash needed to secure a license. ""The word 'license' doesn't apply here and the jury won't be instructed on licensing issues … what we intend to prove at trial is the defendant knew they were transmitting funds derived from criminals,"" he said. The judge did at multiple points ask the prosecutors if they planned to change any other theories or charges in the weeks leading up to the trial, saying doing so might be unfair to the defense.

With analysts projecting 12,700% ROI, Ruvi AI is the opportunity to grow exponentially during the next crypto bull run. Solana’s Pros and Cons Solana has been a blockchain favorite for a long time, fast, scalable and affordable. Processing 65,000+ transactions per second, it’s one of the go-to choices for dApps, DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces. Its focus on efficiency has made it a top blockchain project. But as Solana matures, market saturation and slowed growth are becoming a challenge. The competition and high market cap is reducing the exponential ROI of early investors. Looking for new opportunities with higher upside, investors are now looking at emerging projects like Ruvi AI. Meet Ruvi AI Ruvi AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, a decentralized ecosystem for AI driven content creation. The platform allows users to generate high quality text, images, video and audio for marketing, entertainment and automation industries. Unlike Solana’s broad ecosystem of dApps, Ruvi AI is taking a targeted approach to specific business needs. This focus on real world utility gives Ruvi AI a big edge, extending its appeal beyond the typical crypto user. At the heart of Ruvi AI’s ecosystem is the $RUVI token which fuels platform features like access to premium AI tools, staking rewards and governance participation. This strong utility case, combined with the innovation, makes Ruvi AI a trailblazer to disrupt industries globally. Presale Success Story Ruvi AI’s presale results show the demand is high. Phase 1 launched at $0.010 and sold out in 2 weeks, initial backers are up 50% at $0.015.Over 1,400 holders have joined Ruvi AI’s ecosystem so far, momentum is building. The project has announced its first token listing and partnership with a major exchange, more to come. Plans for further collaborations and listings are making investors more and more interested by the day. Why 12,700% ROI Analysts attribute Ruvi AI’s 12,700% ROI to: Technological Innovation Ruvi AI is a leap forward in decentralized tech, will capture mainstream adoption across multiple industries. Growing Community 1,400+ holders, increasing investor confidence in Ruvi AI’s long term potential. Strategic Partnerships Partnerships with exchanges and collaboration with major players in the blockchain space is increasing visibility and accessibility. Early-Stage Growth Potential Unlike Solana, Ruvi AI is still in its infancy, early backers will get exceptional returns as the project scales. Ruvi AI is a rare opportunity to get life changing returns if the project executes its roadmap. Investment Options Ruvi AI’s presale has 3 VIP tiers to maximize returns. Here’s what’s at stake, based on the listing price of $0.07 and a predicted $1 post-listing price. VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 $RUVI ($750) Bonus : 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500) Bonus : 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $160,00 VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500) Bonus : 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $1,000,000 These VIP tiers are a clear opportunity to get in on Ruvi AI’s early momentum. What’s Next for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI’s fast growth and innovative tech makes it a top contender in the market, attracting investors looking for the next big thing. Solana’s established position is strong, but Ruvi AI is the new opportunity for exponential growth not available in mature projects. Phase 2 presale is live at $0.015, don’t miss out. Will it reach 12,700% ROI? Only time will tell, but the potential is there. For smart investors, the choice is clear – the future may be Ruvi AI.

Moreover, the price dropped below the crucial support in the early trading hours and has failed to reclaim the lost levels, which indicates a tight bearish hold over the token. However, the market sentiments remain largely bullish, which suggests the BTC price could rise after the ongoing correction. The Bitcoin’s recent drop isn’t directly attributed to a court decision on tariffs but rather to President Donald Trump’s announcement of imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. This move sparked widespread volatility across the markets, causing Bitcoin to plummet below $91,000 and resulting in nearly a billion dollars in total liquidations. Meanwhile, a recent US federal court ruling blocking Trump’s $10 billion tariffs has sparked optimism for Bitcoin’s future. What’s Next- Will Bitcoin Rise to $120K or Drop to $100K? The BTC price recently experienced a significant bullish push, probably due to the Golden Cross, which may soon turn into a death cross. The rising scepticism around the network has made the perp whales optimistic, while the spot traders are preparing for the new BTC highs. As per the data from Binance , the perpetual whales are defending $100K with bids, while spot sellers are looking to sell at $120K. With this, the BTC price forecast remains hung with both the possibility of forming a new ATH at $120K or plunging back to $100K. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price has displayed a similar divergence to that displayed in the first few days of April; however, it is reversed now. On the other hand, the DMI has displayed a bearish crossover while the RSI maintains a steep descending trend. Therefore, the bearish reversal may soon be validated while the price could head to the local support at $102,153 at 0.786 FIB. Here, if the price fails to trigger a rebound, it may drop below $100K, otherwise, a rebound could push it within the resistance zone between $105,937 and $107,615. Now, all depends on the monthly close, which is required to be above the local support; else, the Bitcoin (BTC) price may witness a deeper correction.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 18:02:00

In a new post, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,400 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin can break through the resistance range between $106,500-$107,000, the flagship crypto asset will likely soar beyond its current all-time high of about $111,800. “Bitcoin has lost the crucial support level. However, the drop isn’t as severe as we might expect. This means, reclaim of $106,500-$107,000, that would be the party trigger sign for new all-time highs.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,694 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) is likely still in an uptrend and gearing up for a massive breakout. “ETH did break through $2,700 and failed immediately. The thing is, that’s not the crucial level. The second thing is, it’s still building up for a big breakout. When does that happen? Above $2,850 is where the liquidity is and the longer it takes for a breakout to happen, the heavier it will be.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X He also says that ETH has been showing strength against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) for the past two months and may soon break out against the flagship crypto asset. “ETH has seen a strong upwards move in April and May, It has also retested the OB (order block) at 0.023 BTC and has held there. This means that we’re about to test the highs and continue the run.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X ETH/BTC is trading for 0.2461 BTC ($2,597), down slightly in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst says he is turning bullish on Bittensor ( TAO ), a decentralized blockchain-based network that aims to be a marketplace for artificial intelligence (AI) models. “TAO looks great, as it’s fighting the final resistance. Ideally, sub-$400 is a steal for this one in which we continue to show an uptrend even if it drops south of that level. It’s the only one in my portfolio nicely holding up and I think we’ll be seeing $700-$800 soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X TAO is trading for $397 at time of writing, down 6.4% in the last 24 hours.

There are hints that Elon Musk’s company might start accepting crypto for cars again. With X Money already expected to support crypto payments, fans are watching DOGE closely for impact. Could this send the coin to $2? Read this article to understand the price setup, what could trigger a rally, and why Remittix might be the better payment token to invest in. Crypto payments for cars could return: What X Money means for Tesla and DOGE X Money is set to now support crypto payments and many expect Tesla to follow suit. The company is part of Elon Musk’s larger tech vision. Tesla used to take Bitcoin for cars, but stopped after environmental concerns, which made crypto prices fall. If Tesla starts again, this time with Dogecoin, it could create new demand for DOGE. Source: Doge100percent on X Elon Musk has always liked DOGE. He called it the people’s crypto. SpaceX even accepted DOGE for a small mission. So it’s not far off to think Tesla could use it again, especially with support from X Money. Some fans even paid for Tesla merchandise with DOGE in the past. Experts believe any real move by Tesla could send DOGE flying. Even a logo change on Twitter boosted DOGE 20% in one day. That kind of reaction demonstrates the strong connection between the coin and the Tesla brand. So, if Tesla flips the switch and allows DOGE for cars, people won’t just tweet about it. They’ll start buying and holding. That adds real pressure to the price chart. Dogecoin price prediction: Can Tesla news push DOGE to $2? Right now, the Dogecoin price is around $0.22. To reach $2, it would need to go up more than 1,000%. That’s a big leap. But in crypto, that’s not impossible. During the 2021 bull run, DOGE went from less than one cent to over $0.70 in months. Analyst Kevin Cage says that DOGE follows patterns. When hype hits and volume picks up, the price can move fast. Right now, the coin is holding support at $0.21. If buyers step in and it clears $0.23, the next zone is $0.35. Source: TradingView But the big move to $2? That would need big news. Tesla news could be it. It wouldn’t just bring new buyers, it would bring headlines. Big ones. And that makes people who missed out in 2021 pay attention again. Remittix: Growing PayFi to explode once listed While people hope DOGE hits $2, a new coin is getting strong attention. It’s called Remittix . It isn’t a meme. It solves a real problem. Remittix enables individuals to send cryptocurrency to bank accounts in over 30 countries. The receiver gets fiat money in their account and the sender doesn’t need to worry about complicated steps or hidden charges. Remittix works with over 100 coins. People don’t have to learn anything new. They just send and it goes through. No wire fees. No long wait. Just clean, simple payments. What makes it different is this: you don’t even need to use the Remittix token to use the platform. But if you do hold the token, you get perks. There are rewards for people who hold it and even more for people who stake it. Analysts like Crypto Nova have called it “the next PayFi breakout.” The presale is almost sold out. Once it hits exchanges, the price could jump. Some think early buyers could see a 100x return. Conclusion The Dogecoin price prediction largely depends on Tesla and Elon Musk. If Tesla accepts DOGE again, a big move might follow. But that momentum could be short-lived if it’s only based on hype. Remittix, on the other hand, offers tools people already need. If you’re picking one coin to hold for real gains, Remittix looks like the better bet.

In a compelling video clip shared by XRP Avengers on X, Garlinghouse laid out a sharp, unflinching case for XRP’s superiority over Bitcoin, underscoring the intentional design choices that position XRP as a far more scalable and efficient alternative for global payments. Garlinghouse’s Case Against Bitcoin In the widely circulated clip, Garlinghouse confidently articulated the technological limitations of Bitcoin, highlighting its sluggish transaction speeds and high costs . According to the Ripple CEO, Bitcoin’s architecture, while revolutionary in its time, has become a bottleneck for practical use cases, especially in the realm of cross-border payments. Brad Garlinghouse DESTROYS Bitcoin in front of the IMF & Swiss National Bank, presenting the case for $XRP Brad Garlinghouse said “ #XRP was designed by engineers who recognized Bitcoin’s flaws, especially around scalability. XRP is 1,000x faster.” pic.twitter.com/xFL6D41HiM — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) May 29, 2025 Garlinghouse emphasized that XRP was designed by engineers who had studied Bitcoin’s shortcomings and sought to build something fundamentally better. Specifically, he noted that XRP offers transactions that are 1,000 times faster and 1,000 times cheaper compared to Bitcoin . For Garlinghouse, this distinction isn’t just technical; it’s pivotal to reshaping how the world moves money across borders, particularly for individuals and businesses that are currently sidelined by the inefficiencies of traditional banking systems. The End of Pre-Funding and the Rise of On-Demand Liquidity A central pillar of Ripple’s vision, Garlinghouse explained, is the idea of eliminating the need for pre-funding accounts in global financial transactions. Traditionally, international money movement relies on a web of nostro and vostro accounts, pre-funded holdings that financial institutions use to settle transactions across borders. This system is costly, slow, and often inaccessible to smaller players. Garlinghouse’s argument is clear: digital assets like XRP can provide global liquidity on demand, unlocking a more democratized and efficient payment infrastructure. By doing so, Ripple aims to level the playing field, not just for massive multinational corporations moving hundreds of millions of dollars, but also for the small freelancers and businesses scattered across the globe. He illustrated this point vividly by referencing the case of a freelancer in the Philippines, designing for a London-based company and expecting a modest payment. Under current systems, the freelancer’s payout often gets delayed until they accumulate at least $1,000 in their account, a hurdle that disproportionately affects smaller earners. Garlinghouse contends that Ripple’s technology stack can seamlessly enable such microtransactions, making the global economy more inclusive. Building the Internet of Value Drawing parallels to the foundational protocols of the internet, Garlinghouse likened Ripple’s ambitions to the role played by TCP/IP and HTTP in the rise of the Internet of Information. These early internet protocols revolutionized global communication by standardizing the flow of information across connected devices. According to Garlinghouse, Ripple envisions a similar transformation, but for value. Using blockchain technologies, particularly XRP and its associated open-source technology stack, Ripple aims to construct an Internet of Value where payments can move with the same speed, fluidity, and universality as data. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This vision, he argued, has profound implications for financial inclusion, enabling anyone, anywhere, to participate in the global economy without the burdens imposed by legacy financial systems. It’s not just about helping big banks and corporations; it’s about empowering everyday people and businesses who have long been underserved. XRP’s Technical Edge Over Bitcoin Garlinghouse’s takedown of Bitcoin at the IMF and Swiss National Bank wasn’t just a marketing pitch, it was a detailed exposition of why XRP’s technical architecture matters. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system, which demands immense energy consumption and slows down as the network grows, XRP uses a consensus protocol that dramatically accelerates transactions while keeping costs minimal. This makes XRP better suited for high-volume, low-value payments, the kind of microtransactions that are increasingly vital in the digital age. Bitcoin’s design, while robust as a store of value, has struggled to scale effectively for these kinds of applications, leaving a wide opening for Ripple and XRP to step in. Brad Garlinghouse’s address, amplified by XRP Avengers’ viral post, underscores a defining moment in the evolving narrative between Bitcoin and XRP. While Bitcoin continues to hold its position as the pioneer and poster child of cryptocurrencies, Ripple’s CEO is making it clear that the future of cross-border payments requires something faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Ripple’s mission to build an Internet of Value, using XRP as its backbone, is more than just technological ambition; it’s a bid to reshape how money moves in a globalized world. With the support of a passionate community like XRP Avengers and the attention of financial heavyweights like the IMF and Swiss National Bank, Ripple is positioning XRP as not just an alternative to Bitcoin, but as the digital asset purpose-built for the next generation of global finance.

This week, a significant movement has caught the eye of analysts: a massive $516 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been withdrawn from centralized crypto exchanges. This notable outflow, reported by on-chain analytics firm Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), suggests a shift in strategy among crypto traders . Instead of keeping their assets readily available for trading on exchanges, they appear to be moving them into private wallets. But what exactly does this mean for the Ethereum market and the broader crypto landscape? Understanding Ethereum Withdrawals Through On-Chain Data The figure of $516 million in Ethereum withdrawals comes directly from analysis of public blockchain data, often referred to as on-chain data . Firms like Sentora specialize in interpreting these transparent records to provide insights into market activity that aren’t immediately obvious from price charts alone. When users withdraw assets like ETH from exchanges , it’s recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. By aggregating these transactions across major exchange wallets, analysts can track net flows – whether more ETH is entering or leaving exchanges. A large net outflow, as seen this week, indicates that a substantial amount of ETH is being moved off trading platforms. This metric is considered important for crypto market analysis because exchange balances can be a proxy for potential selling pressure. Assets held on exchanges are typically there for trading or potential sale. Assets moved off exchanges are more likely intended for long-term holding, staking, or use in decentralized applications (DeFi). Why Are Crypto Traders Moving ETH Off Exchanges? Several factors could be driving this trend of Ethereum withdrawals . Understanding these motivations helps paint a clearer picture of current market dynamics: Enhanced Security: Self-Custody is Key Many experienced crypto traders and investors prefer to hold their assets in wallets where they control the private keys. This is known as self-custody. Moving ETH from exchanges to hardware wallets or software wallets significantly reduces counterparty risk – the risk that the exchange itself could be hacked, become insolvent, or face regulatory issues that freeze funds. The mantra ‘not your keys, not your crypto’ resonates strongly after past market events. Long-Term Holding (HODLing) Strategy Withdrawals can signal an intent to hold ETH for the long term, rather than trade it actively. When traders anticipate potential future price appreciation, they often move assets off exchanges to resist the temptation of short-term trading and signal their conviction in the asset’s value. This aligns with a ‘HODLing’ strategy, a common approach among believers in Ethereum’s future. Staking Ethereum Since Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge), many ETH holders choose to stake their ETH to earn rewards and help secure the network. Staking often involves moving ETH away from centralized exchanges to personal wallets or staking platforms. This is a significant driver of Ethereum withdrawals , as users commit their ETH for potentially extended periods. Reduced Selling Pressure Perhaps the most immediate market implication is the potential reduction in selling pressure. With $516 million less ETH readily available on trading platforms, there is simply less supply that can be quickly sold onto the market. This dynamic can be a bullish signal, especially if demand remains constant or increases. Engagement with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and NFTs Accessing the full spectrum of the Ethereum ecosystem, including DeFi protocols (lending, borrowing, yield farming) and NFT marketplaces, typically requires using a non-custodial wallet. Traders moving ETH from exchanges might be preparing to participate more actively in these decentralized sectors. What Does This On-Chain Data Signal for the Ethereum Market? The substantial outflow of ETH from exchanges is generally interpreted by analysts performing crypto market analysis as a potentially positive or bullish signal. Here’s why: Potential Supply Shock: Less supply available on exchanges combined with consistent or growing demand could lead to upward price pressure. If a large amount of ETH is locked away in staking or private wallets, the circulating supply available for trading decreases. Accumulation Phase: Large withdrawals often suggest that significant holders or institutions are accumulating ETH at current price levels, viewing it as an opportune time to add to their positions with a long-term outlook. Shift in Sentiment: It reflects a potential shift from a trading-focused mindset to a holding or utility-focused mindset among a large group of crypto traders . This confidence can be contagious and influence broader market sentiment. While on-chain data like exchange flows provides valuable insights, it’s crucial to remember it’s just one piece of the puzzle in comprehensive crypto market analysis . Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments within the Ethereum network (like upcoming upgrades), and overall market sentiment also play significant roles. Comparing Ethereum Withdrawals to Broader Crypto Trends Is this trend unique to Ethereum? While the $516 million figure for Ethereum withdrawals this week is substantial for ETH, similar patterns of assets moving off exchanges are often observed across the broader crypto market during periods where investors anticipate positive price action or seek greater security. Bitcoin, for instance, also sees significant movements off exchanges when accumulation phases are believed to be underway. However, Ethereum’s specific use cases, particularly its dominance in DeFi and NFTs and the increasing popularity of ETH staking, provide additional, unique reasons for users to move their ETH from exchanges compared to assets primarily used as a store of value. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders For crypto traders looking at this data, what are the takeaways? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data metrics like exchange flows, not just for ETH but for other assets you trade. Platforms like Sentora (IntoTheBlock) or Glassnode offer these insights. Evaluate Your Strategy: Consider your own risk tolerance and investment horizon. If you are a long-term holder, ensuring your assets are secure in a private wallet should be a priority. If you are an active trader, understanding these larger movements can inform your short-term decisions. Prioritize Security: Regardless of where you store your crypto, security is paramount. For assets held off exchanges, this means properly managing private keys, using hardware wallets for significant amounts, and being wary of phishing attempts. Diversify Information Sources: Don’t rely on a single metric. Combine on-chain data with technical analysis, fundamental analysis of the Ethereum network, and overall crypto market analysis to form a well-rounded view. Conclusion: What the Massive ETH Outflow Tells Us The withdrawal of a massive $516 million in Ethereum (ETH) from centralized exchanges this week is a significant data point from the world of on-chain data . It strongly suggests that a large number of crypto traders are opting for self-custody and potentially long-term holding strategies over keeping their ETH from exchanges readily available for sale. This trend has important implications for crypto market analysis , potentially indicating reduced selling pressure and a bullish sentiment among those accumulating ETH. While not a guaranteed predictor of future price movements, large outflows like this are a key metric that serious traders and investors watch closely as they navigate the dynamic Ethereum market .

This is the second IP divestment for Yuga Labs, following the sale of Crypto Punks. Yuga Labs has divested the Moonbirds collection, selling the intellectual property rights to Orange Cap Games, a card trading company. Orange Cap Games will also hold the rights to the Mystics and Oddities collections, a variation of the main Moonbirds mint. The Moonbirds collection is the second sale for Yuga Labs after the sale of CryptoPunks to the Infinite Node Foundation. The sale was announced by Greg Solano, co-founder of Yuga Labs. Moonbirds has been acquired by @ocapgames Spencer and the team at Orange Cap Games are among the smartest, most detail-oriented builders in consumer crypto. They put love, genuine craft, and a fair bit of neurotic perfectionism in everything they touch (ask @spencer to tell you… https://t.co/5ADNebM0wD — Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) May 30, 2025 Yuga Labs retains the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection and the Otherside metaverse collection. The sale of NFT IP is partially an attempt to preserve the tokens and their art in a more reliable environment. Moonbirds trading revived after IP sale The Moonbirds collection is relatively smaller and less successful compared to the Crypto Punks. Moonbirds started with a floor price above 28 ETH, to slide as low as 0.30 ETH. The IP sale announcement boosted the floor price to 0.43 ETH. The Moonbirds floor price rallied after the news of the IP sale, rising to 0.47 ETH. | Source: NFT Floor Price Despite this, some of the latest Moonbird sales ask for as much as 3.99 ETH, depending on the rarity and qualities. The NFT market has been mostly abandoned by crypto insiders, displaced by meme tokens. For some collections, attempts were made to cross over to physical items. While the IP may remain appealing, the NFT themselves rarely invited active trading. The Moonbirds collection minted a total of 10,000 items, with an initial mint price of 2.5 ETH. Currently, the collection is held in 5,841 wallets, with a total market cap of 4,500 ETH for all NFT. Even during the slow market, Moonbirds immediately reacted with a spike in trading volumes. In the past day, the collection saw a total of 149 sales. Daily trading volumes expanded by 579.5%, rising to 69.51 ETH. Recently, Moonbirds discontinued its Talons reward program for NFT holders. The NFT collection has been linked to crypto AI agents, using the images and lores to create AI personalities linked to the NFT. CryptoPunks also benefited from the recent change in ownership, as their floor price remains near a three-month high at over 45 ETH. BAYC NFT retain a floor price above 15 ETH and are one of the widely represented avatars on social media. Orange Cap Games to expand the Moonbirds universe Orange Cap Games will use the Moonbirds IP to grow the initial universe and integrate it with its real-world products and games. The gaming company stated that Moonbirds retain untapped potential, which was obscured by the NFT bear market. Additionally, the digital footprint of the collection will grow with new use cases and engagement. Orange Cap Games will retain its partnership with Yuga Labs by adapting Moonbirds as 3D avatars in the metaverse environment of Otherside. Moonbirds will remain an Ethereum collection for now. For scaling and faster transfers, Orange Cap Games has agreed to only migrate the collections to ApeChain, the native L2 network of Yuga Labs.

Why & How?!",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/hyperliquid-price-prediction-hype-set-to-replace-binance-coinbase-kraken-uniswap-jupiter-why-how,"Hyperliquid price prediction trends suggest that HYPE could soon challenge major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. With its rising user base and unique trading infrastructure, analysts are questioning whether the platform can displace giants such as Uniswap and Jupiter. Is this the beginning of a broader move toward decentralized trading models that prioritize speed, liquidity and lower fees? Can Hyperliquid compete with Binance and Uniswap? Analysts say the gap is closing Hyperliquid is gaining attention as its HYPE token and trading infrastructure challenge legacy platforms like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Uniswap and Jupiter. The platform’s capital efficiency has attracted seasoned traders looking for deeper liquidity and faster execution. Unlike Uniswap and Jupiter, Hyperliquid offers an order-book-based model tailored for perpetual contracts, reducing slippage and increasing market responsiveness. Unlike centralized exchanges, analyst Ansem has pointed out that Hyperliquid’s vision aligns closely with the goals Solana and FTX aimed to achieve during their initial collaboration: delivering a high-performance, low-cost trading crypto experience. HYPE’s recent price performance reinforces confidence in Hyperliquid’s scalability and token utility. As new users enter DeFi, analysts are watching if Hyperliquid can offer an alternative that meets compliance expectations without centralization trade-offs. Hyperliquid price prediction: Will HYPE reach $100 in 2025? On May 25, 2025 , HYPE hit an all-time high of $39.93, with open interest reaching $10.1 billion and USDC total value locked climbing to new highs. Since the event, HYPE entered a cooling phase, but the token still retains a 40% increase over the past week. Analysts are closely monitoring whether the drop to $36 signals consolidation or a precursor to further upside. Despite the pullback, derivatives activity remains strong, with liquidity depth and execution speed positioning Hyperliquid as a rock in the DeFi market. Market watchers continue to assess whether the platform can maintain momentum and support HYPE's trajectory toward the next key resistance levels. With $100 being a psychological target, HYPE could re-attempt a rally in the short term. Source: CoinMarketCap Remittix rises as traders shift from Hype to utility Remittix is starting to show up more often on trader watchlists and it’s not just because it’s new. The project is positioning itself as a utility token built for real-world payments, not just speculative hype. With Ethereum as its base, it benefits from an established network while introducing features designed to make cross-border transfers smoother. One of its core strengths is conversion. Remittix allows users to move between crypto and fiat in a few simple steps. That’s especially useful for traders who don’t want their profits stuck in crypto when markets swing.

This platform's rapid adoption and innovative approach bring into question its ability to rival giants like Binance and Coinbase. The distinct trading infrastructure of Hyperliquid, coupled with the HYPE token, is creating buzz around its capacity to offer deeper liquidity and faster transaction speeds. Unlike its competitors, Hyperliquid's order-book model, especially designed for perpetual contracts, aims to mitigate slippage and enhance market responsiveness. This strategic orientation might just redefine trading dynamics in the DeFi space. Comparative Analysis with Major Exchanges Hyperliquid stands out by not only challenging existing centralized exchanges but also by aligning its objectives with decentralized finance principles, echoing the visions Solana and FTX held during their inception. This striking resemblance has been highlighted by industry analysts who see a promising future for the platform. Performance Metrics: A Success Indicator? Recently, HYPE's price surged to unprecedented levels. On May 25, 2025 , the token reached a record high of $39.93, demonstrating robust market confidence and investor interest, which are essential for sustained growth and scalability. However, the real question remains whether this peak is a sign of lasting stability or a temporary spike. Analysts continue to closely monitor these fluctuations to distinguish if this is a consolidation phase paving the way for further growth, potentially hitting the $100 mark by 2025. Emerging Competitors: Remittix Gaining Ground While Hyperliquid continues to progress, it faces new competition from utility-focused tokens like Remittix. Built on Ethereum, Remittix facilitates real-world payments and aims to simplify crypto-to-fiat transactions, enhancing its appeal to a broader user base. With features that support easy conversion and low transaction fees, Remittix is positioned as a practical solution for everyday use, making it an attractive option for those seeking reliability over speculation. Final Thoughts The rise of Hyperliquid reflects a broader shift toward decentralized trading solutions that prioritize performance and affordability.

With new money flowing into emerging tokens, some traders are questioning whether PEPE can keep up. The latest Pepecoin price prediction hints at a rocky June ahead, as enthusiasm cools and fresh opportunities gain momentum. One project catching serious attention is Mantix ($MTX) , which is now in presale. Backed by smart contract automation and AI-powered trading, it’s becoming the go-to for investors hunting the next big win. The Pepecoin price prediction trend looks shaky, especially with analysts eyeing over 100x potential for early MTX adopters. Pepecoin Price Prediction: Is PEPE’s June slide inevitable as the hype starts to fade? Pepecoin (PEPE) has been hovering dangerously close to key resistance levels lately. Recent technical indicators, which previously signaled bullish trends, are now flashing sell signals, suggesting a potential downturn in June. Source: @ali_charts (via X) The latest Pepecoin price prediction points to a possible drop to $0.000007603 by late June, reflecting growing market caution. With PEPE price currently settling around $0.000014, the lack of significant upward movement is causing traders to reconsider their positions. As enthusiasm cools, many traders are rethinking their positions, growing increasingly cautious. They’re watching closely to see if PEPE can hold its ground amid weakening momentum or if the meme coin’s rapid rise is finally running out of steam. Why Mantix $MTX Could Be the Dark Horse as Pepecoin Price Prediction Turns Bearish Recent trends in altcoins show that projects with robust technology and transparent tokenomicstend to outperform speculative tokens during market corrections. Mantix is establishing itself in this space, with an ongoing presale already attracting serious attention. Unlike many hype-driven coins, Mantix combines decentralized exchange infrastructure with cutting-edge security features, setting it up for a strong breakout as traders search for safer, high-growth alternatives. The presale is already turning heads because it offers more than the usual promises. $MTX has a clear plan for spreading the tokens, rewarding people who stick around and helping the network grow. Bonuses for early backers make it a smart time to jump in before the price increases. Compared to the shaky forecasts for Pepecoin, Mantix feels like a steadier bet. Also, the platform rewards liquidity providers and stakers, ensuring active engagement and token circulation without unnecessary inflation. Coupled with DAO governance, $MTX holders have real power to shape the platform’s future. This balance between utility and control allows Mantixto maintain growth momentum beyond the presale phase. Altcoins that combined solid tech with fair tokenomics often saw explosive growth after presales, and Mantix fits this pattern well. Its real-world solutions, backed by smart contract audits and multi-layered security, add a layer of trust that PEPE and most other meme coins simply can’t match. This practical edge positions Mantix as a project ready for massive adoption. Conclusion The Mantix presale is happening now, with $MTX tokens priced at just $0.02. As the Pepecoinprice prediction points to a slowdown, smart investors are turning to Mantix, where early adopters could see returns of over 100x. Don’t let this opportunity slip by.

45300511,https://thecoinrise.com/canary-capital-files-s-1-for-first-staked-cro-etf-in-the-u-s/,1748633341,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,Canary Capital Files S-1 for First Staked CRO ETF in the U.S.,https://thecoinrise.com/canary-capital-files-s-1-for-first-staked-cro-etf-in-the-u-s/,"Canary Capital has filed an S-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the first staked CRO exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. This step follows the SEC’s recent clarification that proof-of-stake (PoS) activities do not count as securities transactions. This announcement has also opened up new possibilities for staked financial products. Canary Capital Awaits SEC Verdict on Staked CRO ETF Although the asset manager has several crypto ETF applications with the SEC, it has yet to receive the agency’s decision. However, it has not relented in its effort to ensure that institutional investors have access to these funds without exposing themselves to the perceived risks associated with the underlying cryptocurrency. The proposed ETF allows investors to directly invest in CRO, the main cryptocurrency of the Cronos blockchain. Investors can benefit from the potential increase in CRO’s value and the earnings reward by including staking in the fund. Furthermore, Crypto.com will be the custodian and liquidity provider for the fund. The fund could lead to similar products that integrate staking for other PoS assets if approved. This, in turn, will increase the range of options available in traditional investment channels. To substantiate its S-1 registration and make it more official, Canary Capital is expected to follow up with a 19b-4 filing. Canary Capital And Its Crypto ETF Episodes Last year, Canary Capital entered the race to launch a spot XRP ETF right after Bitwise. The firm spelled out its goal of creating an XRP ETF in its filing. Canary Capital affirmed that it aims to provide investors a seamless way to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This year, the NASDAQ Stock Market submitted a 19b-4 filing with the SEC on behalf of Canary Capital. The filing is for a spot Hedera (HBAR) ETF . HBAR is the native token of Hedera, a decentralized public network that uses the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to facilitate fast and secure transactions globally. Likewise, the global asset management firm filed the S-1 registration for the spot SUI ETF . Canary Capital, among many others, also filed with regulators to launch an ETF based on the Tron network’s token, TRX . SEC Delays Mount Across Crypto ETF Filings Despite Canary Capital’s recent update, the SEC has yet to respond to its decision on the fund. This delay is part of a broader slowdown, as the commission also delayed decisions on Solana ETF applications from 21Shares and Bitwise. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart thinks the SEC will unlikely approve crypto ETFs like Solana or XRP before late June or early July. He believes a better chance of approval is in early Q4. This depends on market conditions and rules becoming more friendly to crypto-backed investment vehicles.

India’s Supreme Court questioned the government’s lack of substantive regulation despite imposing a controversial 30% taxation on cryptocurrencies. Supreme Court Questions Government’s Failures to Regulate Cryptocurrencies India’s Supreme Court publicly questioned the government’s lack of clear and appropriate cryptocurrency regulation despite imposing a massive 30% tax on assets like Bitcoin. According to reports by Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the Supreme Court has concerns over Bitcoin’s and other cryptocurrencies’ increasing popularity and adoption and the lack of comprehensive regulation in the industry. In a recent hearing on the matter, Justice Surya Kant reportedly said: “This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins, and it is a danger to the economy of the country.” Justice Kant was critical of the government’s tax imposition and its lack of regulations. According to Kant, “ If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it.” Indian Government Will Reportedly Issue Crypto Policy Paper In what is likely a response to the Supreme Court’s criticisms, India is reportedly preparing to issue a discussion paper on bitcoin control next month, suggesting a positive shift to introduce a clearly defined policy framework for digital assets. Per a report by The Economic Times , India is recognising the rising relevance and adoption of digital assets. While India is a world forerunner in taxing cryptocurrencies, it has failed to join the global push for a clear and comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework.

In the dynamic world of the crypto market , understanding potential turning points is key. While Bitcoin has seen significant gains, recent on-chain analysis using the MVRV metric suggests there might be more room to run before we see widespread profit taking . Understanding the Power of On-Chain Analysis for Bitcoin Price Before diving into the specifics of the MVRV metric , it’s essential to grasp the value of on-chain analysis . Unlike traditional market analysis that focuses on price charts and trading volume, on-chain analysis examines transactions occurring directly on the blockchain. This provides unique insights into the behavior of market participants, including miners, long-term holders, and short-term speculators. Think of it as looking under the hood of the Bitcoin network. You can see where coins are moving, how long they’ve been held, and even estimate the average cost basis of different groups of investors. This transparency is a powerful tool for understanding underlying market dynamics that might not be immediately obvious from price charts alone. Key benefits of using on-chain analysis : Provides insight into genuine user activity and adoption. Helps identify accumulation or distribution phases. Offers clues about the conviction of long-term holders. Can signal potential market tops or bottoms based on historical patterns. While no single metric is a crystal ball, combining on-chain data with other forms of analysis can provide a more comprehensive view of the crypto market . Decoding the MVRV Metric: Market Value vs. Realized Value The MVRV metric , or Market Value to Realized Value ratio, is a cornerstone of on-chain analysis developed by Murad Mahmudov and David Puell. It compares the current market capitalization (Market Value) of Bitcoin to its Realized Capitalization (Realized Value). Market Value (MV): This is the standard market cap – the current Bitcoin price multiplied by the circulating supply. It represents the total value of Bitcoin as perceived by the market right now. Realized Value (RV): This is a modified market cap where each Bitcoin is valued not at the current price, but at the price it was last moved on the blockchain. It approximates the average cost basis of all Bitcoin in existence. It tends to be less volatile than Market Value. The MVRV metric is calculated as: MV / RV. The resulting ratio indicates whether the market value is above or below the aggregate cost basis of investors. Interpreting the MVRV Ratio: MVRV > 1: The Market Value is greater than the Realized Value. On average, holders are in profit. The higher the ratio, the greater the aggregate unrealized profit in the system. MVRV The Market Value is less than the Realized Value. On average, holders are at a loss. Historically, values below 1 have signaled potential market bottoms. By observing the MVRV ratio over time, analysts can identify periods where the market is potentially overextended (high MVRV) or undervalued (low MVRV). Glassnode’s Insights: Current MVRV and Profit Taking Potential Leading on-chain analysis firm Glassnode recently shared crucial data regarding the current position of the Bitcoin price relative to the MVRV metric . According to their report, Bitcoin is presently trading within a specific range defined by standard deviations above the mean MVRV. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin is currently positioned between +0.5σ and +1σ on the MVRV chart. Historically, this range has often coincided with periods signaling short-term peaks or local tops within a larger trend. However, the critical piece of information is that this level has not yet reached the typical threshold that historically triggers significant, widespread profit taking across the network. What does this imply? It suggests that while some short-term traders might be taking profits, the majority of the market, particularly long-term holders, have not yet reached a point where they feel compelled to sell en masse. This conviction among holders provides underlying support and indicates that upward price movement is still feasible before the market enters a phase dominated by heavy selling pressure aimed at realizing gains. The current position suggests a market that is profitable for many, but not yet exhibiting the extreme levels of euphoria and overvaluation that have marked previous cycle tops where significant profit taking occurred. Comparing Current MVRV to Historical Profit Taking Zones To truly appreciate the significance of Glassnode’s findings, it helps to look at historical context. When did significant profit taking typically kick in during previous bull markets, according to the MVRV metric ? Historically, major market tops and subsequent large-scale profit taking have correlated with MVRV ratios reaching much higher standard deviation levels, typically above +2σ, and sometimes even exceeding +3σ or +4σ in parabolic phases. Consider these examples: 2017 Peak: The MVRV ratio reached levels well above +3σ, signaling extreme overvaluation and preceding a significant market correction driven by intense selling. 2021 Peaks (April & November): While not reaching the same extreme as 2017, both peaks saw the MVRV ratio climb above +2σ, indicating significant unrealized profits and leading to substantial price pullbacks as investors cashed out. Comparing these historical levels to the current +0.5σ to +1σ range highlighted by Glassnode clearly illustrates the difference. The market isn’t exhibiting the same degree of aggregate unrealized profit that historically precipitates major reversals driven by profit taking . This historical comparison is a key reason why analysts suggest there is still ‘room to run’ for the Bitcoin price . What This Means for the Crypto Market: Potential Room for Growth The implication of the MVRV analysis is positive for the short-to-medium term outlook for the Bitcoin price . If the market hasn’t reached the typical zone for major profit taking , it suggests that the current upward trend could continue. This doesn’t mean the price will go up in a straight line, or that corrections won’t happen. The crypto market is known for its volatility. However, it indicates that a major, cycle-ending top driven by overwhelming investor desire to cash out gains might not be imminent based on this specific on-chain analysis tool. Potential scenarios suggested by this data: Continued Upward Trend: The price continues to climb as long-term holders remain convicted and new demand enters the market, pushing the MVRV ratio higher towards historical peak zones. Consolidation: The price might consolidate or experience minor pullbacks within the current MVRV range as some short-term holders take profits, but without triggering a major downtrend. Eventual Peak: The market will eventually reach an MVRV level (historically above +2σ) that signals significant overvaluation, leading to increased profit taking and a potential market top. The current MVRV position suggests we are likely still in the earlier to middle stages of a bull market cycle, rather than the final, euphoric blow-off top phase. Actionable Insights for Investors Navigating the Crypto Market For those participating in the crypto market , this on-chain analysis provides valuable context. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue monitoring on-chain analysis metrics like MVRV, but also look at other indicators and broader market news. Manage Expectations: While the analysis suggests potential upside, remember that market dynamics can change rapidly. Avoid making decisions based solely on one metric. Plan Your Strategy: If you hold Bitcoin, consider what MVRV levels or price points might align with your own investment goals for profit taking , but be aware that historical patterns are not guarantees. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those accumulating, DCA remains a sound strategy to navigate volatility regardless of specific metric signals. Risk Management: Always invest only what you can afford to lose and understand the risks inherent in the crypto market . The insight that major profit taking hasn’t begun provides a degree of confidence, but it should empower informed decision-making, not reckless speculation. Challenges and Limitations of Relying on the MVRV Metric While the MVRV metric is a powerful tool for on-chain analysis , it’s crucial to acknowledge its limitations: Historical Data: The metric is based on historical patterns. The current market cycle might behave differently due to new factors like increased institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, or regulatory changes. Approximation: Realized Value is an approximation of cost basis. Not every coin movement represents a trade (e.g., internal wallet transfers). Single Metric: Relying on MVRV alone is insufficient. A holistic view requires considering other on-chain indicators (SOPR, NUPL, etc.), technical analysis, and fundamental factors. Interpretation: Different analysts might interpret the same MVRV levels slightly differently based on context. Therefore, use MVRV as a valuable piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture when assessing the potential future of the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market . Conclusion: Room to Run Before the Peak? In summary, the recent on-chain analysis from Glassnode focusing on the MVRV metric provides a compelling perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin price . While trading in a range that has historically signaled short-term peaks, the metric has not yet reached the elevated levels that typically precede widespread, significant profit taking . This suggests that the crypto market , led by Bitcoin, potentially has more room for upward movement before the aggregate unrealized profit becomes so substantial that it triggers a major sell-off phase. Understanding metrics like MVRV, combined with historical context, empowers investors to make more informed decisions in this exciting yet volatile asset class. While caution is always warranted, the current data point from on-chain analysis offers a hopeful outlook for continued growth before the ultimate cycle peak driven by major profit taking pressure.

These levels could signal either a potential recovery or deeper declines. Traders are watching closely to see which way the market will move. This article explores whether these cryptocurrencies are poised for a rebound or if more losses are on the horizon. Litecoin Price Trends and Current Trading Levels LTC experienced about a 7% gain over the last month while showing a roughly 11% decline over the past six months. Price movements reveal fluctuating momentum with short-term improvements countering a longer-term drop. Recent increases contrast with more modest performance seen over half a year, indicating uneven progress that traders have observed. Current trading levels fall between approximately $68 and $94, with bulls and bears appearing evenly matched. Resistance is found near $103.77, while immediate support is around $53.01. A second resistance at $129.15 and support at $27.63 frame the trading range. The oscillator suggests a neutral trend with subtle bearish hints, promoting trading opportunities within these zones. XRP Price Action and Key Levels The past month showed a slight decline of nearly 1%, with a more significant weekly drop exceeding 8%. However, over the last six months, XRP gained over 13%, reflecting some renewed momentum. Price action has been unstable, characterized by short-term pressures balanced by a healthier long-term trend. Recent fluctuations indicate potential for significant moves in the near future. Currently, XRP sits between $1.75 and $2.50. Bulls aim to push towards the nearest resistance at $2.80, with a further target of $3.55, while bears are focused on support around $1.31 and further down near $0.56. The absence of a clear trend suggests that traders may consider buying near support and selling near resistance for optimal gains. Conclusion LTC and XRP have established critical support zones. For LTC, holding above its support could encourage a bounce back. XRP's support is similarly crucial, as it may attract buyers if maintained. Both are at pivotal points. Watching these levels can indicate if a reversal is in play or if further declines are expected. The price action over the next few days will be key in determining their direction.

Altcoins have moved in the opposite direction, dealing a harsh blow to bullish investors hoping for an imminent “altseason.” A recent analysis on CryptoQuant highlights the contrast in liquidation patterns between BTC and altcoins since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, offering a glimpse into the diverging paths taken by the two market segments. Short liquidations on Bitcoin have far exceeded long liquidations since the ETF approval, according to the report. Short liquidations on Bitcoin have far exceeded long liquidations since the ETF approval. Source: @joao_wedson Bitcoin’s post-ETF rally crushes the bears On Binance, Bitcoin’s Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed that short liquidations on Bitcoin exceeded long liquidations by far since the SEC approved ETFs in early 2024. In essence, traders who bet against Bitcoin since then have been systematically forced out of their positions as BTC steadily climbed. In a post on X , analyst Joao Wedson, the author of the CryptoQuant report, stated, “The data doesn’t lie: since the ETF launch, there has been $190 million more in short liquidations than long liquidations on Binance.” According to Wedson, Bitcoin’s price strength during this period caught many bearish speculators off guard. Rather than correcting or stalling after the ETF launches, BTC has extended its rally, reinforcing its dominance and trust among institutional and retail investors alike. Altcoins have become a trap for bulls Unlike Bitcoin, the story is starkly different for the altcoin market. While Bitcoin has steadily climbed and squeezed shorts, altcoins have suffered from overwhelming long liquidations. According to CryptoQuant’s data, long liquidations in the altcoin market outpaced short liquidations by nearly $1 billion during the same post-ETF period. Long liquidations in the altcoin market outpace short liquidations by nearly $1 billion since Bitcoin spot ETFs launched. Source: @joao_wedson This imbalance suggests that many traders expected altcoins to follow Bitcoin’s bullish lead, perhaps anticipating the onset of a long-awaited “altseason”—a period in which altcoins outperform BTC. Unfortunately for these traders, altcoin prices largely trended downward, defying the bullish bias and resulting in widespread liquidations of leveraged long positions. Market dynamics reveal a diverging risk appetite This stark difference in liquidation patterns reveals more than just market volatility; it suggests a fundamental shift in trader sentiment and risk behavior. While investors showed correct bullish conviction in Bitcoin, they incorrectly assumed altcoins would follow suit. The result? BTC punished the bears, but altcoins punished their bulls even harder. The divergence also reflects institutional interest. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in capital from traditional finance players, buoyed by strong macroeconomic narratives, adding legitimacy and demand to BTC. Altcoins, however, lack similar instruments and regulatory clarity, leaving them more vulnerable to retail speculation and volatility. For traders and analysts, the message is clear, and it’s that the current crypto environment favors Bitcoin in terms of relative stability and upside potential.

Get ready for some exciting news that truly highlights the momentum building in the digital asset space. We’re seeing a significant uptick in crypto funding for projects across the ecosystem, and the numbers are starting to paint a very optimistic picture for the future of the crypto market . Decoding the Surge in Crypto Funding According to recent reports, citing data from DeFiLlama, crypto project funding has already reached a staggering $7.7 billion year-to-date in 2025. Now, let’s put that into perspective: this figure represents an impressive 89% increase compared to the same period just last year. This isn’t just a small bump; it’s a substantial leap that indicates renewed confidence and aggressive positioning from investors in the space. What’s even more compelling is the projection for the remainder of the year. Based on the current trajectory, total funding is expected to climb even higher, potentially reaching $18 billion by the end of 2025. This forecast suggests that the pace of investment is likely to continue, fueling innovation and expansion within the crypto landscape. Why the Spike in Crypto Venture Capital? So, what’s driving this significant surge in crypto venture capital ? Several factors appear to be at play: Market Recovery and Stability: Following periods of volatility, the market has shown signs of stabilization and recovery, increasing investor appetite for risk. Emerging Narratives: Specific sectors within crypto, such as AI-crypto convergence, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), and renewed interest in DeFi and GameFi, are attracting considerable attention and capital. Technological Advancements: Continuous development in blockchain technology, scaling solutions, and interoperability are making the ecosystem more robust and appealing for long-term investment. Institutional Interest: While sometimes cautious, institutional players continue to explore and enter the crypto space, bringing significant capital and validation. This influx of crypto investment isn’t just about chasing trends; it reflects a deeper belief in the foundational technology and its potential to disrupt various industries. What Does This Increased Crypto Investment Mean for the Market? More funding flowing into crypto projects has several positive implications for the broader crypto market : Accelerated Innovation: Capital enables teams to build faster, develop more sophisticated products, and push the boundaries of what’s possible with blockchain technology. New Project Development: Expect to see a wave of new protocols, applications, and services launching, addressing current limitations and creating new use cases. Talent Acquisition: Well-funded projects can attract top talent from traditional tech and finance sectors, further professionalizing the industry. Ecosystem Growth: Funding often targets infrastructure, developer tools, and interoperability solutions, strengthening the overall foundation of the crypto ecosystem. Essentially, more money means more building, which ultimately benefits users and contributes to the maturity and expansion of the digital asset space. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Project Funding While the headline numbers are exciting, it’s important to look beyond the surface. The distribution of this crypto project funding is key. Are funds concentrated in a few large deals, or is it spread across a wider range of early-stage projects? Understanding where the capital is flowing can provide insights into future market trends. Investors and enthusiasts should pay attention to: Sector Focus: Which categories (DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, Infrastructure, AI, etc.) are receiving the most significant investment? Stage of Funding: Is the money going into seed rounds for brand new ideas, or later-stage rounds for more established projects looking to scale? Investor Profile: Are traditional VCs, crypto-native funds, or corporate investors leading the rounds? Tracking these details, often available through data providers like DeFiLlama, can offer valuable context on the health and direction of the crypto market .

The analyst points to a technical structure commonly referred to as a “ bull flag ,” which he believes could lead to a significant increase in price if confirmed. Bull Flag Identified in Weekly Price Movement In a recent update , EGRAG first identified the bullish pattern, noting that such setups typically present a 67% to 70% probability of upward continuation. According to his interpretation, the “flagpole” portion of the pattern formed between November 2024 and January 2025, during which XRP saw a sharp increase in value from around $0.50 to a peak of $3.30. #XRP – Bull Flag ( Double Digits) Is there a part you're having trouble understanding? Let me know, and I’ll clarify! #XRPFamily STAY STEADY AND STRONG, Together We Rise pic.twitter.com/fsrbwL9vyq — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 26, 2025 Following this surge, the cryptocurrency entered a consolidation phase, where its price began to fluctuate in a narrow band, primarily within the lower $2 range. This period of reduced volatility and sideways trading, which has lasted roughly four months, is what EGRAG describes as the “flag” component of the formation. The analyst views this phase as a typical cooldown that often precedes another leg higher. Updated Chart Analysis and Price Forecasts In a follow-up shared two days later, EGRAG presented a revised version of the flag pattern to better align with recent market data. This adjustment allowed for more precise projections using a “measured move” technique. To calculate price targets, he utilized both logarithmic and linear charts, emphasizing that logarithmic scaling is often more suitable for evaluating crypto assets due to their high volatility. Based on these methods, EGRAG outlined three potential outcomes. The logarithmic projection suggested a target near $18, representing a gain of roughly 729% from XRP’s current price of $2.17. The linear approach yielded a lower target of $5.50, or about a 153.5% increase. Averaging the two methods resulted in an estimated midpoint of $11.75, which would reflect a 441.47% gain. To account for market uncertainty, EGRAG also applied a 15% to 20% adjustment range to each figure. With this margin, the logarithmic target extended as high as $21.60, while the average price estimate ranged between $13.51 and $14.10. The linear projection’s upper limit reached $6.60. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Sentiment Aligns with Bullish Outlook EGRAG’s outlook aligns with projections from other analysts and industry figures. In March, crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina expressed confidence that XRP could eventually reach $20 or higher. Likewise, crypto personality Davinci Jeremie also indicated that the asset has the potential to exceed $20 within the year. In April, another analyst known as Papa suggested that XRP could hit $14 based on a bullish Fibonacci extension model. Similarly, market watcher JD pointed to $14 as a likely minimum target in the event of a confirmed breakout from current levels. As of report time, XRP trades at $2.17. Despite the short-term movement, technical analysts and crypto enthusiasts remain focused on whether the bull flag structure will result in the anticipated price breakout.

As Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped below $105k, the wider altcoin market led by the memecoins recorded heavy forced liquidation of long-leveraged traders. According to market data from Coinglass, more than $747 million in forced crypto liquidations involved long traders. The forced liquidations of Bitcoin’s whale-long traders, led by James Wynn , triggered further short-term pessimism. Meanwhile, the short crypto traders recorded around $80 million in forced liquidations during the past 24 hours. As a result, the odds of a long squeeze escalated despite the overall optimism of a market rebound over the weekend. What Next for the Altcoin Market The optimism of a crypto rebound in the coming few days remains evident amid the ongoing bloodbath. Bitcoin’s fear and greed index hovered around 60 percent, signaling greed among crypto traders. The improving crypto regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions, led by the United States, has attracted more institutional investors in the web3 space. As a result, it is evident that more crypto investors are anticipating a bullish rebound in the coming days, potentially a parabolic rally in the near future. However, the ongoing bearish sentiment may likely delay a bullish rebound, especially if Bitcoin price drops below $100k again in the coming days. Nonetheless, the notable surge of bearish traders will likely trigger a major short squeeze of Bitcoin price rebounds above $110k in the coming days. The crypto bullish outlook has a higher ground catalyzed by rising adoption from institutional investors and favoring regulatory frameworks from major jurisdictions.

This week, Cango Inc., a company primarily known as a leading automotive transaction service platform in China, turned heads in the cryptocurrency world with a significant announcement regarding its Bitcoin mining operations. What’s Behind Cango’s Jump into Bitcoin Mining? Cango’s foray into the world of digital asset mining might seem surprising at first glance for a company rooted in the automotive sector. However, it reflects a growing trend among diverse corporations looking to diversify their assets, explore new revenue streams, and potentially hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. By acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) mining machines, reportedly from industry giant Bitmain, Cango is actively participating in the process that secures the Bitcoin network and generates new BTC. Bitcoin mining involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the next block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees. This process requires significant computational power and energy, making it a capital-intensive operation. For a company like Cango, investing in mining infrastructure represents a strategic decision to directly accumulate a digital asset that many believe has long-term value potential. A Closer Look at Cango’s Growing Cango BTC Holdings The core of the recent announcement from Cango, shared via their official channels, was the impressive figure of 109.1 BTC mined within a single week. This is a substantial amount of Bitcoin, reflecting efficient operations and significant deployed hashing power. But perhaps more importantly, this weekly yield has significantly boosted their total reserves. Following this successful week of mining, Cango’s total Cango BTC holdings have now reached an impressive 3,398 BTC. To put this into perspective, let’s consider the approximate value (keeping in mind that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and this value fluctuates constantly). As of the time of writing, 3,398 BTC represents a multi-million dollar asset on their balance sheet. This positions Cango as a notable corporate holder of Bitcoin, although still considerably smaller than giants like MicroStrategy, whose strategy is primarily focused on accumulating BTC. The growth in their holdings demonstrates that their investment in mining equipment is yielding tangible results, steadily increasing their digital asset reserves over time. This isn’t just a speculative purchase; it’s an active accumulation strategy through operational activity. Why Are More Companies Embracing Corporate Bitcoin Strategies? Cango is not alone in exploring the potential of digital assets. The trend of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, often referred to as adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy, gained significant momentum starting in 2020. Companies cite various reasons for this move: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its capped supply. Asset Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s treasury reserves away from traditional cash and bonds. Potential for Appreciation: Companies anticipate that the value of Bitcoin will increase over the long term. Attracting Talent and Investor Interest: Embracing innovative technologies like Bitcoin can make a company appear forward-thinking. New Revenue Streams: For companies like Cango, mining directly generates new assets and potentially revenue. While holding Bitcoin is one approach, actively engaging in crypto mining , as Cango is doing, represents a deeper operational commitment to the ecosystem. It requires expertise in setting up and managing mining infrastructure, navigating energy costs, and dealing with the technical complexities involved. Navigating the World of Crypto Mining: Challenges and Considerations While the rewards of successful crypto mining , such as accumulating 109.1 BTC in a week, are attractive, the process comes with significant challenges: High Capital Costs: Acquiring powerful mining hardware, like the machines from Bitmain, requires a substantial upfront investment. Energy Consumption and Cost: Mining is energy-intensive. The cost and availability of electricity are major factors influencing profitability and operational location. Mining Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of solving the mathematical problems increases, requiring more powerful hardware to maintain the same level of output. Hardware Obsolescence: Mining technology evolves rapidly, meaning hardware can become less efficient or obsolete over time. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrency mining varies significantly across jurisdictions and can change unexpectedly, posing risks, especially for companies operating in complex regions like China. Bitcoin Price Volatility: The value of the mined Bitcoin fluctuates with market prices, impacting the profitability of the operation. Cango’s continued success in mining suggests they are effectively managing these challenges, leveraging their resources and strategic partnerships (like with Bitmain) to build a productive mining operation alongside their primary automotive business. Cango’s Announcement in the Context of Recent Bitcoin News This positive development from Cango comes at a time when the broader Bitcoin news cycle is often dominated by market price movements, regulatory discussions, and the performance of dedicated crypto companies. Cango’s update serves as a reminder that adoption and participation in the Bitcoin network are expanding beyond traditional crypto-native firms. It highlights that companies from diverse sectors are finding strategic reasons to engage with Bitcoin, either through direct investment or operational activities like mining. This kind of organic accumulation by publicly traded companies adds another layer to the institutional adoption narrative surrounding Bitcoin. Benefits of Cango’s Mining Strategy: Direct accumulation of a potentially appreciating asset. Diversification of company assets. Potential new revenue stream from mining rewards and transaction fees. Operational involvement provides deeper understanding of the crypto ecosystem. Challenges Cango Faces: Significant capital expenditure on hardware. Ongoing operational costs, primarily energy. Risk associated with Bitcoin price volatility. Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for crypto mining. Maintaining competitive edge against dedicated mining companies. Actionable Insights from Cango’s Move What can individuals and other businesses take away from Cango’s successful mining venture? Diversification is Key: Companies are exploring non-traditional assets for balance sheet management. Operational Adoption is Growing: It’s not just about buying Bitcoin; some companies are integrating crypto into their operations. Mining Requires Expertise: Successful mining involves careful planning, significant investment, and efficient management of technical and energy resources. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on companies from traditional sectors entering the crypto space, as it signals broader acceptance and potential future trends. Cango’s ability to successfully mine over 100 BTC in a week and build their holdings to over 3,000 BTC demonstrates that with the right strategy and resources, companies from various industries can effectively participate in the digital asset economy. Conclusion: Cango’s Mining Success Signals Broader Trends Cango’s announcement that it mined 109.1 BTC this week, bringing its total Cango BTC holdings to 3,398 BTC, is more than just a number; it’s a testament to the increasing integration of corporate Bitcoin strategies into the operations of diverse companies. While their primary business remains automotive services, their significant investment in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, supplied by Bitmain, is clearly paying off, allowing them to accumulate a substantial digital asset reserve. This move highlights the growing interest from non-crypto native companies in leveraging digital assets for strategic purposes, whether for balance sheet management, diversification, or exploring new revenue streams through activities like crypto mining . As the world of finance and technology continues to converge, expect to see more such stories emerge, further solidifying Bitcoin’s place in the global corporate landscape. Cango’s remarkable growth in its BTC holdings is a notable piece of recent Bitcoin news , underscoring the dynamic evolution of corporate engagement with cryptocurrencies.

Currently, long-term moving averages such as the 100 and 200-period suggest bullish directional bias. Recent data has shown a significant increase in Solana’s weekly decentralized trading volume, outperforming many other large-cap crypto coins. By Christian Norman Year-to-date, 2025 has proven to be an interesting time for the crypto market, with Solana being no exception. Enjoying a period of bullish momentum bookmarked by Trump’s win in the election, seen as the pro-crypto candidate of choice, Solana not only rose to an all-time high just shy of $300 but overtook Binance Coin (BNB) to become the fifth-largest coin by market capitalization globally. A chart showing the recent price action of SOLUSD. OANDA, 27/05/2024 Currently trading at 179.38, a ~39% discount from all-time highs made in mid-January, the recent fall in Solana pricing has sparked interest amongst those looking for a buying opportunity. Notwithstanding, this decline in value is not exclusive to Solana, with much of the crypto space feeling the full force of waning market risk appetite. With a meteoric rise in crypto value still fresh in the collective memory, the $1,000,000 question becomes whether this phenomenon will continue in 2025, or whether general market risk aversion will bode negatively for crypto— Solana included. A table showing the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. CoinMarketCap, 05/27/2024. What’s next for Solana? SOLUSD: Technical analysis Moving averages: Currently, long-term moving averages such as the 100 and 200-period suggest bullish directional bias, with recent price action breaking above key levels of support. This suggests that Solana has found sustained buyer pressure in the medium to long-term, and should remain in a general uptrend should current momentum continue. Oscillators lean neutral to sell : Many of the most commonly used trading indicators currently lean towards either a neutral or bearish bias. The Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) and Stochastics currently or recently have Solana as ‘overbought.’ At the same time, the MACD shows a weakening bull trend, with the distance between the MACD and signal line narrowing. Increased US rate cut bets are also benefiting silver pricing, with markets increasingly anticipating two interest rate cuts in 2025 Key levels : At the time of writing, Solana trades rangebound between ~$165 and ~$184. Historically, this is a range where bull trends are either made or broken. A sustained break above this level would suggest further bullish momentum, while the opposite could impose further downside from January’s highs. SOLUSD: Fundamental analysis Surge in DEX trading volume : Recent data has shown a significant increase in Solana’s weekly decentralized trading volume (DEX), outperforming many other large-cap crypto coins. This growth in volume suggests higher levels of user activity, liquidity, and growing utility for the Solana network, which is encouraging for Solana in the medium to long term. Crypto strategic reserve : A pledge by Donald Trump as part of his 2024 campaign, Solana is included in the US government’s “Digital Asset Stockpile”. Once a crypto-sceptic, Trump has not only overseen the creation of a United States crypto reserve but also released his project on the Solana blockchain - the now-infamous $TRUMP coin. Although some, including Solana’s co-founder, have reservations about governmental endorsement of crypto, the short-term effects on Solana pricing have historically been positive.",SOL-USD,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-30 19:52:00

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto analyst Pentoshi tells his 865,000 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap could dip to a price in the mid-$90,000s if it were to lose support around the $101,000 to $102,000 area. However, according to the analyst, demand for the flagship digital asset will be greater than all the BTC mined from all points, which in turn should eventually lead to a price spike. “We are still making higher highs and higher lows, overall this is a strong uptrend… [In my opinion], the worst case scenario [if] the trend [were] to continue [is] we see mid $90,000s as the next higher low. That’s IF we lose around $101,000-$102,000 area, which is the current support. I don’t really think you can compare this currently to 2021 because the situation isn’t the same at all, we were going into a period then of [quantitative tightening] after a period of extreme excess. The competition currently for BTC is only growing, and I’m quite certain the demand is greater than the daily mined BTC from all data points. So demand > supply over any period of time. I think the biggest enemy of people is their own patience. I too make these mistakes [from] time to time.” Source: Ali Pentoshi/X The trader’s chart indicates that BTC could dip to his target sometime between June and July before sparking a rally to the $120,000 range. BTC is trading for $105,471 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Ripple (XRP) and Ruvi AI (RUVI) are hot opportunities, each with their own strengths. But which one can turn $1,500 into a fortune by 2025? Ripple’s Strengths in Cross-Border Payments Ripple was launched in 2012 to streamline cross-border payments, providing financial institutions with fast and cheap transaction solutions. Its native token XRP is the key to these transactions. Ripple has partnered with top financial institutions globally to become the leader in the blockchain payments space. Recently, the resolution of Ripple’s long-standing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sparked renewed interest in XRP. Now that the lawsuit is behind them, Ripple can focus on scaling their services and expanding their partnerships which will boost their adoption big time. However, XRP being a mature cryptocurrency means its ability to deliver exponential returns is limited. While Ripple’s established position provides stability, its growth now depends largely on the steady growth of their ecosystem which is different from the explosive opportunities offered by newer projects like Ruvi AI. Ruvi AI’s Innovative Approach Ruvi AI is disrupting the blockchain space with its AI integration. As a decentralized hub for AI driven content creation, Ruvi AI allows users to generate custom text, images, video and audio for industries like marketing, entertainment and automation. Where Ripple is in financial services, Ruvi AI is in business sectors that are fast adopting AI solutions. By focusing on real world utility, Ruvi AI is aligned with global demand for automation and efficiency, creating a use case that goes beyond speculative investments. The $RUVI token powers the platform’s functionality, giving access to premium AI tools, staking rewards and governance privileges. This utility driven approach makes Ruvi AI an investment opportunity with long term potential. Phenomenal Presale Performance Ruvi AI’s presale has been hot, lots of early investors are in. Phase 1 sold out in 2 weeks at $0.010. Phase 2 is now open at $0.015 and already giving 50% returns to the early backers. We have over 1,400 holders so far, showing growing confidence in Ruvi AI’s vision and execution. Milestones like getting listed on a major exchange and partnering with a mainstream exchange show the project is ready to scale. Growth Potential Ripple is established, safe for those looking for stable returns. Its focus is on blockchain in the financial sector, especially cross border payments. That limits its price growth. Ruvi AI is an early stage opportunity. By entering the market with low token price and a disruptive model, it has huge upside. For investors looking for exponential returns, Ruvi AI is the only one. Ruvi AI’s Investment Opportunities Ruvi AI’s presale has 3 VIP tiers to help investors maximize their returns. Here’s how much $1,500 can be worth based on these opportunities, the listing price of $0.07 and a predicted post-listing price of $1. VIP 2 Threshold: 50,000 $RUVI ($750 investment) Bonus: 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens: 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07): $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1): $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold: 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 investment) Bonus: 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens: 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07): $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1): $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold: 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 investment) * Bonus: 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens: 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07): $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1): $1,000,000 Which Crypto Will Make You Rich? Ripple is an established player in the blockchain space, perfect for stable growth. But for those willing to take more risk for bigger rewards, Ruvi AI is the real deal. Its AI-blockchain hybrid technology and low entry price means enormous growth potential. Ruvi AI’s presale Phase 2 is still at $0.015 per token. Now is the time to act.

For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained strong selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a significant bearish drop. This resulted in a drop toward $0.16 level. Will JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.15 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

After several weeks of testing the $2,700 region, ETH remains within striking distance of this critical resistance, keeping bullish momentum alive. Market sentiment has shifted in Ethereum’s favor, with analysts and investors increasingly pointing to the possibility of an upcoming altseason. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical breakdown, noting that ETH is currently back to a key moving average after flexing a move above the $2,700 range. This move aligned with the underside of a key resistance level, forming a confluence zone that could act as a springboard or rejection point in the days ahead. While Bitcoin consolidates just under its all-time high, Ethereum appears to be gaining traction as traders look for opportunities beyond BTC. With ETH holding higher lows and establishing a steady base, a breakout above the $2,700–$2,800 range could confirm a broader market rotation into altcoins. For now, bulls must maintain control above $2,500 to keep the structure intact and fuel hopes of a move higher. Ethereum At A Pivotal Level As Bulls Defend Support Ethereum is facing a crucial test as it struggles to reclaim higher prices and confirm a sustained uptrend. After multiple attempts to break above the $2,700 resistance zone, the price has been met with volatility, creating a choppy environment that reflects broader uncertainty in the crypto market. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s prospects, especially as altseason chatter grows louder. Cheds recently shared a key insight: Ethereum is now back at its 20-day moving average (DMA) after briefly surging above the $2,700 range. This push met the underside of the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), creating a confluence zone that could act as the launchpad for the next rally, or the line in the sand that decides short-term direction. Holding this DMA support is critical. If bulls defend this level, it could signal renewed strength and spark a breakout that sends ETH back toward $3,000 and beyond. Amid rising speculation and technical pressure, Ethereum’s current structure still leans bullish. It’s maintaining higher lows and continues to show signs of accumulation, which supports the thesis of a possible altseason in the near future. If BTC stabilizes and ETH clears resistance, the entire market could shift upward rapidly.

The chart shows ETH retesting the 34-period EMA (currently near $2,624) and finding short-term support along the confluence of the 50 and 100-period SMAs. These moving averages are acting as a dynamic support band that has held firm during previous retracements in May. The structure remains bullish overall, with higher lows maintained since the breakout on May 9. However, the current price action is forming a tightening wedge pattern, which suggests that a breakout—either up or down—is imminent. Volume has been declining slightly, indicating a potential pause before a decisive move.

A clean bounce from here could set up another attempt to break the $2,700–$2,800 resistance area. On the flip side, a break below the 100 SMA could expose ETH to a deeper retracement toward $2,500 or even the $2,400 zone if selling pressure accelerates.

In recent weeks, ETH has shown notable bullish action, and several crypto analysts are highlighting its potential for a huge upward move toward higher levels in the short term. Crucial Zone To Lead Ethereum To A New Peak Given the current market weakness, Ethereum has lost some of its upward momentum after facing resistance at $2,800. Despite this brief pullback, ETH’s recent trend is pointing to a major rally, indicating an extension of the ongoing uptrend . A seasoned crypto expert on the X platform, Trader Tardigrade, examining the price action, has forecasted a surge to a new all-time high. According to the technical analyst, Ethereum is currently navigating a critical technical zone that may serve as the impetus for one of its biggest rallies ever. Examining the chart, this crucial zone is referred to as the Impulsive Waves zone. The expert is confident that ETH may be gearing up for a powerful surge to a new peak, as this zone has historically preceded massive upward breakout moves . Following a robust recovery in the last cycle, defined by a huge drop and a swift rebound , the expert claims that ETH is now entering the impulsive waves zone. Since the impulsive waves zone is known for its notable bullish influence on price, its recent emergence implies that ETH’s next major move might already be in motion. With momentum building and Ethereum challenging key resistance levels, Trader Tardigrade foresees a substantial upward move to the $18,000 milestone, representing a nearly 700% rally from current price levels. The chart shows that the altcoin is likely to reach this untouched level by the second half of next year. Is ETH Taking Over The Crypto Market? Trader Tardigrade’s forecast could be backed by the fact that the market is slowly shifting towards an Ethereum season. A look at the ETH/BTC chart reveals that Ethereum is gaining bullish momentum as the pair rebounds from its monthly support level of 0.018. Additionally, ETH’s price is forming a Bull Flag formation on the daily chart. A bull flag formation is a technical pattern that typically precedes a continued upward trend, suggesting that the altcoin’s bullish run is not yet over. When ETH breaks out from the bull flag pattern, the expert hints at a huge spike in price to the $4,000 mark . Crypto analysts like Javon Marks have predicted a sustained uptrend after hitting this key level last seen in December last year. As indicators align toward a rally, Javon Marks believes the next target for the altcoin is $4,811. The expert anticipates another +78% upside from this zone, pushing ETH to $8,500 and beyond.",Ethereum|Bull Flag Pattern|ETF|ETF news|ETH-BTC|ethereum etf|Ethereum ETFs|Javon Marks|Spot Ethereum ETF|spot Ethereum ETFs|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-30 20:00:23

In its new Quarterly Banking Profile for the first quarter of 2025, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) says US banks reported a $67.5 billion decrease in unrealized losses on securities. Although it looks like progress, the FDIC warns the decrease has likely already reversed amid extreme bond market volatility and a surging Treasury yield curve. “Longer-term interest rates such as the 30-year mortgage rate and the 10-year Treasury rate decreased in the first quarter, increasing the value of securities reported by banks and lowering unrealized losses. However, increases in longer-term interest rates since the end of the first quarter would likely reverse most of these improvements in unrealized losses if measured today.” Rebel Cole, who worked in the Federal Reserve System for ten years, tells Fortune the losses represent a serious ongoing danger for lenders. “All it takes is one bad news story about any of these banks, and we could have another banking crisis like we had in March of [2023]. I’m amazed we haven’t had one since then.” The FDIC says banks recorded a $180.9 billion rise in domestic deposits, which is about 1%, and a $3.8 billion increase in net income to $70.6 billion, with a reserve coverage ratio declining from 179.9% to 168.8%.

A significant development recently unfolded concerning the acquisition of a key player in the Japanese market. Sinohope Technology , a Hong Kong-listed company with affiliations to the global exchange HTX , has successfully completed a notable crypto acquisition. Sinohope Technology’s Strategic Move On May 29, as reported via HKEXnews, Sinohope Technology finalized its previously announced acquisition of the Japanese crypto exchange BitTrade . This move is more than just a corporate transaction; it represents a strategic entry or expansion into a highly regulated and potentially lucrative market. For Sinohope Technology , integrating BitTrade into its portfolio means gaining a foothold in Japan, a country known for its stringent but clear cryptocurrency regulations. What does this mean for the entities involved and the broader market? Sinohope Technology’s Expansion: This acquisition diversifies Sinohope’s business lines and geographic reach. BitTrade’s Future: Operating as a subsidiary, BitTrade can potentially leverage Sinohope’s resources and network. HTX’s Indirect Influence: Given the affiliation, this could subtly strengthen HTX’s presence or influence in the region through a related entity. Understanding BitTrade and its Significance in the Japan Crypto Market BitTrade , formerly known as Huobi Japan, is a licensed cryptocurrency exchange operating within Japan’s regulatory framework. The Japan crypto market is distinct due to its early adoption of comprehensive regulations following past incidents. Operating legally in Japan requires adherence to strict rules set by the Financial Services Agency (FSA). This makes obtaining or acquiring a licensed entity like BitTrade a preferred path for international companies looking to enter the market compliantly. Key aspects of the Japan crypto market include: Feature Description Regulation Strict licensing and oversight by the FSA. User Base Tech-savvy population with growing interest in crypto assets. Market Structure Dominated by a few licensed exchanges. Asset Listing Rigorous screening process for approved tokens. Acquiring BitTrade provides Sinohope Technology with immediate access to this regulated environment and an established user base, bypassing the lengthy and complex process of applying for a new license from scratch. The Role of HTX Affiliation While the acquisition is by Sinohope Technology , its affiliation with the major global exchange HTX is noteworthy. Although the official announcement positions BitTrade as a subsidiary of Sinohope Technology , market observers often connect the dots between affiliated entities. This relationship could potentially facilitate synergies, whether through shared technology infrastructure, liquidity pools (within regulatory limits), or marketing efforts. The precise nature and extent of collaboration between BitTrade , Sinohope Technology , and HTX under the new structure will be interesting to watch as it develops. Why is this Crypto Acquisition Important? Every crypto acquisition, especially one involving a regulated entity in a major economy like Japan, sends signals to the market. This particular transaction highlights several trends: Value of Regulated Entities: The acquisition price (though not detailed in the snippet, acquisitions of licensed entities are typically substantial) underscores the premium placed on regulatory compliance and licenses in mature markets. Expansion Strategies: Global crypto firms continue to seek expansion into key regions, often through M&A. Institutional Confidence: A Hong Kong-listed company like Sinohope Technology making such a move can be seen as a sign of increasing institutional confidence in the long-term viability of the crypto industry, even amidst market volatility. This strategic step by Sinohope Technology into the Japan crypto market via the BitTrade acquisition is a significant development for all parties involved and merits close attention from anyone following the global expansion of crypto businesses. What’s Next for BitTrade and Sinohope Technology? With the acquisition complete, the focus shifts to integration and strategy execution. As a subsidiary of Sinohope Technology , BitTrade will need to align its operations, technology, and business goals with its new parent company while continuing to meet the strict requirements of the Japan crypto market regulators. Potential developments could include: Enhancements to BitTrade ‘s trading platform. Introduction of new services or assets (subject to FSA approval). Synergies with other parts of Sinohope Technology ‘s business or potentially the broader HTX ecosystem. The success of this crypto acquisition will ultimately be measured by how well Sinohope Technology leverages BitTrade ‘s position to grow its presence and contribute positively to the dynamic Japanese market. Conclusion: A New Chapter for BitTrade The completion of the acquisition of BitTrade by Sinohope Technology marks a pivotal moment for the Japanese exchange and its new parent company. This strategic crypto acquisition positions Sinohope Technology firmly within the regulated Japan crypto market, offering potential for growth and synergy, possibly amplified by its affiliation with HTX . It underscores the increasing institutional interest and the value placed on compliant operations in key global markets. As BitTrade operates under the Sinohope Technology umbrella, the industry will be watching to see how this new structure influences the competitive landscape in Japan and beyond.

The Division concluded that protocol staking activities do not constitute securities offerings under federal securities laws and no registration is required. “Accordingly, it is the Division’s view that participants in Protocol Staking Activities do not need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act, or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration in connection with these Protocol Staking Activities.” CRYPTO IS WINNING. The SEC just said that crypto staking on PoS networks does not involve securities. This is huge! pic.twitter.com/bfaNc7hQ0w — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) May 30, 2025 Staking is Not Securities Related The statement addressed three main types of staking arrangements: self (solo) staking, where node operators stake their own crypto assets using their own resources, self-custodial staking with third parties where asset owners grant validation rights to third-party node operators while retaining ownership and control, and custodial arrangements where third-party custodians hold and stake crypto assets on behalf of owners. The Division applied the Howey test and concluded that protocol staking fails to meet the “investment contract” criteria. This was due to there being no reliance on the entrepreneurial efforts of others since staking rewards come from administrative and ministerial activities, not managerial decisions. Additionally, there is no common enterprise based on others’ efforts, as participants earn rewards through their own protocol compliance, not from third parties’ business success. Finally, it stated that staking activities are essentially service provision rather than investment in a profit-generating enterprise.

House Committee on Financial Services Chairman French Hill, who introduced the bill, said, “Our bill brings long-overdue clarity to the digital asset ecosystem, prioritizes consumer protection and American innovation.” “America should be the global leader in the digital assets marketplace – but we can’t do that without establishing a clear regulatory framework,” added bill sponsor Dusty Johnson.

The IMI article states that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative tool, but is starting to be positioned as a strategic reserve asset. IMI states that due to high US budget deficits, expansionary monetary policies and the continuous decline in real yields on US Treasury bonds, many countries' central banks are turning to alternative reserve assets. The organization said that in this environment, new competitors have emerged against traditional reserve instruments such as gold, and that Bitcoin is increasingly attracting institutional attention with its fixed supply structure and decentralized nature. Related News: White House Officials Speak Out Following Developments in US-China Trade Tensions: Will the 145% Tariff Be Reinstated? The published analysis notes that some countries’ central banks and sovereign wealth funds have had contact with Bitcoin or have indirectly invested in it. For example, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund’s indirect Bitcoin ownership is cited, which is considered an indication that Bitcoin is beginning to be accepted as a long-term store of value. It is stated that Bitcoin can become a protection tool against the instability of traditional currencies, especially for developing countries struggling with high inflation and whose national currencies are under great pressure. According to IMI, in this period when the global financial order began to reshape, Bitcoin has evolved from its “speculative asset” identity to the role of a “strategic reserve asset” with the weakening of the dominance of the US dollar. *This is not investment advice.

According to a report citing on-chain analyst @DeItaone, Trump asserted that China has “totally violated” its tariff agreement with the United States. This claim, while not entirely new in the context of the often-strained relationship between the two economic superpowers, reignites discussions about past trade deals, ongoing tensions, and the potential implications for global markets. For anyone following global economic developments, particularly those interested in how geopolitical factors can influence financial landscapes, including the volatile world of cryptocurrency, understanding the nuances of the US China tariffs saga is crucial. Let’s dive into what this statement might signify and the history behind these claims. What Was the Tariff Agreement Trump References? The statement likely refers to the “Phase One” economic and trade agreement signed in January 2020. This deal was intended to de-escalate the intense trade war that began in 2018 under the Trump administration. At its core, the Phase One agreement involved several key components: Increased Purchases: China committed to purchasing at least $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over 2020 and 2021, compared to 2017 levels. This included specific targets for agricultural products, energy, manufactured goods, and services. Intellectual Property Protection: China agreed to strengthen protections for intellectual property, including reducing forced technology transfers. Financial Services: The agreement included provisions aimed at opening up China’s financial services market to U.S. firms. Currency Practices: Both countries agreed to refrain from competitive devaluation of their currencies. Dispute Resolution: A mechanism was established for resolving future disputes. In return, the U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases and reduce some existing tariffs on Chinese goods, though significant tariffs remained in place on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports from China. The intention was to create a more balanced trade relationship and address long-standing grievances regarding trade practices. Are Claims of Violation Justified? Examining the Evidence Trump’s claim that China has “totally violated” the agreement centers primarily on the purchasing commitments. Reports and analyses conducted since the agreement was signed have consistently shown that China fell significantly short of the purchasing targets outlined in the deal, particularly in the agricultural and energy sectors, partly due to factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. For instance, a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in early 2022 indicated that China had only met about 62% of its promised purchases of U.S. goods and services through December 2021. While China did increase purchases compared to pre-trade war levels, it did not reach the ambitious targets set in the agreement. Challenges in Meeting Targets: Pandemic Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted global supply chains and reduced demand, making large-scale purchases difficult. Economic Slowdown: China’s own economic growth slowed, affecting its import needs. Other Suppliers: China continued to diversify its sources for key commodities, not relying solely on the U.S. Structural Issues: Critics argue the targets were unrealistic from the start, not fully accounting for market dynamics. Beyond the purchasing targets, discussions around intellectual property protection and market access have also continued, suggesting that while progress might have been made in some areas, underlying tensions and disagreements persist. Therefore, while the term “totally violated” is strong and characteristic of Trump’s rhetoric, the claim that China did not fully meet the commitments, particularly on purchases, aligns with various economic analyses. The History of US China Tariffs and the Trade War To understand the weight of Trump’s recent statement, it’s essential to recall the tumultuous period of the US China tariffs trade war. Initiated in 2018, the conflict saw both countries impose escalating tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other’s goods. The U.S. administration cited issues like intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, currency manipulation, and a large bilateral trade deficit as reasons for the tariffs. This tit-for-tat tariff imposition had significant consequences: Increased Costs: U.S. businesses and consumers faced higher costs for imported goods from China. Reduced Exports: U.S. exporters, particularly in agriculture, faced retaliatory tariffs from China, harming sales. Supply Chain Disruption: Companies began rethinking and restructuring their global supply chains to reduce reliance on China. Market Uncertainty: The unpredictable nature of the dispute created significant volatility in global financial markets. The Phase One agreement was seen as a truce, not a resolution, leaving many core issues unresolved and a substantial portion of the tariffs in place. Trump’s recent comment serves as a reminder that despite the signing of that agreement, the underlying trade tensions and disagreements about its fulfillment remain a significant factor in global economic relations . What is the Potential Trade War Impact Now? While Trump is no longer in office, his statements continue to hold sway, particularly as he is a potential candidate for the presidency again. Renewed focus on China’s adherence to trade agreements could signal future policy directions if he were to return to power. More broadly, the persistence of these claims highlights the ongoing friction in global economic relations between the U.S. and China, regardless of who occupies the White House. The potential trade war impact of such claims, even if made from outside the administration, includes: Increased Political Pressure: Puts pressure on the current administration to take a tougher stance on China’s trade practices. Business Uncertainty: Creates uncertainty for businesses relying on trade with China, potentially impacting investment and supply chain decisions. Market Sensitivity: Financial markets, which are highly sensitive to U.S.-China relations, could react to escalating rhetoric or actions. Influence on Future Policy: Shapes the narrative around trade policy ahead of future elections, potentially leading to calls for new tariffs or trade restrictions. It’s important to note that the current Biden administration has maintained many of the Trump-era tariffs while engaging in its own form of strategic competition with China, focusing on areas like technology, human rights, and national security, alongside trade. Navigating Complex Economic Relations: Challenges and Insights The U.S.-China relationship is arguably the most critical bilateral relationship in the world, impacting everything from climate change cooperation to technological development and, of course, economic relations . The challenges in managing this relationship are immense: Challenge Area Description Insight/Implication Trade Imbalance & Practices Disagreements over market access, subsidies, state-owned enterprises, and intellectual property theft. Difficult to resolve without significant structural changes in one or both economies; likely to remain a source of friction. Technological Competition Rivalry in key tech sectors (AI, semiconductors, 5G) leading to restrictions on technology transfer and investment. Escalates beyond traditional trade disputes into national security concerns; impacts global tech supply chains. Geopolitical Tensions Disagreements over Taiwan, South China Sea, human rights, etc., spill over into economic interactions. Makes purely economic negotiations challenging as non-economic factors influence decision-making. Domestic Politics Both leaders face domestic pressures and political incentives that shape their approach to the bilateral relationship. Policy can be influenced by political cycles and rhetoric, adding unpredictability. For businesses, investors, and even individuals trying to make sense of the global economy, the key insight is that the U.S.-China trade relationship is characterized by deep structural issues and competing national interests that extend far beyond simple tariff levels. Claims like Trump’s, while potentially politically motivated, tap into genuine, unresolved grievances regarding China’s trade behavior and its adherence to agreements. Conclusion: What Does This Mean Moving Forward? Donald Trump’s assertion that China “totally violated” the tariff agreement serves as a potent reminder that the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, though perhaps less overtly confrontational than during the peak of the trade war, are far from resolved. The Phase One agreement, intended to ease tensions, appears to be viewed by some, including the former president, as a failure in terms of China’s fulfillment of its commitments. This situation underscores the fragility of trade agreements between major powers when underlying structural issues and strategic competition persist. While the immediate impact of Trump’s statement might be limited, it contributes to the ongoing narrative surrounding Trump China trade relations and keeps the possibility of future protectionist measures or renewed trade disputes on the table, especially in the context of upcoming political cycles. Keeping an eye on developments in global economic relations , particularly between these two giants, remains essential for understanding potential shifts in international trade policy and their ripple effects across the world economy.

A joint stipulation was filed on Thursday by the SEC, Binance, and Zhao, asking the Federal Court to dismiss the agency’s lawsuit complaint filed in June 2023. “Whereas, in light of the foregoing, and in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter, the Commission believes the dismissal of this Litigation is appropriate,” the filing reads. The motion indicated that the SEC’s Crypto Task Force “might impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this litigation” and that the Commission felt dismissing the suit was appropriate “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter.” The motion also requests that the case be dropped with prejudice, meaning the SEC cannot file it again later. The SEC in June 2023 alleged that Binance, Zhao, and U.S.-based sister company Binance.US offered American investors unregistered securities and commingled user funds through a “web of deceit.” The SEC’s chairman at the time, Gary Gensler, claimed in the original complaint that Binance “attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes” while giving U.S. investors access to the trading platform. Binance and Zhao settled a separate case with the Department of Justice in November 2023, agreeing to pay a staggering $4.3 billion fine and admitting that the company violated sanctions, was an unlicensed money transmitter, and failed to enforce proper Anti-Money Laundering procedures. As part of the deal, Zhao resigned from his role as Binance CEO and was later sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024. Binance stated on X that the latest joint motion was a “huge win for crypto” and thanked President Donald Trump and new SEC boss Paul Atkins “for pushing back against regulation by enforcement.” Since President Trump assumed office, the SEC has adopted a friendlier approach to the crypto industry, scrapping a slew of high-profile lawsuits and investigations against firms including Coinbase , Robinhood , Kraken, and Ripple , among others.",Cryptocurrency|News|Binance|Changpeng Zhao|SEC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-30 20:10:57

This shows that traditional finance is starting to accept blockchain-based assets. It also highlights a big change in how established financial institutions view digital currencies. Stripe Set to Revive Stablecoin Ambitions According to a Bloomberg report , Stripe is exploring ways to get more involved with stablecoins, cryptocurrencies linked to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. The goal is to speed up transactions, lower cross-border payment costs, and make accessing financial services easier for businesses worldwide. While there are no formal deals yet, the talk shows that stablecoins could play an important role in the future of global payments. Meanwhile, Stablecoins are becoming essential in fintech, with big companies like PayPal and Visa exploring their uses. If these partnerships succeed, it could help more businesses use stablecoins through Stripe’s large network , which includes millions of businesses in over 80 countries. Recall that the multinational financial firm led by Patrick and John Collison was rumored to have acquired stablecoin platform Bridge in a $1.1 billion deal. The timing of the rumored acquisition came after the payment firm shared plans to support global stablecoin payments. Stripe also took a major step by integrating Circle native tokens, USD Coin (USDC) , into its payment platform. Stablecoin Ecosystem Gains Traction and Forces Regulation The acceptance and use of stablecoins have been on the rise recently. With this increasing traction, the niche has grown to a valuation of $232.13 billion, per a report from Forbes. In light of the sentiments surrounding stablecoins, regulators have swung into action and drafted suitable regulatory frameworks to guide the sector. Two stablecoin regulatory proposals currently being considered are the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act . However, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has recently urged lawmakers to rethink the approach , citing that it is too strict. He believes that both bills will stifle the innovative and creative spirit in stablecoin providers. In other words, he said the bills will make it harder for stablecoin providers to innovate and create better user products. MiCA Reshapes Stablecoin Dynamics in Europe Meanwhile, the introduction of MiCA has been a game-changer for the stablecoin ecosystem in Europe. These regulations, governing asset-referenced and electronic money tokens, began their phased rollout in June 2024. As reported by TheCoinRise, euro-dominated trading volumes have consistently exceeded 2023 averages throughout 2024. MiCA-compliant stablecoins now dominate the European market. Circle’s EURC, Sociéte Générale’s EURCV, and Banking Circle’s EURI collectively accounted for 91% of market share by November 2024. This dramatic shift reflects the growing alignment between regulatory compliance and market adoption.

Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , has been a vocal critic of the president and becomes the latest of many from his party to probe details about the event, which they've called out as evidence of White House corruption. Because Raskin is in the minority party, his demands are unlikely to lead to further congressional action unless they regain the House or Senate in next year's elections. ""I write today to demand that you release the names of all the attendees at this dinner and provide information about the source of the money they each used to buy $TRUMP coins, so that we can prevent illegal foreign government emoluments from being pocketed without congressional consent,"" Raskin wrote this week to the president, joining many counterparts in the Senate in seeking the information, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We deserve to know who is paying for access to our president, and what steps you took to ensure that the funds you receive are legitimate and legal, rather than the proceeds from foreign states or monarchs or illegal activities,"" Rasking said, specifically highlighting Tron founder Justin Sun, a guest who was a major early investor in Trump's family crypto operations.

SHIB is currently trading at approximately $0.00001416, having experienced a 7.80% decline over the past week despite a modest 0.32% gain in the last 24 hours. This performance has prompted close examination of the token’s technical patterns, particularly in the context of its recent price behaviour. Support Zone Holds Through Multiple Tests The analyst emphasizes a recurring demand zone between $0.0000139 and $0.0000144, which has served as a stabilizing range over several trading sessions. SHIB is presently consolidating around the higher end of this band, suggesting that buyers are actively defending the zone. This area has previously functioned as a springboard for price increases. Notably, on May 17, SHIB approached $0.0000139 and proceeded to climb to $0.0000153 the following day. A retest at $0.0000138 on May 19 resulted in a further rally to $0.0000160 by May 23. After a pullback, the asset once again touched the lower boundary of this range on May 25 and has since been fluctuating within this tightly defined corridor. Technical Indicators Signal Neutral Conditions SwallowAcademy’s assessment incorporates multiple technical indicators. The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at roughly $0.00001427, while the 200-period EMA is estimated near $0.00001456. SHIB’s current trading level places it slightly below the 50 EMA and just under the 200 EMA. A confirmed breakout above these two moving averages may be viewed as a signal for a trend reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 46.92, just under the midline threshold of 50. This value implies that the token is neither in an overbought nor oversold state, a scenario often interpreted as neutral and conducive to accumulation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Projection and Potential Upside Based on the strength of the current support zone, SwallowAcademy forecasts the possibility of a price rebound . Should SHIB manage to capitalize on its base of support, the asset could realize gains between 10% and 20% from present levels. The analyst has identified $0.0000159 as a near-term price target, which corresponds to levels observed on May 23. If achieved, this would represent an increase of approximately 10.34% from the current market value. On-Chain Metrics Indicate Long-Term Confidence On-chain data from analytics firm IntoTheBlock lends further weight to the technical case. The number of long-term holders, defined as addresses holding SHIB for over a year, has increased by 0.84%. In contrast, there has been a decline in the number of medium- and short-term holders, with addresses in the 1–12 month range decreasing by 3.73%, and those under one month falling by 3.12%. This trend may suggest a shift in market sentiment, as investors increasingly adopt a long-term outlook while short-term speculative activity appears to be slowing. Such dynamics could reduce immediate selling pressure, helping to stabilize price action in the near term. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Amid this lull, attention pivots to Solana , stirring curiosity about its potential to ignite the next wave of altcoin momentum. Key insights into which cryptocurrencies might be poised for a breakout lie ahead in this analysis. Uptrend Sparks Debate: Ethereum’s Mixed Performance and Key Levels Ethereum advanced by 46.35% over one month while dropping 28.94% across six months. A one-week decline of 1.14% reflects volatile swings amid rising gains. Price moves have shown brisk rallies followed by marked pullbacks, painting a picture of uneven momentum. Recent behavior underscores a market that reacts sharply to news and liquidity shifts. Current price sits between $1468.66 and $2037.85, with a key support at $1142.44 and resistance at $2280.82. Bulls have pushed prices upward into a range with promise, yet bears lurk below support. Trading ideas suggest watching for a break above $2037.85 toward the next hurdle or a dip under $1142.44 to trigger caution. Solana Market Dynamics: Past Volatility and Today's Key Levels SOL experienced a 13.11% rise in the past month, contrasting with a significant 30.35% decline over the last six months. Price behavior suggests the coin undergoes brief rallies followed by steep pullbacks. The data indicates occasional recoveries, but the market remains under prolonged downward pressure, reflecting both bullish bursts and sustained bearish sentiment. Currently, trading is confined within a range of approximately $109 to $171, with resistance around $194.93 and support at $71.65. Market indicators show a slight short-term bearish bias after a nearly 7.8% weekly decline, despite hints of recovery over the month. Buyers may focus on support levels, while sellers eye resistance, waiting for clearer directional signals to materialize. Conclusion ETH is facing resistance below $3,000. Meanwhile, SOL shows potential for growth. Whether SOL alone can lead the market remains uncertain. The focus will stay on ETH and other coins to see which might drive the next significant move. Both ETH and SOL are critical to watch as their performance can influence the overall trend in the altcoin market. Investors will closely monitor developments to gauge future directions.

45303630,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738090,1748639519,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45303630.jpeg,"China is delaying rare earth mineral exports, breaking its Geneva trade deal with the US",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-china-deal-ruined-by-rare-earth-minerals/,"The fragile US-China trade agreement that was patched together earlier this month in Geneva is already on the edge of collapse, according to the Wall Street Journal. The sticking point? Rare earth minerals. The United States says China promised to resume exports of these critical resources in exchange for a 90-day pause on tariffs. But Beijing hasn’t kept that promise, and now tensions are rising fast. The agreement was struck after long negotiations between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng. In the final stretch of talks, the US made it clear: no rare earths, no truce. He agreed. Both sides then paused most of their tariffs, giving global investors something to breathe about. But it didn’t last. China delays export licenses after AI chip warning Since that Geneva meeting, China has continued to stall the approval process for export licenses tied to rare earth minerals and similar materials. These elements are used to build everything from cars to semiconductors. On Friday, President Donald Trump publicly accused China of backing out of its commitments. “China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” he wrote on Truth Social. Greer added that China was “slow-rolling” its side of the agreement and directly pointed to rare earths as the issue. The delay appears to have started shortly after the US Commerce Department issued a new warning on May 12. That warning told companies around the world to avoid using Huawei’s Ascend artificial intelligence chips, regardless of location. China didn’t take that lightly. Officials in Beijing saw it as a hostile move, and immediately raised complaints with Washington. Bessent’s team responded by saying the warning was just a continuation of existing US policy. But that didn’t calm Beijing. Instead, He and his team began stalling the rare earth approvals that were part of the Geneva deal. People briefed on the negotiations say Xi Jinping, China’s leader, hasn’t budged either. Some US automakers have already started raising red flags to the White House. They say that if the rare earth supply doesn’t resume soon, factories in the US could face pandemic-era style shutdowns. These minerals are baked into nearly every part of car production, and without them, assembly lines grind to a halt. Washington hits back with export controls and visa revocations In response to the stalled deal, the Trump administration has started tightening its own controls. The US has now imposed new limits on exports to China—especially targeting technology and software involved in producing C919 commercial airliners, a national priority project backed by Xi himself. Certain chip design software also falls under the restrictions. Meanwhile, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, issued a statement saying China has “repeatedly raised concerns” about US export controls in the tech sector. Liu added that China urges the US to “jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva.” Behind the scenes, Bessent told Fox News on Thursday that he believes it might take a direct call between Trump and Xi to salvage the deal. “I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other,” Bessent said. Trump himself confirmed he plans to speak with Xi, saying he hopes they can “work it out.” As backup, the White House is working on a Plan B for its trade war strategy, especially after a federal court ruling disrupted parts of Trump’s current tariff program. That court decision has weakened some of the tools Trump’s team was using in negotiations, so they’re looking for alternatives that don’t rely on those tariffs. And the pressure campaign doesn’t stop there. The US has also begun revoking student visas for Chinese nationals studying at American universities. Officials say it’s part of a broader effort to protect US innovation and prevent intellectual property theft. China’s Foreign Ministry called the move “politicized and discriminatory.” Chinese officials who were involved in the Geneva talks have said they’re still willing to keep the conversation going.

The company said in a statement regarding the attack that not only was the attempt unsuccessful, but also that important information was obtained by reverse engineering the mechanism behind the attack. BitMEX reported that the attack began when one of its employees received a proposal for a Web3 project on LinkedIn with the theme of “NFT Marketplace.” The aim was to infiltrate the system by convincing the employee to run a code containing malware. However, when the employee reviewed the code repository, he noticed suspicious statements and reported the situation to the BitMEX security team. The technical analysis revealed clues to the Lazarus Group’s tracking methods and operational vulnerabilities. BitMEX revealed that the attackers were attempting to reuse the malicious code called “BeaverTail”, which was previously attributed to Lazarus by Unit 42 of Palo Alto.

Here Are the Details The BitMEX team stated that the attack scenario was based on the goal of collecting user IP addresses and passwords and saving them in a database, but the attackers made an operational error and revealed the original IP addresses. In light of this information, special software was created and regular queries were sent to the database, and at least 10 of the test or development accounts used by the attackers were detected. BitMEX stated that they observed that the Lazarus Group was divided into subgroups with different technical competencies, and pointed out that although the basic phishing methods used in the campaign were weak, the subsequent attack processes were advanced. This development comes after Coinbase suffered a massive data breach a few weeks ago that could have potentially cost it $400 million. *This is not investment advice.

Japan’s Metaplanet just issued $21 million in zero-interest bonds to expand its Bitcoin holdings, now aiming for 10,000 BTC by 2025. With over 7,800 BTC already secured, Metaplanet has even surpassed El Salvador’s national reserve. This move isn’t just symbolic; it signals that digital assets are being institutionalized, reshaping how the market perceives long-term value in blockchain. The confidence is growing, and the clock is ticking for those still waiting on the sidelines. In this wave of rapid transformation, Qubetics ($TICS) stands apart—not just by raising over millions in its 36th presale stage, but by building real solutions where legacy blockchains fell short. With its advanced Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, deep cross-chain compatibility, and a design centered around usability, Qubetics isn’t following trends—it’s setting them. While Bitcoin is becoming a digital reserve, Qubetics is becoming the infrastructure for interaction, placing it at the top for anyone searching for the best crypto to buy right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Functionality with Practical Utility Qubetics is a next-gen blockchain platform focused on solving real-world inefficiencies through a seamless digital experience. One of its most revolutionary tools is its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, allowing for secure, real-time access to multiple blockchains—without relying on centralized exchanges or intermediaries. It’s a frictionless solution designed for both scalability and sovereignty, and it’s already catching attention from technically inclined participants and those navigating complex multi-chain ecosystems. Seamlessly managing DeFi yield pools on one blockchain, while trading NFTs on another—all from the same wallet interface. Smart contract execution, token swaps, and asset management flow smoothly between networks, removing the fragmentation and friction often associated with Web3 usability. In high-stakes scenarios such as managing liquidity across chains or avoiding bridge risks, the wallet serves as a direct answer to usability barriers that once stalled growth. This is not theoretical: Qubetics has raised over $17.5 million, sold more than 514 million tokens, and reached over 27,300 token holders in its 36th stage crypto presale . The current token price is $0.3064, and projections based on $TICS hitting $1 to $15 post-launch translate to ROI potentials between 226% and 4,795%. The numbers speak clearly—and that’s why it’s being listed among the best crypto to buy right now. For those looking at crypto presales with high conviction and real tech, Qubetics is a standout. Cronos (CRO): Market Confidence Wanes as Price Dips Below $0.10 Cronos, the EVM-compatible blockchain developed by Crypto.com, was once considered a prime DeFi destination thanks to its low fees and fast finality. However, the current momentum tells another story. The live price sits at $0.092159, down 6.05% in the last 24 hours, signaling hesitancy among participants and developers alike. Even with a daily volume of $27 million, traction appears to be slowing. As community members weigh their options for the best crypto to buy right now, Cronos is facing an uphill battle. Without delivering a new wave of utility or user experience improvements, it may find itself outpaced by more agile competitors offering what users need, now. Cosmos (ATOM): Inter-Chain Giant Faces Fresh Market Scrutiny Cosmos has long been praised for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. Through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, it enables sovereign chains to communicate and transact securely. But performance isn’t always enough to carry momentum. At a live price of $4.47 and a 7.16% decline in the past 24 hours, Cosmos is under increased scrutiny from participants seeking more user-centric and modern blockchain solutions. Even with a daily volume of $130 million, Cosmos must innovate faster to maintain its spot in future-forward portfolios. Community sentiment is shifting toward utility-rich, ROI-viable chains, and that spotlight is increasingly falling on projects offering more seamless integrations and scalable usability—hallmarks of the best crypto to buy right now. Institutional Signals and Market Timing: Why the Next Move Matters Metaplanet’s bold capital move—raising $21 million to acquire more Bitcoin—has done more than make headlines. It has validated the long-term staying power of blockchain-backed assets. This matters deeply for emerging projects. When major institutions adopt digital assets as strategic reserves, attention flows to the tools and platforms that can sustain those assets’ usability. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) comes in—not just as a currency but as infrastructure enabling the decentralized economy’s growth. As markets shift and large players like Metaplanet raise stakes in Bitcoin, the ripple effects reach all corners of the ecosystem. Blockchains like Cronos and Cosmos must evolve rapidly or risk stagnation. Meanwhile, Qubetics has emerged at the perfect inflection point—presale still open, infrastructure tested, and multi-chain wallet adoption surging. For participants evaluating timing, utility, and long-term traction, the signals are clear. The path forward rewards readiness, not hesitation. When infrastructure meets purpose, opportunity follows. Right now, Qubetics is leading that equation. Conclusion: The Real Utility Behind the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now As institutions like Metaplanet strategically inject capital into Bitcoin, it becomes increasingly clear that digital assets are moving beyond speculation and into structured financial ecosystems. This momentum creates a ripple effect, drawing attention toward blockchain projects that prioritize usability, cross-chain functionality, and long-term adoption. Among them, Qubetics ($TICS) is rapidly emerging as the best crypto to buy right now , not just for its impressive presale metrics, but for offering infrastructure that solves real challenges. While Cronos and Cosmos wrestle with performance dips and user engagement hurdles, Qubetics is delivering exactly what the market demands—secure, interoperable tools that streamline interaction across networks. Qubetics stands at the forefront of meaningful blockchain innovation. For those seeking not just potential returns but real-world relevance, this is where the smart money is heading. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is driving Qubetics ($TICS) presale momentum? Its real-world utility, non-custodial wallet, and interoperability features are capturing strong support, with over $17.5 million raised. How is Metaplanet’s $21M Bitcoin purchase relevant to new crypto projects? It signals deep institutional confidence in digital assets, driving attention to infrastructure tokens like $TICS that support real-world functionality. Why are Qubetics, Cronos, and Cosmos being compared now? Because their current activity reflects how the market is distinguishing utility-led projects from those with legacy features and slowing innovation.

SEC Offers Clarity on Staking Services In the statement , the federal regulator claims that several staking activities—including ancillary staking services, Proof-of-Stake Networks, and third-party service providers—do not constitute securities transactions. https://t.co/qT7IIuJgBf | Statement on Certain Protocol Staking Activities https://t.co/dZkS5uZGZd — Mike Selig (@MikeSeligEsq) May 29, 2025 “It is the Division’s view that ‘Protocol Staking Activities’ (as defined below) in connection with Protocol Staking do not involve the offer and sale of securities,” the statement reads in part. “Accordingly, it is the Division’s view that participants in Protocol Staking Activities do not need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act, or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration in connection with these Protocol Staking Activities.” Commissioner Peirce Applauds SEC Staking Stance Following the news, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw and Hester Peirce released statements of their own about the crypto guidance . Peirce celebrated the decision in a May 29 commentary, saying prior regulatory uncertainty on staking “constrained participation in network consensus and undermined the decentralization, censorship resistance, and credible neutrality of proof-of-stake blockchains.” “Today’s statement provides welcome clarity for stakeholders and ‘staking-as-a-service’ providers in the United States,” she said. However, Democratic Commissioner Crenshaw slammed the SEC’s latest guidance, saying the agency’s statement on the matter ignores “how its conclusions conflict with that applicable law.” “This is yet another example of the SEC’s ongoing ‘fake it till we make it’ approach to crypto—taking action based on anticipation of future changes while ignoring existing law,” Crenshaw said. “I continue to believe that these staff statements do more harm than good by purporting to carve out broad categories of crypto products without analyzing the realities of how they really work,” she added. “These statements paint an incomplete picture that obfuscates, rather than clarifies, what the law is.” The post SEC Staking Shake-Up: Agency Says Proof-of-Stake Isn’t a Securities Deal – What It Means Now appeared first on Cryptonews .",Crypto Regulation News|News|Proof-of-stake|SEC|Staking,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-30 21:25:39

The downturn began during late U.S. trading hours, following remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent , which confirmed a stall in trade discussions with China.

According to the analyst, this prolonged accumulation phase may be setting the stage for a significant breakout. The chart, as highlighted in the post, is beginning to show encouraging signs of bullish pressure. With price tightening near key resistance levels, the conditions appear ripe for a potential upward surge, provided that buying momentum continues to build. Key Technical Levels In Sight As Uniswap Gathers Strength First1Bitcoin highlighted several critical technical levels that could shape Uniswap’s next major move. He noted that the current price of UNI moved back $6.83, reflecting a market that’s gradually gathering momentum after a prolonged period of consolidation. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Blastoff At Hand? The Sleeping Giant Awakens At $4.6 Support The analyst placed strong emphasis on two critical price levels that could shape UNI’s trajectory in the coming weeks. The first breakout target is set at $12, a level that stands as both a psychological barrier and a technical milestone. If Uniswap breaks above this zone, it could ignite fresh bullish sentiment and potentially mark the beginning of a sustained upward move. However, the real test comes at the $15 – $16 resistance zone, which the analyst described as a major obstacle. A move into this region could trigger heightened volatility, as many traders may look to secure profits while others gauge the strength of buyer conviction. Importantly, Uniswap remains below its long-term downtrend line, which has acted as a ceiling for upward movement over the past several months. A breakout above that trendline could change the game entirely, opening the door for a much larger rally. Momentum Builds On A Firm Foundation In his concluding statement, the analyst emphasized growing optimism surrounding UNI’s price action. He noted that the accumulation base, where buyers have been steadily building positions, continues to hold firm, acting as a solid foundation for potential upside movement. This resilience suggests that sellers are losing control, and the market may be primed for a bullish shift. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) In Trouble? Price Crash Below $6.7 Signals Bigger Problems He further highlighted early signs of bullish momentum, with improving technical indicators and price stability suggesting increasing buying interest. This momentum, combined with the prolonged consolidation phase, often precedes a significant breakout. “Watch this zone closely,” the analyst advised, hinting that UNI could be on the verge of a strong rally. If the token maintains its current support and gains upward traction, it may break through key resistance levels and initiate a meaningful uptrend in the sessions ahead.

Just as advancements impact areas like cryptocurrency and blockchain, they are also changing everyday tools we rely on. A significant update is rolling out that puts Gemini , Google’s AI assistant, more prominently into your inbox, a change that reflects the pervasive nature of AI integration across platforms. What Are Gemini AI Email Summaries? Google is introducing email summary cards powered by Gemini directly at the top of your email threads in Gmail . Previously, users had the option to tap a button to get an AI summary of a long email conversation. While that manual option still exists, the key change now is that Gemini will automatically generate these summaries when it deems necessary, without requiring you to initiate the action. This new feature is designed to save you time by providing a quick overview of lengthy emails or threads. As new replies arrive, the summary is intended to update, keeping the synopsis current. It’s an evolution of the capabilities first seen when Gemini launched in the Gmail side panel last year, which included tools for drafting emails and suggesting responses. Potential Challenges with AI Summaries While the convenience of automatic Email Summaries is clear, the reliability of AI -generated content has been a subject of discussion. There have been instances where AI summaries have proven inaccurate or misleading. For example, when Apple implemented AI summaries for app notifications, reports indicated the feature made errors, particularly with news headlines. This led to Apple temporarily pausing the feature for news apps. Google’s own AI Overviews in Search have also faced scrutiny for occasionally providing incorrect or poor-quality information. This history highlights the importance of exercising caution and potentially cross-referencing information provided by automatic AI summaries, especially for critical communications. Managing Gemini’s Automatic Summaries in Gmail Recognizing user preferences, Google provides options for managing this new feature. The automatic summary cards are initially available for emails in English. Whether the feature is turned on by default depends on your region. For instance, in the EU, the UK, Switzerland, and Japan, Google’s ‘smart features’, which include these summaries, are turned off by default. Users in other regions may find them enabled automatically. Regardless of the default setting, users can choose to enable or disable the automatic Email Summaries feature. This can typically be done within the ‘Smart features’ section of your Gmail Settings. For those using Gmail through a workplace account, administrators also have the option to disable personalization settings for users via the Admin console, offering a layer of control at the organizational level. This update is a prime example of how quickly AI is being integrated into the software and services people use daily. Understanding these rapid technological shifts is valuable not just for managing your inbox, but for navigating the broader digital landscape that includes areas like cryptocurrency and other emerging tech fields. Events like Bitcoin World Sessions: AI highlight the growing intersection of these advanced technologies. Conclusion The introduction of automatic Gemini -powered Email Summaries in Gmail marks another step in the integration of AI into everyday digital tools. While offering potential benefits in terms of convenience and time-saving, it also underscores the ongoing need to be aware of the limitations and potential inaccuracies of AI technologies. Fortunately, Google has provided users with the ability to control this feature through settings, allowing individuals to decide if this automatic assistance fits their workflow.

The company recently introduced a range of products related to stablecoins, including a platform (Bridge) that allows fintechs to launch their own stablecoin-linked card programs for customers. Collison’s remarks confirmed the rising interest among traditional financial institutions in exploring stablecoins, one of the fastest-growing crypto use cases. He claimed that his company aimed to fix what traditional financial institutions did not have: slow and costly cross-border payments.

Bridge has since then rolled out its own stablecoin, USDB, while Stripe introduced stablecoin accounts in over 100 countries. Collison said a lot of his company’s future payment volume would be in stablecoins, pointing to costly FX fees and multi-day processing times as pain points that stablecoins could address. Bank technology providers like Fidelity National Information Services Inc., Fiserv Inc., and Jack Henry & Associates Inc. were also considering how to help their customers use the technology. Visa Inc. launched a platform last year to help banks issue stablecoins globally. “Regulated bank-issued stablecoins offer faster, more efficient, and globally accessible payment options…With proper regulation, banks will become central players in digital assets, driving innovation while ensuring consumer protection.” – Julia Demidova , head of digital currencies product and strategy at FIS Collison hoped that Stripe’s new products would “eat away” at the FX fees that banks and other technology providers charged consumers sending money overseas. He added that traditional money remittance technologies were also very slow. Stablecoin payment volume reaches $94B A survey by Artemis found that stablecoin payment volumes have reached $94.3 billion this year, primarily driven by Business-to-business (B2B) transfers. B2B transactions accounted for an annual run rate of $36 billion, and P2P payments had a run rate of $18 billion. Card-linked stablecoin payments followed with $13.2 billion in annual volume, while B2C payments and prefunding had annual volumes of $3.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. The annual run rate pace for these settlements reached $72.3 billion in February 2025. The report also revealed that B2B stablecoin monthly volumes grew from under $100 million at the start of 2023 to over $3 billion by early 2025. Stablecoin-linked card payments also rose from $250 million in monthly volume at the start of 2023 to over $1 billion by the end of 2024. B2C payments increased from $50 million in monthly volume at the start of 2023 to over $300 million by early 2025. According to the study, approximately 10 million blockchain addresses made a stablecoin transaction every day, and over 150 million blockchain addresses held a nonzero stablecoin balance. Tether’s USDT was the most used stablecoin by volume, with a market share of around 90%, followed by Circle’s USDC. USDT remained the primary stablecoin for B2B transfers, although USDC maintained a 30% share of monthly volumes. The BIS also estimated that around $400 billion of annual cross-border flows were settled in USDC and USDT.

This triggered a significant decline over the past week and now appears highly bearish amid the latest breakdown. Considered as one of the most recovered assets during the last buying phase, Fartcoin recorded a mind-blowing gain and reached its highest level of $1.6 for the first time in four months. While that brought a good return on investment within a short period, major holders booked profits, and the price slipped. That action led to a steady dump as Bitcoin loses traction this week, and the price dipped to a daily low of $1.08. There’s hope for a rebound daily as the trend remains in favour of the bulls in the short term. However, looking at the recent breakdown in the bullish structure on the 4-hour chart, the trading landscape appears to have changed in favour of bears. As we can see on the daily chart, they are currently in charge of the market. In fact, more dips may surface with no signs of interceptions. Technically, the bulls are currently off the market. If they return with a major push above the current monthly high, we can anticipate another rally to a new multi-month high. But for now, they are taking a break. FARTCOIN’s Key Levels to Watch Source : Tradingview A slight price recovery may bring a retest at the breakdown level of $1.2 before resuming selling. If the market pushes above this level, it may reclaim the $1.646 resistance with a potential break up to $2 and $2.74. The target support levels to watch in the latest dip are $0.95 and $0.645.

These zero-coupon bonds, known as the 17th series, come with a $525,000 face value and are set to mature on November 28, 2025. As they bear no interest, Metaplanet avoids additional financial costs tied to borrowing. Metaplanet Adds to Bitcoin Warchest According to the official document , the terms allow Evo Fund to initiate early redemptions with a five-day notice, either in full or in multiples of $525,000. Additionally, redemptions may be linked to future funding rounds with the same investor. The bonds are unsecured, with no guarantees or administrators, which is in line with Japanese corporate law. Payment processing will take place at the company’s Tokyo office. This fundraising effort contributes to Metaplanet’s larger goal of amassing 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Year-to-date, the company has raised $135.2 million, including previous rounds in February ($25.9 million), March ($13.3 million), and earlier in May ($25 million). Currently holding approximately 7,800 BTC, worth around $840 million, Metaplanet ranks 11th among global corporate Bitcoin holders, with an average purchase price of $91,340 per BTC. In March, it used cash-secured put options to acquire 696 BTC, followed by an additional 145 BTC in April for $13.6 million. Metaplanet isn’t the only company doubling down on Bitcoin. In Scandinavia, K33 is taking a similar approach. K33 Joins Corporate Bitcoin Trend K33, the Oslo-based cryptocurrency brokerage company, announced plans to begin holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet after raising 60 million SEK ($6.22 million). As per the announcement on May 28th, the funding was secured via interest-free convertible loans and a new round of share and warrant issuances. The Norwegian firm confirmed that 100% of the funds will be used to buy Bitcoin, possibly acquiring up to 57 BTC at current prices. The firm secured 45 million SEK ($4.66 million) through loans maturing in June 2028, and 15 million SEK ($1.5 million) via equity and warrants. Investors converting their warrants before March 2026 will be granted additional free warrants, which would potentially allow K33 to raise a total of 75 million SEK ($7.77 million).

It’s true, and according to a fascinating Citigroup stablecoin report , the growing influence of stablecoins is having a significant impact on treasury bill demand . This trend highlights the increasing integration between the crypto market and traditional financial systems. Understanding Stablecoins and Their Role in Finance Before we dive into the specifics of the Citigroup stablecoin report , let’s quickly recap what stablecoins are and why they matter. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to provide a reliable store of value and medium of exchange within the digital asset space. Their stability makes them essential for various activities within the crypto market , including: Trading pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT) Lending and borrowing protocols Payments and remittances Yield farming and other DeFi applications This widespread use within the crypto ecosystem is the primary driver behind their significant stablecoin growth over the past few years. But their influence isn’t confined to the digital realm anymore. The Direct Link: Stablecoin Reserves and Treasury Bill Demand So, how do stablecoins connect to traditional finance, specifically U.S. Treasury bills? The answer lies in how stablecoin issuers maintain their peg. To ensure stability and allow users to redeem their stablecoins for the pegged fiat currency at any time, issuers hold reserves. Historically, these reserves included a mix of assets like cash, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and government debt. However, driven by a desire for greater transparency, security, and regulatory clarity (especially after events like the Terra/Luna collapse), there’s been a significant shift towards holding highly liquid and low-risk assets. Short-term U.S. Treasury bills fit this criteria perfectly. Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term debt obligations of the U.S. government with maturities ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. They are considered among the safest and most liquid investments globally. Stablecoin issuers are increasingly parking their reserve funds in these instruments because they offer: Safety: Backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Liquidity: Easily bought and sold in large volumes. Yield: Provide a return, albeit typically modest, on the reserve assets. As the market capitalization and usage of stablecoins grow, the volume of reserves required by issuers also increases. A substantial portion of these growing reserves is being allocated to T-bills, directly fueling treasury bill demand in the traditional financial markets. Key Takeaways from the Citigroup Stablecoin Report The recent Citigroup stablecoin report , as cited by CoinDesk, provides valuable insights into this developing trend. The bank’s analysis underscores the increasingly important role stablecoins play across both the crypto market impact and traditional finance. Here are some key points highlighted in the report: Growing Influence: Stablecoins are no longer just a niche crypto tool; their expanding use cases are giving them a noticeable footprint in broader financial systems. Driving T-Bill Demand: The report explicitly states that growing stablecoin usage is fueling demand for short-term U.S. Treasuries. This confirms the direct link we discussed. Future Market Size Projections: Citi offered a compelling projection for future stablecoin growth , estimating the market could reach a massive $1.6 trillion to $3.7 trillion by 2030. This potential growth trajectory implies a proportionally large increase in required reserve assets, further boosting potential treasury bill demand . Regulatory Considerations: The report didn’t just offer bullish projections; it also included important caveats. Regulatory constraints, such as potential limitations on the types of assets stablecoin issuers can hold or restrictions on earning yield from reserves, could potentially cap or influence the pace of this growth. This ties directly into the theme of digital asset regulation . Broader Monetary System Insights: Perhaps most interestingly, the report notes that stablecoin issuance patterns offer insights into broader shifts happening within the global monetary system, suggesting that these digital assets are becoming indicators of larger financial trends. Projected Stablecoin Growth and Its Implications for Treasuries Citi’s projection of a $1.6 trillion to $3.7 trillion stablecoin market by 2030 is significant. To put this into perspective, even the lower end of this range represents a substantial increase from the current market size (which fluctuates but is well under $200 billion as of late 2023/early 2024). If a significant portion of these reserves continues to be held in U.S. Treasuries, the impact on the market for short-term government debt could become even more pronounced. Consider this simple hypothetical: If the stablecoin market reaches $2 trillion and 80% of reserves are held in U.S. Treasuries, that’s $1.6 trillion invested in Treasuries just from stablecoins. This volume is comparable to or even exceeds the holdings of some large traditional institutional investors or even some central banks. This increased and potentially sustained demand from stablecoin issuers can influence the dynamics of the Treasury market, potentially affecting yields and liquidity for other market participants. The Interplay of Digital Asset Regulation and Stablecoin Reserves The future trajectory of stablecoin growth and its impact on treasury bill demand is heavily intertwined with digital asset regulation . Policymakers globally, and particularly in the U.S. where the dominant stablecoins are dollar-pegged, are actively considering how to regulate stablecoins. One key area of focus is reserve requirements. Proposed legislation often includes strict rules on the composition of stablecoin reserves, frequently mandating that they be held in highly liquid assets like cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. government securities (Treasury bills, notes, and bonds with short maturities). If such legislation passes, it would likely accelerate the trend of stablecoin issuers holding Treasuries, potentially increasing treasury bill demand even further. However, regulations could also introduce complexities, such as rules around who can hold reserves, where they must be held, and whether issuers can earn yield on these reserves (as mentioned in the Citi report as a potential constraint). The regulatory environment will shape not just the safety of stablecoins but also their operational models and their relationship with traditional financial markets. Challenges and Opportunities Arising from Stablecoin Growth While the link between stablecoin growth and treasury bill demand presents interesting dynamics, it also brings both challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Lack of clear, harmonized global regulation remains a significant challenge for stablecoin issuers and the broader crypto market . Concentration Risk: A large, concentrated holding of Treasuries by a few major stablecoin issuers could potentially pose systemic risks if not properly managed or regulated. Yield Limitations: As noted by Citi, regulations limiting the ability to earn yield on reserves could impact the business model of stablecoin issuers and potentially slow growth or shift strategies. Market Volatility Spillover: Although stablecoins aim for stability, extreme stress in the broader crypto market impact could theoretically lead to large-scale redemptions, forcing rapid selling of reserve assets and potentially impacting Treasury market liquidity, though this risk is generally considered low for highly liquid T-bills under normal circumstances. Opportunities: Enhanced Financial Stability: Mandating high-quality reserves like Treasuries can make stablecoins inherently safer and more reliable. Increased Market Efficiency: Stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more accessible transactions globally, bridging gaps between traditional and digital finance. Greater Integration: The growing connection via Treasury holdings represents a concrete link between the crypto market and traditional finance, fostering greater understanding and potential for future collaboration. Validation of Digital Assets: The acceptance and integration of stablecoins into traditional financial plumbing, even through reserve holdings, lends credibility to the broader ecosystem of digital assets . Actionable Insights for Investors and Policymakers What does this mean for you, whether you’re involved in the crypto market , traditional finance, or policymaking? For Crypto Participants: Understand the reserve composition of the stablecoins you use. Increased regulatory clarity around reserves is a positive sign for the long-term health and stability of the stablecoin ecosystem. For Traditional Finance Participants: Recognize stablecoins as a new, albeit non-traditional, source of demand for short-term government debt. This is a tangible example of how digital assets are beginning to interact with established markets. Pay attention to the Citigroup stablecoin report and similar analyses for insights into this evolving landscape. For Policymakers: The growing link necessitates thoughtful and clear digital asset regulation . Rules around stablecoin reserves are crucial for mitigating potential risks while allowing for innovation and continued stablecoin growth . Conclusion: Stablecoins – A Bridge Building Demand The narrative is clear: stablecoins, initially conceived as stable units for the volatile crypto market , are increasingly acting as a significant bridge to traditional finance. As the Citigroup stablecoin report highlights, their impressive stablecoin growth is directly translating into increased treasury bill demand , making them notable players in the market for government debt. While challenges related to digital asset regulation and market dynamics remain, the potential for stablecoins to reach multi-trillion-dollar valuations by 2030 underscores their potential to become even more influential. This trend is a powerful illustration of how the lines between digital and traditional finance are blurring, driven by the practical needs of a rapidly evolving digital economy.

This perspective, emerging from within China, a nation known for its stringent stance on decentralized cryptocurrencies, is particularly noteworthy. According to information shared by Solid Intel on X, the think tank’s assessment suggests that Bitcoin “deserves continued attention” in the context of reserve assets, especially amidst ongoing concerns about the pervasive influence and potential risks associated with the US Dollar ‘s hegemony. Why Would a Chinese Think Tank Look at Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset? Understanding the significance of this perspective requires looking at the traditional role of reserve assets and the current global financial landscape. Traditionally, national central banks and governments hold reserve assets to provide economic stability, manage exchange rates, and ensure liquidity in times of crisis. Gold has historically served this purpose, and more recently, the US Dollar has become the preeminent global reserve currency, largely due to the size and stability of the U.S. economy, the depth of its financial markets, and the dollar’s role in international trade. However, the concentration of global finance around a single currency, the US Dollar , also creates dependencies and potential vulnerabilities for other nations. Discussions around ‘de-dollarization’ – efforts by countries to reduce their reliance on the dollar – have been gaining traction, particularly among nations seeking greater economic autonomy or those with geopolitical tensions with the United States. For a Chinese Think Tank , exploring alternatives or complements to the existing dollar-centric system is a strategic consideration. While China has been actively promoting its own currency, the Yuan, for international use and developing its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan, looking at independent, decentralized assets like Bitcoin , albeit cautiously, suggests an exploration of all potential avenues in a complex geopolitical and economic environment. Is Bitcoin Truly a Viable Countermeasure Against US Dollar Hegemony? This is where the think tank’s view becomes particularly intriguing and sparks considerable debate. The idea of Bitcoin challenging the US Dollar ‘s global status is a long-term, highly speculative prospect. The US Dollar ‘s dominance is deeply entrenched in global trade, debt markets, and institutional frameworks built over decades. However, Bitcoin possesses unique characteristics that proponents argue could, over time, offer an alternative: decentralization (no single country controls it), scarcity (capped supply of 21 million coins), borderlessness, and censorship resistance. These traits stand in stark contrast to fiat currencies controlled by central banks. The think tank’s perspective likely isn’t suggesting an immediate replacement of the US Dollar with Bitcoin . Instead, it’s more probable they are evaluating Bitcoin as one piece in a broader strategy: As a Hedge: Holding a small portion of reserves in a non-sovereign, decentralized asset could potentially act as a hedge against risks specific to fiat currencies or the existing financial system. As an Alternative System Explorer: Investigating how a decentralized digital currency could function in international transactions or as a store of value outside traditional channels. As a Geopolitical Signal: Even the discussion from a state-affiliated body sends a signal about exploring options and acknowledging the evolving nature of global finance, potentially encouraging other nations or entities to consider alternatives to the US Dollar . It’s crucial to note the significant challenges Bitcoin faces before it could realistically challenge the US Dollar ‘s role, including its price volatility, scalability issues for mass transactions, regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions, and the sheer network effect and infrastructure supporting the dollar. China’s Complex Relationship with Digital Currency China’s stance on cryptocurrencies has been famously contradictory. On one hand, the country has implemented strict bans on crypto trading and mining, citing financial stability risks and speculative concerns. This has led many to believe China is outright against decentralized digital assets. On the other hand, China has been a pioneer in developing its own central bank digital currency , the Digital Yuan (e-CNY). This state-controlled digital currency is designed to replace physical cash, enhance domestic payments, and potentially facilitate international transactions under Beijing’s purview. The focus has clearly been on centralized digital money controlled by the state, not decentralized ones like Bitcoin . The fact that a government-affiliated Chinese Think Tank is discussing Bitcoin positively, even as a potential reserve asset or countermeasure, highlights a potential internal nuance or a strategic exploration happening behind the scenes. It suggests that while China suppresses public crypto activity, the strategic implications of decentralized digital assets are still being studied at higher levels, perhaps as a tool in geopolitical and economic strategy rather than a public investment vehicle. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset? Let’s break down the potential upsides and significant hurdles: Potential Benefits: Decentralization: Not controlled by any single government or central bank, offering potential independence from geopolitical influence. Scarcity: Fixed supply makes it potentially inflation-resistant over the long term, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed infinitely. Border-Agnostic: Can be sent and received globally without intermediaries, potentially useful for international transfers or bypassing traditional financial channels. Transparency (Pseudonymous): Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, offering a different type of transparency compared to traditional finance. Significant Challenges: Volatility: Extreme price swings make it a risky store of value for national reserves which prioritize stability. Regulatory Uncertainty: Lack of clear, consistent global regulations creates legal and operational risks for state adoption. Scalability: The network’s current capacity limits its use for high-frequency, large-volume transactions needed for global finance. Security & Custody: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin is complex and high-stakes for a nation-state. Energy Consumption: The energy used by the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism remains a point of criticism and environmental concern. Public Perception & Understanding: Still viewed with skepticism by many traditional finance experts and the general public. What Does This Signal for the Future of Digital Currency and Global Finance? This report from a Chinese Think Tank , while not official government policy, is a significant signal. It indicates that major global powers are seriously considering the implications of decentralized digital currency , even those like China that have been publicly restrictive towards it. It suggests that the conversation around global reserve assets and the future of finance is evolving beyond traditional fiat and gold. While Bitcoin replacing the US Dollar as the primary reserve asset is not on the immediate horizon, the fact that influential bodies are evaluating its potential role, even as a hedge or a component of a diversified reserve strategy, validates its growing importance on the global stage. It reinforces the narrative that digital assets are not just speculative investments but are becoming intertwined with geopolitical and macroeconomic discussions. For investors and observers in the crypto space, this serves as a reminder that the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin extends beyond retail speculation to potential strategic adoption by sophisticated players, including nation-states or state-affiliated entities exploring alternatives in a shifting world order. Conclusion: A Noteworthy Shift in Perspective The evaluation of Bitcoin by a Chinese government-affiliated think tank as deserving attention for its potential role as a reserve asset and a countermeasure against US Dollar hegemony is a development of considerable interest. It highlights the strategic thinking occurring within major global powers regarding the future of finance and the role of decentralized digital currency . While China’s official stance on public crypto remains restrictive and its focus is heavily on the Digital Yuan, this report suggests a deeper, more nuanced internal analysis of Bitcoin ‘s potential utility in a geopolitical context. It underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin ‘s unique properties, even as significant challenges remain for its widespread adoption as a national reserve asset. This perspective from a Chinese Think Tank adds another layer to the ongoing global debate about de-dollarization, the future of reserve currencies, and the transformative potential of digital assets in shaping the financial landscape of tomorrow. It’s a signal that the conversation around Bitcoin is moving from the fringes into the realm of high-level strategic consideration.

Trading volumes have gone up by nearly 43% and are currently nearing the $1 billion mark for Cardano, emphasizing that the selling spree might be gaining traction. The market was spooked by a new piece of legislation that has already moved forward within the House of Representatives called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” This new law imposes high taxes on foreign-held U.S. investments and “weaponizes” the country’s capital markets according to analysts. It would make it more expensive for foreign investors to participate in the U.S. markets if passed. Despite these headwinds, ADA whales seem to have taken advantage of the latest pullback to buy a large amount of the token. Whales have bought over 180 million #Cardano $ADA in just the past week! pic.twitter.com/hOmii47pKo — Ali (@ali_charts) May 29, 2025 The popular crypto trader Ali Martinez shared on X recently that whales bought more than 180 million ADA tokens worth approximately $13 million last week. This indicates accumulation by the market’s “smart money” and supports a bullish Cardano price forecast . Cardano Price Prediction: Late Buyers Can Take Advantage of an Upcoming ADA Drop The daily chart shows that ADA has broken its trend line support recently as a result of a 4-day losing streak. However, the price action will likely retest this line from below, meaning that ADA could recover to at least $0.7500 in the near term. If that retest confirms the trend line break and the price fails to jump back above this line, it could result in a significant decline toward the $0.50 area. Whale activity typically supports a bullish Cardano price prediction. Hence, this decline could be a good opportunity to buy ADA at a lower price. This kind of setback allows late buyers to enter the rally at a much lower price. Hence, as new money and ‘dry powder’ enter the scene, the next leg up for ADA could push the token to higher highs, meaning a potential push to $1. In the meantime, the best crypto presales of the year like SUBBD (SUBBD) offer significant upside potential to early buyers as their tokens are sold at a heavily discounted price ahead of exchange listings and public launches. SUBBD (SUBBD) Surpasses $500K Mark to Create a Better Home for Content Creators SUBBD (SUBBD) is a decentralized content distribution platform that offers a better deal to influencers and significant benefits to fans. Since its presale event kicked off in early April, the project has raised more than $500,000 to polish its user interface and back-end systems.

According to information shared by Watcher Guru on X, the company is set to make a massive Bitcoin acquisition, signaling a bold new direction for its treasury management strategy. What Does This $2.32 Billion Trump Media Bitcoin Deal Mean? The core of the news revolves around a reported agreement valued at an astonishing $2.32 billion . Under this deal, Trump Media is said to be purchasing Bitcoin with the explicit intention of holding it as a Treasury Asset . This move places DJT in a growing, albeit still small, group of publicly traded companies opting to allocate a portion of their corporate reserves into the leading cryptocurrency. For context, corporate treasury management traditionally involves holding low-risk, liquid assets like cash, short-term government bonds, or commercial paper. The decision to swap a substantial amount of capital for a volatile asset like Bitcoin is a significant departure from conventional practices. Key aspects of this reported deal include: Scale: The sheer size of the investment ($2.32 billion) is noteworthy, positioning it as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin acquisitions reported to date, potentially rivaling or exceeding holdings of other publicly known corporate holders depending on the exact terms and timing. Purpose: Holding Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset implies a long-term strategy, viewing BTC not just as a speculative trade but as a store of value or hedge against inflation, similar to how some view gold. Source: The report originated from Watcher Guru on X, a popular source for crypto news and market updates. While widely reported, official confirmation from Trump Media itself is the definitive next step that stakeholders will be watching for. Why Would Trump Media Consider a Crypto Investment Like Bitcoin? The decision for a company like Trump Media to engage in a large-scale Crypto Investment , specifically in Bitcoin, could be driven by several factors: Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically shown significant price appreciation over the long term, despite considerable volatility. A company might see this as an opportunity to grow its treasury reserves beyond the modest returns offered by traditional safe-haven assets. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Bitcoin is often touted as ‘digital gold’ and a potential hedge against inflation dueating to its fixed supply cap (21 million coins). In an era of quantitative easing and potential currency devaluation concerns, holding a non-sovereign, scarce asset could be appealing. Attracting a Specific Investor Base: Trump Media’s platform, Truth Social, caters to a specific audience. Given the growing interest in cryptocurrency among various demographics, including those politically aligned, a move into Bitcoin could resonate with and potentially attract investors interested in both the company and the crypto space. Following Corporate Trends: While not mainstream, companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a potential blueprint for other corporations. This could signal confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability as a corporate asset. What are the Potential Challenges and Risks for DJT Stock and Bitcoin? While the potential upsides are clear, holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset comes with significant risks that could impact DJT Stock and the company’s financial stability: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods. A significant downturn could rapidly diminish the value of Trump Media’s treasury holdings, potentially impacting its balance sheet and investor confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains evolving and fragmented across different jurisdictions. Future regulations could impact the value, liquidity, or even the legality of holding Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires sophisticated security measures to protect against hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. A security breach could result in the total loss of the invested capital. Accounting and Reporting Challenges: Accounting for volatile digital assets like Bitcoin can be complex and subject to specific rules (like FASB’s recent standard requiring fair-value accounting), which can introduce volatility into reported earnings. Public Perception: While appealing to some, a large Crypto Investment could alienate more conservative investors who prefer traditional, stable treasury management practices. How Does This Compare to Other Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? Trump Media’s reported $2.32 billion investment would place it among the top publicly traded companies by Bitcoin holdings. Here’s a simplified comparison (figures are approximate and subject to change based on market price and ongoing acquisitions): Company Approximate BTC Holdings (as of relevant reports) Reported Trump Media Holding MicroStrategy (MSTR) ~214,400 BTC ~ $2.32 Billion Worth of BTC (Exact amount depends on purchase price) Marathon Digital (MARA) ~17,857 BTC Tesla (TSLA) ~9,720 BTC Note: The actual number of Bitcoin acquired by Trump Media depends on the average purchase price paid during the reported $2.32 billion transaction. This table highlights the scale of the reported Trump Media deal. While MicroStrategy remains the leader by a significant margin in terms of the *number* of Bitcoin held, a $2.32 billion investment is substantial and indicates a serious commitment to the asset class. What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors? For investors tracking DJT Stock , this news is crucial. It introduces a new variable – the performance of a volatile digital asset – directly onto the company’s balance sheet. Investors will need to consider: DJT Stock Volatility: The stock price may become increasingly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements. Due Diligence: Understanding Trump Media’s specific strategy for managing this asset (custody, risk management, future plans) is key. Market Sentiment: How the broader market reacts to a media company making such a large Crypto Investment could influence sentiment around DJT. For Bitcoin investors, a multi-billion dollar acquisition by a publicly traded company, regardless of its industry, is generally viewed positively as it signals increasing institutional adoption and demand. This could contribute to positive price momentum, though it does not guarantee future gains. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Digital Treasury Frontier The reported $2.32 billion Bitcoin acquisition by Trump Media marks a significant and potentially transformative moment for the company. By opting to hold Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset , DJT is embracing a strategy that, while still unconventional, is gaining traction among corporations seeking alternatives to traditional cash reserves. This move could offer substantial benefits if Bitcoin appreciates, potentially enhancing the company’s balance sheet and appealing to a digitally-savvy investor base. However, it also introduces considerable risk due to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape. Investors in both DJT Stock and the broader cryptocurrency market will be watching closely to see how this strategic Crypto Investment unfolds and what impact it ultimately has on Trump Media’s financial future and the perception of corporate Bitcoin adoption.

The situation has drawn comparisons to Elon Musk’s public endorsements of Dogecoin, which helped propel DOGE to the top of the meme coin market during the last bull cycle. Wait, what Trump just dropped a $PEPE pic on Truth Social Is this a secret crypto endorsement or just trolling the internet? Either way the $PEPE rocket might just have a new co-pilot. What’s next a $PEPE rally or a Twitter melt down Stay tuned pic.twitter.com/cu8RF7D55b — Josh Mair (@WizzOfCrypto) May 29, 2025 While not an explicit endorsement, Trump’s post has ignited a wave of excitement among speculators, fueling hopes that history might repeat itself with PEPE. Still, market reaction has been tempered by broader macro pressures. A 6% price surge in the hours following the post quickly gave way to an 18% correction. The U.S. Court of International Trade’s flip-flop on Trump’s tariff suspensions appears to be the primary driver of the shift, as risk-on sentiment recedes and traders remain cautiously optimistic. PEPE Price Prediction: Could Hype-Fuelled Speculation Push New Highs? A more direct presidential shill could give PEPE the momentum it needs to break out of the channel forming the handle of a 5-month cup-and-handle pattern. PEPE / USDT 1-day chart, cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. The initial market reaction to Trump’s post pushed the PEPE price towards its upper resistance, but the move lacked the conviction for a full retest. Momentum indicators currently favour the bears, with the MACD line widening its gap below the signal line after a recent death cross—a sign of a sustained near-term downtrend. More so, the RSI is en route to cross below the neutral line at 52, adopting a steep downtrend. If this trend continues, sellers stand to overwhelm buyers. A social catalyst could maintain the pattern, with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level—a common bottom during minor corrections—at $0.00001 serving as a potential reversal point. On the contrary, a breakdown below lower support could invalidate the bullish pattern completely, eying the next key support level at $0.000008. Should a breakout occur by mid-June, the cup-and-handle pattern suggests upside toward $0.000026—a 100% gain from current prices. Traders Have Under 24 Hours to Catch This Pepe Opportunity Since the mid-April market bottom, those who back the wrong horse are missing out on substantial gains as most coins loom far below their highs just four months ago.

According to a blog post released by BitMEX on Friday, the team has now set up an internal monitoring system to watch for more infections and possibly catch future operational security errors. The whole thing started when a BitMEX employee was contacted on LinkedIn with a proposal to work on a fake NFT marketplace project, but the offer matched a known phishing tactic used by Lazarus, so the employee immediately reported it, starting a full investigation. BitMEX’s security team accessed a GitHub repository the attacker shared, which contained a Next.js/React project. But buried inside was code designed to get the employee to unknowingly execute a malicious payload on their system. The team didn’t run the code, they went straight to analysis. BitMEX dissects malware, finds Lazarus fingerprints Inside the repo, BitMEX engineers searched for the term eval, a common red flag in malware. One line of code had been commented out, but it still revealed intent. If active, it would’ve reached out to “hxxp://regioncheck[.]net/api/user/thirdcookie/v3/726” to fetch a cookie and execute it. That domain had previously been linked to Lazarus by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, a team that’s tracked DPRK cyber activity for years. Source: BitMEX Another line was active. It sent a request to “hxxp://fashdefi[.]store:6168/defy/v5” and executed the response. BitMEX manually fetched that JavaScript and found it was heavily obfuscated. Using webcrack, a tool for deobfuscating code, the team reportedly pulled the layers off. The final output was messy but readable, as it looked like three different scripts smashed into one. One part of the code contained identifiers for Chrome extensions, which usually points to credential stealing malware. One string, p.zi, looked like older Lazarus malware used in the BeaverTail campaign, another operation previously documented by Unit 42. BitMEX decided not to re-analyze the BeaverTail component, as it was already public. Instead, they focused on another discovery: the code connected to a Supabase instance. Supabase is a backend platform for developers, sort of like Firebase. The problem? The Lazarus devs didn’t lock it down. When BitMEX tested it, they were able to access the database directly—no login, no protection. Hackers expose infected device logs and their own IPs The Supabase database had 37 logs of infected machines. Each entry showed the username, hostname, operating system, IP address, geolocation, and timestamp. BitMEX noticed patterns—some devices appeared repeatedly, which made them stand out as developer or test machines. The naming format for most hostnames followed a 3-XXX structure. Many IPs came from VPN providers. One user, “Victor,” often connected using Touch VPN. Another, “GHOST72,” used Astrill VPN. But then Victor messed up. One entry linked to him had a different IP—223.104.144.97, a residential IP in Jiaxing, China, under China Mobile. That wasn’t a VPN. That was likely the real IP address of a Lazarus operator. BitMEX flagged it as a major ops failure. BitMEX then built a tool to keep pinging the Supabase database. Since May 14, the tool has collected 856 entries from the database, which dates back to March 31st. Among them, there were 174 unique combinations of usernames and hostnames. The system now runs continuously, looking for new infections or more mistakes by the attackers. By examining timestamps, BitMEX found that Lazarus activity drops between 8am and 1pm UTC, which is 5pm to 10pm in Pyongyang. This matches a structured working schedule, giving further proof the group isn’t just some freelancing hackers—it’s an organized team. Security team confirms Lazarus pattern and internal split The Lazarus Group has a known history of social engineering attacks. In earlier incidents like the Bybit breach, they tricked an employee at Safe Wallet into running a malicious file. That gave them initial access. Then another part of the team took over, accessed the AWS environment, and changed the front-end code to steal crypto from cold wallets. BitMEX said this pattern shows the group is likely split into multiple teams—some doing the basic phishing, others handling the advanced intrusions once access is gained. BitMEX wrote, “Throughout the last few years, it appears that the group has divided into multiple subgroups that are not necessarily of the same technical sophistication.” The security team said this campaign followed that same template. The initial message on LinkedIn was simple, the GitHub repo amateurish. But the post-exploitation script showed far more skill, clearly built by someone more experienced. After deobfuscating the malware, BitMEX was able to extract Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and feed them into their internal systems. They renamed variables, cleaned the script, and followed how it worked. The early part of the code was new, and it reportedly sent system data (username, IP, etc.) straight into Supabase, making tracking easy… for anyone who found the open database. BitMEX also identified machines used during development. Examples included Victor@3-KZH, which was used with Touch VPN and China Mobile. Others like GHOST72@3-UJS-2 and Super@3-AHR-2 used a mix of Astrill, Zoog, and Hotspot Shield. Logs even showed user accounts like Admin@3-HIJ, Lenovo@3-RKS, GoldRock@DESKTOP-N4VEL23, and Muddy@DESKTOP-MK87CBC. These were likely test environments set up by the attackers.

The company plans to use a significant portion of this massive funding push to purchase Ethereum (ETH). A Shelf Offering is a financing method that allows a company to gradually offer its securities, which it has registered with the SEC, to the market in order to raise capital, rather than all at once. This method allows companies to raise funds flexibly over time. The total number of shares that SharpLink Gaming could issue under this shelf offering is over 72 million. If sold in full, the company could generate up to $1 billion in proceeds assuming the shares trade at the current market price of $79.21. Related News: The Once Largest Cryptocurrency Exchange Got Off Light: They Repelled the North Korean Attack The shares will be sold in the United States at certain intervals and depending on market conditions, using the “at the market offering” method. In such sales, the shares are offered to investors directly through sales representatives. The company announced that it will use the majority of the funds to purchase Ethereum (ETH), while the rest will be allocated for working capital, general corporate expenses, operational expenses, and affiliate marketing activities. SharpLink Gaming, which purchased $435 million worth of Ethereum last week, saw its shares increase by 2,700% following these developments. The company’s market value also grew 11-fold, attracting attention. *This is not investment advice.

Both have unique strengths that cater to different parts of the blockchain ecosystem making them big winners in the coming months. Ethereum’s Strengths as a Market Leader Since 2015 Ethereum has been the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By introducing programmable smart contracts Ethereum changed the game and created an entire ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) in industries from gaming to finance. As Ethereum is mature it will have slower percentage growth compared to smaller projects but its robust ecosystem, consistent innovation and market reliability makes it a good pick for investors in the next bull cycle. Ruvi AI’s Disruptive Vision While Ethereum is the backbone of blockchain innovation Ruvi AI is at the edge by combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI). This unique combination allows Ruvi AI to offer decentralized tools for content creation where users can generate text, images, videos and audio efficiently. Ruvi AI is going to disrupt industries by targeting real world applications like marketing, entertainment and automation. Businesses can use its technology to streamline workflows and create high quality content fast, giving the $RUVI token a strong use case. Investors have noted Ruvi AI’s potential to extend blockchain adoption beyond its traditional user base making it a standout in the crowded digital asset market. By focusing on solving real business problems Ruvi AI caters to a broader audience, setting itself apart from speculative projects.

Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) Rally From $0.03 to Be More Profitable,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-10-still-possible-mutuum-finances-mutm-rally-from-0-03-to-be-more-profitable/,"Ripple (XRP) has long been a favorite among crypto investors, sparking speculation about whether it can hit the ambitious $10 mark in 2025. While XRP navigates regulatory challenges and market fluctuations, many are also eyeing emerging altcoins with explosive growth potential. One such coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has captured attention for its remarkable rally, offering an intriguing alternative for investors seeking higher returns. The project is presently at Presale Phase 5 and has already raised over $9.5 million with over 11,400 investors. With a public launch price of $0.06 after subsequent phases, phase 5 investors at the prevailing price of $0.025 can realize potential returns of 100% by the time the token launches on exchanges. As crypto prices today fluctuate and the market digests ongoing news, savvy investors are weighing established cryptos like XRP against promising newcomers to determine which offers the best path to profit. XRP Holds Steady Amid Regulatory Anticipation As of today, Ripple (XRP) trades around $2.30, reflecting moderate stability following recent market fluctuations. Investor attention remains sharply focused on the potential approval of Ripple ETFs, which could act as a major catalyst and potentially drive XRP towards much higher price targets, including the speculative $10 mark. Despite facing ongoing regulatory scrutiny, XRP’s robust adoption in cross-border payments and growing institutional interest keep it positioned as a strong contender in the crypto space. While XRP awaits clear regulatory signals, emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also starting to gain momentum among investors seeking the next big opportunity. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Certik Audit Completed: Mutuum Finance Solidifies Trust and Transparency Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance has now officially completed its Certik smart contract audit, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to safety and reliability. Their open-source smart contracts are secure in design, instilling trust among users. Presale Momentum Today, with the token valued at $0.03, early investors are greatly intrigued by MUTM. A rise of 16.67% will take the token to $0.035 during the next step. Because some analysts think the post-launch prices will climb to $3, there is a big opportunity for those who buy the token at $0.03. For this reason, Mutuum Finance has become a favorite among DeFi followers who track low-cost altcoins. A Buy-and-Distribute system is unique to Mutuum Finance among most speculation tokens. The model buys new tokens from the market regularly and then passes them to stakers, making it valuable for all parties to take part for the long haul. It helps build prices and supports staying involved for an extended period. Gamified Leaderboard Engages the Community In addition to securing community ties, Mutuum Finance has established a leaderboard feature which displays the top 50 token holders in real-time. Bonus tokens will be received by the top 50 ranks, which becomes an entertaining, game-like incentive for users to move up and hold their positions. It is a smart merge of DeFi mechanics and community involvement. XRP’s path to $10 hinges on regulatory clarity and ETF approval, making it a slower, uncertain play. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining rapid traction, raising over $9.5 million with 11,400+ investors. At $0.03 in presale and launching at $0.06, early buyers could see 100% gains, with forecasts as high as $3. With Certik-audited security, unique DeFi lending, and reward-driven tokenomics, MUTM offers faster, higher upside.

Elon Musk , a figure often at the center of these discussions, has reportedly stepped down from his role as a U.S. special government employee, where he unofficially led the Department of Government Efficiency, playfully dubbed ‘DOGE’. This move highlights the complex and sometimes fraught relationship between tech leaders and the political landscape, prompting many to question what comes next for Silicon Valley Politics . Elon Musk’s DOGE Departure and Its Implications The announcement of Elon Musk’s departure from the ‘DOGE’ initiative comes amidst a cooling relationship with the current administration and reported impacts on his businesses, such as slumping Tesla sales potentially tied to his public political stances. Despite stepping down, Musk acknowledged the opportunity to address government waste and insisted that the core mission of DOGE would continue. The initiative, since its inception, has been characterized by aggressive budget cuts, job reductions, and departmental shutdowns, inevitably stirring considerable controversy. This event serves as a potent symbol of the evolving dynamic between influential tech figures and government. As tech giants and their leaders wield increasing power and influence, their involvement in politics becomes more scrutinized, leading to what some are calling the ‘find out’ stage for Silicon Valley Politics . Beyond Musk: Key Discussions on the Bitcoin World Podcast The full implications of Musk’s departure and the broader trends shaping the tech and crypto worlds were recently unpacked on Bitcoin World’s flagship podcast, Equity. Hosted by Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha, the episode delved into who else might be leaving the DOGE initiative and why this moment is critical for understanding the future of Silicon Valley Politics .

This move has significant implications for both the gaming retailer and the cryptocurrency market. Neuralink’s Valuation: Elon Musk’s brain-computer interface startup, Neuralink, raised $600 million, pushing its valuation to an estimated $9 billion. This highlights continued investor confidence in ambitious neurotechnology projects. NYT and Amazon AI Licensing Deal: A landmark agreement between The New York Times and Amazon signals how traditional media content is becoming a valuable asset for training and powering generative AI models. Nvidia Earnings Analysis: An examination of Nvidia’s recent earnings report, suggesting the forecast might be more optimistic than CEO Jensen Huang’s cautious remarks.

Market movements suggest a potential shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. With one asset dipping and another gaining momentum, the upcoming trends could be pivotal. This article explores which coin might steer the next market direction and provides insights into their recent performances. Cardano Overview: Shifts and Key Price Levels Cardano experienced a modest monthly gain of about 1.87% while facing a sharp six-month decline of nearly 34.30%. The coin also saw a significant weekly drop of around 12.36%, indicating substantial short-term pressure amid longer-term struggles. Price fluctuations between $0.55 and $0.78 demonstrate notable volatility in its performance. Current price action identifies support levels at $0.41 and a stronger base near $0.18, with resistance emerging at $0.88 and $1.11. Bearish signals dominate from moving averages and indicators, indicating a lack of clear direction. Traders might consider buying near lower support and selling close to resistance while monitoring potential signs of a trend reversal. Toncoin Price Dynamics: Recovery Signals Amid Ongoing Volatility Toncoin has shown modest gains recently with a one-month price increase of about 3.67% contrasting a steep six-month drop near 51.54%. The coin has traded mostly in a range between $2.55 and $3.99, reflecting a period of recovery following significant losses. Historical moves suggest that while short-term momentum has been positive, the broader long-term trend remains unsettled, with past volatility hinting at cautious optimism. The current range sees immediate resistance near $4.82 and a higher hurdle around $6.26, paired with supports at $1.94 and $0.50. The price action appears balanced, with bulls asserting strength as indicated by a moderately positive RSI around 56.29, yet trading remains rangebound. Consider targeting dips near support levels and monitoring for breakouts around resistance areas for potential trading opportunities. Conclusion The recent market movements show ADA struggling while TON experiences significant growth. This shift highlights the dynamic nature of the market. ADA's dip could signal a need for strategic adjustments. Meanwhile, TON's rise suggests it may lead future trends. Observing these changes can offer insights into potential investment opportunities.

After months of anticipation and complex legal proceedings, the team overseeing the FTX bankruptcy process has officially launched the second phase of its repayment efforts. This is a pivotal moment for FTX creditors who have patiently waited to recover assets lost in the exchange’s dramatic downfall. According to reports, this phase is expected to see a substantial FTX distribution of over $5 billion. The initial disbursements are slated to begin within a short window of 1–3 business days from today, marking a tangible step towards resolution for many. What Does This FTX Repayment Phase Entail? This isn’t the first step in the recovery process, but Phase 2 represents a major wave of distributions. The bankruptcy estate, managed by administrators, has been working diligently to locate, secure, and liquidate assets belonging to the collapsed exchange and its affiliated entities, such as Alameda Research. The goal has been to maximize the value available to repay creditors whose funds were frozen or lost. The specifics of this FTX repayment phase include: Significant Capital Outflow: The commitment to distribute over $5 billion indicates the significant progress made in asset recovery and valuation. This figure represents a large portion of the total estimated value available for distribution. Targeted Audience: These funds are specifically earmarked for eligible FTX creditors who filed claims during the bankruptcy proceedings. The complex process involved verifying claims, determining their value (often based on asset prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing in November 2022), and establishing a distribution hierarchy. Initial Timeline: The 1–3 business day window for the start of distributions suggests that the administrative and technical infrastructure for payout is ready. While distributing funds to a large number of creditors is a complex task, this initial timeframe provides a clear expectation for when the process will commence. Method of Payout: Creditors are typically being repaid based on the USD value of their holdings at the time of the bankruptcy filing. While some distributions might involve in-kind crypto where feasible and approved, a significant portion is expected to be in fiat currency or stablecoins, depending on the creditor’s preference and jurisdictional requirements. This helps manage volatility during the payout period. This phase follows extensive work, including asset sales, legal battles, and negotiations to consolidate assets and create a pool of funds for distribution. It’s a testament to the efforts of the bankruptcy administrators and legal teams involved. A Ray of Hope for FTX Creditors? For the thousands of individuals and institutions who had funds locked on FTX, this announcement is more than just a financial update; it’s a moment of potential relief. The past year and a half have been filled with uncertainty, frustration, and financial strain for many. The start of this major crypto payout offers a tangible outcome after a prolonged period of waiting. While the total recovery percentage for creditors is still subject to the final outcome of the bankruptcy process and asset liquidation, the fact that such a significant amount is being distributed in this phase is generally seen as a positive sign. Early estimates and market conditions (particularly the rise in value of some crypto assets held by FTX) have sometimes suggested a potentially higher recovery rate than is typical in large-scale bankruptcies, though this is not guaranteed for all claim types. This step helps to restore some faith in the process, demonstrating that even in the aftermath of a catastrophic failure like FTX, structured legal processes can yield results for affected parties. It moves the narrative from the collapse itself to the active resolution and restitution phase. Navigating the FTX Bankruptcy Update: What Should Creditors Do? With the distribution phase beginning, it’s crucial for FTX creditors to be informed and cautious. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed via Official Channels: Rely exclusively on official communications from the FTX bankruptcy administrators (like Kroll Restructuring Administration) or the court-appointed representatives. Be wary of unofficial sources, social media rumors, or direct messages claiming to facilitate your payout. Verify Your Payout Details: Ensure the payment method and destination you provided during the claims process are correct and up-to-date. If you need to update information, do so only through the official creditor portal or designated channels. Beware of Scams: Unfortunately, major events like this attract scammers. Be extremely cautious of any unsolicited contact (emails, texts, calls) asking for personal information, wallet keys, or fees to ‘expedite’ your FTX repayment. The administrators will not ask for this information via unofficial channels. Understand Your Claim Status: If you haven’t already, log into the official creditor portal to understand the status of your claim, the approved amount, and the expected method of distribution. Consult Financial/Legal Advisors: For complex claims or significant amounts, considering consulting with a financial advisor or legal counsel who specializes in bankruptcy recovery can be beneficial. Patience remains key, as distributing funds to a large number of creditors across various jurisdictions will take time, even after the initial phase begins. The 1–3 day window is for the *start* of the process, not necessarily the completion of all payouts. The Road Ahead for FTX Distribution and Resolution While the distribution of over $5 billion is a massive step, it’s important to remember that the FTX bankruptcy process is incredibly complex. There may be further phases of distribution as more assets are recovered or legal disputes are resolved. The administrators are tasked with maximizing recovery for all creditors, which can involve liquidating a diverse range of assets, from traditional investments to venture capital stakes and remaining crypto holdings. The successful execution of this phase will build confidence in the remaining steps of the resolution. It demonstrates the operational capability of the bankruptcy estate to handle large-scale financial movements and communicate progress to affected parties. The ultimate goal is to conclude the bankruptcy proceedings and provide as much restitution as possible to those who suffered losses. This FTX bankruptcy update is a critical turning point, shifting the focus from the failure of the exchange to the active process of making amends to those affected. While challenges remain, the commencement of this significant crypto payout is a positive development that offers tangible hope to the multitude of FTX creditors around the globe.
