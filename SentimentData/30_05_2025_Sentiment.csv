Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/400-million-xrp-abrupt-surge-heres-the-significance/,"XRP recorded a significant increase in on-chain transaction volume recently, with nearly 400 million transactions processed in a single day. This spike in network usage marks one of the most active periods in recent months, drawing attention from analysts and investors alike. However, despite the sharp rise in activity, XRP’s market price has remained relatively stable. Market Activity and Technical Outlook For May, data shows several transaction volume surges, culminating in the sharp increase observed on the 27th. These types of movements often reflect large-scale transfers between wallets, which could be linked to institutional portfolio adjustments or internal exchange settlements. Despite the volume spike, price movement has remained subdued. XRP continues to trade within a narrow range, fluctuating between $2.20 and $2.50. This price behaviour suggests investor hesitation, with no clear directional momentum developing so far. Technical analysis of the XRP/USDT pair indicates a symmetrical triangle formation, a classic sign of market consolidation. Currently, the price is testing support at both the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). A minor golden cross is visible, but it has not resulted in significant upward momentum yet. If the price breaks out, it may aim for resistance levels near $2.60 to $2.70. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Caution Still High While the recent jump in transaction volume signals increased network activity, it does not necessarily guarantee short-term price appreciation. Market interest, particularly among retail investors, appears limited. This is evident in the relatively low trading volume on exchanges, suggesting that traders are waiting for a confirmed breakout before re-engaging. For now, XRP must hold above the $2.20 support level to avoid a deeper pullback. Should buying pressure increase and the price move above $2.50, a renewed uptrend could emerge, supported by the growing network utility. However, without a decisive move from market participants, the asset remains locked within its current range. In summary, although XRP’s on-chain performance has improved notably, its price has yet to reflect that strength. Investors are advised to monitor volume and resistance levels closely as the market searches for direction. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Understanding the broader economic climate is crucial for anyone navigating digital assets. A recent report from Odaily sheds light on a key development within the US economic sphere that warrants attention: comments from a top White House official regarding US trade policy and the future of US trade deals . What Did the White House Economic Council Director Say About Trade Tariffs Impact? According to the report, Kevin Hassett, who served as the Director of the White House National Economic Council (NEC) during the period referenced, expressed significant confidence regarding a recent ruling concerning tariffs. Hassett’s comments focused on the potential trade tariffs impact and the administration’s strategy moving forward. Here are the key takeaways from Hassett’s statement: Confidence in Overturning Ruling: Hassett is confident that a recent tariff ruling will be successfully overturned upon appeal. No Impact on Agreements: He believes this specific ruling will not negatively affect ongoing trade agreements. Expectation of More Deals: More trade agreements are anticipated in the coming weeks. Deals Ready for Decision: Three trade agreements were specifically mentioned as being ready for then-President Donald Trump’s final decision. This perspective from a high-ranking official within the White House economic council offers insight into the administration’s view on the stability and direction of its trade agenda, despite potential legal or regulatory challenges. Who is Kevin Hassett and Why Does His Opinion on US Trade Deals Matter? Kevin Hassett is an economist who held prominent positions within the US government, including chairing the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and serving as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC). The NEC is a principal forum used by the President for considering policy matters involving domestic and international economic issues. Its Director plays a crucial role in coordinating economic policy-making across various government agencies. Hassett’s statements carry weight because they reflect the administration’s official stance and expectations regarding its economic and trade policies. His confidence in overturning a tariff ruling and the expectation of impending US trade deals signal a particular outlook on the administration’s ability to navigate trade disputes and secure new agreements. Understanding Trade Tariffs and Their Potential Market Ripple Effects Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. Governments use them for various reasons, including protecting domestic industries, generating revenue, or as a tool in trade negotiations. While seemingly straightforward, tariffs can have complex and far-reaching economic consequences: Potential Impact Area Description Consumer Prices Can increase the cost of imported goods, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. Domestic Industries Can make domestically produced goods more competitive but may also increase costs if industries rely on imported components. Export Markets Can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, harming domestic exporters. Supply Chains Can disrupt established global supply chains, forcing companies to find new suppliers or relocate production. Market Sentiment Trade disputes and tariffs often create uncertainty, which can negatively impact investor confidence and lead to volatility in stock markets, commodity prices, and even potentially influence sentiment in digital asset markets. The specific tariff ruling mentioned by Hassett, though unnamed in the report, likely pertains to a particular industry or country. His confidence in its reversal suggests the administration believes its trade strategy remains legally sound or that alternative legal avenues will succeed. This perceived stability, or lack thereof depending on the outcome, contributes to the overall economic narrative that influences global markets. Why Does White House Economic Council Commentary Matter for the Global Economy? The economic policies set by major global powers like the United States have a significant impact on international trade flows, currency valuations, and overall market stability. The White House economic council plays a key role in shaping these policies and communicating them to the public and markets. When a high-ranking official like Kevin Hassett speaks with confidence about overturning a tariff ruling and the impending success of US trade deals , it sends a signal: Signal of Resolve: It indicates the administration’s determination to pursue its trade agenda despite obstacles. Signal of Stability (Potential): If the appeal is successful and deals are struck, it could reduce uncertainty surrounding specific trade relationships. Signal of Negotiation Stance: It might also provide clues about the administration’s negotiating leverage and priorities in ongoing discussions. For those monitoring global markets, including the cryptocurrency space, these signals are part of the larger mosaic of economic data and political developments that inform investment decisions and risk assessments. While not a direct driver of crypto prices, the health and stability of the global economy, heavily influenced by US trade policy , can impact capital flows and investor appetite for riskier assets. Navigating the Future: What Does This Mean for US Trade Policy and Beyond? Hassett’s comments paint a picture of an administration actively pursuing its trade objectives and confident in overcoming legal challenges to its tariff strategy. The expectation of more US trade deals suggests ongoing efforts to reshape trade relationships through negotiation rather than solely relying on tariffs. Key Aspects to Consider: Benefits: Successful trade deals can open new markets for US goods, potentially boost economic growth, and provide greater certainty for businesses engaged in international trade. Overturning a potentially disruptive tariff ruling could prevent negative consequences for specific industries. Challenges: Trade negotiations are complex and can face political hurdles both domestically and internationally. The success of appeals is never guaranteed. Furthermore, the specific terms of new trade deals can have varied impacts across different sectors of the economy. Examples: The mention of three deals ready for the President’s decision highlights concrete progress in specific negotiations, although the details of these agreements were not provided in the report. Actionable Insights: Stay informed about developments in US trade policy and global trade relations. Monitor the outcomes of tariff appeals and the details of any new trade agreements announced. While the link to crypto is indirect, major shifts in global trade can influence broader market sentiment and economic forecasts. The confidence expressed by a figure within the White House economic council is a data point in the ongoing story of global economic relations. It underscores the dynamic nature of international trade and the continuous efforts by governments to shape it. Conclusion: The Interconnectedness of Global Economics and Trade Tariffs Impact Kevin Hassett’s statements regarding the expected overturning of a tariff ruling and the anticipation of further US trade deals offer a glimpse into the perspective from the highest levels of the US economic policy-making body. His confidence, as reported by Odaily, suggests a belief within the administration that their approach to US trade policy is resilient and set to yield further results in the form of new agreements. While this news directly concerns international trade and US economic strategy, its relevance extends to anyone observing global markets. The potential trade tariffs impact , the stability (or instability) created by trade disputes, and the positive momentum from new US trade deals all contribute to the overall economic environment that indirectly influences investment climates, including the appetite for digital assets. Keeping an eye on these macroeconomic signals, even those originating from the White House economic council , provides valuable context for navigating the complexities of today’s interconnected financial world.

While the headlines might seem focused purely on traditional finance, the latest economic data out of the United States holds significant clues for the future direction of the crypto market. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis recently released its second estimate for the first quarter of 2025, and the numbers caught many by surprise. Decoding the Latest US GDP Numbers So, what exactly did the data show? The report indicated that the US GDP , or Gross Domestic Product – the total value of goods and services produced in the country – contracted at an annual rate of 0.2% in Q1 2025. This figure was slightly less severe than the 0.3% decline that analysts had broadly expected, but it still represents a significant shift. Think of GDP as a report card for the US economy . A positive number means the economy is growing, while a negative number signals a slowdown or contraction. The previous quarter (Q4 2024) saw a healthy expansion of 2.4%. This sharp reversal into a GDP contraction in Q1 is therefore a notable event, suggesting the economic momentum seen late last year has faded. Here’s a quick look at the recent trend: Q4 2024 (Final Estimate): +2.4% Expansion Q1 2025 (Second Estimate): -0.2% Contraction This data point is crucial because it’s one of the primary indicators economists and policymakers use to gauge the health and direction of the economy. While this is the second of three estimates, the final number is usually close to the second, meaning this contraction is likely to stick. What Does This Economic Data Signal for the US Economy? A GDP contraction , even a modest one like 0.2%, immediately raises questions about the underlying strength of the US economy . While one quarter of negative growth doesn’t automatically mean a recession (which is typically defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction), it certainly puts recessionary fears back on the table for many analysts. What could be behind this slowdown? Several factors might contribute, including: Cooling Consumer Spending: Consumers are the engine of the US economy. If high inflation or borrowing costs are finally biting, they might be pulling back on spending. Reduced Business Investment: Uncertainty about the future economic outlook can lead companies to delay investments in new equipment, buildings, or hiring. Impact of Higher Interest Rates: The Federal Reserve’s past interest rate hikes are designed to slow the economy to combat inflation. This contraction suggests those policies are having their intended effect, perhaps more strongly now. Understanding this specific piece of economic data is key to forming a broader view of the macroeconomic landscape. Connecting the Dots: Economic Data and the Crypto Market Impact Now, let’s get to why this matters for you, the crypto enthusiast. Traditional economic data like the US GDP report can have a significant crypto market impact , albeit sometimes indirectly. Here’s how the dots connect: Investor Sentiment: A weakening US economy often leads to a shift in investor sentiment. When the economy looks shaky, investors tend to become more risk-averse. This can mean pulling money out of assets perceived as higher risk, which sometimes includes cryptocurrencies, and moving into safer havens like government bonds. Monetary Policy Expectations: A contracting economy puts pressure on the Federal Reserve. If the economy continues to slow, the Fed might feel compelled to lower interest rates sooner than previously anticipated to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates can make riskier assets, including crypto, relatively more attractive compared to low-yield traditional investments. Inflation Outlook: While the GDP report itself isn’t an inflation print, a slowing economy can potentially ease inflationary pressures as demand cools. A clearer path towards lower inflation could also influence the Fed’s actions and market sentiment, impacting crypto. Dollar Strength: Economic performance can affect the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international investors. So, while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, their prices are still heavily influenced by global macroeconomic conditions and the liquidity available in the system, much of which is tied to the health of the US economy and the policies of its central bank. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market After This US GDP Report Given this new piece of economic data , what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key economic data releases, not just US GDP . Inflation reports, jobs numbers, and Fed announcements are all critical pieces of the puzzle. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: A potentially slowing economy can bring increased market volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Watch the Fed: Pay close attention to statements from Federal Reserve officials. Their reaction to this data will be a major factor influencing market expectations regarding future interest rates. Consider Diversification: While crypto is your focus, think about how this economic backdrop affects your overall investment strategy. This GDP contraction serves as a reminder that the crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. External economic forces play a significant role in shaping its landscape. In Conclusion: A Warning Signal from the US Economy The Q1 2025 US GDP report showing a 0.2% contraction is a crucial piece of economic data that investors should not ignore. It signals potential headwinds for the US economy after a period of expansion and could influence everything from Federal Reserve policy to overall market sentiment. While the direct link isn’t always immediate, the potential crypto market impact from a slowing economy and subsequent policy responses is undeniable. Staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is just as important as tracking on-chain metrics or project developments when navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

This is where the AI crypto browser aims to shine. The intelligent agents within the Donut browser are designed to understand your intent and autonomously execute these kinds of blockchain transactions . Think of it like having a personal crypto assistant built directly into your browser. Here’s how it could simplify things: Token Swaps: Instead of manually finding the best DEX, approving tokens, setting slippage, and executing the swap, you might simply tell the AI agent, “Swap 1 ETH for USDC,” and it handles the rest, finding the optimal route and price. Yield Farming: Participating in yield farms often involves depositing liquidity pairs, staking LP tokens, and managing rewards. An AI agent could potentially monitor opportunities, suggest strategies, and even execute deposits or withdrawals based on parameters you set. Portfolio Optimization: Managing a diverse portfolio requires constant monitoring and rebalancing. An AI agent could analyze market conditions, track your holdings, and suggest or automatically execute trades to maintain your desired asset allocation or risk level. This level of automation has the potential to drastically lower the barrier to entry for interacting with DeFi and other web3 protocols. Transforming User Interaction with Decentralized Applications Beyond automating transactions, the AI crypto browser is set to redefine how users interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Today, interacting with a dApp often feels like using a clunky, early-internet website. Donut aims to make this experience intuitive, efficient, and safer. Key features planned for the Donut browser that enhance dApp interaction include: Built-in Wallets: Seamless integration of secure crypto wallets means you don’t need separate browser extensions or apps to connect to dApps. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Access: Direct access to various DEXs simplifies trading and liquidity provision. AI-Powered Risk Screening: A critical feature is the use of AI to analyze smart contracts and dApp interactions for potential risks, scams, or vulnerabilities, providing users with warnings before they connect their wallets or sign transactions. This adds a crucial layer of security that is often missing in the current landscape. By integrating these features and layering AI on top, Donut Labs is creating a more unified, intelligent, and user-friendly gateway to the decentralized web. This could be a major catalyst for broader adoption of decentralized applications in the coming years. The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities While the vision is compelling, building an AI crypto browser comes with significant challenges. Training AI agents to safely and effectively interact with the ever-evolving landscape of smart contracts and protocols is a complex task. Ensuring the security of the AI itself and preventing potential exploits is paramount. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI and crypto also presents a hurdle. However, the opportunities are immense. If successful, Donut could become the preferred way for millions of new users to enter the crypto space, abstracting away much of the technical complexity and risk currently involved. The $7M funding provides Donut Labs with the resources needed to tackle these challenges head-on and capitalize on the opportunity to be a leader in the next generation of crypto infrastructure. What Does This Mean for the Future? The investment in Donut Labs signals a growing trend: the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. As AI becomes more sophisticated, its ability to understand, navigate, and execute actions within complex digital environments like the blockchain increases. A dedicated AI crypto browser could pave the way for a future where interacting with DeFi, NFTs, and other web3 services is as simple as telling an AI agent what you want to achieve. Donut Labs anticipates that their approach will contribute significantly to broader adoption of decentralized technologies in the coming decade. The ability to automate and simplify complex blockchain transactions , combined with enhanced security features, could finally make web3 accessible to a mainstream audience. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Interaction The $7M funding secured by Donut Labs is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a vote of confidence in the future of AI-powered crypto interaction. By developing an AI crypto browser designed to simplify blockchain transactions and enhance the user experience with decentralized applications , Donut Labs is at the forefront of building a more accessible and intelligent decentralized web.

The global crypto market cap has recently soared past an incredible milestone, exceeding $3.5 trillion. This isn’t just a number; it reflects a massive influx of capital and growing confidence in the digital asset space. What’s behind this surge? According to the on-chain analytics experts at Sentora (formerly known as IntoTheBlock), a major catalyst is the increasing institutional demand . What’s Fueling the Crypto Market Cap Surge? The headline figure of the crypto market cap crossing the $3.5 trillion threshold is certainly attention-grabbing. Sentora’s report highlights that while the entire ecosystem is contributing, the primary engine driving this recent growth is the significant interest and investment coming from large institutions. Bitcoin’s Role: A large part of this institutional focus is centered around Bitcoin . With the advent of regulated investment products like spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions, traditional finance players now have easier, more familiar avenues to gain exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Capital Influx: Institutions manage vast sums of capital. Even a small allocation from a large pension fund, hedge fund, or corporate treasury can represent hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars flowing into the market, disproportionately impacting the overall crypto market cap . Validation and Confidence: Institutional involvement often lends an air of legitimacy and maturity to an asset class. Their participation signals to other large players, and even sophisticated retail investors, that the market is becoming more established and less speculative than in its earlier days. Beyond Bitcoin: Strength in the Broader Ecosystem While Bitcoin might be leading the charge in terms of institutional flows, Sentora’s data reveals that the health of the crypto ecosystem extends far beyond just the king coin. The broader landscape is showing robust signs of recovery and growth, indicating increasing utility and adoption. DeFi’s Rebound: Decentralized Finance ( DeFi ) is seeing a significant resurgence. Sentora noted that DeFi loan books have rebounded to an impressive $30 billion. This metric is a key indicator of activity and confidence within decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading protocols. The recovery here suggests users are actively engaging with decentralized applications again after previous market downturns. Stablecoins’ Steadfast Growth: Stablecoins , digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, have also seen remarkable growth. Sentora’s report points out a substantial 56% increase in their capitalization over the past year. This growth is crucial as stablecoins act as the primary medium of exchange within the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading, lending, and payments without needing to constantly convert back to fiat currency. Their expanding market cap reflects increased activity and liquidity across the entire space. How is Regulation Shaping the Future? The evolving regulatory landscape in the United States is playing an increasingly important role in the crypto narrative, particularly concerning DeFi and stablecoins . Sentora highlighted that guidance and potential regulations from key bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are poised to significantly shape the future trajectory of these sectors. Clarity for Institutions: Regulatory clarity is often cited as a major hurdle for institutions considering deeper involvement in crypto. Clear rules around classification (is an asset a security or a commodity?), trading, and custody can provide the certainty large compliance departments require. Defining DeFi: Regulators are grappling with how to oversee decentralized protocols. Future guidance could impact how DeFi operates, potentially affecting everything from user interfaces to the underlying smart contracts. While some fear over-regulation, clear guidelines could also legitimize certain activities and attract more mainstream users and capital. Stablecoin Frameworks: Given their role in facilitating transactions and their potential to scale, stablecoins are under intense scrutiny. Proposed regulations aim to ensure their stability and prevent their use in illicit activities. A robust regulatory framework for stablecoins could pave the way for their wider adoption in payments and traditional finance. While regulatory developments can introduce uncertainty in the short term, many market participants view thoughtful regulation as a necessary step towards the long-term maturity and sustainability of the digital asset market. Benefits and Challenges of Increased Institutional Adoption The surge in institutional demand bringing the crypto market cap to new heights comes with both significant benefits and potential challenges: Benefits: Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital means deeper markets, making it easier to buy and sell assets without causing significant price swings. Reduced Volatility: Institutional trading strategies are often less emotional and short-term focused than retail, potentially leading to more stable market movements over time. Enhanced Legitimacy: Their participation validates crypto as a serious asset class, attracting further investment and talent. Infrastructure Development: Institutions require sophisticated tools and services, driving innovation in custody, trading platforms, and data analytics. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large pools of institutional capital could potentially lead to greater centralization of power and influence within certain protocols or assets. Market Manipulation Risks: While regulations aim to prevent this, large players could potentially exert undue influence on market prices. Regulatory Hurdles: The very regulations designed to attract institutions can also impose restrictions that impact the decentralized nature of some crypto projects, particularly in DeFi . Correlation with Traditional Markets: Increased institutional involvement could lead to crypto markets becoming more correlated with traditional finance, potentially reducing its diversification benefits. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast What does this mean for you, the individual interested in or invested in crypto? The market reaching a $3.5 trillion crypto market cap driven by institutional demand is a strong signal of maturation. It suggests that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative bets, but as legitimate components of global financial portfolios. Keep an eye on how regulatory discussions progress, as they will significantly impact the operational landscape for DeFi and stablecoins . Understanding the difference between assets primarily driven by retail vs. those attracting institutional interest (like Bitcoin ) can also be key to navigating market dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets? Sentora’s latest data paints a clear picture: the crypto market is experiencing a period of significant growth, propelled by the increasing appetite from institutional investors, particularly for Bitcoin . This influx of sophisticated capital, coupled with the robust recovery seen in sectors like DeFi and the expanding utility of stablecoins , underscores the ecosystem’s resilience and evolving nature. As regulatory frameworks begin to solidify, they promise to further shape this burgeoning market. The journey to $3.5 trillion is a testament to the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric, potentially ushering in a new era for crypto.

While your focus might be on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the latest altcoin moves, paying attention to the broader financial landscape, especially the US stock market , is more crucial than ever. Today brought some notable news from Wall Street as markets opened with significant upward momentum. Let’s dive into what happened and why it matters for your digital asset portfolio. Positive Signals from the Stock Market Open The start of trading saw major indices pushing into positive territory, reflecting a notable shift in investor sentiment as the stock market open got underway. Here’s a quick look at the performance of the key benchmarks: S&P 500: Gained +0.79% NASDAQ Composite: Led the charge with a significant +1.43% increase Dow Jones Industrial Average: Posted a modest +0.14% gain This broad-based rise across different sectors indicates a potential increase in risk appetite among investors, a factor that often has ripple effects across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Understanding the S&P 500’s Move The S&P 500 , often considered a bellwether for the overall health of the U.S. economy and stock market, showing a nearly 0.8% gain right out of the gate is a strong signal. This index represents the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Its positive movement suggests confidence in the earnings outlook and economic stability, at least for the short term. For crypto investors, a rising S&P 500 can sometimes correlate with positive sentiment spilling over into digital assets, especially those seen as growth investments. Why the NASDAQ’s Surge is Particularly Interesting for Crypto The NASDAQ , heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, posted the most significant percentage gain among the major indices today. This is particularly relevant for the crypto market because many crypto investors and projects are aligned with the technology sector. Historically, there has been a notable correlation between the performance of the NASDAQ and the price movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A strong NASDAQ often suggests positive sentiment towards tech innovation and growth assets, which can directly benefit the crypto space. When tech stocks are rallying, it can create a favorable environment for digital assets that are also perceived as high-growth, disruptive technologies. The Dow Jones and Broader Market Health While the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s gain was more modest compared to the NASDAQ and S&P 500, its positive opening contributes to the overall narrative of a strong market start. The Dow tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies, often referred to as ‘blue-chip’ stocks. Its positive performance suggests that confidence isn’t limited just to the tech sector but is potentially spreading to broader industrial and financial areas of the economy. This widespread positivity can reinforce the overall bullish sentiment in the traditional markets, which, as mentioned, can influence the crypto market through various channels, including investor confidence and capital flows. What Does This Stock Market Open Mean for Crypto Investors? The correlation between traditional markets, especially tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies has become more pronounced over recent years. Here’s a breakdown of what today’s positive US stock market opening could imply for your crypto investments: Benefits: Positive Sentiment Spillover: A rising stock market can indicate increased investor confidence and risk appetite, potentially leading investors to allocate more capital into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Macro Environment Indicator: Strong stock performance might reflect underlying positive economic factors (like favorable inflation data or optimistic growth forecasts) that could also support the crypto market. Validation of Growth Assets: The NASDAQ’s strong performance, in particular, can signal continued belief in growth-oriented and technology-driven assets, which aligns well with the narrative surrounding many cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Increased Correlation Risk: While correlation can be beneficial during market rallies, it also means crypto is more susceptible to downturns in traditional markets. If stocks fall, crypto might follow. Less Diversification: High correlation means holding both stocks and crypto might offer less diversification benefit than in the past. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Given the connection, how should a crypto investor react to this positive stock market open ? Monitor Key Economic Data: Keep an eye on the factors driving the stock market (inflation reports, jobs data, central bank commentary) as they increasingly influence crypto. Watch Tech Sector Performance: Pay close attention to the NASDAQ and major tech stocks, as their movements often foreshadow trends in the crypto market. Consider the Macro Landscape: Don’t view crypto in isolation. Understand its place within the broader financial ecosystem. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Recognize that increased correlation means crypto’s volatility might be tied more closely to macro swings. Concluding Thoughts Today’s strong opening across the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow Jones is a significant event in the traditional finance world, and its implications for the cryptocurrency market are noteworthy. While crypto has its unique drivers, the increasing interconnectedness with global markets means that positive signals from Wall Street, particularly from the tech-heavy NASDAQ, can contribute to a favorable environment for digital assets. Staying informed about these traditional market movements is no longer optional but a vital part of navigating the complex and exciting world of cryptocurrency investing.

This agreement allows the tech giant to use The Times’s extensive editorial archives to train its various AI platforms. This move comes less than two years after The New York Times initiated a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging copyright infringement over the use of its content for AI training without proper authorization or compensation. What Does the Amazon AI Deal Involve? The core of this agreement is the licensing of The New York Times’s diverse editorial content to Amazon. According to statements from The Times, this includes a broad spectrum of material designed to enhance Amazon’s customer experiences powered by AI. Key aspects of the deal include: Access to news articles published by The New York Times. Inclusion of content from NYT Cooking, the outlet’s popular food and recipe site. Utilization of material from The Athletic, The Times’s sports-focused publication. Potential integration of this content into Amazon’s Alexa software, suggesting AI-driven interactions could leverage Times information. While the specific financial terms of this Amazon AI content licensing agreement have not been publicly disclosed, it marks a notable first for both parties involved. For Amazon, it represents their initial foray into securing such a large-scale content licensing deal specifically for AI training purposes. For The New York Times, it’s their first official generative AI-focused licensing agreement, signaling a strategic shift towards potentially collaborating with AI developers under controlled terms. Why Did The New York Times Pursue an AI Licensing Deal Now? The context of this deal is crucial. In late 2023, The New York Times filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft. The suit claimed that these companies used millions of articles published by The Times to train their AI models, including large language models central to Generative AI applications, without obtaining consent or providing compensation. Both OpenAI and Microsoft have disputed these allegations. This legal action highlighted the complex and often contentious relationship between content creators and AI developers regarding the use of copyrighted material for training data. The decision by New York Times AI strategy to pivot from litigation against some AI companies to a licensing partnership with another like Amazon suggests a potential path forward for publishers seeking to monetize their archives in the age of AI. Unlike OpenAI, which has reportedly signed numerous similar licensing deals with various publishers globally (including The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, NewsCorp, and Axel Springer), Amazon’s deal with The Times appears to be a foundational step in its content acquisition strategy for AI development. Implications of Licensing Media Content for AI Training Deals like this Media Content licensing agreement between The New York Times and Amazon raise important questions about the future of journalism, AI development, and copyright in the digital age. Publishers face the challenge of protecting their intellectual property while also exploring new revenue streams and adapting to technological shifts. Potential Benefits: Revenue for Publishers: Licensing provides a potential new income source for media organizations whose traditional models are under pressure. Improved AI Models: Access to high-quality, verified journalistic content can theoretically lead to more accurate, reliable, and nuanced AI models. Controlled Use: Licensing agreements can provide publishers with more control over how their content is used by AI companies compared to unauthorized scraping. Potential Challenges: Undisclosed Terms: The lack of transparency in deal terms makes it difficult to assess the true value exchanged and set precedents for future agreements. Impact on Traffic: If AI models directly answer user queries using licensed content, it could potentially reduce direct traffic to publisher websites. Defining Fair Use: The legal battles and licensing deals are part of a larger effort to define what constitutes fair use of copyrighted material in the context of AI training. This agreement between The New York Times and Amazon is more than just a business transaction; it’s a significant indicator of how major content creators and technology platforms are navigating the complex intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence capabilities. As AI models become more sophisticated, the value and necessity of high-quality, verified human-created content for their training becomes increasingly apparent, making these licensing deals a critical trend to watch.

Last week, a hacker hit Cetus with a sophisticated smart contract exploit targeting the decentralized exchange’s (DEX) concentrated liquidity market maker (CLMM) pools, purloining approximately $223 million worth of assets from the platform. The DEX quickly froze $162 million worth of the stolen assets. Now, the Sui community is currently voting on a proposal that enables a special transaction to return those frozen assets from two attacker addresses back to Cetus. If passed, the vote would approve a one-time authentication of two special transactions hard-coded with the two attacker addresses, stolen asset objects, and their destination. The votes are weighted by validator stake, but the Sui Foundation’s stake is excluded to maintain neutrality. The vote passes if more than 50% of the total stake participates and there are more “yes” votes than “no” votes. The voting period ends next week, but early passing could happen as early as Thursday if the remaining unvoted stake cannot change the outcome. That appears poised to happen, with 71% of the validators having already voted “yes” at time of writing, compared to 0.3% for “no,” 1.5% abstaining and 27.2% who had yet to vote. Cetus also announced this week that it is in a position to fully cover the remaining losses via cash, token treasuries and a loan from the Sui Foundation, pending the vote’s passage. “Because full recovery is dependent upon the results of the community vote, we humbly ask for the Sui community’s full support to recover the funds via the upcoming vote. We recognize that this is an extraordinary ask forced by our actions, however we think it is the right decision especially for those affected.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

After months of lagging behind BTC, ETH is now making a strong move, with bulls pushing price action toward the critical $2,800 resistance. This level, which has consistently capped upside momentum since early February, now stands as the key battleground for Ethereum’s next major leg. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Market sentiment has shifted as Ethereum shows signs of reclaiming dominance, driven by renewed spot demand and strengthening technicals. Top analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on the rally, emphasizing the importance of the $2,850 mark. According to Pillows, this is the most significant resistance Ethereum has faced in this cycle, and breaking through it could unlock a powerful move toward $3,000 and beyond. Momentum has been building steadily over the past few weeks, and ETH’s recent resilience against macroeconomic pressure is adding to the conviction. If bulls manage to flip this resistance into support, it could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin surge. For now, all eyes are on Ethereum as it flirts with a breakout that could reshape market dynamics heading into June. Ethereum Eyes Expansion Phase Amid Shifting Global Dynamics Ethereum is positioning itself for a potentially expansive move as both technical indicators and market sentiment continue to align in its favor. After weeks of consolidation and steady gains, ETH is now testing the $2,850 resistance—a level that has held price down since February. The setup suggests that Ethereum is not only regaining momentum but could also lead the next phase of the crypto rally. While the crypto market gains traction, broader macroeconomic forces are reshaping investor behavior. A recent decision by the U.S. Federal court to strike down former President Trump’s tariffs on various countries has created fresh uncertainty across global markets. This policy reversal could introduce volatility in traditional finance, as trade dynamics shift and new fiscal responses take shape. Despite this uncertainty, Ethereum appears to be thriving. There’s a view that crypto assets like ETH could perform well under tight economic conditions, and current price action supports that view. ETH is showing resilience, supported by growing spot demand, a bullish structure, and rising investor confidence. Pillows highlighted in his latest analysis that if Ethereum reclaims the $2,850 level in the coming sessions, the path to $4,000 will open quickly. This would represent a major breakout and likely trigger a wave of capital rotation from Bitcoin and stablecoins into altcoins. For now, ETH remains just below a breakout point. If bulls can push decisively above resistance, it would confirm the start of an expansionary move that could reshape the broader market, positioning Ethereum as a leading force in the next phase of the cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Reclaims Weekly Key Levels Ethereum is showing renewed strength on the weekly chart, currently trading at $2,728.36 after reaching a high of $2,789.50. This move marks a significant recovery from recent lows near $1,600 and confirms the formation of a strong uptrend. ETH has now reclaimed the 34-week EMA at $2,511.42 and is pushing above the 100-week SMA at $2,605.71. These moving averages now act as dynamic support levels, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The next critical level to watch is the 50-week SMA, currently sitting at $2,729.64, just slightly above the current price. A confirmed weekly close above this level would mark the first time ETH has sustained strength above it since late 2023. That could open the door for a push toward the $3,200–$3,600 zone, with $4,000 in sight if momentum accelerates. Volume has also picked up on this recent move, signaling healthy participation from buyers. Historically, similar recoveries from major moving average clusters have preceded expansive legs in Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally As long as ETH maintains this structure and closes the week above $2,700, bulls are likely to retain control. The breakout above $2,850—last defended in early 2024—remains the final hurdle before Ethereum can challenge prior cycle highs.

Recent analysis suggests several powerful forces are aligning, potentially driving the premier cryptocurrency to new heights. If you’re watching the crypto market , understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial. A deep dive into on-chain and technical data reveals five compelling signals that point towards continued upside potential for Bitcoin . These factors aren’t just isolated events; they represent shifts in market structure and investor behavior that have historically preceded significant price appreciation. Let’s break down what these signals are and why they matter for the future trajectory of Bitcoin . Signal 1: Sustained Whale Accumulation One of the most telling signs of smart money confidence is the behavior of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. These entities control vast amounts of Bitcoin and their movements can significantly influence market dynamics. Recent data indicates a sustained pattern of accumulation by these large wallets. What does this mean? Reduced Supply on Exchanges: When whales move Bitcoin off exchanges into cold storage, it signals an intent to hold for the long term, reducing the readily available supply for selling. Confidence in Future Price: Accumulation suggests these large players believe the current price is attractive and expect it to rise considerably in the future. They aren’t selling into strength; they’re buying dips or accumulating steadily. Market Strength: Sustained buying pressure from large players provides a strong foundation for price support. This consistent absorption of supply by whales is a fundamental bullish signal, suggesting strong hands are positioning for significant gains. Signal 2: Strong Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products, particularly in the United States, has been a game-changer for the crypto market . These vehicles provide traditional investors with an accessible and regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin . The inflows into these ETFs have been substantial and consistent. Here’s why this is bullish: New Capital Injection: ETFs bring significant new capital into the market that might otherwise not have directly invested in Bitcoin . This includes institutional funds, wealth managers, and retail investors using traditional brokerage accounts. Demand Exceeding Supply: The rate at which these ETFs are buying Bitcoin to back their shares often exceeds the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined daily. This creates a supply shock dynamic. Validation and Legitimacy: The success and adoption of Bitcoin ETF s lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially attracting even more conservative investors over time. The sustained demand from the ETF sector is a powerful engine driving the Bitcoin price higher by absorbing available supply. Signal 3: Elevated Investor Sentiment Market psychology plays a significant role in price movements. While not a fundamental driver, elevated investor sentiment can fuel momentum and extend rallies. Various metrics, from social media trends to survey data and funding rates in derivatives markets, suggest sentiment remains broadly positive towards Bitcoin . Why is positive sentiment important? Increased Participation: Positive sentiment encourages more people to buy, from retail investors entering the market to existing holders increasing their positions. Reduced Selling Pressure: When sentiment is high, holders are less likely to sell on minor price dips, leading to more resilient price action. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: In the short to medium term, widespread belief in a rising market can contribute to that rise as buying activity increases. While sentiment can be fickle, its current elevated state indicates a general bullish outlook across the crypto market , supporting the potential for continued price increases. Signal 4: Rising Open Interest Despite All-Time Highs Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures or options) that have not been settled. Typically, when an asset reaches new all-time highs, open interest might decline as traders take profits or close positions. However, in the current cycle, open interest in Bitcoin derivatives has remained elevated or continued to climb even as the price reaches record levels. What does this signal? New Money Entering: High open interest at highs suggests new positions are being opened, not just old ones being rolled over or closed. This indicates fresh capital and new market participants are entering the derivatives space, often with bullish bets. Confidence in Continuation: Traders are willing to take on leveraged positions even at high prices, implying confidence that the rally is not over. Potential for Volatility: While bullish, high open interest also increases the potential for large price swings due to liquidations if the market moves sharply in one direction. This metric, analyzed alongside funding rates, provides insight into the leverage and conviction within the market, and current readings suggest a strong belief in further upside. Signal 5: Potential Short Liquidations Above $111,000 The derivatives market isn’t just about bullish bets. Many traders take short positions, betting on the price to fall. Data on liquidation levels shows where these short positions would be forced to close if the price rises, potentially triggering a cascade of buying. Analysis points to significant clusters of short positions that could face liquidation if Bitcoin surpasses levels between $111,000 and $115,000. Why is this a bullish signal? Liquidation Cascades: When the price hits these levels, automated systems force short sellers to buy Bitcoin to cover their positions. This sudden buying pressure can rapidly accelerate the price increase. Fuel for the Rally: These forced buys act as fuel, pushing the price higher and potentially triggering further liquidations at even higher levels. Weakening Opposition: Liquidating short positions removes market participants betting against the price rise, reducing selling pressure. The presence of these potential liquidation zones above current price levels creates a technical setup where a move higher could gain rapid momentum, helping propel the Bitcoin price towards and potentially beyond these targets. Putting It All Together: A Broader Bull Cycle Individually, each of these five signals provides a piece of the puzzle. Taken together, as highlighted by the Cointelegraph analysis of on-chain data and technical indicators, they paint a compelling picture of a market structure geared for further appreciation. Sustained whale accumulation reduces supply, robust Bitcoin ETF inflows create consistent demand, elevated sentiment encourages participation, high open interest shows conviction, and potential short liquidations offer technical upside fuel. The report suggests this isn’t just a temporary bounce, but rather that Bitcoin is firmly entrenched in a broader bull cycle. This cycle is characterized by fundamental shifts in adoption, market infrastructure (like ETFs), and increasing confidence from both retail and institutional players. Price Targets: $120,000+ and Beyond? Based on these bullish signals and the broader market context, the analysis indicates a strong likelihood of Bitcoin surpassing the $120,000 mark in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, the potential exists for the price to reach as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025. It’s important to remember that price targets are projections based on current data and market conditions. The path to these levels is unlikely to be a straight line, and volatility is inherent in the crypto market . However, the confluence of these five bullish factors provides a data-driven basis for these optimistic forecasts. What Does This Mean for Investors? For those participating in or watching the crypto market , these signals offer valuable insights: Actionable Insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange reserves, whale wallet movements, and long-term holder behavior. Track ETF Flows: Watch weekly or monthly reports on Bitcoin ETF inflows to gauge institutional and traditional investor demand. Understand Sentiment: While not a primary driver, sentiment indicators can help understand market psychology and potential short-term swings. Be Aware of Liquidation Levels: Understanding where significant liquidation clusters lie can help anticipate potential areas of accelerated price movement. Consider Long-Term Perspective: The analysis points to a broader bull cycle, suggesting that focusing on the long-term trend rather than short-term volatility may be beneficial. Potential Benefits: Significant price appreciation for existing holders. Opportunities for new investors to participate in a potentially growing market. Further maturation and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. Potential Challenges: Market volatility means significant price swings are possible. External factors (regulatory news, macroeconomic shifts) can impact the market. Reaching price targets is not guaranteed and depends on the continued strength of these signals and overall market conditions. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook Supported by Data The convergence of sustained whale accumulation , strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, positive investor sentiment, rising open interest at highs, and technical liquidation zones above current levels presents a powerful case for continued upside in the Bitcoin price . These signals, derived from detailed on-chain data and technical analysis, suggest the current market environment is robust and poised for further growth. While no market move is guaranteed, the weight of evidence points towards a high probability that Bitcoin is set to climb higher, with targets of $120,000 and potentially $200,000 appearing increasingly plausible within the next year and a half. For anyone interested in the future of finance and digital assets, keeping a close watch on these key indicators is essential.

According to market data from Coingecko, AVAX, which had a fully diluted valuation of about $10.2 billion and a 24 hour average trading volume of around $610 million, dropped nearly 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $22.44 at the time of this writing. What Happened to Avalanche Fundamentals The Avalanche network has grown to a vibrant web3 ecosystem with more than $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) and nearly $2 billion in stablecoins market cap. The mainstream adoption of the Avalanche network by institutional investors has been bolstered by the notable development of its ecosystem’s tokenization technology. As a result, the Avalanche network has achieved more than 46k active daily on-chain users. Meanwhile, several fund managers – led by VamEck, and Grayscale Investments – are seeking to offer spot AVAX ETFs in the United States in the near future. AVAX Price Expectations In the weekly timeframe, AVAX price has been recovering from the 2022 crypto bear market. The utility-focuses altcoin has been forming a macro bullish continuation since March 2024, which is characterized by a falling symmetrical channel in the weekly timeframe. In the four hour timeframe, AVAX price has been forming a symmetric triangular pattern in the past four weeks. AVAX price has respected a rising logarithmic trend established since April 9, thus signaling a bullish continuation pattern. According to on-chain data , AVAX price has established a robust support level above $22.8, especially after 362k wallets accumulated more than 21.65 million AVAX coins. Consequently, a consistent close beyond the liquidity level above $25 will trigger a fresh rejuvenated rally toward the target range between $35 and $55.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 00:10:41

The Blockchain Builders Fund , a fund with strong ties to Stanford University, has successfully closed its oversubscribed Fund I, securing a substantial $28 million. This significant milestone marks a fresh wave of investment specifically targeting promising pre-seed and seed-stage blockchain startups. What is the Blockchain Builders Fund and Why Does it Matter? The closure of the Blockchain Builders Fund ‘s first fund at $28 million, exceeding its initial target, signals robust investor confidence in the future of blockchain technology and its applications. What makes this fund particularly noteworthy is its affiliation with Stanford, suggesting a potential pipeline of talent and research-backed insights informing its investment decisions. By focusing on the earliest stages of startup development – pre-seed and seed – the fund is positioning itself to support founders right from the ground floor. This is a critical phase where startups require not just capital, but often strategic guidance, network access, and operational support to transform innovative ideas into viable products and businesses. Fueling Innovation: How the Fund is Investing in Web3 Startups The fund hasn’t just been raising capital; it’s already actively deploying it. According to a press release via Chainwire, the Blockchain Builders Fund has already allocated over $16 million from Fund I across a diverse portfolio of 40 projects. This demonstrates a rapid pace of investment and a broad scope of interest within the web3 ecosystem. The investments span several key sectors poised to drive the next wave of web3 adoption and innovation: Artificial Intelligence (AI): Exploring the intersection of AI and blockchain, potentially funding projects focused on decentralized AI, AI-enhanced dApps, or blockchain infrastructure for AI. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Supporting the evolution of financial applications built on blockchain, from lending and borrowing protocols to decentralized exchanges and novel financial instruments. Infrastructure: Investing in foundational technologies that make web3 more scalable, secure, interoperable, and user-friendly, such as layer 2 solutions, developer tools, and data protocols. Real-World Assets (RWA): Backing projects that tokenize or bring tangible assets onto the blockchain, unlocking new possibilities for liquidity and ownership in areas like real estate, art, or commodities. This strategic allocation across varied, high-growth sectors highlights the fund’s vision for a multi-faceted web3 future, powered by innovative web3 startups . The State of Blockchain Funding : A Sign of Market Confidence? In a market cycle that has seen periods of cautious investment, the successful oversubscription and closure of a $28 million fund dedicated to early-stage web3 is a positive signal. It suggests that despite market volatility, there remains significant capital eager to back foundational technologies and disruptive business models within the blockchain space. The fact that the fund is already more than halfway deployed ($16M out of $28M) across 40 projects reinforces the narrative that promising opportunities exist and are being actively pursued by investors. This level of activity in blockchain funding at the early stage is often seen as a leading indicator for future growth and innovation in the ecosystem. Why Focus on Early-Stage Crypto ? The Potential and the Risks Investing in early-stage crypto startups comes with inherent risks. Many projects fail to gain traction, navigate regulatory hurdles, or achieve product-market fit. However, the potential rewards can be substantial. Early-stage investments offer the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of technologies and companies that could potentially reshape industries. For the Blockchain Builders Fund, focusing on this stage allows them to work closely with founders, helping to shape their strategies, build strong teams, and navigate the complex web3 landscape. It’s an investment in potential, betting on visionary teams building the infrastructure and applications for the decentralized future. Navigating the Future: The Role of Venture Capital Web3 With $16 million already deployed, the Blockchain Builders Fund still has over $12 million remaining in Fund I. The plan is to invest this remainder by the end of the year. This indicates a continued push to identify and support promising projects in the coming months. The role of venture capital web3 funds like this is crucial for the health and growth of the ecosystem. They provide the necessary capital for innovation, help translate complex technical ideas into marketable products, and connect startups with the resources they need to scale. Their investment decisions often highlight emerging trends and areas of perceived high potential within the market. Conclusion The closure of the Blockchain Builders Fund’s $28 million Fund I is a significant development, injecting vital capital into the early-stage web3 ecosystem. With investments already spread across key areas like AI, DeFi, infrastructure, and RWAs, the fund is actively backing the builders of the decentralized future. This move underscores continued confidence in the potential of blockchain technology and highlights the critical role of venture capital in nurturing the next generation of web3 innovation.

As the chief executive officer of one of the most talked-about ventures in digital assets — Twenty-One Capital Inc., Mallers aims to reshape corporate Bitcoin holdings and challenge Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds over 580,000 BTC, valued at approximately $64 billion. Jack Mallers aims for Saylor’s crown with billion-dollar Bitcoin bet Twenty-One is supported by the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald LP, stablecoin powerhouse Tether Holdings SA, and the Japanese investment firm SoftBank Group. The company is not simply following the ever-expanding list of businesses chasing after the opportunity to imitate Strategy , Michael Saylor’s software firm that has been transformed into a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin — it is trying to beat it. Twenty-One Capital, backed by notable entities including Tether and Cantor Fitzgerald, recently disclosed a $458 million Bitcoin acquisition. The firm plans to publish its Bitcoin addresses to verify its reserves, emphasizing transparency in its operations. In contrast, Michael Saylor’s Strategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, recently purchasing an additional 4,020 BTC, bringing its total holdings to over 580,000 BTC. Mallers envisions Twenty-One Capital acquiring up to 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply, approximately 1 million BTC, signaling a bold ambition to rival Saylor. Many people outside the crypto community have recognized Jack Mallers mostly for being emotional in 2021 when he announced that Bitcoin would become legal tender in El Salvador at the biggest conference in Miami. How Mallers ended up as the leader of Twenty One may be as interesting as Mallers’s story about turning El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele onto Bitcoin. Mallers narrates his journey to explore Bitcoin Mallers explained that his path to Twenty-One went through Tether Holdings SA CEO Paolo Ardoino, who has known Mallers since his early days in Bitcoin. Mallers began revealing his exploration of Bitcoin. He explained that he grew up in and around traditional finance and was first exposed to Bitcoin in 2013 when his father co-founded and sold a discount futures brokerage. Apart from his father, his stepmother is deep in the crypto world, known as BitcoinMom on X. Mallers dropped out of college and founded Zap Solutions Inc., Strike’s parent company, when he was 23. Mallers also revealed that Tether’s sister company, Bitfinex, was the first major exchange to implement the Lightning Network. He continued by saying that he was one of the most vocal early developers of the Lightning Network, referring to the Bitcoin payment protocol. “And so Paolo and I would talk, and that was à la 2017,” the CEO of Strike concluded. In the meantime, Tether was establishing a deeper relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald, the investment bank that US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick led before he was recruited to work as part of President Donald Trump’s executive staff. Cantor helps oversee Tether’s reserves and holds a convertible bond with the largest Stablecoin operator. Lutnick has helped transform Tether, a firm formerly eyed with suspicion by Washington, into an unlikely ally of the president. Due to Cantor’s ties with Trump, Mallers mentioned that Tether is the only link between him and the bank and Lutnick, whose son Brandon currently manages the company. He admitted that he did not know Brandon well, but he was his banker. Crypto investors prefer Mallers to Saylor as a perfect choice for Twenty-One Mallers and Tether crossed each other’s paths over the years, including overlapping in El Salvador, where Strike and Tether now have headquarters. When Mallers launched Strike in El Salvador in 2021, it became the most downloaded app in the country. Strike first relied on Tether’s USDT stablecoin as a substitute for the dollar, but it quickly dumped USDT in favor of partnerships with banks in El Salvador. In 2023, Strike started adding Tether again to its platform. However, it was not until the end of last year when the concept for Twenty- One began to take shape, Mallers said. Mallers remembers meeting Tether and their team in November at a Plan B Forum, a conference co-hosted by the Swiss city of Lugano and Tether. “We had a smart conversation about the direction of the world, their plans, and my plans,” Mallers said. For many people, Mallers is an appealing choice to lead Twenty-One because he is so frank about his defense of Bitcoin. Whereas Saylor frequently appears as a serious businessperson, Mallers comes across with the “crypto bro” appeal that is quite attractive to retail crypto investors. Additionally, Mallers, like many online influencers, is active on his YouTube channel, where he uploads videos and hosts a weekly podcast about Bitcoin and the financial systems called The Jack Mallers Show. Mark Palmer, a senior analyst for fintech and digital assets at Benchmark, also stated that although Michael Saylor’s role as a promoter of Strategy and Bitcoin had been incredibly helpful, Jack Mallers, who is a charming person and famous in the crypto world, is a great choice to promote both Twenty-One Capital and Bitcoin.

Co-sponsored by eight other members of Congress—five Republicans and three Democrats—the legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. The CLARITY Act establishes how the United States should treat cryptocurrencies and digital assets. For years, the crypto industry has thrived in a legal gray zone. The absence of clear rules has confused and stifled innovation . This bill is meant to change that. It is a follow-up to last year’s Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), but it further lays out oversight duties. Representative Dusty Johnson said that America was poised to lead the world in the digital assets market but emphasized that this could not happen without a clear regulatory framework. The bill is long and is expected to be the focus of extensive negotiations among the two parties and chambers. In the meantime, it is a strong step forward for crypto legislation in Congress. Key provisions target market oversight The Clarity Act assigns most of the responsibility for supervising crypto trading markets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill confers “exclusive regulatory jurisdiction” on the CFTC for digital commodity spot markets — the areas where commonly used assets such as Bitcoin trade. Meanwhile, the SEC will continue to oversee digital assets classified as securities —those you invest in with the expectation of profiting from the efforts of others. According to this structure, crypto firms would be free to register with the CFTC or the SEC, depending on the digital assets they work with. The bill tenures provisional registration for crypto firms to begin operating while agencies work out the regulations. It also requires platforms to follow anti-money laundering rules outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act. For example, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and wallet providers will be excluded from SEC oversight in some cases. The Clarity Act, if implemented, would allow regulators only 12 months to promulgate rules. That timeline is relatively short in the arcane realm of financial rule-making, which can frequently drag on for years. Congress sparks debate with Clarity Act introduction The Clarity Act comes at a moment of increasing political fascination with crypto and pressure to regulate. Whereas the stablecoin bill is considered further along the track, this latest attempt targets larger market structure issues. The measure is backed heavily by House Republicans, particularly those on the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees. But its future is uncertain. Democrats are divided. Some worry the bill is overly friendly to the crypto industry. Others worry about links between crypto firms and Donald Trump, who has recently re-emerged in the political world. Still, a handful of Democrats have backed clear crypto standards — particularly if they safeguard consumers. The crypto industry, beyond Congress, is paying close attention. The bill has won praise from the crypto advocacy group Stand with Crypto. They describe it as a “big step forward” when providing companies and developers the legal certainty they need to do business in the U.S. Some experts suspect the bill and stablecoin legislation could eventually be bundled into a single package. That would produce an even broader crypto law — possibly the first in the United States. President Trump has urged Congress to pass both bills by August, before the congressional recess. But inside sources say that’s a highly ambitious goal. There will be hearings on the new bill next week. Members of Congress will also have an opportunity to publicly debate what’s in it, amendments, and the way forward.

Get ready for some exciting news that bridges the gap between blockchain technology and everyday student life. Zebec Network (ZBCN), known for its innovative Solana-based payment solutions, has just made a significant move that could change how students manage their money across the United Kingdom. In a press release shared via Chainwire, Zebec announced its acquisition of Science Card, a prominent platform already serving over 50,000 students in top UK universities. This isn’t just another corporate deal; it’s a strategic play set to accelerate the adoption of crypto debit card UK services and revolutionize student finance crypto possibilities. Breaking Down the Big News: The Zebec Acquisition Let’s dive into the details of this pivotal Zebec acquisition . Zebec Network is building a name for itself with its real-time, continuous payment streams and on-chain payroll solutions. By acquiring Science Card, they’re not just buying a company; they’re gaining immediate access to a large, established user base within a key demographic – university students. Science Card has built a strong presence within the UK university ecosystem, providing card services tailored to students. Imagine having a payment platform already integrated into campus life, trusted by thousands. That’s the foundation Zebec is now building upon. This move significantly strengthens Zebec’s existing suite of card offerings, which includes payroll cards and general-purpose crypto debit cards. Why is this such a big deal? For Zebec, it’s about rapid expansion and user acquisition in a targeted market. For UK students, it opens the door to potentially more flexible, efficient, and innovative ways to handle their finances, powered by blockchain technology. Bringing the Crypto Debit Card UK Experience to Students One of the most tangible outcomes of this acquisition is the potential for widespread adoption of the crypto debit card UK market specifically among students. While crypto debit cards have been around, integrating them directly into a platform already used by tens of thousands of students removes significant barriers to entry. So, what exactly is a crypto debit card? Think of it like a regular debit card, but instead of drawing funds directly from a traditional bank account, it’s linked to your cryptocurrency holdings. When you make a purchase, the crypto is instantly converted to the local currency (in this case, GBP) at the point of sale. This allows users to spend their crypto like regular money anywhere cards are accepted. For UK students, this could mean: Easy Spending: Using crypto to pay for textbooks, groceries, rent, or a well-deserved coffee without needing to manually convert it beforehand. Global Access: Potentially easier international transactions or online purchases. Exploring Crypto: A practical, low-friction way for students to engage with their crypto holdings in their daily lives. By integrating their crypto debit card capabilities with the Science Card platform, Zebec is poised to make spending crypto as easy as swiping a regular student ID or bank card on campus and beyond. Leveraging the Science Card UK Platform The genius of this acquisition lies in the existing infrastructure and user base of Science Card UK . This isn’t Zebec starting from scratch to build a student network; they’re plugging into one that’s already established and trusted. Science Card has successfully navigated the complexities of partnering with UK universities and understanding the specific financial needs and habits of students. Their platform likely includes features relevant to student life, such as discounts, budgeting tools, or integration with university services. Zebec’s challenge and opportunity now is to seamlessly integrate their blockchain payment technology and crypto debit card functionality into the existing Science Card experience. This means maintaining the familiar aspects that students rely on while introducing the new benefits of blockchain. Consider these integration possibilities: Adding an option to link a crypto wallet to the Science Card account. Allowing users to top up their card balance using various cryptocurrencies supported by Zebec. Providing educational resources within the app about managing crypto and using the debit card. The existing relationship Science Card has with over 50,000 students across leading UK institutions provides Zebec with a direct channel to a tech-savvy demographic that is often open to exploring new financial technologies. The Broader Impact on Blockchain Payments UK While the immediate focus is on students, this Zebec acquisition also has wider implications for the landscape of blockchain payments UK . A successful integration and adoption within the university sector could serve as a powerful case study for bringing blockchain-based payment solutions to other demographics and industries in the UK. The UK has been a significant hub for fintech innovation, but the widespread adoption of crypto for everyday payments is still in its early stages. Initiatives like this, which target a specific, receptive market segment with a practical use case (spending), can help normalize and accelerate the use of blockchain technology for transactions. Key takeaways for the UK blockchain payment space: Increased Visibility: Putting crypto debit cards into the hands of tens of thousands of students raises awareness and understanding. Infrastructure Development: This push requires robust backend systems for conversions, compliance, and transaction processing within the UK’s regulatory framework. Setting Precedent: A successful model in the student sector could inspire similar initiatives in other consumer or business segments. Furthermore, Zebec’s foundation on the Solana network highlights the potential for fast, low-cost transactions, which are crucial for micro-payments and frequent spending typical of student life. This acquisition could showcase Solana’s capabilities for real-world payment applications in the UK market. What Does This Mean for Student Finance Crypto? Let’s get specific about the impact on student finance crypto . University life often involves managing budgets carefully, dealing with student loans, part-time work, and various expenses. Introducing a crypto element adds a new dimension. For students who already hold crypto, this provides an easy way to access the value of their digital assets without complex off-ramping processes. For those new to crypto, the integrated platform could serve as a gentle introduction, making it less intimidating to get started. Potential Benefits for Students: Benefit Explanation Convenience Spend crypto easily at millions of locations worldwide. Access to Funds Quickly use the value of crypto holdings for immediate needs. Potential Rewards Some crypto cards offer rewards in crypto or other benefits (details pending Zebec’s integration). Financial Education Opportunity to learn about digital assets and blockchain in a practical way. Potential Challenges Students Should Be Aware Of: Price Volatility: The value of crypto can change rapidly, impacting the spending power of funds held. Regulatory Clarity: The UK’s stance on crypto regulation is evolving, which could affect services. Tax Implications: Spending crypto may have tax consequences depending on individual circumstances and local laws. Understanding Fees: Be aware of any conversion fees, transaction fees, or card maintenance fees. Actionable Insights for Students: If you’re a student at a UK university served by Science Card, keep an eye out for announcements from Zebec and Science Card regarding the integration. Understand how the new features work, research the cryptocurrencies supported, and start small if you’re new to spending crypto. Always prioritize understanding the risks involved, especially regarding volatility. Looking Ahead: The Future of Zebec and UK Student Finance The Zebec acquisition of Science Card is a bold step that positions Zebec to become a key player in the crypto debit card UK market, leveraging an established student network. It highlights the growing trend of blockchain companies seeking real-world use cases and direct consumer adoption. The success of this integration will depend on several factors, including the seamlessness of the technology, the clarity of communication to students, and adapting to the UK’s specific financial and regulatory environment. If successful, it could pave the way for further innovation in student finance crypto and significantly contribute to the broader adoption of blockchain payments UK . This isn’t just about payments; it’s about potentially empowering a new generation with tools to interact with digital assets in a practical, everyday context.

Meta AI, the AI assistant integrated across Meta’s suite of applications, has reached a remarkable benchmark, signaling widespread adoption and Meta’s aggressive push into the AI space. For those following the intersection of technology and digital platforms, this milestone is particularly noteworthy. Rapid Growth in Meta AI Users During the company’s annual shareholder meeting, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta AI now boasts one billion monthly active users. This figure represents a doubling of its user base in a relatively short period, up from 500 million monthly active users reported in September 2024. This rapid growth underscores the increasing consumer interaction with AI features embedded within popular social platforms. The integration of Meta AI across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger has clearly contributed to its swift ascent in user numbers. Making the AI assistant readily available where people already spend their time has removed significant barriers to adoption. What’s Next for Meta AI? Looking ahead, Mark Zuckerberg outlined Meta’s strategic focus for the AI assistant. The primary goal for this year is to enhance the user experience and position Meta AI as a leading personal AI assistant. Key areas of development include: Personalization: Making the AI more tailored to individual user needs and preferences. Voice Conversations: Improving the capability for natural and effective voice interactions. Entertainment: Expanding its use cases within entertainment contexts across Meta’s apps. This focus on deepening the experience suggests Meta is moving beyond basic AI interactions towards creating a more integral and valuable tool for its massive user base. Meta AI Milestone: Paving the Way for Monetization? With a user base of this scale, the question of monetization naturally arises. Zuckerberg indicated that the plan is to first build out the AI assistant’s capabilities and user engagement before focusing on generating revenue. However, he did mention potential future avenues for monetization as the assistant evolves: Inserting paid recommendations within interactions. Launching a subscription service for users seeking access to more compute power or premium features. Should Meta pursue a subscription model, it would enter into direct competition with established players like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which already offers paid tiers for enhanced access and capabilities. This move could reshape the landscape for consumer-facing AI services. The Role of the Standalone AI Assistant App Adding to Meta’s AI momentum, the company launched a standalone Meta AI app just a month prior to this announcement. While the primary driver of the billion users is likely the integration within existing apps, the dedicated app provides a focused environment for users who wish to interact with the AI outside of their social feeds. It also serves as a platform for Meta to test and roll out new AI features more directly. The rapid accumulation of Meta AI users demonstrates the tech giant’s commitment to making AI a core part of its ecosystem and future business model. As the AI assistant continues to evolve, its potential impact on how people interact with technology and digital content will be significant.

One of the most anticipated events in the crypto space is just around the corner. The Circle IPO is officially on the calendar, signaling a significant step for the stablecoin giant and the broader digital asset market. When is the Circle IPO Happening? According to recent reports, stablecoin issuer Circle is targeting the week of June 2nd for its initial public offering. This timeline suggests that the company has finalized key details, including the pricing structure and the official schedule for the launch. This move comes after previous attempts and market explorations, indicating Circle’s readiness to go public amidst improving market sentiment. BlackRock Circle: What’s the Interest? Adding another layer of intrigue to the offering is the reported interest from financial titan BlackRock. The world’s largest asset manager has shown interest in potentially acquiring a 10% stake in Circle. This isn’t the first time BlackRock and Circle have collaborated; BlackRock is a reserve manager for Circle’s USDC stablecoin, holding a portion of its reserves in BlackRock-managed money market funds. This existing relationship makes BlackRock’s potential investment in the public offering a notable development. Is a Pre-IPO BlackRock Deal Likely? While BlackRock’s interest is significant, securing a major pre-IPO deal at this late stage seems unlikely. According to Jay Woods, a strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, such substantial investment agreements are typically finalized much earlier in the IPO process. This suggests that if BlackRock were to acquire a stake, it would likely happen as part of the public offering itself rather than a separate, private transaction beforehand. Why is the Circle Stock Generating Buzz? The potential launch of Circle Stock is generating considerable buzz for several reasons: Improving Market Conditions: The broader financial markets, including tech and crypto-related sectors, have seen more favorable conditions recently, creating a better environment for new public offerings. Strong Demand: There appears to be robust interest from both retail and institutional investors. Reports suggest that major players like ARK Invest are considering a substantial purchase, potentially up to $150 million, signaling confidence in Circle’s business model and future prospects. Leading Stablecoin Position: Circle is the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Its central role in the digital economy and decentralized finance (DeFi) makes it a compelling investment opportunity for those looking for exposure to the crypto space through a regulated entity. What Does This Stablecoin IPO Mean for Crypto? Circle’s move to become a publicly traded company marks a significant milestone for the entire digital asset industry. As a major Stablecoin IPO , it provides traditional investors with direct exposure to a core piece of the crypto infrastructure through a regulated, transparent corporate structure. This could pave the way for more crypto-native companies to follow suit, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital economy. The Bigger Picture: Crypto IPOs on the Horizon? The successful launch of the Crypto IPO by Circle could serve as a crucial test case and a catalyst for other cryptocurrency companies considering going public. It demonstrates that investors are willing to back established, revenue-generating businesses within the crypto ecosystem. This trend could lead to increased transparency and regulatory clarity for the industry as more companies adopt the reporting standards required of public entities. Conclusion Circle’s planned IPO in early June, coupled with strong institutional interest from firms like BlackRock and ARK, highlights growing confidence in the stablecoin issuer and the broader crypto market. While a pre-IPO deal with BlackRock seems improbable at this stage, the overall market reception is expected to be positive. This public offering is not just about Circle; it represents a maturing moment for the crypto industry, offering traditional investors a new avenue to participate in the digital asset revolution.

The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to political debate, but recent developments in the UK are particularly noteworthy. Nigel Farage, the prominent leader of the Reform Party, has unveiled ambitious plans that could fundamentally alter the landscape of UK crypto regulation if his party secures victory in the upcoming general election. This isn’t just minor tinkering; Farage is proposing a bill designed to propel the UK into becoming a global ‘crypto powerhouse’, a vision that surprisingly echoes the stance taken by former US President Donald Trump. What is the Core of the Proposed UK Crypto Bill? At the heart of Nigel Farage’s pitch to the nation’s crypto enthusiasts lies a specific legislative proposal – a dedicated UK crypto bill . This bill isn’t a vague promise; it outlines concrete steps intended to foster growth and adoption within the digital asset space. According to reports, the key pillars of this proposed legislation are designed to make the UK a significantly more attractive jurisdiction for crypto investors and businesses alike. Let’s break down the main components: Reduced Capital Gains Tax: One of the most significant proposals is the intention to slash the capital gains tax rate on crypto investments down to a flat 10%. This is a dramatic reduction from current rates, which can be as high as 20% for higher-rate taxpayers, and is seen as a direct incentive to encourage investment and trading activity within the UK. Regulatory Sandbox for Innovation: The bill aims to establish a dedicated regulatory sandbox specifically for crypto innovation. This provides a controlled environment where businesses can test new technologies, products, and services without facing the full burden of existing regulations initially. It’s designed to encourage experimentation and growth in a safe manner, allowing regulators and innovators to work together. Ensuring the Right to Use Crypto for Payments: A foundational element of broader crypto adoption is its utility in everyday transactions. The proposed bill seeks to explicitly protect and ensure the right for individuals and businesses to use cryptocurrency for payments. This move could pave the way for greater integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. These proposals collectively signal a potential shift from a cautious, sometimes perceived as restrictive, regulatory approach to one that is actively seeking to attract crypto talent and capital. Understanding Nigel Farage’s Crypto Stance For many, linking Nigel Farage crypto policy might seem unexpected. Known primarily for his euroscepticism and populist politics, his foray into the specifics of digital asset regulation highlights the growing importance of crypto as a political issue. Farage’s messaging positions this move as part of a broader strategy to modernize the UK economy, cut red tape, and attract industries of the future. His engagement with the crypto topic isn’t just about economic policy; it’s also a clear attempt to connect with a specific demographic. The cryptocurrency community, particularly younger individuals, often expresses frustration with traditional financial systems and regulatory hurdles. By proposing policies that are seen as pro-crypto, Farage and the Reform Party are directly appealing to this segment of the electorate. This political manoeuvre is proving to be potentially effective. Recent polls and reports indicate that the Reform Party has seen a notable surge in support, particularly among younger voters aged 18-34. While it’s difficult to attribute this rise solely to their crypto stance, it undoubtedly plays a role in differentiating them from more established parties and signalling an openness to new technologies that resonate with this demographic. The Reform Party Crypto Policy: Mirroring Trump’s Approach? One of the most intriguing aspects of Farage’s proposal is the explicit comparison being drawn to Donald Trump’s recent pivot towards a more crypto-friendly position in the United States. Trump, who previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, has increasingly embraced digital assets, holding crypto and making public statements supportive of the industry, often contrasting his view with that of the Biden administration. The parallels between the two leaders’ approaches are striking: Aspect Nigel Farage (UK) Donald Trump (US) Overall Goal Make UK a “crypto powerhouse” Support crypto industry, prevent hostile regulation Key Proposals (Farage) / Stance (Trump) Lower Capital Gains Tax, Regulatory Sandbox, Right to Payments Preventing Fed CBDC, Accepting Crypto Donations, General Pro-Crypto Rhetoric Target Demographic Younger, tech-savvy voters Younger, tech-savvy voters, crypto community Political Strategy Differentiate from opponents, attract future industries Differentiate from opponents, appeal to a growing voter bloc Public Persona Populist, anti-establishment Populist, anti-establishment This mirroring suggests a potential emerging trend in populist politics globally: recognizing the growing economic and political significance of the crypto space and actively courting its participants. Both leaders, known for their anti-establishment appeal, seem to understand that the crypto community often views excessive regulation and traditional financial structures with suspicion. By positioning themselves as champions of crypto, they tap into this sentiment. What Does This Mean for Crypto Tax UK? Let’s delve deeper into the potential impact on crypto tax UK . The current system can be complex, with capital gains tax applied to profits from selling, trading, or gifting crypto. The rate depends on an individual’s overall income and whether they are a basic or higher-rate taxpayer, ranging from 10% to 20% (on gains above the annual allowance). For businesses, crypto is generally subject to Corporation Tax. Farage’s proposal for a flat 10% capital gains tax rate on crypto is a significant departure. This would make the UK’s crypto tax regime potentially one of the most competitive among major economies. The argument for this reduction is multi-faceted: Stimulate Investment: A lower tax burden incentivizes investors to enter the market and trade more actively, potentially increasing liquidity and market size. Attract Capital: Lower taxes can make the UK a more attractive destination for international crypto investors and funds. Simplify Compliance: While not explicitly stated how it would be simplified beyond the rate, a flat rate could potentially simplify calculations for some investors. Increase Tax Revenue (Potentially): The Laffer Curve principle suggests that sometimes lowering tax rates can lead to increased overall tax revenue due to stimulated economic activity. Proponents of the 10% rate would argue this could be the case for crypto. However, critics might raise concerns about fairness (is it equitable to tax crypto gains lower than other asset classes?) and the potential impact on government revenue in the short term. Nevertheless, for crypto investors in the UK, this specific proposal is likely the most immediately impactful part of the potential bill. Challenges and Opportunities for UK Crypto Regulation Implementing a comprehensive UK crypto regulation framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and preventing illicit activity is a delicate balancing act. Farage’s proposed bill presents both significant opportunities and considerable challenges. Opportunities: Becoming a Global Leader: A clear, favorable regulatory environment could position the UK as a preferred location for crypto businesses, startups, and talent, competing with jurisdictions like Switzerland, Singapore, or parts of the US. Fostering Innovation: The regulatory sandbox, in particular, offers a structured way to allow new ideas to flourish without being stifled by outdated rules. Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector can contribute to job creation, investment, and overall economic output. Increased Adoption: Making it easier and more appealing to hold and use crypto could accelerate mainstream adoption among the UK population. Challenges: Defining ‘Crypto’: Regulation needs clear definitions. What specific digital assets would fall under this bill? How would it handle rapidly evolving areas like DeFi, NFTs, or stablecoins? Consumer Protection: While encouraging innovation is key, ensuring adequate protection for retail investors from scams, fraud, and market volatility remains paramount. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system requires robust AML/CTF measures, which can be complex with decentralized technologies. Balancing with Traditional Finance: How would this new framework interact with existing financial regulations and institutions? Would it create an uneven playing field? Political Opposition: Any new bill, especially one touching on complex and sometimes controversial areas like crypto, will face scrutiny and potential opposition from other political parties and stakeholders. The success of such a bill would heavily depend on the details of its implementation and the ability of regulators to adapt to the fast pace of technological change in the crypto space. Can the UK Truly Become a Crypto Powerhouse? Nigel Farage’s ambition is clear: to make the UK a dominant force in the global crypto economy. The proposals within the potential UK crypto bill , particularly the tax reduction and regulatory sandbox, are certainly steps that align with this goal. Countries that have adopted favorable regulatory environments have seen significant growth in their crypto sectors. However, achieving ‘powerhouse’ status requires more than just a favorable bill. It necessitates: Talent Pool: Ensuring a skilled workforce in blockchain technology, cybersecurity, and finance. Infrastructure: Reliable digital infrastructure and connectivity. Banking Relationships: Crypto businesses often struggle with obtaining banking services; supportive traditional finance is crucial. Global Reputation: Building trust and a reputation for regulatory clarity and stability on the international stage. While the proposed bill lays a foundation, becoming a ‘powerhouse’ is a long-term project requiring sustained effort and a holistic approach across various sectors. The Road Ahead for Reform Party Crypto Policy The future of the Reform Party crypto policy hinges significantly on the outcome of the next UK general election. If the party gains substantial influence or forms part of a government, these proposals could move from aspiration to legislation. The rising support for Reform, particularly among demographics interested in crypto, gives these proposals a degree of political weight they might not have had previously. It will be crucial to watch how other political parties react to these proposals. Will they ignore them, criticize them, or perhaps adopt similar, albeit modified, stances to appeal to the same voters? The conversation around crypto regulation in the UK is clearly evolving, pushed forward by these explicit political commitments. For anyone involved in the UK crypto space, understanding the nuances of these proposals and the political forces behind them is essential. It could signal a fundamental shift in how digital assets are treated in the country, impacting everything from investment strategies to business operations. Summary: Nigel Farage and the Reform Party have put forward a bold vision for the UK’s future in the digital asset space, proposing a dedicated UK crypto bill aimed at creating a ‘crypto powerhouse’. Key elements include a significant reduction in crypto tax UK capital gains to 10%, the establishment of a regulatory sandbox, and ensuring the right to use crypto for payments. This approach mirrors recent moves by Donald Trump in the US, highlighting a potential global trend among populist leaders to appeal to the growing crypto community. While the proposals offer clear benefits for fostering innovation and attracting investment, they also present challenges related to implementation, consumer protection, and integration with existing financial systems.

Recently, attention has been drawn to a prominent Hyperliquid whale trader, identified as James Wynn, who is reportedly facing a substantial unrealized loss on a large Bitcoin position. What Happened to the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bitcoin Long? According to data shared by HypurrScan and cited by JinSe Finance, James Wynn, known for his significant trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform, holds a substantial Bitcoin long position. This position, however, is currently underwater, facing an unrealized loss estimated at a staggering $5.4 million. The details surrounding this specific trade highlight the inherent risks associated with high leverage: Trader: James Wynn (a known Hyperliquid whale) Platform: Hyperliquid Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) Position Type: Long (betting on price increase) Leverage: 40x Current Situation: Facing an unrealized loss of approximately $5.4 million An ‘unrealized loss’ means the position is currently losing money based on the market price, but the loss isn’t locked in unless the position is closed or, critically, liquidated. Understanding Leveraged Trading and Liquidation Price This situation brings the concepts of leveraged trading and the liquidation price into sharp focus. Leveraged trading allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. In this case, 40x leverage means James Wynn is trading a Bitcoin position 40 times larger than the initial margin (collateral) he put down. While leverage can significantly amplify profits if the market moves favorably, it equally magnifies losses when the market moves against the position. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out the initial margin. This is where the liquidation price becomes critical. The liquidation price is the specific market price at which a leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent the trader’s losses from exceeding their margin. For James Wynn’s 40x Bitcoin long, the reported liquidation price is set at $106,340. This means if the price of Bitcoin were to drop to this level, Hyperliquid would automatically close his position, realizing the full loss and potentially more, depending on market conditions during liquidation. For a 40x long position, a relatively small percentage drop in the price of Bitcoin can lead to liquidation. Conversely, a 40x short position would face liquidation if the price rose significantly. Why Do Traders Use Such High Leverage? Given the immense risk, one might wonder why traders, especially large ones like a Hyperliquid whale , would use such high leverage like 40x. The primary reason is the potential for outsized returns. Consider this: Without leverage, a 1% increase in Bitcoin price yields a 1% profit on the invested capital. With 40x leverage, a mere 0.25% increase in Bitcoin price could theoretically yield a 10% profit on the initial margin (0.25% * 40 = 10%). This potential to generate significant profits from small price movements attracts aggressive traders. However, the flip side is equally true: a small adverse price movement can lead to rapid and substantial losses, including the loss of the entire initial margin upon reaching the liquidation price . The Implications of a Large Crypto Loss A potential crypto loss of $5.4 million is significant, even for a whale trader. While whales often have deep pockets and can withstand large losses, an event like this highlights the extreme volatility and risk present in the crypto markets, particularly on perpetual futures platforms like Hyperliquid. For the individual trader, reaching the liquidation price means their entire margin for that position is gone. For the platform and other traders, a large liquidation can sometimes add selling pressure to the market, although sophisticated platforms like Hyperliquid have mechanisms designed to minimize market impact. This situation serves as a stark reminder: High leverage is a double-edged sword. Market conditions can change rapidly, turning profitable positions into losing ones quickly. Liquidation is a real and present danger in leveraged trading. Lessons for Traders from This Hyperliquid Whale Situation While the scale of a Hyperliquid whale ‘s position is far beyond that of most retail traders, the principles and risks remain the same. This event offers valuable lessons: Understand Leverage: Never use leverage you don’t fully comprehend. Know the exact price point where your position will be liquidated. Risk Management is Key: Always trade with a stop-loss order to limit potential losses before the liquidation price is reached. Only risk a small percentage of your total trading capital on any single trade. Start Small: If you’re new to leveraged trading, begin with very low leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) to understand the dynamics before considering higher amounts. Volatility Matters: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets. High leverage combined with high volatility dramatically increases the risk of rapid liquidation. Don’t Blindly Follow Whales: While tracking large traders can offer insights, their risk tolerance and capital reserves are vastly different from yours. A loss they can absorb could be catastrophic for a smaller trader. The potential crypto loss faced by James Wynn underscores that even experienced, large-scale traders are not immune to the inherent risks of the market and the amplified dangers of high leverage. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale of High Stakes Bitcoin Longs The situation involving the Hyperliquid whale James Wynn and his substantial unrealized loss on a 40x Bitcoin long serves as a powerful cautionary tale. It vividly illustrates the immense potential rewards and, more importantly, the catastrophic risks associated with high-stakes leveraged trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market. With a reported liquidation price of $106,340 looming, the outcome of this specific position remains uncertain. However, the event itself provides a crucial reminder for all traders: understand your tools, manage your risk diligently, and be acutely aware of the price points that could lead to a significant crypto loss . In the world of high leverage, the margin for error is incredibly thin. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

A recent development that has captured attention is the latest funding round for Twenty One , a prominent Bitcoin treasury firm. The company has successfully raised an additional $100 million, pushing its total capital raised to an impressive $685 million. This news comes as the firm makes significant strides towards a major SPAC merger , signaling growing confidence in the institutional adoption of digital assets and highlighting the potential for substantial Cryptocurrency Investment in structured financial products. Twenty One’s Funding Milestone: Reaching $685 Million The additional $100 million was secured through convertible senior secured notes. This type of financing allows investors to potentially convert their debt into equity at a later date, often under specific conditions. According to CoinDesk, this recent infusion of capital stems from existing investors and sponsors exercising options that were part of an earlier fundraising round in April. Key details of the financing include: Amount Raised: An additional $100 million. Financing Instrument: Convertible senior secured notes. Total Capital: Brings Twenty One’s total capital raised to $685 million. Source: Existing investors and sponsors exercising April options. Note Terms: 1% coupon rate, due in 2030. This substantial fundraising underscores strong investor belief in Twenty One’s strategy and future prospects, particularly as a leading Digital Asset Firm focused on treasury management involving Bitcoin . Navigating the Path to Public Markets: The SPAC Merger with CEP Beyond the funding news, Twenty One is actively progressing towards a merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners (CEP). The chosen route for this significant corporate event is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger structure. What is a SPAC merger? A SPAC, often called a “blank check company,” is a firm with no commercial operations that is formed solely to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company. For a private company like Twenty One, merging with a listed SPAC offers an alternative path to becoming a publicly traded entity compared to a traditional IPO. The strategic rationale behind this SPAC merger with a reputable financial institution like CEP is clear. It provides Twenty One with: Public Listing: Access to public capital markets. Enhanced Credibility: Association with a long-standing financial player like Cantor Equity Partners. Increased Visibility: Greater exposure to institutional and retail investors. This move is a significant step for a Digital Asset Firm seeking mainstream financial integration. Twenty One’s Strategy: A Focus on Bitcoin and Treasury Management Twenty One positions itself as a Bitcoin treasury firm. This implies a focus on holding and managing significant amounts of Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, potentially similar to other public companies that have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Led by Brandon Lutnick, the firm’s actions suggest a strong conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. This is further evidenced by their disclosed $458 million Bitcoin acquisition earlier this month. Such substantial acquisitions by institutional players are closely watched indicators of increasing institutional confidence and can influence overall sentiment around Cryptocurrency Investment . What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investment and the Market? The developments surrounding Twenty One , its significant fundraising, and its impending SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners carry broader implications for the digital asset landscape and Cryptocurrency Investment : Institutional Validation: Large fundraising rounds and mergers involving established financial names signal growing institutional acceptance and integration of digital assets. M&A Trend: This highlights a potential trend of mergers and acquisitions as digital asset firms seek scale, regulatory clarity, and access to traditional financial markets. Maturation of the Space: The use of sophisticated financial instruments like convertible notes and structures like SPACs indicates the increasing maturity of the digital asset industry. Focus on Bitcoin: Twenty One’s clear focus on Bitcoin treasury management reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a potential corporate reserve asset. For investors interested in the institutional side of crypto, Twenty One’s journey provides a compelling case study of how a Digital Asset Firm is navigating growth and seeking integration with traditional finance. Conclusion Twenty One’s successful raising of an additional $100 million, bringing its total capital to $685 million, is a significant financial milestone. Coupled with the active progress towards a SPAC merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners, these events underscore the firm’s ambitious growth trajectory and the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world. As a dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm, Twenty One’s strategic moves, including its recent substantial Bitcoin acquisition, reflect a strong commitment to digital assets. This progression is a positive indicator for the broader landscape of institutional Cryptocurrency Investment and the continued evolution of the Digital Asset Firm ecosystem.

When it comes to digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, the lack of a defined legal framework has been a significant hurdle for many businesses looking to integrate this technology. However, recent comments from a major player in the traditional finance space suggest that progress on this front could be a game-changer. The prospect of a US stablecoin bill is being viewed with optimism by industry leaders. Why Does the MoneyGram CEO See This as a ‘Huge Unlock’? Anthony Soohoo, the CEO of MoneyGram, a long-standing global leader in cross-border peer-to-peer payments, recently shared his perspective on the potential impact of forthcoming stablecoin regulation in the U.S. According to reports from financial news aggregators, Soohoo described the passage of such legislation as a “huge unlock” from a business standpoint. But what exactly does this mean, and why is a company like MoneyGram so interested in stablecoins? For MoneyGram, a business deeply entrenched in facilitating the movement of money across borders, stablecoins represent a potential evolution of their core services. Here’s a breakdown of why clear rules around stablecoins could be so impactful: Faster Settlements: Traditional cross-border payments can involve multiple intermediaries and take days to settle. Stablecoins, built on blockchain technology, offer the potential for near-instantaneous settlement, drastically reducing transaction times. Lower Costs: Reducing the number of intermediaries and streamlining the settlement process can lead to significant cost savings, both for the business and the end consumer sending or receiving money. Expanded Reach: Stablecoins could potentially open up new corridors and markets where traditional banking infrastructure is less accessible or more expensive. Innovation in Financial Products: Regulatory clarity allows companies to build new services and products on top of stablecoin rails, fostering innovation in payments, remittances, and potentially other financial services. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: The current ambiguous regulatory landscape creates risk and hinders investment. A clear US stablecoin bill would provide the necessary legal certainty for businesses to confidently invest in and deploy stablecoin-based solutions at scale. Soohoo’s comments underscore the growing recognition among established financial institutions that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, are not just a fringe technology but a powerful tool that can enhance existing business models and create new opportunities, provided the regulatory environment is conducive. What Could Stablecoin Legislation Entail? While the specifics of any potential US stablecoin bill are still being debated in Congress, discussions generally revolve around key areas aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring stability and consumer protection. Potential elements of such legislation could include: Issuance Standards: Requirements for stablecoin issuers regarding reserves (what assets back the stablecoin), transparency, and auditing. This is crucial for ensuring that a stablecoin maintains its peg to the underlying asset (like the US dollar). Licensing and Supervision: Establishing which regulatory bodies (e.g., banking regulators, SEC, CFTC) would oversee stablecoin issuers and potentially other entities involved in stablecoin activities. Consumer Protection: Rules designed to protect users from fraud, ensure clear disclosure of risks, and provide recourse in case of issues. Interoperability: Potentially addressing how different stablecoins and traditional financial systems can interact seamlessly. Passing comprehensive crypto regulation, specifically for stablecoins, is seen by proponents as essential for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in financial innovation. Without clear rules, businesses might hesitate to build and operate stablecoin services within the U.S., potentially pushing this activity to other jurisdictions. The Broader Impact of a US Stablecoin Bill The enthusiasm expressed by the MoneyGram CEO highlights a significant shift. It indicates that major players in traditional finance are not only observing the digital asset space but are actively anticipating and advocating for regulatory clarity to leverage this technology. A well-crafted US stablecoin bill could have ripple effects beyond just payments and remittances: Increased Institutional Adoption: Regulatory certainty is a major factor for larger financial institutions considering entering the digital asset space. Clear rules for stablecoins could pave the way for broader adoption across various financial sectors. Enhanced Dollar Dominance: By providing a clear framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins, the U.S. could strengthen the international role of the dollar in the digital age. Foundation for Future Innovation: Stablecoins are often seen as a foundational element for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based applications. Regulation could provide a stable base for these sectors to grow responsibly. While challenges remain, including finding the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks, the potential benefits articulated by leaders like MoneyGram’s CEO underscore the importance of legislative action. The passage of a thoughtful US stablecoin bill is widely anticipated as a crucial step towards integrating digital assets more fully into the mainstream economy. Conclusion: A Path to Growth Through Clarity Anthony Soohoo’s characterization of a US stablecoin bill as a “huge unlock” for business is a powerful endorsement from a company that understands the complexities of moving money globally. His comments reflect a growing sentiment within the financial industry that clear, effective stablecoin legislation is not just about regulating a new technology, but about enabling significant business efficiencies, cost reductions, and opportunities for innovation. As discussions continue in Washington, the business world, from established giants like MoneyGram to agile fintech startups, will be watching closely, hopeful that regulatory clarity will indeed unlock the full potential of stablecoins and other digital assets in the United States.

Judson Althoff, a Chief commercial officer of Microsoft, told workers that the British Universal bank signed on to buy 100,000 licenses of Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant, marking a significant deal. At the standard list price of $30 per user per month, this deal could generate approximately $36 million in annual revenue for the tech firm, though large clients typically receive bulk discounts. Microsoft has embedded Copilot, its flagship AI offering, across its products. During the firm’s third-quarter earnings call on April 30, CEO Satya Nadella listed an array of Copilot-infused applications and strong adoptions. According to Nadella, the tech firm is previewing a first-of-its-kind software engineering agent capable of asynchronously handling developer tasks. He noted that GitHub Copilot now has over 15 million users, a more than fourfold increase year-over-year, with adoption by both digital-native firms like Twilio and large enterprises including Cisco, HPE, Skyscanner, and Target, all leveraging the tool to embed AI across the entire software development lifecycle. Microsoft reveals its main focus of increasing Copilot adoption The people who wished to remain anonymous as the deal was privately revealed that Althoff said several dozen clients — such as Accenture Plc, Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG, and Siemens AG — now have more than 100,000 Copilot users. Microsoft is concentrating on getting Copilot adopted and is closely monitoring how much of the customer workforce is using the tools, Satya Narayana Nadella, a chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft, said during a company-wide town hall event. Following its close partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and as such, it is inserting Copilot into its suite of productivity apps. The world’s largest software maker is seen as a leader in commercializing AI products. Microsoft said in January that its AI suite, which includes cloud infrastructure and AI applications, was on track to achieve at least $13 billion in annual revenue. Despite all these progresses, Wall Street is still eager to see proof that the multibillion-dollar bet is working. Corporate clients describe Copilot as a measured rollout and a series of trials Many anecdotes have emerged on corporate customers adopting Copilot, but Microsoft has not shared a total customer count or the financial impact of those sales. Other corporate clients have said the tools need a lot of internal tweaks and employee training. Moreover, many say their use of Copilot is best described not as a race to equip all of their employees with the expensive software as quickly as possible but as a measured rollout plus a series of trials. Weeks after disclosing plans to lay off 6,000 workers — nearly 3% of the workforce — Microsoft also has reason to rally the troops. In the meeting, Nadella addressed the cuts and explained that they were driven by organizational changes rather than employee performance. The layoffs were concentrated on the people who build the company’s products, suggesting that even engineering jobs are not immune to the age of artificial intelligence. Microsoft declined to comment on the matter. Representatives from Barclays, Accenture, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Siemens also did not provide a statement.

Bitcoin $90,000 Dream Is A “Fairy Tale” “To make it clear,” the analyst wrote, “the idea to casually dip to 90K and resume the daily uptrend sounds like a fairy tale to me.” According to Dr. Cat, such a move would require Bitcoin to breach no fewer than four critical support levels on higher timeframes, which he considers “so unrealistic that… [it] may come only in the dreams of someone sidelined waiting for these prices.” Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Instead, Dr. Cat identifies a narrow window of “imbalances” across the daily, 2-day, and 3-day Ichimoku indicators—most notably between $102,600 and $106,300—that remain untapped. “These are pending a touch,” he noted, pointing to the Kijun Sen and Tenkan Sen levels as crucial balance markers. The weekly Chikou Span (lagging span), a key indicator in Ichimoku theory, currently sits above prior candle closes—a historically bullish condition that suggests Bitcoin is still in a strong uptrend unless it closes below those support levels. Dr. Cat charted these historical supports using the 26-period look-back rule: approximately $103.600 for this week, rising to $108.300 by mid-June before dipping toward $99,000 by late June. “If CS has managed to keep above candles so well until now on the steepest past slope, it’s very unlikely to go below them,” he emphasized. However, the bullish case comes with a short fuse. A pivotal technical event—the bullish TK cross on the weekly chart—is expected on June 9. “But if [it’s] below ATH, it will be fake as Kijun Sen will be flat,” he warned. In plain terms: unless Bitcoin prints a new all-time high shortly after the TK cross, the signal will be invalidated. On the other hand, a new ATH post-cross would confirm what Dr. Cat calls a “super clear and bullish signal: very, very unlikely not to be followed immediately by a strong bullish continuation.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock Notably, he flags a divergence between BTCUSD and BTCEUR, the latter of which is already showing the Chikou Span dipping into candle territory, a neutral-to-bearish signal. “BTCEUR… looks significantly worse than BTCUSD,” he observed. “This chart is simply neutral and can go either way: much higher than here, or as low as ~70K EUR.” He attributes some of the current BTCUSD bullishness to USD weakness, adding that mid-June will likely clarify whether this price strength is structurally sound or artificially inflated. Zooming out to the monthly chart, Dr. Cat unveiled his most aggressive forecast yet: $270,000 per BTC, based on Ichimoku Price Theory’s “4E model.” While he acknowledged this as a “wild guess,” he argued that the crypto market tends to defy consensus expectations. “Plenty of people seem to be skeptical of this bull run,” he said. “And even if they expect it to continue, they bet mostly on shy/moderate targets. My bet is on the latter [being surpassed].” The next two to three weeks will be decisive. A failure to break all-time highs in June—combined with Chikou Span weakness or daily trend breakdowns—could signal a prolonged cool-off into Q4. Until then, all eyes are on the weekly TK cross and the market’s reaction. At press time, BTC traded at $108,783.

Veteran gold advocate and renowned Bitcoin skeptic, Peter Schiff, recently stirred the pot by attending the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. His presence alone was noteworthy, but it was his outspoken commentary that truly grabbed headlines, reigniting the fiery Peter Schiff Bitcoin debate. Schiff didn’t hold back, leveling sharp criticisms against the leading cryptocurrency and firmly reiterating his long-held belief that only gold holds the status of a true reserve asset. What Exactly Did Peter Schiff Claim About Bitcoin? Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, used the platform not to praise Bitcoin, but to dismantle its perceived value and purpose. His core arguments, as stated during or around the conference, were pointed and direct: No Intrinsic Value: Schiff asserted that Bitcoin is an asset devoid of intrinsic value. Unlike commodities or productive assets, he argues, Bitcoin doesn’t inherently produce anything or have a physical use case beyond speculation. This lack of inherent worth, in his view, means it cannot create real wealth in the traditional sense. A ‘Giant Cult’: Perhaps his most provocative claim was labeling the Bitcoin community a “giant cult.” This suggests a group bound by fervent, perhaps irrational, belief rather than fundamental value or logic. Not a Technological Innovation: Countering a common narrative, Schiff dismissed Bitcoin as a significant technological breakthrough, instead comparing its structure and market dynamics to that of a meme coin – assets often driven purely by hype and community sentiment rather than underlying technology or utility. Gold is the ONLY True Reserve Asset: Schiff doubled down on his stance that gold is the unparalleled store of value and the sole true reserve asset. He cited the continued purchasing of gold by central banks globally as evidence supporting this claim, contrasting it sharply with their lack of significant Bitcoin holdings. These statements underscore the fundamental divide between gold bugs like Schiff and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world. For Schiff, Bitcoin’s value is purely speculative, a bubble waiting to burst, while gold’s value is timeless, proven by millennia of history and its tangible nature. Exploring the Core of the Bitcoin Intrinsic Value Debate The concept of Bitcoin intrinsic value is a central point of contention. For traditional investors like Schiff, intrinsic value is often tied to physical properties, utility, or the ability to generate future cash flows (like a stock). Gold has industrial uses, serves as jewelry, and has a long history as a medium of exchange and store of value. Bitcoin proponents argue that its value isn’t ‘intrinsic’ in the traditional sense, but derived from other crucial factors: Decentralization: Its independence from central authorities makes it censorship-resistant and a hedge against traditional financial system risks. Scarcity: The hard cap of 21 million coins creates digital scarcity, a key driver of value, similar to how the limited supply of gold contributes to its value. Network Effect: The growing number of users, developers, and businesses built around Bitcoin increases its utility and security. Security: The robust proof-of-work mechanism makes the network incredibly secure against attacks. Utility as Digital Gold/Store of Value: In a digital age, Bitcoin offers a way to store and transfer value across borders without intermediaries, acting as a digital alternative to gold. While Bitcoin lacks physical form or industrial use, its value proposition lies in its unique digital properties and the robust network supporting it. The debate hinges on whether these digital attributes constitute a form of ‘intrinsic’ or fundamental value in the 21st century. Is the Bitcoin Community a ‘Giant Cult’? Addressing the Bitcoin Cult Claim Schiff’s description of the community as a Bitcoin cult is undoubtedly inflammatory. While the term ‘cult’ typically implies blind devotion, manipulative leadership, and isolation from reality, the Bitcoin community is characterized by passionate belief, strong evangelism, and a shared vision for a decentralized future. Similar to early adopters of any revolutionary technology or movement, Bitcoin enthusiasts often display deep conviction and are eager to convert others. They pore over technical details, debate economic theories, and actively participate in promoting adoption. This passion can sometimes be perceived as cult-like by outsiders, especially given the asset’s volatility and the strong conviction many holders have in its long-term success despite setbacks. However, comparing it directly to a harmful cult ignores the open, decentralized nature of the community, the lack of a single leader, and the fact that participation is voluntary and based on investment thesis or ideological alignment rather than coercive control. While pockets of extreme views or toxic behavior exist, labeling the entire global community a ‘cult’ is a broad generalization that many find unfair and dismissive. Bitcoin vs Gold: The Ultimate Reserve Asset Showdown The core of Schiff’s argument and a perpetual topic of discussion is the Bitcoin vs Gold comparison. For centuries, gold has been the go-to asset during times of economic uncertainty, held by individuals and nations alike as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Its status as a Gold reserve asset is well-established. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a newcomer, only gaining prominence in the last decade. Its proponents argue it possesses properties that make it superior to gold in the digital age. Let’s look at a comparison: Feature Gold Bitcoin Intrinsic Value (Traditional View) Yes (Physical, Industrial, Jewelry) Debatable (Digital Utility, Network Effect) Scarcity Finite (Mining is difficult but supply increases) Absolutely Finite (Hard cap of 21 million) Portability Difficult (Heavy, requires security) Easy (Digital, can be sent anywhere instantly) Divisibility Difficult (Cutting/melting) Easy (Divisible up to 8 decimal places – satoshis) Verifiability Requires expertise/equipment Easy (Blockchain transparency) Storage Cost/Security Requires secure vaults, insurance Requires digital security (wallets, keys) Historical Precedent as Money/Store of Value Thousands of years ~15 years Central Bank Adoption as Reserve Asset Widespread and increasing Minimal (Some exploration/discussion) Volatility Relatively low High While gold has the advantage of history and stability, Bitcoin excels in areas like portability, divisibility, and transparency in the digital realm. The debate isn’t just about which is better, but whether Bitcoin can carve out its own role as a digital store of value or even a future reserve asset alongside, or perhaps eventually challenging, gold. Why Do Central Banks Still Prefer Gold? Schiff correctly points out that central banks are currently buying gold, not Bitcoin. This preference for Gold reserve asset status among national banks stems from several factors: History and Trust: Gold has been a trusted store of value and medium of exchange for millennia. Central banks have vast experience managing gold reserves. Stability and Liquidity: While not immune to price swings, gold is generally less volatile than Bitcoin and has deep, established global markets for trading. Regulatory Clarity: The legal and regulatory framework around holding and managing gold is well-defined internationally. Bitcoin, conversely, faces significant regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions. Physical Control: Central banks can physically hold and secure their gold reserves within their borders, offering a sense of direct control that differs from holding digital assets distributed globally. However, the landscape is slowly evolving. Some central banks and international bodies are exploring digital currencies (CBDCs) and the potential implications of decentralized cryptocurrencies. While mass adoption of Bitcoin as a central bank reserve asset isn’t imminent, the conversation is no longer entirely off the table for some forward-thinking institutions. Actionable Insights for Investors What should investors take away from the ongoing Peter Schiff Bitcoin vs. Gold debate? Do Your Own Research: Don’t rely solely on the opinions of one person, whether they are a gold bug or a Bitcoin maximalist. Understand the fundamentals of both assets. Consider Diversification: Many investors choose to hold both gold and Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio, leveraging the unique characteristics of each. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is significantly more volatile than gold. Assess how much risk you are comfortable taking. Long-Term Perspective: Both gold and Bitcoin are often viewed as long-term stores of value. Consider your investment horizon. Schiff’s criticisms, while harsh, highlight legitimate questions about Bitcoin’s valuation and role. However, they often overlook the innovative aspects and growing adoption that make Bitcoin a compelling asset for many in the digital age. Conclusion: An Unending Debate Peter Schiff’s appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference and his subsequent remarks served as a stark reminder of the ideological chasm separating traditional finance advocates and the cryptocurrency world. His claims of Bitcoin having no Bitcoin intrinsic value , being a ‘giant cult,’ and his insistence on gold as the sole Gold reserve asset are consistent with his long-held views. While Schiff’s criticisms resonate with those skeptical of digital assets, they fail to fully capture the arguments for Bitcoin’s value derived from its decentralized network, absolute scarcity, and growing utility as a digital store of value. The Bitcoin vs Gold debate is far from over, reflecting differing views on what constitutes value and security in the modern economy. Ultimately, the choice between Bitcoin, gold, or a combination of both depends on an individual investor’s financial goals, risk appetite, and belief in the future trajectory of both traditional and digital assets. Schiff’s comments, though controversial, contribute to a necessary dialogue about the nature of money and value in the 21st century.

The latest development sparking discussion comes from Spain, where banking behemoth Santander is reportedly exploring a potential entry into the cryptocurrency market. According to insights shared by ‘Unfolded’ on the social media platform X, the initial focus of this exploration centers on early-stage plans for a stablecoin. This move by a major global bank like Santander underscores the growing trend of Santander crypto interest within established financial institutions. Why Are Giants Like Santander Eyeing Banking Stablecoins? Santander isn’t operating in a vacuum. Its reported interest in stablecoins reflects a broader trend across the financial industry. Banks and financial institutions are recognizing the potential efficiencies and new opportunities that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, can offer. But why the sudden (or perhaps not so sudden) pivot? Efficiency in Payments and Settlements: Traditional cross-border payments can be slow, expensive, and involve multiple intermediaries. Stablecoins operating on blockchain technology offer the potential for near-instantaneous, 24/7 settlements at significantly lower costs. This is particularly attractive for corporate banking and interbank transfers. Exploring Tokenized Assets: Beyond simple payments, stablecoins can serve as the foundational layer for trading and settling other tokenized assets, such as real estate, securities, or commodities, on a blockchain. Banks want to be at the forefront of this potential revolution in asset management and trading. Meeting Evolving Customer Needs: Corporate clients, especially those involved in international trade or digital businesses, are increasingly looking for faster and more flexible payment solutions. Stablecoins could provide a digital-native answer to these demands. Staying Competitive: The rise of FinTech companies and dedicated crypto platforms offering digital asset services is pressuring traditional banks to innovate. Ignoring the digital asset space is no longer a viable long-term strategy. Anticipating Regulatory Shifts: While the regulatory landscape for stablecoins and other digital assets is still evolving, banks are positioning themselves to be ready when clearer frameworks emerge. Developing internal expertise and pilot programs now is crucial for future compliance and market participation. The exploration of banking stablecoins by institutions like Santander signals a strategic move to adapt to a changing financial ecosystem. It’s not just about dipping toes; it’s about understanding how digital value transfer can integrate with existing financial infrastructure. What Could a Santander Bank Digital Currency Look Like? While details are scarce, a stablecoin issued or utilized by a major bank like Santander would likely differ in significant ways from the stablecoins most commonly used in the public crypto market (like USDT or USDC). Here are some potential characteristics: A Santander stablecoin would likely be: Fiat-Backed 1:1: Pegged directly to a major fiat currency like the Euro or potentially the US Dollar, with reserves held by the bank itself, ensuring stability. Permissioned or Enterprise-Focused: Initially, it might not be a public stablecoin accessible to everyone. Instead, it could operate on a permissioned blockchain network, limited to verified institutional clients or used internally for interbank settlements. Regulatory Compliant: Designed from the ground up to adhere to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, as required by traditional banking standards. Use Case Specific: Focused initially on specific applications like cross-border payments, corporate treasury management, or the settlement of tokenized securities, rather than broad retail adoption. This approach allows banks to explore the technology in a controlled environment, mitigating some of the risks associated with public, permissionless networks while adhering to their regulatory obligations. The concept of a bank digital currency , whether a stablecoin or a direct digital representation of liabilities, is becoming a key area of focus. Benefits of Institutional Crypto Adoption for the Financial System The potential entry of major players like Santander into the crypto space through initiatives like stablecoins carries significant implications, not just for the bank itself, but for the broader financial system and the digital asset market. This trend of institutional crypto adoption offers several potential benefits: For Banks and Institutions: Operational Efficiency: Reduced costs and time for transactions, especially cross-border. New Revenue Streams: Potential for offering new digital asset services, custody, and facilitating tokenized markets. Enhanced Risk Management: Potential for real-time settlement reduces counterparty risk in certain transactions. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Staying relevant in a rapidly digitizing global economy. For the Crypto Market: Increased Legitimacy: Participation from regulated financial giants lends credibility to the digital asset space. Potential for Increased Liquidity: As institutions engage, they can bring significant capital and trading volume. Development of Robust Infrastructure: Institutional needs drive the development of more secure, scalable, and compliant digital asset infrastructure. For Users (eventually): Faster, Cheaper Transactions: While initial focus might be institutional, the underlying technology improvements could eventually benefit retail users. New Financial Products: Access to tokenized assets and other digital-native financial services. This evolution signifies a maturation of the digital asset space, moving beyond speculative retail trading towards integration into core financial functions. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges of Stablecoin Regulation and Adoption While the potential is clear, the path for banks entering the crypto space, particularly with stablecoins, is fraught with challenges. The primary hurdle remains stablecoin regulation . Here’s a look at some key challenges: Challenge Description Implication for Banks Regulatory Uncertainty Lack of clear, harmonized global or even regional rules specifically for stablecoins and digital assets held by regulated entities. Creates legal and compliance risks, hinders development and deployment. Technical Integration Integrating new blockchain technology with complex, often legacy, banking systems. Requires significant investment, expertise, and presents operational challenges. Security Risks Threats of hacking, smart contract vulnerabilities, and cyberattacks targeting digital asset infrastructure. Requires robust security protocols and constant vigilance to protect assets and data. Competition Competing with existing public stablecoins, other banks developing similar solutions, and potential Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Requires a strong value proposition and efficient execution to gain market share. Public Perception Addressing concerns about volatility (even for stablecoins, perceived risk), scams, and the association of crypto with illicit activities. Requires clear communication and building trust with clients and the public. Overcoming these challenges requires close collaboration between banks, regulators, and technology providers. The success of initiatives like Santander’s potential stablecoin will heavily depend on navigating this complex landscape. Examples of Institutional Crypto Adoption Beyond Santander Santander’s exploration is part of a larger trend. Several other major financial institutions have already taken steps into the digital asset space, providing a roadmap and context for Santander’s potential move: JPMorgan Chase: Launched JPM Coin, a private, permissioned blockchain-based system for wholesale payments between institutional clients. This is a prime example of a bank-issued digital currency for specific use cases. DBS Bank (Singapore): Established a digital asset exchange, allowing institutional and accredited investors to trade cryptocurrencies and eventually tokenized assets. Goldman Sachs: Has been active in cryptocurrency trading and exploring tokenization of traditional financial assets. Various Banks in Pilot Programs: Many banks globally are participating in pilot programs exploring blockchain technology for interbank settlements, trade finance, and other applications, often involving forms of digital tokens or stablecoins. These examples demonstrate that institutional crypto adoption is not just theoretical; it’s actively happening. Banks are exploring different angles, from direct trading and custody to issuing their own digital currencies for specific purposes. Santander’s focus on stablecoins aligns with the payment and settlement efficiency angle pursued by many. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? While Santander’s initial stablecoin plans are likely focused on institutional use, developments like this have broader implications for the financial world and anyone interested in crypto: Watch for Regulatory Clarity: Increased institutional involvement puts more pressure on regulators to provide clear rules. Keep an eye on regulatory announcements in major financial hubs. Clearer rules could accelerate adoption. Observe Use Case Development: Pay attention to how banks like Santander plan to use stablecoins. Will it be limited to internal transfers, or will it extend to corporate payments, trade finance, or even facilitating tokenized asset trading? Understand the Difference: Recognize that a bank-issued stablecoin might operate differently (e.g., permissioned network, strict KYC) than public stablecoins you might use on a crypto exchange. Institutional Flow Matters: As more institutions engage, it can potentially bring more stability and volume to certain parts of the crypto market, particularly those related to infrastructure and regulated digital assets. The Future of Finance is Hybrid: Santander’s move reinforces the idea that the future financial system will likely be a hybrid, integrating traditional finance with elements of decentralized or distributed ledger technology. Santander’s reported exploration is a signal that major banks see a future where digital assets play a role. It’s a development worth following closely. Conclusion: Santander’s Stablecoin Step and the Future of Banking Santander’s early-stage exploration into the crypto market, specifically focusing on stablecoins, is a significant indicator of the direction traditional finance is heading. It’s not an isolated event but rather part of a larger wave of institutional crypto adoption as banks seek to leverage the potential efficiencies and opportunities presented by digital assets. While challenges, particularly around stablecoin regulation and technical integration, remain substantial, the strategic imperative for banks to innovate in the digital realm is clear. Whether Santander’s plans fully materialize and how their potential bank digital currency is implemented will be key developments to watch. What is certain is that the lines between traditional banking and the digital asset world are increasingly blurring, promising a more integrated and potentially more efficient financial future.

This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a complete pivot, signaling strong conviction in the future of a specific blockchain ecosystem. The decision involves exiting a long-held position in one of crypto’s giants to go all-in on another. Understanding the Bold Solana Treasury Shift At the heart of the news is Sol Strategies’ decision to fully allocate its treasury assets to Solana (SOL). Previously holding a position in Bitcoin (BTC), the company has now liquidated its entire Bitcoin holdings to acquire a substantial amount of SOL. Specifically, Sol Strategies announced via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it purchased 26,478 SOL for $4.7 million. This acquisition brings their total Solana treasury holdings to a staggering 420,355 SOL. To put this into perspective, based on recent market valuations, this Solana treasury is estimated to be worth approximately CAD $100 million. This isn’t pocket change; it represents a significant corporate asset base now solely tied to the performance and growth of the Solana network. Why the Bitcoin Exit? The decision to execute a complete Bitcoin exit from their treasury is perhaps as noteworthy as the move into Solana. For many companies holding crypto on their balance sheets, Bitcoin has been the default, perceived as the safest and most established digital asset. Sol Strategies’ departure from this common practice suggests a strategic re-evaluation of their long-term asset management goals and a potentially higher conviction in the growth trajectory and utility offered by the Solana ecosystem compared to Bitcoin for their specific objectives. Sol Strategies’ Vision: More Than Just a SOL Investment Sol Strategies explicitly stated that this massive SOL investment is not merely a speculative play on the price of Solana. The company articulated a clear rationale rooted in a long-term commitment to the Solana ecosystem . A key part of their strategy involves supporting validator growth within the network. By holding and potentially staking such a large amount of SOL, Sol Strategies can play a significant role in the network’s security, decentralization, and overall health. This suggests a belief in Solana’s technology, its development community, and its potential to scale and handle widespread adoption. Here’s a quick look at the key figures: Previous Treasury Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) New Treasury Asset: Solana (SOL) Recent Acquisition: 26,478 SOL Cost of Acquisition: $4.7 million Total SOL Holdings: 420,355 SOL Estimated Value of Treasury: ~CAD $100 million Stated Goal: Long-term commitment, support validator growth What Does This Mean for the Solana Ecosystem? A treasury move of this magnitude from a known entity like Sol Strategies can have several implications for the Solana ecosystem : Increased Confidence: It can signal strong institutional or corporate confidence in Solana’s technology and future prospects, potentially encouraging other investors. Validator Growth Support: By dedicating significant capital to SOL holdings, Sol Strategies can contribute to the network’s security and decentralization through staking, aligning their financial interests with the network’s operational success. Market Sentiment: Large, publicly announced purchases can positively influence market sentiment around SOL. Potential for Further Development: A company deeply invested in the ecosystem is more likely to participate in or fund further development and innovation on Solana. Is a Full Treasury Allocation Risky? While the move signals strong conviction, allocating an entire treasury to a single, volatile asset like SOL does come with inherent risks. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their price swings, and concentrating assets removes the diversification benefits that holding multiple assets (like Bitcoin and others) might offer. However, Sol Strategies’ focus on validator growth suggests they may be looking beyond short-term price movements and are focused on the yield and network participation benefits that come with staking. Looking Ahead: Sol Strategies and the Solana Treasury Sol Strategies’ decision is a bold statement in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto treasury management. It moves away from the more common diversified or Bitcoin-centric approaches and places a significant bet on Solana’s continued growth and success. The outcome of this strategy will be closely watched, not only by those interested in Sol Strategies’ performance but also by the broader crypto community keen to see how such a concentrated, ecosystem-focused treasury performs over the long term and what impact it has on the Solana ecosystem itself. This development highlights a growing trend where companies are not just holding crypto but are strategically aligning their assets with specific blockchain ecosystems they believe will drive future innovation and value.

That vision is becoming more of a reality as companies like Rain, a prominent cryptocurrency card issuer, continue to innovate. Rain is making waves with its latest announcement: expanding support for stablecoin payments specifically on the Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and Stellar (XLM) networks. This move is significant for users looking for faster, potentially cheaper ways to spend their stablecoins. The Expansion of Stablecoin Payments Rain’s decision to integrate support for stablecoins residing on the Solana, Tron, and Stellar blockchains marks a notable step in bridging the gap between the crypto economy and traditional finance. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value relative to an asset like the US dollar, are increasingly popular for transactions due to their reduced volatility compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. By enabling payments using stablecoins from these specific networks, Rain is tapping into ecosystems known for their transaction speed and efficiency. This expansion means users holding stablecoins (such as USDC or USDT, which are available on these networks) can potentially access and spend those funds more readily through their Rain debit or credit card. It simplifies the process that might otherwise involve multiple steps like sending funds to an exchange, converting them to fiat, and then transferring to a bank account. The direct spending capability via a card offers a more seamless experience. What is the Rain Crypto Platform? Before diving deeper into the network expansion, it’s helpful to understand Rain itself. Rain operates as a cryptocurrency platform that facilitates the use of digital assets in the traditional payment ecosystem. Essentially, they provide cards (both debit and credit options are mentioned) that allow users to spend their crypto holdings at merchants worldwide that accept card payments. The platform handles the backend conversion process. When a user makes a purchase, Rain typically converts the necessary amount of cryptocurrency (now including supported stablecoins on SOL, TRX, XLM) into the required fiat currency at the point of sale. This abstraction makes the transaction feel like a regular card payment for both the user and the merchant. Rain has demonstrated growth and attracted investor confidence, notably securing $24.5 million in an investment round led by Norwest Ventures. This funding indicates market belief in the potential of crypto-to-fiat payment solutions and provides Rain with resources to expand its offerings, such as this latest network integration. Connecting Your Funds: How the Crypto Card Works Using a crypto card like the one offered by Rain typically involves linking your crypto wallet or account on the Rain platform to the physical or virtual card. When you make a purchase: You swipe or tap the card at a point-of-sale terminal or use it online. The transaction request goes to the card network (like Visa or Mastercard, depending on the issuer). The request is forwarded to Rain. Rain calculates the equivalent amount of crypto (in this case, the stablecoin on the specific network) needed to cover the fiat cost of the transaction. Rain executes a conversion of the required crypto amount into fiat currency in real-time (or near real-time). The fiat is used to settle the transaction with the merchant. The equivalent crypto balance is deducted from your Rain account. This process requires robust infrastructure to handle rapid conversions and fluctuating crypto prices, although stablecoins mitigate the price volatility aspect significantly. Why Solana Stablecoin Payments? Solana has gained prominence for its high transaction throughput and low transaction costs compared to some other blockchains. These characteristics make it particularly attractive for payment applications.

Excerpts from court documents in the SEC, Binance case. Source: Eleanor Terrett Terrett shared the news via her X page, attaching an image from the legal filing, which identified the SEC as the plaintiff and Binance Holdings Limited, BAM Trading Services Inc., BAM Management US Holdings Inc., and Changpeng Zhao as the defendants. SEC, Binance credit Crypto Task Force for resolution The SEC initiated this civil enforcement action against Binance on June 5, 2023, and it filed an amended complaint on October 16, 2024 (Docket No. 282). The joint stipulation seeks to allow both parties to dismiss the ongoing lawsuit. “Whereas, in light of the foregoing, and in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter, the Commission believes the dismissal of this Litigation is appropriate,” the May 29 filing in the District Court for the District of Columbia read. Both parties hinted at the possibility of a dismissal in February when the SEC and Binance asked the judge to stay the case. Then again, in April, when the same request was filed. The parties mentioned how the establishment of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force “might impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this litigation,” in the court documents. The SEC’s Acting Chairman, Mark T. Uyeda introduced the task force on January 21, 2025, to present a regulatory framework for crypto assets in the lead up to providing regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency space. Paul Atkins’ SEC sets a precedent The SEC’s willingness to dismiss Binance’s lawsuit follows a trend that has seen the agency end its litigation against other crypto companies like Coinbase, Consensus and Kraken, which were settled earlier this year. It has also ended investigations into Circle, Immutable and several others. Sentiments on X are bullish about the SEC and Binance finally burying the hatchet, but a number of users in the reply section of Eleanor Terrett’s X post have drawn comparisons to the protracted settlement of the SEC’s case against Ripple Labs . The Ripple case is a similar high-profile case. It began in December 2020 and has seen multiple developments, including a final judgment on August 7, 2024, imposing a $125 million civil penalty on Ripple. Still, the SEC appears committed to ending aggressive enforcement actions initiated against crypto firms during Gary Gensler’s tenure with the financial watchdog.

A recent development, specifically a US Court Ruling in Washington, D.C., referencing a prior Trade Court Ruling , might seem distant from crypto at first glance, but it underscores principles of law, government action, and judicial oversight that are profoundly relevant to the Regulatory Environment crypto navigates. Let’s dive into why this seemingly unrelated court reference holds importance for anyone tracking the future of digital assets and regulated markets. Understanding the US Court Ruling and its Context According to reports, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., made a notable reference to an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade. While specific details regarding the case before the Washington D.C. court remain largely undisclosed at this time, the reference points back to a significant legal challenge concerning Government Policy – specifically, the halting of a reciprocal tariff policy enacted by the previous administration. This reference is more than just a procedural note; it signifies how legal precedents set in one area of law can be considered and applied in others. The original Trade Court Ruling was a landmark decision that challenged the executive branch’s authority in implementing certain trade measures, asserting the judiciary’s role in reviewing such actions. The fact that a different U.S. District Court is now referencing this decision suggests its principles are being considered relevant in other legal contexts, potentially broadening its impact beyond international trade disputes. What Was the Original Trade Court Ruling About? To grasp the significance of the Washington D.C. court’s reference, we need to understand the original Trade Court Ruling . This decision stemmed from challenges against a specific tariff policy. Here are some key aspects, based on public reporting about the original case: The Policy: The case involved tariffs imposed under specific statutory authority, often related to national security or trade imbalances. The Challenge: Plaintiffs, typically importers or affected businesses, argued that the implementation of these tariffs exceeded the executive branch’s delegated authority or failed to follow proper legal procedures. The Ruling: The U.S. Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs, at least in part, ruling that the administration had overstepped its bounds or improperly applied the law in imposing the tariffs. This ruling effectively halted the implementation of the specific reciprocal tariff policy in question. The Principle: At its core, the ruling was an assertion of Judicial Review – the power of courts to review the constitutionality or legality of actions taken by the legislative and executive branches of government. This original ruling was a significant check on executive power in the realm of trade, demonstrating that even policies enacted under broad statutory language are subject to legal challenge and judicial oversight. Why Does This US Court Ruling Matter for the Regulatory Environment? Now, let’s connect these dots back to the Regulatory Environment , which is of paramount concern to the cryptocurrency community. The crypto space is currently grappling with significant uncertainty regarding how existing laws apply to digital assets and whether new regulations are needed. Various government agencies – from the SEC and CFTC to the Treasury and Congress – are actively discussing or pursuing different approaches to oversight. This US Court Ruling , by referencing a significant Trade Court Ruling on Government Policy , highlights several crucial points relevant to crypto: Judicial Review is a Check on Power: The principle of Judicial Review means that government agencies, including those regulating or seeking to regulate crypto, are not beyond the reach of the law. Their interpretations of statutes, the procedures they follow, and the scope of the rules they propose can all be challenged in court. Precedent Matters: Court decisions, especially those from federal courts, create precedents. While a ruling on trade tariffs isn’t directly about Bitcoin, the legal reasoning employed by the court regarding the limits of executive authority, the interpretation of statutes, or the requirements for administrative action can be cited in future cases involving other government policies, including those targeting digital assets. Clarity Through Litigation: Sometimes, the precise boundaries of Government Policy and regulatory authority are only truly defined through legal challenges. This is a path the crypto industry is already navigating, with ongoing lawsuits against regulatory bodies seeking clarity on whether certain tokens are securities, the scope of exchange oversight, and other critical issues. Impact on Market Certainty: Legal challenges and the potential for judicial intervention can introduce uncertainty, but they can also, over time, lead to greater clarity regarding the rules of the road. A clear Regulatory Environment is something the crypto market desperately needs to foster innovation and attract mainstream adoption. Rulings like the referenced Trade Court Ruling , even in a different sector, contribute to the overall body of law that defines how government interacts with industry. Think of it this way: If a court rules that a government agency overstepped its authority in imposing tariffs based on a certain interpretation of a law, that ruling’s reasoning might be relevant if another agency is accused of overstepping its authority in regulating crypto based on a similar broad interpretation of a different law. Navigating the Complexities: Challenges and Perspectives The interplay between Government Policy , the Regulatory Environment , and Judicial Review is complex. There are differing perspectives on the appropriate role of each branch of government: Advocates for Strong Executive/Agency Power: Argue that agencies have the necessary expertise and are best positioned to respond quickly to rapidly evolving areas like technology and finance. They may view extensive judicial intervention as hindering effective governance. Advocates for Judicial Oversight: Emphasize the importance of checks and balances. They believe courts play a crucial role in ensuring that government actions stay within the bounds set by statutes and the Constitution, protecting individuals and industries from arbitrary or unlawful power. Industry Perspective (including Crypto): Often seeks clear, predictable rules. While some in crypto may chafe under regulation, many recognize that a lack of clarity is detrimental. They watch court cases closely, hoping for decisions that provide certainty and fairness, ensuring that regulations are applied correctly and don’t stifle innovation unnecessarily. The Washington D.C. court’s reference to the Trade Court Ruling is a small piece of this larger puzzle, illustrating how judicial challenges to Government Policy are an ongoing feature of the U.S. legal system and contribute to shaping the overall Regulatory Environment . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Given the indirect but relevant implications of this US Court Ruling and the underlying Trade Court Ruling , what should those interested in crypto take away? 1. Pay Attention to Legal Precedents Beyond Crypto: Don’t limit your focus only to court cases explicitly involving Bitcoin or blockchain. Rulings in areas like administrative law, securities law (even outside of crypto), and challenges to government agency actions (like the tariff case) can set precedents or offer insights into legal arguments that may eventually be applied to digital assets. 2. Understand the Principle of Judicial Review: Recognize that legal challenges are a legitimate and important part of shaping the Regulatory Environment . Support for organizations or efforts that advocate for clear, fair regulation and are willing to pursue legal avenues when necessary can be impactful. 3. Stay Informed on Government Policy Trends: The tariff case is an example of how broad Government Policy can be subject to legal challenge. Keep an eye on proposed legislation and regulatory rules related to crypto, understanding that these too can be challenged in court. 4. Advocate for Clarity: Engage with policymakers and regulators where possible, stressing the need for a clear and consistent Regulatory Environment for digital assets. Highlight how legal uncertainty hinders legitimate activity while potentially pushing bad actors underground. 5. Recognize the Long Game: Establishing a stable and predictable Regulatory Environment for crypto will likely be a multi-year process involving legislative efforts, regulatory rulemaking, and significant court battles. Developments like this US Court Ruling are reminders that the legal system moves deliberately, but its decisions have lasting effects. Conclusion: Why Legal Watchfulness is Key While a US Court Ruling referencing a Trade Court Ruling on tariffs might not generate the same buzz as a Bitcoin price surge or a major exchange listing, it’s a critical reminder of the foundational legal principles that govern government action and shape the Regulatory Environment . The principle of Judicial Review , the power of legal precedent, and the constant negotiation between Government Policy and judicial oversight are all highly relevant to the ongoing development and regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Staying informed about legal developments, even those outside the immediate crypto bubble, provides valuable context and helps anticipate potential challenges and pathways towards regulatory clarity. The reference by the Washington D.C. court serves as a small but significant signal that the legal principles tested in cases like the original Trade Court Ruling continue to resonate throughout the U.S. judicial system, influencing the legal landscape that industries like crypto must navigate.

Training and running cutting-edge AI models typically requires massive clusters of high-end GPUs, making advanced AI development and deployment expensive and resource-intensive. However, a significant development from DeepSeek is changing this narrative, particularly for those interested in accessible and **Efficient AI Models**. While their larger R1 model garnered attention, a smaller, ‘distilled’ version, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, is proving that powerful AI doesn’t always need a data center. What is DeepSeek’s New Single GPU AI Model? DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is a compact iteration of DeepSeek’s latest R1 reasoning AI model. It’s specifically designed to be significantly more efficient than its larger sibling, making it capable of running on much less hardware – potentially even a **Single GPU AI Model** setup. This is a crucial point, as it drastically lowers the barrier to entry for developers, researchers, and even smaller companies looking to experiment with or deploy advanced reasoning capabilities. The model is built upon the foundation of Alibaba’s Qwen3-8B model, released in May. DeepSeek then applied a technique known as ‘distillation.’ In essence, they used the output and capabilities of the larger, more powerful **DeepSeek R1 AI** model to train and fine-tune the smaller Qwen3-8B base model. This process allows the smaller model to inherit some of the reasoning and performance characteristics of the larger model, but in a much more compact and efficient package.

US Democratic lawmakers are raising significant concerns and demanding transparency regarding who is involved with this particular digital asset, specifically targeting attendees of a recent dinner hosted by Donald Trump for memecoin holders. What are Democratic Lawmakers Demanding? According to a report by The Guardian, lawmakers from the Democratic Party are calling on the project team behind the TRUMP memecoin to reveal the list of individuals who attended a private dinner event held by Donald Trump. This demand stems from worries about potential foreign influence and the opaque nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Congressman Jamie Raskin is a key figure driving this demand. He has voiced concerns that foreign governments or entities could be using purchases of the memecoin as a way to secretly funnel money to the former U.S. president, bypassing traditional campaign finance regulations. Why the Concern Over Political Donations Crypto ? The core issue highlighted by lawmakers is the potential for cryptocurrencies, particularly memecoins which can be volatile and tied to specific personalities, to be used for political financing without public scrutiny. Traditional political donations have disclosure requirements aimed at preventing illegal foreign contributions and ensuring transparency. The concern is that large purchases of a memecoin like TRUMP, especially by foreign nationals or entities, could serve as an indirect form of political support or donation that falls outside the current regulatory framework, potentially influencing U.S. politics. The Justin Sun Connection: A Case Study Congressman Raskin specifically pointed to Tron (TRX) founder, Justin Sun, as an example fueling these concerns. Sun reportedly purchased $20 million worth of TRUMP tokens. Furthermore, Sun has also invested a substantial $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another cryptocurrency project linked to the Trump family. Sun’s involvement is particularly noteworthy given his legal history in the U.S. He was indicted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on charges of fraud last year. Although the case was stayed in February of this year, his significant investments connected to Trump-related crypto projects raise questions for lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest or influence. Navigating Memecoin Disclosure and Transparency Challenges Demanding disclosure for attendees of a private dinner linked to a memecoin project presents unique challenges. While the intention is transparency in political finance, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the lack of clear regulatory guidelines around memecoins complicate such demands. The project team’s legal obligation or ability to disclose attendee lists, especially if attendees are merely token holders and not direct political donors through traditional channels, is unclear. Key challenges include: Identifying attendees who might have purchased tokens for speculative reasons versus political influence. Distinguishing between genuine retail investors and large-scale purchasers potentially linked to foreign entities. The lack of a clear legal framework classifying memecoin purchases as political donations requiring disclosure. Balancing demands for transparency with individual privacy concerns in the crypto space. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community This situation underscores the increasing intersection of cryptocurrency and politics. For crypto holders and enthusiasts, it’s important to: Stay informed about regulatory discussions surrounding crypto and political finance. Understand the potential scrutiny that projects linked to political figures may face. Recognize that the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins, is still evolving. The demand for memecoin disclosure highlights the ongoing debate about how to apply existing financial transparency rules to the novel world of digital assets. Conclusion The demand by Democratic lawmakers for the disclosure of attendees at a Trump memecoin dinner signals a growing intent in Washington to understand and potentially regulate the flow of value between political figures and the cryptocurrency market. Fueled by examples like the significant investments made by figures such as Justin Sun , these concerns about potential foreign influence and lack of transparency in political donations crypto are unlikely to subside soon. This development adds another layer of complexity to the relationship between digital assets and the political arena, emphasizing the need for clarity and potentially new regulations in the future.

Leaving large sums of money idle means missing out on potential growth and facing the erosive power of inflation. This is especially relevant in today’s dynamic financial landscape, where traditional savings yield little and alternative assets like cryptocurrencies offer different opportunities. So, what exactly should you do when you have excess cash beyond your immediate needs? Why Having Excess Cash Can Be a Problem While having cash provides liquidity and security, keeping too much of it sitting idle comes with downsides: Inflation Risk: The purchasing power of cash decreases over time due to inflation. Your dollars buy less in the future than they do today. Opportunity Cost: That cash could be working for you, generating returns through various investments. Security Concerns: Holding large physical amounts of cash can be risky due to theft or loss. Low Yield: Traditional savings accounts or money market funds often offer minimal interest rates, barely keeping pace with, or falling behind, inflation. Understanding these points is the first step in deciding what to do with dollars that aren’t needed for daily expenses or short-term goals. First Steps: Assess Your Financial Situation and Goals Before you start investing cash or making any major decisions, take a step back and evaluate your overall financial picture. This crucial assessment will guide your choices. Build an Emergency Fund: Ensure you have 3-6 months (or more) of living expenses readily accessible in a savings account for unexpected events like job loss or medical emergencies. This cash is not excess; it’s essential security. Identify Short-Term Goals: Are you saving for a down payment on a house, a car, or a vacation within the next 1-3 years? Cash or highly liquid, low-risk options are suitable for these goals. Define Long-Term Goals: What about retirement, your children’s education, or building long-term wealth? This is where strategies for managing cash for growth become important. Evaluate Debt: High-interest debt (like credit cards) often has an interest rate higher than potential investment returns. Paying down such debt can be a very effective use of cash. Once you have a clear picture of your needs and goals, you can explore options for your true too many US dollars . Traditional Avenues for Investing Cash For those looking for established ways to grow their money, traditional markets offer several options. Stocks and Bonds Investing in the stock market means buying ownership in companies. This offers potential for significant growth over the long term, but also comes with volatility and risk. Bonds represent lending money to governments or corporations in exchange for interest payments and the return of principal. Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks but offer lower potential returns. Benefits: Potential for capital appreciation (stocks), regular income (bonds), diversification, liquidity (for publicly traded assets). Challenges: Market volatility, potential loss of principal, requires research or professional advice, taxes on gains and income. Actionable Insight: Consider diversified index funds or ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) for broad market exposure with lower risk than individual stocks. For bonds, consider bond funds that match your risk tolerance and time horizon. Real Estate Investing in physical property (rental properties, REITs) can provide rental income and potential appreciation. It’s a less liquid investment than stocks or bonds. Benefits: Potential for passive income, appreciation, hedge against inflation (sometimes), tax advantages. Challenges: High upfront cost, ongoing expenses (maintenance, taxes, insurance), illiquidity, requires management (for physical property), market downturns. Actionable Insight: For smaller amounts of excess cash , consider investing in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which trade like stocks and own income-producing real estate. High-Yield Savings Accounts & CDs While not strictly investing for growth, these options offer slightly better returns than standard savings accounts and are very low risk and liquid (savings) or offer fixed returns for a set period (CDs). Benefits: Safety of principal (usually FDIC insured), predictable income (CDs), high liquidity (savings). Challenges: Returns may not keep pace with inflation, lower returns compared to riskier assets. Actionable Insight: Use these for funds you might need in the short to medium term (1-5 years) where capital preservation is key. Exploring Alternatives: What to Do with Dollars in New Markets Beyond traditional finance, alternative investments offer different risk/reward profiles. This is where many people with too many US dollars are starting to look. Cryptocurrency Investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum involves buying digital assets that operate on decentralized networks. The crypto market is known for its high volatility but also its potential for significant returns. Benefits: High potential for returns, decentralization, innovation, diversification away from traditional assets. Challenges: Extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainty, security risks (hacking, scams), complexity, requires significant research. Actionable Insight: Approach crypto with caution. Start with a small percentage of your excess cash that you can afford to lose. Focus on understanding the technology and the specific assets you’re interested in. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility risk. Gold and Precious Metals Often seen as a store of value, gold and other precious metals can be held physically or via funds (ETFs). They are sometimes considered a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Benefits: Store of value, hedge against inflation/economic instability, tangible asset. Challenges: Does not generate income (unless through funds), storage costs (physical), price volatility, performance can lag other assets during growth periods. Actionable Insight: Consider adding a small allocation (e.g., 5-10%) to your portfolio for diversification and potential hedging benefits. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Lending money directly to individuals or businesses through online platforms can offer higher interest rates than traditional savings. Benefits: Higher potential returns than savings, diversification. Challenges: Credit risk (borrower default), platform risk, illiquidity, requires careful vetting of loans. Actionable Insight: Diversify across many loans to mitigate default risk. Understand the platform’s risk assessment process. Strategic Uses for Managing Cash Beyond Investing Not all too many US dollars need to be invested for financial returns. Sometimes, the best return is on your own financial well-being. Paying Down Debt As mentioned earlier, paying off high-interest debt provides a guaranteed return equivalent to the interest rate you were paying. This is often a financially sound move before aggressive investing. Benefits: Guaranteed return (saving on interest), reduces financial stress, improves credit score. Challenges: Cash is no longer available for other uses, may not feel as exciting as investing. Actionable Insight: Prioritize paying off debt with interest rates higher than what you reasonably expect to earn from investments (e.g., credit cards, some personal loans). Funding Education or Skills Development Investing in yourself or your family’s education can yield significant long-term returns in earning potential. Benefits: Increased earning capacity, personal growth, non-taxable use of funds (in some cases). Challenges: Can be expensive, no guaranteed financial return, requires time commitment. Actionable Insight: Use excess cash to pay for courses, certifications, or degrees that can enhance career prospects. Home Improvement Using cash to improve your home can increase its value and your quality of life. It’s a different kind of investment. Benefits: Increased property value, improved living environment, can be more cost-effective than financing. Challenges: No direct financial return until sale, requires managing contractors, potential for cost overruns. Actionable Insight: Focus on improvements that add significant value or address necessary repairs rather than purely cosmetic changes if maximizing financial return is a goal. Strategic Spending or Enjoyment Sometimes, having too many US dollars means you can afford to spend some on experiences, travel, or items that genuinely improve your life or bring you joy. This isn’t about frivolous spending but intentional use of funds beyond necessities and investments. Benefits: Improved quality of life, creating memories, immediate gratification. Challenges: Reduces funds available for investment or debt repayment, doesn’t provide financial return. Actionable Insight: Allocate a specific portion of your excess cash for spending after ensuring your financial bases (emergency fund, debt, basic investments) are covered. Getting Professional Help for Managing Cash Navigating these options can be complex. If you have substantial too many US dollars , consulting a fee-only financial advisor can be beneficial. They can help you create a personalized plan based on your specific situation, risk tolerance, and goals. Conclusion: Make Your Dollars Work for You Having too many US dollars in cash is a signal to take action. Leaving it idle is a missed opportunity. By assessing your financial health, understanding your goals, and exploring the various avenues available – from traditional investments like stocks and real estate to alternatives like cryptocurrency, and even strategic uses like debt repayment or self-improvement – you can make informed decisions about what to do with dollars . The key is to create a plan that aligns with your objectives and risk comfort level, ensuring your excess cash is not just sitting there, but actively working towards building your financial future. Don’t let inflation erode your wealth; take control and put those dollars to work.

The cryptocurrency has recently been in a short-term pullback, moving slightly lower after previous gains. This type of movement is common in crypto markets, especially since XRP often mirrors Bitcoin’s price action. Current Price Movement At the moment, XRP has dropped below a key support level between $2.30 and $2.34. This breakdown means the price could fall further towards the next major support zone around $2.10 to $2.15. If selling pressure increases, XRP might test even lower areas — but holding above these support levels would be a positive sign for the bulls. XRP has important support between $2.10 and $2.15. A drop below this could push the price down to $1.79, which is a very important level to hold. If it falls under $1.79, bigger losses could follow. On the other hand, XRP faces resistance between $2.30 and $2.34. If the price moves above this, the next hurdles are at $2.44, and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Possible Bullish Pattern Forming There’s a chance that XRP might be forming a classic chart pattern called an “inverse head and shoulders.” This is a bullish (positive) sign that often hints at a price rise. But right now, this pattern isn’t confirmed yet. For this pattern to become official, XRP’s price would need to bounce from its current levels, move up towards the $2.62 mark, and break through it. If that happens in the next couple of weeks, it could spark a strong upward move — maybe even towards new all-time highs. What Could Happen Next? In the short term (next few days to a week), experts expect XRP’s price to continue cooling off while Bitcoin remains quiet. The key is whether XRP can hold above $2.10 or especially $1.79, as dropping below these levels might bring more selling pressure. If bulls (buyers) step in soon, it might see a bounce back before XRP hits those lower levels. On the flip side, if sellers stay in control, the price could dip a little more before finding strong support.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 01:42:14

Among the most talked-about recent phenomena are meme coins – cryptocurrencies often born from internet jokes, cultural trends, or community enthusiasm, rather than traditional business models or clear utility. Their explosive growth and unique characteristics have presented a significant challenge for existing financial regulations worldwide. This challenge was front and center at the recent Bitcoin 2025 Conference , where U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce offered some intriguing insights and a potential path forward for navigating the complex landscape of SEC Meme Coin Regulation . Hester Peirce Crypto Insights: A Call for Clarity Known affectionately in the crypto community as “Crypto Mom” for her often more accommodating stance towards digital assets compared to some of her peers, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has consistently advocated for clearer regulatory frameworks that foster innovation rather than stifle it. Her comments at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference underscored this perspective, specifically addressing the unique nature of meme coins. Peirce noted that meme coins, in many ways, resemble collectibles. Think of digital baseball cards, unique digital art pieces, or other items whose value is primarily driven by cultural significance, community sentiment, and scarcity rather than an underlying business venture or expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others (a key component of the Howey Test used to define a security in the U.S.). Her crucial point was that these assets, due to their nature, currently appear to fall outside the conventional protections offered by securities laws. This creates a significant gap, leaving investors potentially exposed without the disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions typically applied to securities. Why a Crypto Regulatory Committee for Meme Coins? The core of Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion is the establishment of a dedicated Crypto Regulatory Committee specifically focused on meme coins. But why is such a specialized body needed? Here are some reasons: Unique Characteristics: Meme coins often lack whitepapers, clear roadmaps, or identifiable development teams in the traditional sense. Their value is heavily reliant on community hype and social media trends. Investor Protection: Without securities law protections, investors are more vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes, market manipulation, and misleading promotions. Regulatory Ambiguity: Applying existing securities frameworks, designed for traditional stocks and bonds, to assets like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu is challenging and can lead to uncertainty. Rapid Evolution: The meme coin space moves incredibly fast, with new tokens emerging daily. Regulators need a focused approach to keep pace. Global Nature: Meme coins trade on global platforms, requiring a coordinated or at least well-considered domestic approach that considers international implications. A dedicated committee could bring together experts to study these unique assets, understand their market dynamics, and propose tailored regulatory approaches that don’t necessarily fit the mold of traditional securities regulation. Navigating the Challenges of Meme Coin Regulation Regulating meme coins is no simple task. The proposed Meme Coin Regulation committee would face numerous hurdles: Defining ‘Meme Coin’: How do you legally define a meme coin versus other cryptocurrencies or digital assets? The line can be blurry. Decentralization: Many meme coins claim a degree of decentralization, making it hard to identify responsible parties for regulatory compliance. Valuation Challenges: Traditional valuation metrics don’t apply. Value is highly speculative and sentiment-driven. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Overly strict regulation could stifle the organic, community-driven innovation that characterizes this space, while insufficient rules leave investors exposed. Jurisdictional Issues: Trading is global, while regulation is typically national. The committee would need to grapple with these fundamental questions to develop effective and fair rules. Potential Structure and Focus of a Meme Coin Regulatory Committee While Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion was high-level, one can envision the potential structure and focus areas for such a committee. It might include representatives from: The SEC Other relevant financial regulatory bodies (CFTC, FinCEN) Academic experts in digital assets and economics Potentially, representatives from the crypto industry (though this could be controversial) Their work could involve: Area of Focus Potential Activities Classification Developing criteria to distinguish meme coins from securities or other asset classes. Disclosure Exploring alternative disclosure requirements suitable for assets without traditional financials. Market Integrity Studying mechanisms to detect and prevent manipulation specific to meme coin markets. Investor Education Developing resources to help potential investors understand the unique risks of meme coins. Enforcement Identifying clear triggers and methods for enforcement actions against fraudulent activities. The goal would be to create a framework that provides necessary investor protections without trying to fit a square peg into the round hole of existing securities law designed for different types of assets. The Broader Context: Crypto Regulation in the US Commissioner Peirce’s proposal comes at a time when the U.S. is actively debating the future of crypto regulation. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has largely pursued an enforcement-first approach, classifying many cryptocurrencies as securities and taking action against platforms and projects they deem non-compliant. This approach has drawn criticism from many in the industry, including Commissioner Peirce, who argue it lacks clarity and hinders innovation. The suggestion for a specific committee for meme coins highlights the difficulty in applying a one-size-fits-all approach to the diverse crypto ecosystem. It acknowledges that assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, utility tokens, stablecoins, and meme coins may require different regulatory considerations. The discussions at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference , a major gathering for the crypto community, provide a crucial platform for these ideas to be debated and potentially influence future policy directions. Peirce’s willingness to engage with the community and propose specific solutions like a Crypto Regulatory Committee is seen by many as a positive step towards finding pragmatic regulatory solutions. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Market? For investors, the prospect of clearer Meme Coin Regulation could bring both pros and cons. On the one hand, increased regulatory clarity and potential protections against fraud could boost confidence and potentially attract a wider range of participants to the market. On the other hand, any form of regulation could be seen by some as interfering with the free-wheeling, speculative nature that attracts many to meme coins in the first place. For the market as a whole, a dedicated committee could signal a more nuanced and thoughtful approach from regulators towards specific crypto asset classes. It could potentially pave the way for tailored rules that acknowledge the unique characteristics of meme coins rather than forcing them into unsuitable existing categories. Looking Ahead: The Future of Meme Coin Regulation Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion is just that – a suggestion. Whether a dedicated Crypto Regulatory Committee for meme coins is ultimately established remains to be seen. However, her comments at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference serve as a vital acknowledgment from within the SEC that meme coins present a unique regulatory challenge that needs a specific, thoughtful approach. Addressing the regulatory gap is essential for fostering a mature and safe digital asset market. Whether through a dedicated committee or other means, clearer guidance on how assets like meme coins are viewed and regulated in the U.S. is crucial for investors, developers, and the industry’s future growth. The conversation has been started, and the path towards effective SEC Meme Coin Regulation is likely to be a long and complex one. Summary At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce highlighted that meme coins resemble collectibles and currently lack securities law protections. She proposed creating a dedicated Meme Coin Regulatory Committee to address this gap, acknowledging the unique challenges these assets pose. This suggestion signals a potential shift towards more tailored regulatory approaches for specific crypto categories, aiming to enhance investor protection and market clarity while navigating the complexities of these community-driven, often speculative assets. The path to effective meme coin regulation is challenging but necessary for the evolving digital asset landscape.

The Texas-based company now expects about $9.40 per share for the fiscal year ending January 2026. That’s higher than its earlier estimate and more than what analysts predicted. Dell is making a stunning bet on the future of computing, throwing a mountain of cash at the future of artificial intelligence and big tech collaborations. And that sharp reversal is driving, in part, a surging AI market. In the past quarter alone, the tech firm posted $12.1 billion in orders for AI servers. That is more than it shipped in all of the previous fiscal year. According to Dell COO Jeff Clarke, the demand isn’t showing much sign of slowing. The company is sitting on a $14.4 billion AI backlog, indicating more revenue will come to fruition in subsequent quarters. Clarke described it as an “unprecedented demand” from customers building large and complex AI systems. He added that some delays in delivering systems are simply waiting for new data centers, power, and cooling to go online. Sales grow as Dell taps into AI gold rush For the three months ended May 2, Dell reported $23.4 billion in revenue, a 5% increase from the comparable period a year earlier. That was more than the $23.1 billion average estimate of Wall Street analysts. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to $1.55 per share, which fell short of the $1.69 per share analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Researc h ex pected. The company said it was pleased with its performance and bullish that future quarters would be even better. Dell’s earnings per share and revenue for the current quarter, $2.25 and $29 billion, surpass average market estimates. The increase in AI server orders has been driven by leading customers such as Elon Musk’s xAI and CoreWeave, who use Dell’s high-end servers in growing data centers. The tech firm has been buying back many shares as part of a share repurchase program to add to shareholder value. This reduces the number of shares in circulation, effectively increasing earnings per share. Dell builds flagship supercomputer with Nvidia In a separate huge victory, Dell has partnered with the chipmaker Nvidia to construct a next-generation supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy. Based at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the system will fulfill the most advanced research requirements, from fusion energy to biomolecular modeling, materials design, and even fundamental physics. This move further cements Dell as a key AI and high-performance computing player. Still, challenges remain. AI server sales, which show much promise, are what Clarke referred to as “lumpy.” Outside AI, the consumer PC market continues to woes. In the three months until the end of June, Dell’s consumer PC revenues dropped 19%. Its operating income in that unit — consumer and business machines — fell 16%. Economic uncertainty and persistent tariffs from the United States also hamper parts of the tech industry. On Thursday, HP Inc., a Dell competitor, had its stock drop 8.3% after reducing its profit forecast because of tariffs and slow demand. Curiously, that same day, a United States court panel concluded that most tariffs during the Trump administration ran afoul of the law, despite which they remain in place while the legal process continues. Dell noted that its updated full-year guidance takes into account everything currently known about these tariffs.

45270594,60d74fb7-681c-4fd9-926f-10f6cce443a1,1748570014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/45270594.jpeg,Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht to Bitcoiners: ‘Freedom is Worth the Struggle’,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/29/silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-to-bitcoiners-freedom-is-worth-the-struggle,"LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht has a message for the crypto community: if you want to maintain your freedom, you must remain unified and decentralized, and you must be prepared for a struggle. In a heart-felt keynote speech closing out Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Thursday, Ulbricht, addressing the public in-person for the first time since being released from prison in January, shared a story to illustrate his three guiding principles — freedom, decentralization and unity. Ulbricht explained that, in the early days of the Silk Road, he wanted to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms to stock the darknet marketplace with, so he rented a remote cabin. The cabin, he said, was infested with wasps. He set out to deal with the wasps, using a trick his father had taught him that involved trapping the wasps’ nests under a towel. “My heart was pounding,” Ulbricht said. “I selected the nest that was furthest from the others, because I didn’t know if the other nests would come and sting me, spread out the towel, got as close as I could — ready to flee if I had to — but when I wrapped up the nest, nothing happened. It was as if the other wasps didn’t even notice.” Ulbricht said that the wasps were strong because they were free: “It was impossible to keep track of so many individual wasps, a sting could come from any direction. They were strong because they were decentralized, across seven nests."" But, Ulbricht said, the wasps were ultimately weak because they were not unified, and did not react when their fellow wasps were taken down. “Had a single wasp dared to come sting me when I reached for that first nest, I would have fled … but they didn’t. Thank god you are not wasps,” Ulbricht said. Before being pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump in January — the result of a promise Trump made on the campaign trail in 2024 — Ulbricht spent 12 years behind bars. His speech on Thursday marked the 10-year anniversary, to the day, of a New York judge sentencing the then-31-year-old Ulbricht to two life sentences, plus 40 years, for owning and operating the dark net marketplace. During his keynote speech, Ulbricht, who has been free for four months, still seemed buoyant with his newfound freedom. In a video montage ahead of his appearance on stage, clips of Ulbricht experiencing life outside prison — traveling, surfing, spending time with his wife — played on screen, each showing a beaming Ulbricht. “Winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful,” Ulbricht said, crediting the crypto community for advocating for his release. “I’m free, and it’s because of you. You made this moment possible…Thank you, thank you, thank you.” After more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht likened himself to Rip van Winkle, admitting that he was overwhelmed with all the technological advancements since he went to prison. “There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right, and thousands more I'll never have time to learn about. There's DeFi and Web3 and AI to help me navigate it all. It's nuts,” Ulbricht said. “I mean, just a few months ago, when I walked out of prison, I'd never seen a drone … It's all hitting me at once, freedom, the new technology, the fact that I have a future again.” Ulbricht closed by telling the audience about gangs and factions in prison, saying that he quickly came to understand that the prison wardens like inmates to be divided. “The only times I saw the wardens show respect to the prisoners was when we were united,” Ulbricht said. “Those that oppose decentralization and freedom love it when we’re divided, I promise you, so stay united. So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom, and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united…stay true to these principles and the future is ours.”",Policy|Ross Ulbricht|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 01:53:34
45268937,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164250,1748570113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45268937.jpeg,Exclusive: Cantor Fitzgerald Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Fund with Gold Shield,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cantor-fitzgerald-bitcoin-fund/,"BitcoinWorld Exclusive: Cantor Fitzgerald Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Fund with Gold Shield Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management, a major player in global financial services, is making a significant move with the planned launch of its first Bitcoin fund . This isn’t just any fund; it comes with a unique feature designed to appeal to cautious investors: downside protection linked to the price of gold. What Makes This Bitcoin Fund Unique? Cantor Fitzgerald’s approach stands out. While many funds offer direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, this new five-year fund incorporates a protective mechanism. Here are the key features: Gold-Backed Protection: The fund offers 1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold. This means that for every dollar Bitcoin’s price might fall, the fund aims to offset that loss with a corresponding gain (or reduced loss) tied to gold’s performance. It’s important to note this isn’t physically backed by gold held by the fund, but rather uses financial instruments to achieve a correlation-based hedge. Upside Exposure: Investors still get exposure to the potential upside of Bitcoin’s price appreciation. No Cap on Gains: Unlike some structured products, the fund does not cap the potential profits from Bitcoin’s rise. Five-Year Term: It is structured as a five-year investment vehicle. Targeting Institutions: The fund is primarily aimed at institutional investors, reflecting the growing demand from this segment. This structure attempts to address one of the primary concerns investors have about Bitcoin: its volatility. By linking protection to gold, an asset traditionally seen as a safe haven and store of value, Cantor Fitzgerald is positioning this fund as a potentially less volatile way for institutions to gain crypto exposure. Expanding Institutional Access to Institutional Bitcoin Beyond the new fund, Cantor Fitzgerald is also significantly expanding its Bitcoin financing business. The firm reportedly has up to $2 billion available for institutional clients looking for financing solutions related to Bitcoin. This includes services like: Lending against Bitcoin holdings. Providing capital for Bitcoin-related businesses. Offering prime brokerage services for large crypto trades. This expansion signals Cantor Fitzgerald’s increasing commitment to the digital asset space and its belief in the long-term potential of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Providing robust financing options is crucial for institutions, as it allows them to manage liquidity, leverage positions, and execute complex strategies within the crypto market. Why the Interest in Gold-Backed Bitcoin ? The concept of pairing Bitcoin with gold might seem counterintuitive to some crypto enthusiasts who see Bitcoin as ‘digital gold.’ However, for traditional institutional investors, gold represents stability and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty – qualities they are often seeking when diversifying portfolios. The inclusion of gold-backed Bitcoin protection in this fund is a strategic move by Cantor Fitzgerald to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the nascent crypto world. It offers a familiar concept (gold as a hedge) applied to a new, volatile asset (Bitcoin), potentially making it more palatable for risk-averse institutions or those bound by specific investment mandates. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold prices is not always consistent, and the effectiveness of this protection mechanism will depend on various market factors and the specific instruments used by the fund. However, the intent is clear: to mitigate the sharp downside risks associated with direct Bitcoin investment. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment ? Cantor Fitzgerald’s move is another strong indicator of the maturing crypto investment landscape. As more reputable financial institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald enter the space with tailored products and services, it adds legitimacy and infrastructure necessary for broader institutional adoption. The availability of sophisticated financial products, like funds with built-in protection mechanisms and large-scale financing, lowers the barriers to entry for large firms previously hesitant due to volatility, regulatory uncertainty, or lack of infrastructure. This development could pave the way for other institutions to explore similar hybrid or protected crypto investment products. It highlights the demand for solutions that offer exposure to Bitcoin’s growth potential while addressing the inherent risks in ways that align with traditional finance risk management practices. While the fund is initially focused on institutions, the trend of established financial firms creating diverse crypto products ultimately benefits the entire ecosystem by increasing liquidity, improving market efficiency, and potentially leading to more accessible products for retail investors in the future. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Crypto The actions of firms like Cantor Fitzgerald underscore a significant shift. We are moving beyond just buying and holding Bitcoin to building a comprehensive financial ecosystem around it. The availability of $2 billion in financing demonstrates the scale of capital now being directed towards the sector by major financial players. This infrastructure is vital for the next phase of growth, enabling everything from complex trading strategies to funding for innovation within the blockchain space. Challenges remain, including regulatory clarity and operational complexities. However, the commitment shown by firms like Cantor Fitzgerald suggests that institutions are actively working through these challenges to participate in what they see as a significant opportunity. The blend of traditional assets (like the gold link) with digital assets (Bitcoin) in new financial products is likely a trend we will see continue as the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) continue to blur. Cantor Fitzgerald’s new fund and expanded financing are important steps in making crypto more accessible and manageable for large investors, potentially driving further capital into the market and solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a recognized asset class within the global financial system.

While the market capitalization of Ethereum (ETH) has seen an uptick, the bank’s findings suggest this hasn’t translated into a meaningful boost in core network usage or significant inflows into potential spot ETH ETF products. What Did JPMorgan’s Analysis Reveal About Ethereum? According to details reported by The Block, the core of JPMorgan ‘s assessment revolves around a perceived disconnect between market valuation and on-chain activity. Here’s a breakdown of their key observations: Market Cap vs. Activity: The report acknowledges an increase in Ethereum ‘s market cap, suggesting positive market sentiment or anticipation. However, it notes a lack of corresponding significant growth in fundamental network activity metrics. CME Futures vs. Spot ETFs: A noticeable increase in long positions within the CME ETH futures market was highlighted. This contrasts sharply with the absence of significant inflows into spot ETH ETF s, which are still awaiting approval or broader availability in many key markets. Individual Investor Interest: The divergence between institutional-leaning futures activity and the lack of spot ETF inflows (often seen as a proxy for broader retail/individual interest) led analysts to conclude that individual investor enthusiasm for Ethereum currently remains subdued. This analysis provides a snapshot of how a major financial institution views the current dynamics within the Ethereum ecosystem, focusing on tangible market and on-chain data rather than just price movements. Understanding Ethereum Network Activity and the Pectra Upgrade When analysts like those at JPMorgan talk about Ethereum Network Activity , they are referring to a range of on-chain metrics that indicate how much the network is actually being used. These can include: Transaction Count: The number of successful transactions processed on the network. Active Addresses: The daily or monthly count of unique wallet addresses sending or receiving ETH or interacting with smart contracts. Gas Usage: The total amount of ‘gas’ (the unit of computation on Ethereum) consumed by transactions, reflecting the complexity and volume of operations like DeFi interactions or NFT transfers. Smart Contract Interactions: The number of times users interact with decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or NFT platforms built on Ethereum. A major network upgrade, such as the Pectra Upgrade (referencing the proposed Prague/Electra combination or potentially a recent one like Dencun, depending on the report’s specific timing and terminology), is typically expected to improve the network’s efficiency, scalability, or functionality. These improvements are often anticipated to lead to increased usage, lower costs, and thus, a boost in Ethereum Network Activity . JPMorgan’s report highlights that, in their view, this expected activity surge hasn’t materialized despite the upgrade’s rollout. The Puzzle: Why Low Spot ETH ETF Inflows Despite Futures Interest? The distinction made by JPMorgan between CME ETH futures and spot ETH ETF s is significant. CME futures are primarily utilized by institutional traders and sophisticated investors for hedging or speculating on price movements without holding the underlying asset. Spot ETH ETF s, on the other hand, would hold actual ETH and are often seen as a more accessible investment vehicle for retail investors and traditional financial advisors, offering exposure to the asset class through regulated brokerage accounts. The observed increase in CME futures activity suggests continued institutional interest in having exposure to Ethereum ‘s price. However, the lack of substantial inflows into available or anticipated spot ETH ETF products points to potential hurdles for broader adoption. These hurdles could include regulatory uncertainty (especially in jurisdictions where spot ETH ETFs are not yet approved), lingering caution among traditional investors regarding direct crypto exposure, or simply a lack of strong conviction among individual investors at the current price levels. This divergence supports JPMorgan ‘s conclusion that while institutional players might be engaging with ETH derivatives, the enthusiasm from the wider individual investor base, often targeted by spot ETFs, appears muted. Implications for the Ethereum Network and Investor Sentiment What does JPMorgan ‘s analysis suggest about the current state of the Ethereum Network Activity and investor sentiment? It implies that: Upgrades Alone May Not Drive Adoption: While technical improvements from the Pectra Upgrade are valuable, they might not be sufficient on their own to immediately translate into significantly increased user activity or attract widespread new investment via easily accessible products like spot ETFs. Retail Adoption Remains a Challenge: The path to bringing millions of new individual users and investors onto the Ethereum Network or into ETH investment vehicles still faces considerable obstacles, whether they are related to complexity, perceived risk, or lack of accessible investment products. Institutional vs. Retail Divergence: There appears to be a notable difference in how institutional and retail investors are currently engaging with Ethereum , with institutions seemingly more comfortable with derivatives like futures than individuals are with potential spot investment products. This perspective from a major financial institution serves as a reminder that despite positive developments like network upgrades and increasing market cap, the growth and adoption of the Ethereum Network are complex processes influenced by technology, market structure, regulation, and investor psychology. Looking Ahead: What to Watch For Given JPMorgan ‘s assessment, what should market participants and Ethereum enthusiasts monitor in the coming months? Key indicators will include: Ethereum Network Activity Metrics: Keep an eye on transaction counts, active addresses, and gas usage. A sustained upward trend in these metrics would contradict the report’s findings and signal organic growth. Spot ETH ETF Developments: Regulatory decisions and the actual performance and inflows of spot ETH ETF s in jurisdictions where they are approved will be crucial gauges of individual investor demand. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall health and direction of the crypto market significantly influence activity and investment in individual assets like Ethereum . Impact of Future Upgrades: While the report focused on the period after the referenced upgrade, the long-term effects of Pectra Upgrade features (or subsequent developments) on network usability and cost could still drive activity over time. While JPMorgan ‘s report offers a cautious view, it provides valuable data points for understanding the current landscape. The lack of immediate widespread individual investor enthusiasm via spot ETFs and network activity doesn’t negate Ethereum’s long-term potential but highlights the challenges in translating technical advancements and institutional interest into broad-based adoption. Summary: JPMorgan’s Sobering Take on Ethereum Post-Upgrade In conclusion, JPMorgan ‘s recent report presents a somewhat sobering perspective on Ethereum ‘s performance following the cited Pectra Upgrade . Despite an increase in market valuation and institutional engagement via futures, the bank found little evidence of a significant surge in fundamental Ethereum Network Activity or strong individual investor demand as reflected in spot ETH ETF inflows. This analysis underscores the ongoing journey for Ethereum to translate its technical prowess and market presence into widespread, tangible usage and broad retail investment.

Here’s what could happen next, according to historical trends. Toncoin Open Interest Has Hit Its Highest Since February In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Toncoin. The “Open Interest” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to TON (in USD) that are currently open on all derivatives platforms. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up more positions related to the asset on the market. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when new positions appear, so this kind of trend can lead to higher volatility for the cryptocurrency’s price.

On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests that investors are closing their own positions voluntarily or being forcibly liquidated by their exchange. Either way, the asset can behave in a more stable manner following such a trend due to the drop in leverage. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Toncoin Open Interest over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Toncoin Open Interest has just seen a very sharp spike, a sign that traders have opened up a large number of futures positions. More specifically, the metric’s value has gone up from $143 million to $190 million over the last 24 hours. From the chart, it’s visible that this quick 33% jump initially came as the coin’s price witnessed a rapid increase, but interestingly, it maintained its upward trajectory even as the asset saw a pullback. “Past spikes like this have often preceded corrections – worth watching closely,” notes Glassnode. The last time the Toncoin Open Interest formed this pattern was at the end of March/start of April. What followed back then was a price drawdown of about 32%.

As the analytics firm has pointed out in its latest weekly report, Bitcoin has also been observing a major rise in its Open Interest. As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin Open Interest fell to a low of $36.8 billion in April as the cryptocurrency’s price itself went down. Since then, however, the indicator has shot up by 51% alongside the bull rally, reaching the $55.6 billion mark. The report explains that this suggests “a build up of leverage is underway.” TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.34, up more than 11% in the last 24 hours.

Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, is making waves with its investment strategy. The company’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, recently shared compelling details about how Tether is utilizing its substantial profits, and it involves a major focus on the leading cryptocurrency: Bitcoin . Tether’s Profitable Strategy: Reinvesting in Bitcoin Speaking at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dropped a notable statistic: Tether has generated approximately $20 billion in profits over the past three years. This figure alone underscores the immense scale and success of Tether’s operations within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What’s even more interesting is where these profits are going. According to reports from Odaily covering Ardoino’s comments, a surprisingly small portion—less than 5%—has been allocated to shareholder dividends. This indicates a strong preference for reinvestment back into the business and strategic assets rather than immediate payouts. The vast majority of these profits, the remaining 95%, are being channeled into two primary areas: Expanding Tether’s global distribution network Significant reinvestment in Bitcoin This clear emphasis on acquiring more Bitcoin with company profits signals a bullish stance from one of the most influential entities in the crypto market. It highlights Tether’s confidence not only in its own business model but also in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. Why is Tether Investing Heavily in Bitcoin ? Tether’s decision to allocate a large percentage of its profits towards Bitcoin isn’t entirely new, but the sheer scale revealed by Paolo Ardoino is noteworthy. Tether first publicly disclosed its Bitcoin holdings as part of its reserves in May 2023. At the time, they stated they would regularly allocate up to 15% of their net operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin. This latest announcement suggests that the actual percentage of *total* profits (which would include operating profits, interest income from reserves, etc.) being directed into Bitcoin and growth initiatives is substantially higher than the previously stated 15% of *operating* profits. The $20 billion figure represents the total financial gain over three years. Several factors likely drive this strategy: Diversification: While Tether’s primary reserves back USDT and are largely held in safe, liquid assets like U.S. Treasury bills, allocating a portion of profits to Bitcoin adds a growth-oriented asset to their balance sheet. Potential Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically been a high-performing asset. Investing profits into BTC allows Tether to potentially grow its non-reserve holdings significantly if Bitcoin’s value increases. Alignment with the Crypto Ecosystem: As a cornerstone of the crypto market, holding Bitcoin aligns Tether with the broader digital asset landscape and demonstrates confidence in the technology it serves. Strategic Positioning: Large Bitcoin holdings can enhance Tether’s financial strength and strategic flexibility, separate from the assets specifically backing USDT redemptions. This approach allows Tether to benefit from Bitcoin’s potential upside while maintaining the stability and liquidity required to back the circulating supply of its stablecoin, USDT . Understanding Tether’s Profitability How does Tether generate such massive profits? The primary source of income for Tether comes from the interest earned on the reserves it holds to back the value of USDT . As the circulating supply of USDT has exploded, reaching tens of billions, the reserves have grown proportionally. A significant portion of these reserves is held in interest-bearing instruments, particularly short-term U.S. Treasury bills. With rising interest rates globally over the past few years, the income generated from these reserves has become substantial. This interest income forms a large part of the profits that Paolo Ardoino referenced. Additional revenue streams can include fees from minting/redeeming USDT, although interest income is typically the dominant factor. Here’s a simplified look at the profit allocation based on Ardoino’s statement: Profit Allocation (Past 3 Years) Approximate Amount (Based on $20B Total Profit) Percentage of Total Profit Shareholder Dividends Less than $1 billion Less than 5% Reinvestment (Global Distribution & Bitcoin ) More than $19 billion More than 95% This table clearly illustrates the strong bias towards reinvestment over immediate shareholder returns, a strategy that aligns with long-term growth objectives, including significant Crypto Investment . What Does This Mean for the Market and USDT Holders? Tether’s massive reinvestment strategy has several implications for the broader crypto market and for users of USDT : Potential Bitcoin Price Impact: Consistent, large-scale buying by an entity like Tether adds significant buying pressure to the Bitcoin market. While it’s difficult to isolate Tether’s exact impact, their accumulation is undoubtedly a bullish factor. Signal of Confidence: Tether’s willingness to hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet sends a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and its role as a store of value. Tether’s Financial Strength: By reinvesting profits into potentially appreciating assets like Bitcoin, Tether can further strengthen its overall financial position, separate from the specific assets backing USDT . This could be seen as a positive for the long-term stability of the company, though it doesn’t directly impact the 1:1 peg of USDT, which is backed by specific reserve assets. Increased Scrutiny: Large holdings of volatile assets like Bitcoin, even if held separately from core reserves, may attract increased scrutiny from regulators, who are already focused on stablecoin reserves and operations. For holders of USDT , it’s crucial to remember that the assets backing the stablecoin’s peg are kept separate from Tether’s corporate profits and investments. The value of USDT remains tied to the stability and liquidity of its stated reserves, which are primarily in cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and U.S. Treasury bills. The Bitcoin acquired with profits is part of Tether’s corporate treasury, not the direct backing for every USDT token. Challenges and Considerations While Tether’s aggressive Crypto Investment strategy, particularly into Bitcoin, highlights strong profitability and a bullish outlook, it’s not without potential challenges or points of consideration: Market Volatility: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin exposes Tether’s corporate treasury to the inherent volatility of the crypto market. While this doesn’t directly impact the USDT peg (as BTC is not a primary reserve asset for the peg), significant downturns could affect Tether’s overall financial statements and profitability in future periods. Transparency: While Tether has improved its reporting over the years, the exact timing and scale of their Bitcoin purchases from profits are not always immediately clear, which can lead to speculation.

The market is no longer rewarding coins based solely on hype or historical dominance. Instead, attention is moving toward platforms with real-world applications, modular infrastructure, and developer-friendly tools. At the center of this shift is Qubetics , which has rapidly become one of the best cryptos to buy this week for long-term utility and scalability. Unlike other Layer 1s that chase headlines, Qubetics builds for function. It simplifies blockchain adoption for enterprises, developers, and emerging markets by focusing on interoperability and real-world asset tokenization. That approach sets it apart from Aptos, which is making cautious inroads into healthcare data, and Maker, which is undergoing a rebrand with unclear traction. In an increasingly utility-driven market, Qubetics is consistently named among the best cryptos to buy this week. As the demand for cross-chain efficiency, privacy, and business-ready solutions intensifies, projects like Qubetics are no longer optional—they are essential. This article explores why Qubetics is rising as a top contender among the best cryptos to buy this week, and how Aptos and Maker are attempting to adapt in a rapidly evolving space. Qubetics: Building the Blockchain Tools Businesses Actually Use Qubetics recently secured partnerships across Kazakhstan’s government-led blockchain pilot programs, introducing tools like QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE into regional enterprise infrastructure. This agreement strengthens its positioning as a global blockchain utility provider, not just a speculative crypto asset. Presale Stats Reflect Explosive Growth Qubetics is currently in Stage 36 of its crypto presale , with the token priced at $0.3064. So far, the project has: Sold over 514 million tokens Onboarded 27,200+ holders Raised more than $17.5 million These figures demonstrate a powerful level of early adoption, especially given the project’s focus on solving real-world problems in areas like tokenized finance, privacy infrastructure, and decentralized development tools. Modular Framework, Real Impact Qubetics operates as an all-in-one blockchain development ecosystem tailored for cross-chain applications. It simplifies smart contract creation, dApp deployment, and security auditing with modular tools that require no redundant configurations. Key Highlights: Cross-chain compatible smart contract deployment Drag-and-drop IDE for developers Legal frameworks for tokenizing real-world assets Institutional wallet integrations Unlike most tokens with limited use cases, Qubetics actively helps businesses bridge Web2 and Web3 without needing custom network builds. That focus makes it more than a coin—it’s a developer suite with regulatory foresight. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: Enterprise Privacy on Blockchain Privacy is no longer a luxury—it’s a requirement. Qubetics integrates a decentralized VPN infrastructure that enhances online privacy for businesses and users alike. This system is blockchain-native, creating a revenue model for bandwidth providers while shielding users from centralized surveillance. Decentralized VPN Features: End-to-end encryption using Zero-Knowledge Proofs Monetized participation for node operators Cross-border routing to avoid censorship Integration with the native Qubetics wallet This decentralized VPN feature positions Qubetics not just as a crypto project, but as a privacy-first infrastructure provider, giving it long-term relevance in digital compliance, cloud security, and cross-border communications. Aptos (APT) Inches Up to $5.37 as Trading Volume Jumps 41%, Market Eyes Renewed Upside Potential Aptos (APT), ranked #33 by market capitalization, registered a 0.89% gain in the past 24 hours, reaching $5.37 alongside a sharp 40.88% surge in daily trading volume, which rose to $167.06 million. The project now holds a circulating supply of 632.61 million APT out of a total 1.15 billion, with a market cap of $3.4 billion and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $6.19 billion. While APT still trades 72.91% below its peak price of $19.90 set in January 2023, it has seen a strong 74.6% recovery from its December 2022 low of $3.09.

Despite the price rally, Maker’s market capitalization holds steady at $1.47 billion, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $1.74 billion. The platform’s self-reported circulating supply stands at 847.22K MKR out of a 1 million max supply, and it supports a robust Total Value Locked (TVL) of $5.51 billion—highlighting its foundational role in decentralized finance. Trading between $1,653.38 and $1,769.96 in the past 24 hours, MKR remains 72.46% below its all-time high of $6,339.02 from May 2021, yet it’s recorded a staggering 8,189% gain since its all-time low of $21.06 in January 2017. With a profile score of 74%, Maker continues to be a dominant force in the DeFi space, driving stability through its governance model and the Dai stablecoin ecosystem.

It means that a lot of people that look at Bitcoin are going to be afraid of it. They'll never touch it. They'll never benefit from it. They'll be left behind. Then others will just juggle it. They will juggle the fire. They will make fireworks with the fire. They will create trinkets with the fire. They will create magic tricks with the fire. But those that truly understand it will feed the fire. How do you feed the fire? You feed the fire by buying Bitcoin. “ Saylor — who has taken on a near-mythic status in the bitcoin community for his leadership of Strategy, a publicly-traded technology company-turned-bitcoin treasury company, which holds approximately 3% of the total bitcoin supply — said that people should trade their other, inferior assets for bitcoin. “Take your fiat currency, trade it for bitcoin. Take your long term capital, trade it for bitcoin. Sell your bonds, trade [them] for Bitcoin. Sell your inferior equity, sell your inferior real estate property, buy bitcoin,” Saylor said. “Feed the fire, and what will come of that? An extraordinary explosion in the network and [in] the power of the network, and you will have bought your ticket to prosperity.” Thus was Saylor’s third way to wealth — courage — which he said meant that wealth “favors those who embrace intelligent monetary risk.” Bitcoin, like other assets, rises in price if more people buy it, though Saylor did not mention this effect during his speech. In addition to courage, Saylor advised the audience to have conviction in bitcoin’s potential, to stay committed to one cause, to cooperate with their families and children, to embrace artificial intelligence, to consider civility when engaging with the “natural power structures of the world,” and to remember to be generous. “When you are successful — and you will be successful — get up every morning and spread happiness, share security, and deliver hope to those less fortunate than you,” Saylor said. “You found the path first, you found the way first. You should spread good karma.”",Markets|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy|Strategy|News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 02:16:57

Possible Reasons Behind The Dip Today Macroeconomic Factors: On the macro side, the market sentiment was hit after a second US court blocked President Trump’s proposed tariffs. In addition, Treasury Secretary Bessent confirmed that trade talks with China have stalled — adding uncertainty to global markets, including crypto. Fear & Greed Index Signals ‘Greed’ at 61: The crypto Fear & Greed Index remains at 61 (Greed). Historically, markets tend to cool down after extended periods of greed-driven rallies, and today’s decline fits that pattern.

Analysts said that Bitcoin is currently flashing short-term warning signals as it liquidates long positions. The market is cooling off after weeks of upward momentum, and technical indicators like the Super Trend remain green but are starting to slow in bullish momentum. Ethereum Rejected at Resistance: Ethereum faced rejection from a major resistance zone once again, pulling its price down by over 3.6% in the past 24 hours to trade around $2,609. A slowing MACD on the 3-day timeframe also hints at weakening bullish momentum, raising concerns of a possible bearish crossover in the coming weeks.

The Act proposes comprehensive registration regimes to allow digital asset firms to operate legally within the U.S. market. Lawmakers emphasize the bill’s focus on consumer protection, innovation, and institutional clarity for investors and entrepreneurs. A long-awaited effort to bring order to the murky world of U.S. crypto regulation advanced on Thursday as Representative French Hill introduced the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, also known as the CLARITY Act. The bill arrives with bipartisan support, including three Democratic co-sponsors, and seeks to finally resolve the jurisdictional tug-of-war between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The New Bipartisan Crypto Bill Seeks to End SEC-CFTC Turf War The 236-page bill is a successor to last year’s FIT21 legislation. While stablecoin regulation still leads the race to become the first comprehensive crypto law in the U.S., the CLARITY Act represents a major step forward in shaping broader crypto market structure rules. At its core, the bill gives the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over digital commodity spot markets. These would be governed by new entities registered with the agency. Source: US Congress Crypto platforms would have the option to register with either the CFTC or the SEC, depending on whether they handle digital commodities like Bitcoin or securities, or both. “Our bill brings long-overdue clarity to the digital asset ecosystem and prioritizes consumer protection and American innovation,” said Representative Hill. “It builds off our work in the 118th Congress.” The legislation introduces comprehensive registration regimes, allowing crypto firms to legally operate in the U.S. It also lays out disclosure and compliance requirements for developers and intermediaries. These include detailed project disclosures, segregation of customer funds, and conflict-of-interest mitigation. “The CLARITY Act will deliver clear rules of the road that entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers deserve,” said Representative Ritchie Torres, one of the bill’s backers. Representative Dusty Johnson, who leads the agriculture subcommittee on digital assets, added: “America should be the global leader in the digital assets marketplace, but we can’t do that without establishing a clear regulatory framework.” U.S. Lawmakers Push Crypto Reform Bill Clarifying Custody, Stablecoin, and DeFi Oversight The bill covers long-disputed areas, including the regulation of custodians and decentralized finance (DeFi). It rejects the SEC’s prior attempt to require custody firms to hold customer assets on their own balance sheets. Instead, it sets a standard for “qualified digital asset custodians,” which would be defined by the CFTC based on federal, state, or foreign oversight. NEW: Chairman @RepFrenchHill today introduced the CLARITY Act, a bipartisan bill which would establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US.

The legislation tasks the SEC, CFTC, and the Treasury Department with studying these sectors and reporting back within a year. The Government Accountability Office is also directed to prepare reports on DeFi and NFTs. The bill explicitly exempts some decentralized wallet providers and DeFi platforms from SEC oversight. It also clarifies that payment stablecoins are not securities, placing regulatory authority with whichever agency already oversees the firm engaged in the activity. All told, the CLARITY Act sets a tight one-year timeline for regulators to write and implement the rules if the bill becomes law. That schedule is viewed by some as ambitious, especially given the complexities of financial regulation. Some provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, are still not finalized. NEW: US Digital Asset Market Structure bill, the CLARITY Act: 1. Clarifies CFTC vs. SEC (defining commodities & securities). 2. Unified federal licensing and registration regime. 3. Stablecoin and DeFI carve-outs. https://t.co/ZTosDCUudA pic.twitter.com/OTShEAebrn — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) May 29, 2025 Whether the House and Senate will align on crypto regulation is still unclear. The Senate is expected to resume debate next week on its stablecoin bill , which has made procedural progress but faces partisan concerns . Some lawmakers have floated the idea of combining the stablecoin and market structure bills , though such a move could complicate passage. President Donald Trump has pushed for both bills to reach his desk by the August congressional recess, but crypto insiders in Washington view that timeline as unlikely. For now, the bipartisan CLARITY Act gives lawmakers and regulators a new framework to work with and puts renewed pressure on Congress to end the longstanding confusion over crypto regulation in the United States.

Dogecoin is eyeing a potential run toward $1, while Avalanche hovers around the $30 mark. But while traders wait for breakouts, another project is making quiet strides. BlockDAG, available at just $0.0018 during its presale, has already raised over $276 million. Market predictions point to a future price as high as $20 per coin. This massive price gap is turning heads, suggesting that this may be the most valuable entry point in the current cycle. BlockDAG is not just chasing trends. It is focused on building a reliable foundation for fast, secure, and widely usable blockchain systems. With Dogecoin and Avalanche still performing, BlockDAG echoes their early potential, offering an entry before wider market interest takes hold. AVAX Eyes $40 as Market Momentum and DeFi Growth Build Up Avalanche (AVAX) remains a strong Layer-1 project in 2025, now trading close to $30. Analysts note a solid chart formation, hinting at a possible breakout. If current volumes continue, targets up to $40 may soon be in sight. The rising optimism around AVAX comes from more than just price activity. Its ecosystem is growing steadily through new partnerships and DeFi features. While AVAX has regained some support, it still sits far below its all-time high. The upside is still there, but compared to earlier phases, it now comes with higher risk and smaller rewards. DOGE Prepares for $1 Push but Faces Limited Room to Climb Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold strong, drawing attention with its $1 price target. Recent analysis shows DOGE might be preparing for another upward swing, backed by favorable chart trends and better market sentiment. It has reclaimed the $0.25 range and looks steady before a possible move higher. Large holders are accumulating DOGE, and daily transactions are increasing. These signs point to growing momentum. Still, as a widely known name, its price rise from $0.25 to $1 represents a 4x return. This is solid, but smaller when compared to lesser-known coins trading below $0.01 with more room for growth. Why BlockDAG Is Gaining Market Traction at $0.0018 While top coins like DOGE and AVAX remain in the spotlight, BlockDAG is becoming the standout project of 2025. With over $276 million raised and 21.5 billion coins sold so far, its presale reflects strong interest. The limited-time price of $0.0018 is locked until June 13, even though Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262. This leaves room for a huge potential profit before it reaches its $0.05 launch level. BlockDAG combines DAG speed with blockchain security, making it a hybrid Layer-1 designed for global scalability. The system supports parallel transaction processing and is EVM-compatible, which helps developers move apps with ease. A low-code smart contract tool is included, helping non-technical users build on the network through simple drag-and-drop tools. Beyond software, BlockDAG uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work setup and physical mining gear. Devices such as the X10, X30, and X100 will start mining after the mainnet goes live. This makes the $0.0018 rate especially compelling. For instance, $1,000 buys more than 555,000 BDAG. If the coin reaches $1, that’s $555,000. At $20, it turns into over $11 million. These figures echo the early days of BTC and ETH, making BlockDAG one of the most discussed names this year. BlockDAG Could Lead the Cycle’s Breakout Narrative Dogecoin and Avalanche still offer gains, but their early growth phase is largely behind them. Their performance now tracks with market trends. BlockDAG, however, is just starting and offers real upside for those who act fast. With the price fixed at $0.0018 until June 13, and over $276 million already secured, BlockDAG stands out. Its strong structure, growing reach, and unique features give it a serious edge. The GO LIVE reveal will only boost visibility. For those still waiting, this may be the right moment to look closer before the market fully catches on.

XXRP uses swaps to provide leveraged XRP exposure, but carries heightened risk and volatility compared to spot products. XRP is already more volatile than other digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. So XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. Long-term investors should use the futures ETF or wait for spot XRP ETFs rather than holding leveraged products like XXRP. In my recent coverage of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( OTC:BITW ) for Seeking Alpha, I made note of how it was becoming increasingly possible to mimic the top holdings of that fund but through allocating to various ETFs and closed-end funds in a traditional a self-directed IRA. At 90% combined allocation between Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), spot ETFs are useful tools for self-directing asset weightings. Allocating the 3% exposure to Solana ( SOL-USD ) is also quite easy given the OTC market offers two different closed-end funds as well as a futures-based ETF. 5% of BITW assets are in XRP ( XRP-USD ). Despite the US market lacking spot ETFs or OTC market CEF shares, traders can get exposed to XRP through the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF ( XXRP ). In this article, we'll look at Teucrium's fund details, how it allocates XRP exposure, and why speculators with longer term time horizons should wait for spot ETFs rather than sitting in XXRP shares. Fund Details & Objective The objective of the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF is very simple; XXRP aims to double the return of XRP on a daily basis. To its credit, Teucrium is very overt about the fact that the fund will ultimately lag the performance of XRP over time. We'll detail that a bit more in the risks section later in this article. Believe it or not, XXRP is not the only 2x leveraged XRP ETF in the market today. In the time since my May 21st BITW article , we have seen a second 2x leveraged XRP fund begin trading, with the Volatility Shares 2x XRP ETF ( XRPT ) launching on May 22nd. Here's a straightforward comparison between the funds: Fund Comparison XXRP XRPT Issuer Teucrium Volatility Shares LLC Inception 04/07/2025 05/22/2025 Expense Ratio 1.89% 0.94% AUM $100.24M $1.70M Source: Seeking Alpha With respect to being first to market, the only real advantage XXRP has over XRPT at this point in time is liquidity. With just over $100 million in AUM against less than $2 million for XRPT, traders will likely have a far easier time executing orders at desirable prices through XXRP if they want to go the leveraged fund route. Since these funds are not to be held for longer than a few days or weeks (at most), the expense ratio likely doesn't matter as much as the liquidity difference. But it is worth pointing out that XXRP is roughly double the price of XRPT, purely by the fees associated with holding the funds. XRP Swaps Since there isn't a spot ETF for XRP yet in the US market, XXRP utilizes swap agreements with global financial institutions that allow Teucrium and its counter-parties to make payments based on XRP reference assets or benchmarks. Those could include the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, the CME CF XRP-Dollar Real-Time Index, or a handful of European XRP ETPs that are listed below: 21Shares XRP ETP Bitwise Physical XRP ETP Virtune XRP ETP WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP CoinShares Physical XRP ETP In addition to these 'XRP Swaps,' Teucrium may also hold XRP futures contracts and/or XRP options. But the point is, XXRP doesn't actually provide speculators with direct exposure to XRP. Which is definitely a consideration that US buyers should keep in mind if they want to minimize third-party risk to the degree that they can. That said, for this type of product, that concern is likely minimal. The larger concern is long term decay. 2x Leveraged ETF Risks As is generally the case with every leveraged ETF product in the market today, funds like XXRP are designed for short-term holding rather than long-term investment. For those seeking a tactical trading tool, 2x funds like XXRP can be great. The advantage they have over taking positions with margin is the leveraged funds limit downside. Trading with margin can result in a call to pledge more collateral. However, with leveraged ETFs, a trader can only lose what is put into the position. Furthermore, unlike something like 0DTE options, there is no expiration on leveraged ETF positions. So holding time can be as long as the idea is winning, or the trader has an ability to endure pain. On the latter, Teucrium's prospectus makes it very clear that XXRP is not designed for long-term holding and will ultimately lag the return of XRP if held for too long: The return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of its return for each day compounded over the period. The Fund’s returns for periods longer than a single day will very likely differ in amount, and possibly even direction, from the Fund’s stated multiple (2x) times the return of daily changes in the price of XRP for the same period. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if XRP’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the price of XRP increases. As I've said in my numerous articles covering at least a dozen leveraged ETFs prior to this one, it is imperative that entries and exits in these types of products are timed properly. Sustained periods of chop or sideways action will not help XXRP holders. While the trading history for XXRP is admittedly small since inception in early-April, we can already see how sideways action is bad for the fund: Data by YCharts The chart above shows the price performances of XRP and XXRP since April 28th. The price or XRP is roughly flat at 0.79% over the last month, yet XXRP is down nearly 10%. Some of this is due to the added volatility that comes with a 2x leveraged ETF - that volatility is entirely by design. But the volatility is compounded because XRP itself is also highly volatile. XRP Volatility I've covered XRP based on network fundamentals a handful of times for SA and recently updated that view back in April: For me, the chain usage data is actually pretty encouraging. We see transactions up over time, DAAs making highs, and even fees have noticeably increased in recent months. Still, price is well ahead of all of this action. However, even if one holds the view that XRP is a buy based on their own fundamental framework, it's important to keep in mind that any position in XXRP should likely be expressing more of a technical bull setup than a fundamental one. Crypto is already a highly volatile sector of the market, and when you get into the altcoins that volatility can get more intense. Such is the case with XRP. Volatility XRP BTC ETH 30D 0.61 0.35 0.92 90D 1.08 0.54 0.94 1Yr 0.98 0.49 0.73 Source: Messari The table above shows the volatility metrics for XRP, BTC, and ETH over 30 Day, 90 day, and 1 year time frames. In all but one time frame, XRP is more volatile than ETH and XRP is more volatile than BTC in all three time frames shared. Closing Takeaways Essentially, XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. XRP is already a very volatile asset over just about any time frame that you look at. Factor in leverage from a fund like XXRP, and we're talking about a financial product that must be actively managed by the trader who holds it. This is not a product that should be held for longer than a few days, in my view. Thus, timing the buy properly is imperative. For investors who want exposure to XRP without leverage, they can consider the Volatility Shares XRP ETF ( XRPI ) as an alternative. That fund utilizes futures contracts without the leverage to mimic XRP returns and was launched the same day as XRPT.",XRP-USD|XXRP,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-30 03:04:29

The total crypto market value slipped by 3.1%, now standing at $3.35 trillion. This sudden dip came after a U.S. court overturned President Trump’s trade tariffs, creating fresh uncertainty for investors. The Court of International Trade ruled that Trump had overstepped the powers granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act when placing those import tariffs. While the Trump administration has already filed an appeal, the decision rattled financial markets — and cryptocurrencies felt the impact as well. What’s Happening with XRP’s Price? Right now, XRP risks falling by another 16% to around $1.96 if it can’t stay above a key support level at $2.31, which is backed by the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This is making traders nervous because some early warning signs are showing up in the market. Bearish Signs in the Data A couple of things are raising red flags for XRP: Funding rates for XRP have been stuck around 0% since February. This means traders aren’t really bullish or bearish — they’re undecided. And when there’s no clear direction, prices often move sideways or dip. Open interest (the total value of active XRP futures contracts) has dropped by 9.66%, falling from a 3-month peak of $3.52 billion on May 13th to $3.2 billion now. This shows investors are pulling out their money and cutting risk on XRP. XRP ETPs saw their biggest weekly outflow of $37.2 million. This broke an incredible 80-week streak of steady inflows.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another decline if it fails to clear the $2.2440 level. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to clear the $0.3550 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.3000 and $0.280 support levels. The price even dipped below the $0.220 support level. A low was formed at $0.2132 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.220 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.3540 swing high to the $2.2132 low. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.2440 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.3540 swing high to the $2.2132 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.270 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance or even $2.3650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.420. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.270 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.180 level. The next major support is near the $2.160 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.160 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.080 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.180 and $2.160.

Does this dismissal, signed jointly by both sides, indicate a new era for crypto oversight under the Trump administration? The SEC’s case, filed in June 2023, had accused Binance Holdings, BAM Trading Services, BAM Management U.S. Holdings, and former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, and enabling trading in unregistered securities. SEC Dismisses Civil Case Against Binance and Changpeng Zhao The SEC voluntary dismissal , filed jointly with Binance with prejudice in Washington, D.C., means the regulator cannot revive these charges, marking a major shift in U.S. crypto policy and enforcement. Source: CourtListener According to the court document, the SEC stated, “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter, the Commission believes the dismissal of this Litigation is appropriate.” While the regulator provided no further explanation, it did clarify in its litigation release that the move does not necessarily reflect its stance on other cases. Over the past several months, the case had remained in limbo. In April 2025, the SEC and Binance requested a stay , followed by extension requests, suggesting shifting priorities and behind-the-scenes negotiations. The dismissal follows a turbulent 2023 for Binance, which included a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over Bank Secrecy Act violations. Zhao and Binance admitted to criminal wrongdoing as part of that settlement and agreed to overhaul compliance protocols. In a tweet celebrating the SEC’s decision, Binance called it “a huge win,” adding, “Thank you to Chairman Atkins and the Trump team for pushing back against regulation by enforcement.” Huge win for crypto today. The SEC’s case against us is dismissed. Thank you to Chairman Atkins & the Trump team for pushing back against regulation by enforcement. U.S. innovation is back on track – and it’s just the beginning. — Binance (@binance) May 29, 2025 Thursday’s court filing also referenced the SEC’s newly formed crypto task force , which has recently engaged with industry stakeholders. The task force indicates a potential shift in the agency’s regulatory strategy under evolving political and administrative leadership, particularly in contrast to the aggressive enforcement style seen during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. While the SEC may be recalibrating its crypto policy direction, it remains unclear how this dismissal might influence other ongoing or future enforcement actions. For Binance and Zhao, however, the end of this legal chapter marks a significant win as they explore continued global regulatory challenges. Policy Reset: SEC Retreats from Enforcement-Led Crypto Regulation The SEC’s dismissal of its lawsuit against Binance is part of the shift in regulatory posture under the Trump administration, marked by a move away from aggressive enforcement and toward more structured policymaking in the crypto space. In recent months, the SEC has either settled or dropped multiple high-profile cases involving other major industry players. Coinbase , ConsenSys , and Kraken all reached settlements earlier this year. Investigations into Circle, Immutable, and others were quietly closed without further action. The SEC officially dropped its cases against Consensys, Kraken, and Cumberland DRW as the agency shifts its regulatory approach. #CryptoRegulation #CryptoPolicy #SEC https://t.co/pn7Utn0XLL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 28, 2025 Lawsuits against Uniswap and OpenSea have also been withdrawn, significantly softening the agency’s stance.

According to a Thursday announcement, Fastex will offer spot crypto trading services of tokens including bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, Cardano ADA, Solana SOL and its native utility token, Fasttoken FTN, to both retail and institutional investors in the U.S. Fastex’s American expansion comes as the U.S. continues to overhaul its approach to crypto regulation under President Donald Trump’s administration. Since Trump took office in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has retreated from the so-called regulation-by-enforcement approach to crypto it took under former Chair Gary Gensler, dropping a host of open investigations and closing ongoing litigation against crypto exchanges. In an interview with CoinDesk at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Fastex’s Chief Legal Officer and board member Vardan Khachatryan said that the SEC’s softened stance toward crypto regulation played a major role in the exchange’s decision to expand in the U.S., though he acknowledged that there is still no concrete legal framework for crypto in the country. “There has been enough of a policy change, at least in terms of [how the U.S. government is] viewing things, that allowed us to go for this,” Khachatryan said. “It’s still kind of a risk, but it’s a lower risk.” With a host of crypto companies returning to the U.S. due to the Trump Administration's crypto-friendly policies, cities like New York are hoping to attract companies expanding to the U.S. to set up shop in their jurisdictions. But, while Khachatryan said New York would be “the right place to be in terms of headquarters,” he said that, for now, the prospect of obtaining a BitLicense — the notoriously difficult-to-obtain crypto license issued by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) — is prohibitive. “I hope that things will change a bit,” Khachatryan said. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has branded himself the “Bitcoin Mayor” in an attempt to lure crypto companies to New York, called for the end to the BitLicense regime during a speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance published a staff statement — the latest in a series from the regulator — spelling out how the regulator may evaluate proof-of-stake networks, mainly noting that covered activities do not ""involve the offer and sale of securities"" — meaning the SEC won't sue any person or company participating in those activities. Node operators and validators, custodians, delegates, nominators and entities staking assets either on their own, staking directly with a third party or staking on behalf of an asset's owners fall into this bucket, the staff statement said. In this, the SEC seems to suggest that staking will be treated identically to mining, the consensus mechanism securing networks like Bitcoin BTC, which the SEC clarified also did not implicate securities laws in a similar staff statement last month. The SEC's staff statement was ""very clear for a subject that can be a little bit complicated,"" said Lorien Gabel, the CEO of staking-focused crypto firm Figment. And its main upside appears to be saying that various activities U.S. companies might have shied away from in the past are okay now. ""They included some ancillary staking activities. For example, we provide insurance around slashing [and we also provide] modified unbonding periods ,"" he said. ""And they said that actually doesn't mean that you're a manager of assets as a staking provider."" The SEC statement said companies that want to provide those types of services, or even pooled staking, can do so, he said. Thursday's statement is an incremental but important update from the regulator, said Alison Mangiero, the head of staking policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation. ""This reaffirms that there's going to be similar treatment for stakers that there is for miners. And I think it's especially important because, given under [former SEC Chair Gary] Gensler, there were so many enforcement actions that were focused on staking as a service … we saw a lot of those cases dismissed, and the Coinbase case dismissed with prejudice,"" she said. ""We assumed that this would be the stance, but actually having a staff statement that asserts it, I think is crucially important."" The fact it came just days before the SEC faces a deadline on a number of applications to bring staking into spot ether ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is telling, she said. It's likely that the ETF providers would have received staking approvals regardless, but the SEC statement will likely start speeding up the process for securing those approvals, Gabel said. As with the SEC's previous staff statements, Thursday's included a footnote clarifying that it is very narrowly tailored and certain restrictions would apply. It is not a replacement for rulemaking done through the actual commissioners and ""has no legal force or effect,"" the footnote said. ""This statement only addresses certain activities involving Covered Crypto Assets that do not have intrinsic economic properties or rights, such as generating a passive yield or conveying rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business enterprise,"" another footnote said.",News Analysis|SEC|Staking|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 03:24:48
45271692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=761530,1748575802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45271692.jpeg,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls at $108K as Key Risk Metric Flashes Red, Is Correction Looming?",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rally-stalls-at-108k-as-key-risk-metric-flashes-red-is-correction-looming/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has recently experienced a slight slowdown after its impressive upward run, trading at $108,012 at the time of writing. Over the past week, Bitcoin has recorded a 3.1% decline, indicating a moderate pullback from recent highs. However, despite this short-term downtrend, the asset continues to hold steady above significant support levels, suggesting minimal selling pressure from market participants. Amid the current pullback phase, analysts have started to express caution regarding Bitcoin’s immediate outlook. In particular, one CryptoQuant analyst known by the handle Crazzyblockk highlighted the emergence of an elevated market risk signal through the “Standardized 60-Day Realized Cap Volatility (RCV)” metric. This indicator, frequently monitored by investors to assess risk levels, has reportedly crossed a critical historical threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Understanding the Elevated Risk Signal The 60-Day Standardized RCV, as explained by Crazzyblockk, measures the variance between Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, essentially the cumulative value at which all coins last moved, and its market capitalization. This metric is normalized to account for volatility, thus helping investors detect significant shifts in market sentiment. Currently, the Standardized RCV value has reached 1.9, surpassing the 1.5 threshold traditionally viewed as indicative of high market risk. Historically, when the 60-Day Standardized RCV exceeds values between 1.5 and 1.9, it has often preceded local market peaks or considerable corrections. According to the analyst, these elevated readings indicate periods when investor behavior, characterized by increased profit-taking and speculative activities, diverges notably from Bitcoin’s fundamental valuation. Implications for Bitcoin Investors The current Standardized RCV reading suggests that Bitcoin’s market might be approaching a point of heightened caution. Although this indicator alone is not a definitive sell signal, it does suggest investors should adopt a more conservative risk management approach, especially in regard to new positions or leveraged trades. This cautious stance aligns with historical data from other widely monitored metrics like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), both of which currently reflect similarly heightened risk levels. For investors, the present scenario necessitates careful consideration of market conditions before making strategic moves. The Standardized RCV indicator serves as a precise gauge to navigate market volatility, advising investors to consider reducing exposure, tightening stop-losses, or potentially waiting for a clearer alignment of price with underlying fundamentals before making substantial commitments. Crazzyblockk noted: Now is a time for risk management, not euphoria. Investors may consider reducing exposure, tightening stops, or awaiting a retest of fundamentals before re-entry. Standardized RCV continues to be a precision tool in navigating crypto volatility.

However, these instruments must be non-deliverable, meaning investors won’t be able to hold the digital assets; instead, they will only receive payouts based on price movements. Strict Risk Controls In a May 28 press release , the central bank confirmed that Russian financial institutions are now allowed to issue financial derivatives, digital financial assets (DFAs), and other securities pegged to cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, access to these offerings is strictly limited to investors who meet certain legal criteria, with the general public remaining excluded. The financial regulator has also adopted a conservative risk approach. Credit institutions must fully back such positions with capital and implement individual exposure limits. These measures are meant to reduce the impact of crypto price fluctuations and prevent broader financial risks, with plans of formalizing the requirements within the year. Despite this update, the Bank of Russia is maintaining its broader opposition to cryptocurrencies and will continue to advise against direct investment in them. Broader Efforts to Advance Crypto Regulation This move follows similar efforts to create a legal framework for digital assets in Russia. The government is currently reviewing proposals from the monetary authority for a pilot program that would restrict crypto transactions to certain categories of investors. To qualify, participants must hold at least $1.1 million in securities and deposits or have earned over $570,000 in the previous year. The pilot, introduced in March, is expected to run for three years if approved and could play a key role in shaping the future of digital asset use within Russia’s financial system. Similarly, the Russian Finance Ministry and the national bank have begun laying the foundation for a government-run crypto exchange that is expected to launch in the coming months. According to local media reports, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed that the initiative would support the legalization of crypto use and bring digital transactions under regulatory oversight. The exchange will operate within the country’s experimental legal framework for financial innovation and will be open only to a limited group of approved investors for conducting regulated crypto transactions. Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov also highlighted that the platform could be developed using existing financial infrastructure or by newly licensed entities. Meanwhile, Russia continues to use cryptocurrency in oil trade with India and China. Last year, Siluanov confirmed that domestic businesses have been using digital assets to work around economic sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

The regulator said that Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX and XT.COM were found to be operating without a license. All five platforms have been accused of offering trading services to Thai users without authorization through their websites. As a result, legal action has been initiated with the Economic Crime Suppression Division. This is “to protect investors and prevent illegal platforms from being used for money laundering by criminals,” the SEC said in a translated statement. The Thailand SEC announced that it will block cryptocurrency exchanges Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX and XT platforms on June 28, 2025, and initiate legal proceedings against them for being unlicensed digital asset business operators. https://t.co/VeOM7onr3M — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 Regulators Now Armed with Legal Tools to Target Offshore Crypto Operators The action follows months of increasing regulatory pressure. In response to rising concerns, Thailand passed new anti-cybercrime legislation in April. This law empowered the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society to quickly block suspicious websites and platforms. More specifically, the Royal Decree on the Prevention and Suppression of Technological Crime came into effect that month. As a result, authorities were granted broader powers to shut down unlicensed digital services targeting Thai users. Since then, the government has intensified enforcement . It is now focusing on crypto exchanges that operate outside the country’s legal framework. Crypto Platforms Face Tighter Rules as Thailand Tests Blockchain in Public Finance This move is part of a wider effort by Thai regulators to clean up the local crypto market. To support this shift, the Ministry of Finance introduced G-Token , a blockchain-based investment token, last month. It allows retail investors to purchase government bonds. Notably, the $150m issuance marks Thailand’s first attempt at tokenized public fundraising. According to, Jomkwan Kongsakul, deputy secretary-general of the SEC, the G-Token would launch through an approved initial coin offering portal. In this setup, the Finance Ministry will serve as registrar. However, the SEC has said that G-Tokens cannot be used as a medium of exchange. This restriction clearly separates regulated digital assets from the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading. At the same time, regulators have tightened rules for digital asset firms. These include stricter customer screening, faster suspension of suspicious accounts, and more support for fraud victims. Further, under the new law, the scope of accountability has widened. Banks, telecom firms and social media platforms can also be held liable if they fail to prevent cybercrime on their networks.

The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Thursday that it has designated Funnull Technology, along with its administrator, Liu Lizhi, for supporting cyber-enabled investment fraud operations, often known as “ pig butchering” scams . “Today’s action underscores our focus on disrupting the criminal enterprises, like Funnull, that enable these cyber scams and deprive Americans of their hard-earned savings,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Michael Faulkender. Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Funnull Technology Inc., a Philippines-based company that provides computer infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of websites involved in virtual currency investment scams, commonly known as… — Treasury Department (@USTreasury) May 29, 2025 US Treasury Links Funnull to Infrastructure Behind Widespread Crypto Fraud According to the Treasury, Funnull provided technical infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of scam websites. Many of these sites were tied to crypto fraud. In particular, they targeted Americans through fake investment schemes. The company allegedly bought IP addresses in bulk from cloud service providers. It then sold them to cybercriminals. These actors used the infrastructure to host scam websites and other malicious content. Moreover, investigators say Funnull’s infrastructure supported many platforms flagged in crypto scam reports to the FBI. Victims of these scams reported average losses of more than $150,000. Typically, the scams rely on false identities and scripted conversations. These are used to build trust with victims. Eventually, the victims are persuaded to invest in fake digital assets through counterfeit platforms that display falsified returns. Authorities Say True Victim Losses Likely Much Higher Than Reported The schemes are increasingly operated by criminal organizations based in Southeast Asia. Some of these groups reportedly use trafficked labor to carry out the scams. Once a victim refuses to invest more, the scammer cuts off communication. At that point, the entire investment vanishes. Meanwhile, Funnull allegedly used domain generation algorithms to create large volumes of deceptive website names. It also distributed web design templates that helped scammers quickly launch new fraudulent sites. In 2024, the company was found to have altered a widely used code repository. This modification redirected traffic from legitimate websites to scam and gambling platforms, some of which are linked to money laundering networks. In addition, the Treasury said Liu Lizhi managed internal operations at Funnull. He kept spreadsheets tracking employee performance, assigned tasks, and domain usage tied to fraudulent activity, including phishing and gambling sites. To support detection efforts, the FBI, working in coordination with the Treasury, plans to release a cybersecurity advisory. It will include technical details to help identify infrastructure linked to Funnull. Finally, authorities warn that reported losses may severely understate the true scale of damage. Many victims of online scams never report the crime.

Unlike traditional bonds secured by fiat currency, BitBonds will be backed by Bitcoin, offering potential returns tied directly to BTC’s performance. It’s still unclear if interest payments will be in Bitcoin or fiat, but the move signals a growing embrace of digital assets in mainstream finance. $552 million worth of BitBonds announced BTC-backed bonds mark a new era in municipal finance Investors can leverage Bitcoin to fund NYC projects Navigating Regulation as NYC Bets on Crypto Of course, this bold move isn’t without challenges. New York’s tough BitLicense rules could complicate the rollout, with critics arguing that such regulations stifle innovation. Adams, however, is pushing for more flexible policies to support crypto adoption. To make this happen, he’s set up a Crypto Council to guide digital asset strategies and position NYC as a global hub for crypto innovation. On the national front, crypto momentum is building. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order established a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, acquiring about 200,000 BTC to promote government-driven Bitcoin adoption.

The token has dropped over 75% from its February high near $3 and is currently sitting at $0.6894, down 6% in the last 24 hours and 15% over the week. Pi Coin Stuck In Tight Range With Bearish Trends Pi is currently stuck in a tight range between $0.688 and $0.816, and is hovering above key support levels. Despite the price dip, trading volume is up 42% in the past day to $158 million. But on-chain data reveals rising exchange inflows, a sign that more Pi is being prepared for selling as 263 million Pi coins will be unlocked in June, 233 million in July, and 132 million in August. The coin’s trend remains bearish with all key moving averages (10, 20, 50, 100-day EMAs and SMAs) sitting above the current price. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, and the MACD is negative. RSI is also neutral at 43.6. Unless the Pi breaks above the $0.75-$0.78 resistance range, the next key support levels are $0.60 and $0.50. If the buying volume picks up, it could retest the $0.85-$0.85 zone. However, on the flip side, it could stay stuck between $0.70 and $0.76 through May 31. Will Pi Rebound Above $1? As the first half of the year comes to a close, Pi could face more selling pressure if fear and doubt grip the market. This could push the price to $0.58-$0.65 in the short term. According to CoinDCX , if the buyer interest returns and volume picks up, it has a chance to rebound toward the $1.00-$1.20 level. If there is momentum, it could even finish June at $1.82 . The price of Pi will likely continue to decline until the end of August, after which it may slowly start to recover.

45275195,https://coinpaper.com/9372/institutional-interest-in-xrp-grows-with-hyperscale-lending-platform-and-cme-futures,1748583000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Institutional Interest in XRP Grows with Hyperscale Lending Platform and CME Futures,https://coinpaper.com/9372/institutional-interest-in-xrp-grows-with-hyperscale-lending-platform-and-cme-futures,"Enterprise blockchain adoption is giving XRP a fresh institutional push as two new developments spotlight the token’s growing utility in both lending and derivatives markets. US-based data center operator Hyperscale Data has announced plans to invest up to $10 million in XRP to support the launch of a blockchain-based lending platform tailored to public companies listed on major US stock exchanges. At the same time, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has seen a strong response to its recently launched XRP futures contracts, which recorded $86.6 million in trading volume during their first week, with nearly half of that activity occurring outside US trading hours. Hyperscale Data Bets on XRP With $10M Allocation for Enterprise Lending Platform Hyperscale Data, a prominent US data center operator, is making a bold leap into decentralized finance (DeFi) with plans to purchase up to $10 million worth of XRP as it prepares to launch a blockchain-based enterprise lending platform in Q3 2025. The initiative, led by its investment arm Ault Capital Group (ACG), targets publicly listed companies and represents a significant push toward integrating tokenized digital assets into traditional financial operations. A Blockchain Lending Platform for Listed Corporations At the heart of the initiative is a novel XRP-powered lending system designed specifically for US public companies listed on the NYSE, NYSE American, and NASDAQ. Initially rolling out in beta, the platform will enable eligible firms to borrow XRP on custom terms, secured either by traditional collateral or via convertible instruments tied to the borrower's registered equity. According to Hyperscale, this lending mechanism will provide corporations with an alternative liquidity option—especially appealing to firms seeking blockchain-native solutions without sacrificing the regulatory rigor and transparency demanded by public markets. The company confirmed that all lending operations will be built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a blockchain network widely known for its fast settlement speeds and low transaction costs. These technical advantages, Hyperscale believes, make XRPL uniquely suited for high-throughput enterprise applications. To manage volatility, Ault Capital Group plans to use XRP futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as a hedge. This strategic move aligns the firm with institutional-grade risk management practices, allowing them to maintain operational stability even during periods of crypto market turbulence. Conditional Rollout Based on Market and Regulatory Clarity While Hyperscale Data’s XRP acquisition signals strong confidence in blockchain finance, the company was careful to note that the platform’s launch schedule and scale remain subject to regulatory and market conditions. Any substantial shifts in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on XRP or broader crypto regulations could impact the project’s progress. The company emphasized that it is closely monitoring the regulatory environment and stands ready to adjust the scope or timing of the project as needed. Despite potential roadblocks, Hyperscale Data’s commitment to investing up to $10 million in XRP positions it among the first institutional players to bring tokenized finance directly into the public equity sphere. While other blockchain lending protocols have primarily targeted crypto-native users or retail borrowers, Hyperscale’s approach signals a shift toward enterprise-grade DeFi infrastructure. If successful, this initiative could create a new financial pipeline for public companies, offering greater flexibility in capital structuring, while also validating blockchain as a serious tool for traditional finance. Ripple Effect on XRP’s Institutional Appeal The announcement may also mark a turning point for XRP itself, which has long been associated with cross-border payments but has struggled to gain widespread institutional lending adoption amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the United States. A structured, compliant use case like Hyperscale’s platform could enhance XRP’s legitimacy in the eyes of traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, Hyperscale’s infrastructure advantage as a data center operator may enable smoother integration between off-chain enterprise systems and on-chain transactions—another potential draw for publicly listed firms wary of crypto’s technical and regulatory complexities. As the world of traditional finance and decentralized technologies continue to converge, Hyperscale Data’s XRP-backed lending platform represents a bold experiment with institutional ramifications. By targeting publicly traded firms and layering crypto-native innovation with regulatory awareness and traditional hedging strategies, the company may be laying the groundwork for a new era of blockchain-based capital markets infrastructure. CME’s XRP Futures See $86M in First Week as Global Traders Fuel Non-US Demand In related news, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has successfully launched regulated XRP futures, marking another significant step in the maturation of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. Just one week after their debut, the futures have registered $86.6 million in volume, with a notable share of activity driven by international participants outside of US trading hours, according to a CME spokesperson. This early traction shows XRP’s global utility as a cross-border payments asset and the growing appetite among institutions and traders to gain regulated exposure to it without the need to hold the underlying tokens directly. Strong Global Demand and Off-Hours Activity Data shows a total of 4,032 contracts were traded during the first six trading days, with 46% of that volume occurring during non-US trading hours. The spokesperson further emphasized that a substantial portion of the participation came from outside the US, reflecting XRP’s status as a truly international digital asset. The high levels of engagement during non-US sessions point to demand from regions such as Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, where Ripple’s technology and XRP’s use in payment corridors have seen considerable adoption. CME’s XRP futures contracts come in two formats: a standard contract representing 50,000 XRP and a micro contract representing 2,500 XRP. Both contracts are cash-settled and derive their pricing from the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time. This structure allows institutional and professional traders to gain price exposure to XRP without the operational or custodial complexities associated with owning the token directly. It also offers an opportunity to hedge existing crypto positions or speculate on future price movements within a secure, regulated environment. XRP’s Unique Position in Cross-Border Finance XRP has long been positioned as a payments-focused cryptocurrency, designed to facilitate fast, cheap, and scalable international money transfers. Ripple , the fintech firm behind its development and ecosystem support, utilizes XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in solutions like RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL)—services adopted by banks and remittance providers across multiple continents. The release of futures products on CME, the largest derivatives exchange globally, represents institutional validation of XRP’s market relevance and liquidity, despite lingering regulatory ambiguity in the US. The timing of this launch may also prove strategic, as regulatory frameworks around crypto derivatives continue to evolve in the US and abroad. With CME’s strict compliance requirements and oversight, these XRP futures provide institutions a way to access the asset class within regulated parameters, a significant factor for fund managers and corporate traders seeking risk-managed exposure. The international interest also signals broader trends in tokenized payments and blockchain-based financial rails, which continue to gain traction amid calls for faster, more transparent cross-border settlements. What This Means for XRP’s Market Dynamics The immediate success of XRP futures on CME could have broader implications for the digital asset’s market structure. Increased futures trading often correlates with improved price discovery, greater liquidity, and a more diverse participant base. It may also pave the way for future financial products such as ETFs or structured notes tied to XRP’s performance. Moreover, the global participation, nearly half of which occurred during non-US hours, reaffirms XRP’s importance beyond US borders, where regulatory hurdles have not been as pronounced.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 05:30:00

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the Division’s remarks apply to persons who self-stake certain covered crypto assets on a PoS network. Proof-of-stake network mechanisms are structured to incentivize users to voluntarily coordinate and cooperate to secure the network. The U.S SEC noted that uncertainty about regulatory views on staking discouraged Americans from doing so for fear of violating securities laws. The agency said the uncertainty also constrained participation in network consensus and undermined the decentralization, censorship resistance, and credible neutrality of PoS blockchains. U.S SEC aims to provide clarity for digital asset stakers in the U.S. 1/ Today the @SECGov issued guidance on activities involving ""staking"" / proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. As in its POW/mining guidance, the SEC affirmed that participation in protocol staking activities does not require registration under the securities laws. pic.twitter.com/zArQ5lz8KD — Rebecca Rettig (@RebeccaRettig1) May 29, 2025 The Division of Corporation Finance acknowledged on May 29 that proof-of-stake blockchain staking activities are not considered security transactions within the confines of the federal securities laws. The U.S SEC noted that the Division’s statement aims to provide clarity for stakers and staking-as-a-service providers in the U.S. The agency also mentioned that the Division’s remark applies to persons who self-stake certain covered digital assets on a proof-of-stake or delegated PoS network. The SEC’s statement also applies to non-custodial and custodial staking-as-a-service providers that facilitate PoS staking on behalf of others. According to the U.S SEC , the statement explains that pairing certain ancillary services with non-custodial or custodial staking services does not make providing staking services a securities offering. The government entity also noted that ancillary services include the provision of slashing coverage, which allows digital assets to be returned to a staker before the end of the protocol’s unbounded period. The provision also delivers earned rewards based on an alternative rewards payment schedule and in alternative amounts. The Division added that slashing coverage aggregates stakers’ virtual assets together for the purpose of satisfying a network’s minimum staking requirements. “I expect that the Division and Crypto Task Force will continue to develop views about security status for other activities, products, and services involving participation in network consensus.” – Hester Peirce , Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Chief legal officer at Jito Labs Rebecca Retting argued that the SEC’s conclusion cleared the path for crypto exchange-traded funds to include staking in their products. The SEC has been making efforts to offer more clarity to crypto regulation since the departure of former Chair Gary Gensler. During Gensler’s reign, the agency had taken issue with staking services from Kraken, Coinbase, and Metamask. U.S SEC says PoW doesn’t implicate U.S. securities laws Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the agency has dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players and re-examined rules affecting the crypto space. Republican acting Chair Mark Uyeda has also created a crypto task force to be led by fellow Commissioner Hester Pierce. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw noted that it has been four months since the launch of the agency’s Crypto Task Force, which she believes will deliver a clear regulatory framework. Crenshaw argued that the SEC’s approach doesn’t promote clarity but continues to sow uncertainty around what the law is and what parts of it the Commission is willing to enforce, which she said is bad for investors and the markets. The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance also clarified on March 20 that proof-of-work mining activities are not considered securities activities. The agency added that it’s the Division’s view that participants in mining activities do not need to register transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration in connection with mining activities. The agency referred to the Howey Test – 1945 U.S. Supreme Court case frequently cited by the U.S SEC to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and, therefore, a security – to form its conclusion on Thursday. The Commission argued that a miner’s self-mining is not undertaken with expectations of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The SEC believes that rather, a miner contributes its computational resources, which secure the network and enable the miner to earn rewards. The agency added that mining pools do not expect profits, just like mining. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Football Remains Most Popular Sport for Crypto A recent study by Sport Quake said that football made up 43% of all crypto and digital asset sponsorship for the 2024/25 season. This has resulted in a 64% year-over-year increase in the total amount of sponsorships. “All the growth is from football (soccer) and non-US spend as brands invest in global sponsorships and international markets while they wait to see President Trump’s US crypto policies,” said Matt House, CEO of SportQuake. Further, 44% of all crypto football sponsorships happen within Europe’s top five leagues, including France’s Ligue 1. PSG’s decision to venture into crypto accumulation follows a growing trend among corporations to include Bitcoin in their balance sheets. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin, Crypto is Accelerating Bitcoin has become a treasury preference for more companies and brands, following President Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve order, which helped clear the path. Dom Harz, Co-Founder of BOB (Build on Bitcoin), told Cryptonews that “ETFs have a lot to do with” the adoption. “The most interesting change we’ve seen over the last two years is the mood shift between Bitcoin once being a speculative bet and now being a strategic play for corporations,” he said via email. “From a corporate point of view, there is massive appeal. They would have a passive yield on their assets, and it offers them diversity from traditional investments.” The post Football Team Paris Saint-Germain Scores Bitcoin Treasury Strategy appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-30 05:34:35

This development aligns with the momentum behind the GENIUS Act,which is a bipartisan US bill that seeks to regulate stablecoins by enforcing 1:1 dollar backing, AML compliance, and reserve asset protections. If passed, the act could reinforce the US dollar’s dominance in digital finance. Meanwhile, India is expanding its digital rupee trials by focusing on programmability and offline use cases to increase accessibility. These global moves suggest stablecoins and CBDCs are becoming core pillars of the future financial infrastructure. Santander Eyes Stablecoin Launch Banco Santander SA, one of the world’s leading global banking institutions, is reportedly considering expanding its cryptocurrency services to retail clients, including the potential launch of its own stablecoin. The move is part of a trend among major financial institutions toward embracing blockchain-based financial products in light of a changing regulatory climate in the United States. According to a May 29 Bloomberg report , Santander is exploring both US dollar and euro-pegged stablecoins, although plans are still in early development. This latest development places Santander alongside other major US banks— like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo—that are reportedly exploring similar initiatives thanks to more favorable regulatory conditions under the administration of President Donald Trump. The shift in tone emboldened banks to consider launching fiat-pegged tokens that could accelerate payments, promote financial inclusion, and enhance global capital access for small businesses. Supporters of the trend argue that stablecoins can extend the global reach of the US dollar, streamline cross-border transactions, and democratize access to financial systems by banking the unbanked and reducing friction in traditional remittance flows. However, the broader banking industry is still quite divided on the issue. While some institutions view stablecoins as an opportunity to innovate, others fear they could erode traditional banking profits and market share, especially if these tokens begin offering interest-like yields. Overview of the stablecoin market (Source: RWA.xyz ) Banking lobbyists, supported by several US senators, have resisted legislation that will make it easier to issue or distribute yield-bearing stablecoins. This is mostly due to concerns over the destabilizing effects they could have on retail banking. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand spoke at the DC Blockchain Summit in March of 2025, and questioned whether allowing stablecoin issuers to pay interest might encourage depositors to abandon traditional banks, thus threatening their ability to provide loans to local businesses and households. NYU professor Austin Campbell argued that yield-bearing stablecoins disrupt the core mechanics of modern retail banking, particularly the low-interest deposit model that is foundational to the fractional reserve system. Campbell criticized efforts to curtail such products, and suggested that only entrenched interests stand to gain from blocking innovation. Stablecoin Bill Could Cement Dollar’s Digital Role The GENIUS Act is a pivotal piece of US legislation that is focused on stablecoins, and it could soon play a central role in boosting the US dollar’s dominance in the digital asset landscape. Short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, the bill seeks to provide regulatory clarity on how stablecoins are issued, backed, and governed, with particular focus on one-to-one collateralization with US dollars and strict compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. According to a May 29 report from Foresight Ventures, the act has the potential to cement the dollar’s status as the world’s preferred settlement currency in the Web3 era, as well as empower fintech companies to build secure, compliant financial tools. The bill advanced past a procedural vote in the US Senate on May 20 with a 66–32 margin, which suggests that it has good bipartisan momentum. However, it still awaits a full floor vote, and its final passage is not guaranteed. Earlier in May, the legislation encountered some resistance from key Democrats, prompting cautious optimism in the crypto industry. The GENIUS Act’s potential extends beyond the borders of the United States. Some industry leaders believe its implementation could serve as a global benchmark for digital asset regulation. Andrei Grachev , managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance, said that when the US takes a definitive step on stablecoin policy, the rest of the world tends to follow suit. Stablecoins are no longer viewed as experimental tools in the crypto ecosystem but as superior alternatives to traditional fiat money as they are faster, more efficient, and more transparent. The goal of the GENIUS Act is to safeguard that utility by introducing protective measures around reserve assets. The legislation will prohibit issuers from using reserves for purposes beyond redemption and a narrow list of low-risk investments, like US Treasury repos. These provisions are designed to prevent systemic risk and guard against the emergence of shadow banking practices in the stablecoin sector. If passed, the GENIUS Act could lay the foundation for a more stable and regulated digital dollar infrastructure. India Expands Digital Rupee Trials CBDC’s developments are also increasing around the globe. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to expand the scope of its digital rupee pilots by introducing new use cases and features to both the retail and wholesale versions of its central bank digital currency (CBDC). According to the RBI’s Annual Report for 2024–25 , the central bank is particularly focused on exploring programmability and offline functionality, which could make the digital rupee more versatile in regions with limited internet connectivity. These enhancements are expected to support use cases like government subsidies and corporate expenditure limits, helping to tailor digital payments to specific economic needs. Currently, the retail CBDC pilot is being tested with select customers and merchants through a network of participating banks and has already reached 600,000 users. To scale adoption even more, the RBI allowed certain non-bank entities to offer CBDC wallets. Meanwhile, the wholesale pilot is gaining traction within the interbank market and has recently expanded to include four standalone primary dealers. The growth of India’s broader digital payments ecosystem further supports this push into CBDCs. During the 2024–25 financial year, the country saw a 34.8% increase in the volume and a 17.9% rise in the value of digital payments. India also maintained its global leadership in real-time payments, with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) accounting for 48.5% of global transaction volume. (Source: RBI ) Among its other recent innovations, the RBI pointed out the “Delegated Payments” feature, which allows a primary user to authorize another individual to make UPI transactions in a preset limit. The goal of this initiative is to widen digital payment access. India’s Supreme Court also renewed calls for comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. On May 20, Justice Surya Kant criticized the government’s delayed action, despite the existence of a 30% tax on crypto profits since April of 2022.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 05:43:07

Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded an incredible net inflow of $433 million. That inflow extends the run of consecutive daily inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs to an impressive ten days. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs maintained their own strong momentum, too, registering a net inflow of $84.89 million. Ethereum spot ETFs have now seen their own consecutive daily inflow run extended to an impressive eight days. The inflows into these ETFs reflect a developing institutional inclination toward digital assets and a newly discovered adoption of cryptocurrency investment vehicles that combine traditional finance with the nascent blockchain ecosystem. Spot ETFs are increasingly being viewed by market participants as accessible and regulatory-compliant ways of achieving exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum while avoiding the direct custody of assets. Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Ten Straight Days of Net Inflows Over the last ten days, capital has accumulated in Bitcoin’s spot ETFs with stunning consistency. On just May 28 alone, they attracted a net inflow of $433 million. That’s a clarion call from both institutional and retail investors, and it’s one of the main reasons I think the SEC may be close to approving a Bitcoin spot ETF. On May 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $433 million, marking 10 consecutive days of net inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million, extending their streak to 8 consecutive days. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 In the previous three months, we have seen inflows of Bitcoin. These inflows have continued and actually even picked up pace in the last month. The latest data we have indicates that in August, we saw capital inflows, net capital inflows into Bitcoin, to the tune of $107 million. Spot ETFs serve as a vital link between traditional investment structures and the world of cryptocurrencies. They present an investment vehicle that is both familiar and regulated, thus reducing the entry barriers for many investors who might prefer to stay on this side of the bridge. And the bridge has been holding up well, with strong inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past few months. Ethereum Spot ETFs Extend Their Winning Streak Ethereum spot ETFs have similarly enjoyed a sustained wave of capital inflows. On May 28, right around the time of the latest annual Divergence Strategic Summit, Ethereum contents of spot ETFs received capital inflows of $84.89 million. This extended the streak of daily gains for Ethereum-backed ETFs to eight consecutive days. The primary programmable blockchain, Ethereum continues to draw institutional investor interest as a result of forthcoming improvements in scalability and network performance. The current inflow of exchange-traded-fund capital suggests that investors believe Ethereum’s ecosystem is developing favorably and that they will secure some appreciable delta by holding that which is most likely to be a more valuable token in the years to come. ETH ICO Whale on the Move Again: Another Sell-Off Begins The legendary “1 Million #ETH ICO Whale” has resumed selling — and the numbers are massive. Just 8 hours ago, this wallet recharged 956.7 ETH (worth $2.53M) to #OKX , raising fresh sell-off alarms. Details: pic.twitter.com/y03d4FL9dL — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) May 29, 2025 Capital has been coming into Ethereum ETFs steadily, which fits into a broader market trend we see. And this trend is that investors are looking to get diversified exposure to major blockchain networks beyond just Bitcoin. The way I see it, and I think a lot of people in our industry see it, this is a trend reflecting confidence in Ethereum. And their confidence isn’t unfounded. A lot of things are happening on Ethereum, to Ethereum, and with Ethereum. Whale Activity Sheds Light on Ethereum Market Dynamics While institutional investments in Ethereum ETFs appear to show an accelerating interest in the markets, it is the notable individual investment activity that provides a wealth of further insight. One of the most prominent Ethereum whales, operating from wallet 0xC8d6C156c13AC68ADA3f03B80fc201ae4867A57d, continues to make waves. This investor holds some 51,663 ETH, or $140 million worth of the digital asset, at very low basis costs: about $0.31 per ETH. Interestingly, this whale has just received an additional 24,000 ETH three days ago, which is quite the addition to their already hefty pile of ETH. Despite that, it’s good to note that this whale was just gifted 24,000 ETH three days ago. Investor actions on such a large scale send very valuable signals to the market. When savvy traders who are long-term holders of an asset accumulate it, that tends to signal to us that they are quite confident in the asset’s future trajectory. And such accumulation seems to be happening now in the Bitcoin market. This is—again—adding to the support of the price increases we are seeing. A Growing Narrative of Institutional Adoption Continued inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs and strategic activity by large holders are evidence of a maturing cryptocurrency market. Institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals see these assets as central to their portfolios, now that regulated products allow for a more straightforward and secure investment process. While the crypto ecosystem is still in its infancy, ETFs will likely help it evolve. They will help the whole ecosystem maintain compliance with financial regulations while enabling a much broader base of participation. They will also make Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens (or at least those that have passed muster) much more accessible on a risk-adjusted basis to a much wider variety of investors. Not too bad for something that wasn’t even on the horizon a year or so ago. For investors and observers, the steady influx of capital and strategic accumulation make clear that there is a consensus forming around the idea that digital assets are here to stay—not that they are merely ephemeral, like a fad, but that they are something much more fundamental, like a building block of the future financial system.

Beijing’s markets fell hardest after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said talks with China had stalled recently, hurting hopes for a lasting tariff deal. Bloomberg reported that Shanghai’s Composite Index and the CSI 300 both slipped by around 0.6%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.5%. Bessent, speaking at a financial conference, acknowledged that high-level negotiations had lost momentum but said he remained “confident that talks will pick up again.” His remarks, however, added to worries that Washington and Beijing might struggle to secure a more permanent trade deal. China objected to U.S. chip restrictions, while the U.S. added new export limits on major Chinese tech firms. Earlier this month, the two sides agreed to pause their tit-for-tat tariff increases for 90 days, a truce set to expire in early July. Despite the temporary hold, high tariffs on Chinese goods kept imports expensive for U.S. buyers. Regional stocks followed Wall Street , where markets closed well below their intraday peaks after the appeals court’s ruling. President Trump denounced the initial decision that halted his tariffs and said he was “confident the Supreme Court will allow [the tariffs] to proceed.” He also hinted at exploring alternative legal routes to enforce the tariffs, many of which are slated to begin in July. In Asia, S&P 500 futures eased 0.3% as traders prepared for the Fed’s preferred inflation report due later. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 slid 1.3% and the Topix index dropped 0.7% after city data showed consumer prices climbed more than expected in May. This inflation figure could give the Bank of Japan added reason to consider raising interest rates. Many analysts are now eyeing a 25-basis-point rate increase as soon as July. Other data showed Japan’s economy remained firm Industrial output fell 0.8% in April, less than economists had forecast, while retail sales rose 1.2%, outpacing predictions. The stronger data helped push the yen higher, a move that weighed on exporters and further pressured equity markets. In other parts of Asia, tech stocks fell as the initial boost from NVIDIA’s strong quarterly report wore off. South Korea’s Kospi declined 0.5% as local chipmakers and other tech firms reversed course. Singapore’s Straits Times dipped 0.3%. Australia’s ASX 200 finished flat after weak retail sales led some to expect more RBA rate cuts. In India, Nifty 50 futures rose 0.1%, pointing to a stronger open as the index held just below 25,000.

This ascent represents a rise of $25.8 billion from the recent lows and highlights a developing demand among traders and investors for the more refined vehicles that serve to hedge risk and implement relatively advanced trading strategies. The open interest in options has been increasing much more rapidly than that in futures, a sign of the evolving nature of the Bitcoin derivatives market. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 A broader shift in how market participants approach Bitcoin is clearly reflected in the rising interest in options. Instead of exclusively buying and holding, or trading in the spot market, more and more investors are turning to Bitcoin options to manage risk, make speculative bets on price movements, and set up intricate (and sometimes not-so-intricate) derivatives trades. This signals, if nothing else, that the Bitcoin ecosystem is maturing, and options are a part of that maturation. Short-Term Holder Profitability Shows Healthy Market Dynamics In tandem with the thriving options market, on-chain metrics offer intriguing glimpses into the actions and gains of short-term Bitcoin holders. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR), taken as a 30-day moving average, recently reached a local high. This metric can be understood as tracking the average profit or loss realized by investors who have held (and then spent or sold) their Bitcoin for a short duration (less than a now-treasured four-year hold period). The STH SOPR (30DMA) metric, which measures the average profit or loss realized by short-term investors when spending coins on-chain, recently hit a local high STH realized profit rose noticeably. Nevertheless, demand for coins remains strong enough not to hinder the bullish… pic.twitter.com/dsE8toaEin — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 29, 2025 The increase in STH realized profits indicates that short-term holders more frequently are capturing gains, and this reflects an environment where buying opportunities exist, and traders are effectively timing their exits. It is vital to note, however, that despite this uptick, the STH SOPR has not yet hit the euphoric levels we witnessed during previous Bitcoin price tops. This indicates that while profits are being taken, the market is not yet overheated or showing signs of excessive exuberance. A positive feedback loop is sustained by the short-term investors’ steady profitability: Profits can be reinvested and used to support trading activity, which keeps the liquidity flowing and the prices moving in the right (upward) direction. The SOPR indicator is a pretty reliable way of gauging the presence or absence of euphoric speculative bubbles in a market. And right now, it is not showing any signs of those kinds of bubbles being present. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Steady Capital Inflows In addition to the burgeoning activity in derivatives markets and on-chain metrics, there is now clear evidence that investor demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs is also growing rapidly. On May 28, for instance, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $433 million. This follows nine straight days of inflows into these regulated investment products. Compared to other vehicles of exposure to Bitcoin, the appetite for ETFs not only continues to but also appears to be speeding up. Spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin are now comparable with inflows into gold ETFs by this point in their adoption. On May 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $433 million, marking 10 consecutive days of net inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million, extending their streak to 8 consecutive days. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 Funds holding Bitcoin are now under the same regulatory regime as funds that hold gold, and that’s a big deal. Trust and acceptance as an asset class are now coming at us like the floodgates have opened, and the ETF is the vehicle of choice across our bridge to traditional finance. These inflows also reinforce the bullish trend in Bitcoin’s price. Increased demand from ETFs can translate into upward price pressure. Inflows occurring over several days also say something about investor confidence. They say that confidence is strong and that market participants see value in maintaining or increasing their Bitcoin exposure. A Growing Ecosystem of Sophistication and Confidence When we look at all these data points together, they show us a very clear picture: The Bitcoin market is moving into the next stage of its maturity. This next stage is marked by not just the appearance but also the substance of increased player sophistication; as for profitability, the short-term holders of Bitcoin (i.e., the folks who buy and sell it under the one-year window of the capital gains tax) are sitting on plenty of it, with the STH SOPR being a very nice leading indicator of that realm. And as for price discovery, things are looking really good. At the same time, uninterrupted net inflows into spot ETFs highlight growing institutional confidence and adoption. They further reinforce the narrative that Bitcoin is moving, in a very controlled way, toward the kind of mainstream acceptance that assets like gold enjoy. Bitcoin is always developing, and these trends point out how critical it is to keep an eye on derivatives activity, on-chain metrics, and capital flows if you want to understand the market’s underlying strength and direction. For investors and spectators, the expanding toolkit of financial instruments and the plethora of positive market signals make for a pretty good reason to be cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin’s next growth and adoption phases.

45275853,https://nulltx.com/?p=150047,1748584399,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Polymarket Predicts High Odds for Spot ETF Approval Among Major Altcoins in 2025,https://nulltx.com/polymarket-predicts-high-odds-for-spot-etf-approval-among-major-altcoins-in-2025/,"With ongoing interest in cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , Polymarket—a well-known decentralized prediction market platform—has now weighed in with some fresh, highly sought-after insights. These focus on the probabilities placed by the Polymarket platform on recent applications for spot ETFs tied to some of the most recognizable altcoins being approved by regulators. According to Polymarket, of the six major altcoins nominated for spot ETF approval, five have probabilities exceeding 68%. This translates to strong market optimism that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will give the go-ahead sometime in the next year. This list includes top projects which are such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Litecoin (LTC) which is each capturing significant investor interest and signaling the increasing appeal of the altcoins which are beyond Bitcoin and towards the mainstream. Meanwhile, Pepe (PEPE), which is a newer token and much less established, trails very far behind with only a 9% chance of ETF approval, which really underscores a divide that participants in the market see between established projects and speculative newcomers. XRP Leads the Pack with an 83% Approval Probability Among the top contenders, XRP currently enjoys the highest odds of securing a spot ETF approval in 2025, with its chances weighing in at a commanding 83%. This strong optimism simply reflects the ongoing favorable development that Ripple’s regulatory environment is undergoing, which in turn largely hinges on the protracted federal legal entanglement that the firm finds itself in. That also affects the XRP price. XRP’s leadership position on Polymarket likely shows confidence among investors that the cryptocurrency’s long-standing legal wrangling with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is headed for a favorable resolution, one that would allow the kind of regulatory sign-off that would make an ETF possible. And the XRP community and its investors have a close watch on these developments because, if nothing else, an ETF approval would be a massive milestone in making XRP a legitimate investment vehicle. Solana maintains a strong position in the realm of prediction markets, with a probability of around 80% that it will be approved. This remarkably steady outlook suggests that market participants are not only optimistic but also increasingly confident about Solana’s expansion; its ever-maturing ecosystem, network scalability, and very much seemingly real increasing adoption make it feel ETF inclusion is definitely within reach. Growing Momentum for Cardano, Dogecoin, and Litecoin Data from Polymarket also shows that Cardano, Dogecoin, and Litecoin have experienced substantial increases in the likelihood of ETF approval over the last few months. When the initial Altcoin ETF predictions were released, all three of these altcoins were projected to have probabilities well below the 50% mark. However, in the time since, all odds have improved by considerable margins, with each altcoin now projected to have an approximately 70%-80% chance of being approved for an ETF. Polymarket Odds for Spot ETF Approval on Major Altcoins According to @Polymarket , 5 out of 6 major altcoins nominated for ETF approval — $XRP , $SOL , $DOGE , $ADA , and $LTC — each have over a 68% chance of receiving spot ETF approval in 2025. $XRP currently leads with an 83%… pic.twitter.com/Lg7yJfub4c — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 28, 2025 This upward trend reflects an altering set of regulations and a coming-of-age for these projects. Cardano, with its ever-evolving smart contract capabilities, strikes me as an ecosystem that might consider itself next-gen. I don’t know if it’s Dogecoin’s 5 million-plus holders, or the ears it has to the ground in the way of endorsements, that give it a fighting chance in this world of vogue and trust. In my eyes, Litecoin remains near the top of the totem pole of trust, in large part because of its consistent steady upward path. The continued increase in the probabilities of approval for these altcoin ETFs suggests that there is a growing belief that the regulatory agencies might soon start allowing a wider array of investment products based on cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Pepe Coin Trails Far Behind Amid Speculation In contrast, Pepe (PEPE), even with the recent buzz and popularity it’s enjoyed in certain crypto communities, stands a very low chance—just 9%—of achieving spot ETF approval next year. This pretty much illustrates how the market views newer, speculative tokens that grab quick hype but seem to lack the necessary institutional infrastructure, regulatory clarity, or widespread adoption to appeal to the kinds of regulators that sign off on these things. How investors and the market are differentiating between: 1. Blue-chip altcoins having established use cases, and 2. Speculative “meme” coins that face greater hurdles on the road to regulatory acceptance. PEPE’s low odds are a potential indicator of this differentiation. What This Means for Crypto Investors and Markets Polymarket gives us a rare peek into how people are pricing the regulatory risk and opportunity landscape for major altcoins in 2025. That is, it lets us see in real-time how market participants are potentially calibrating that risk and opportunity landscape. And what it’s showing us, for the most part, is a scene of relative calm—at least over the near term. Altcoins such as Cardano, Dogecoin, and Litecoin are now seen as far more likely to gain regulatory blessings than they were just a few months ago. This is part of a much bigger trend in the crypto space in which many coins and tokens are now seen as far more likely to be deemed legally permissible because they are distinct from securities. This trend could, by extension, make those coins and tokens more permissible as parts of legal businesses, too. Monitoring these changing probabilities is valuable for investors. It provides insight into the sentiment of the market and the regulatory environment, which helps investors navigate risk and identify potential catalysts for price movement. The saga of trying to get spot ETFs approved is one of the crypto industry’s best storylines right now. And based on data from the prediction market Polymarket, it seems that the appearance of regulatory breakthroughs on that front for the top altcoins is looking more and more likely—at least in the relatively near future.

This makes us a very interesting protocol, not only because we offer this thing called a nearly cross-chain liquidity pool (which should give some users a way to earn yield across different blockchains, while also increasing swap efficiency), but also because we are on a path towards adopting more DeFi features. What is more, we have been experimenting with using LP tokens as collateral and offering some of those LP tokens as prizes in a game that some of our friends at BlockZero are helping us design. Everything else seems to be happening in Hyperliquid. And yet most people have not heard of us. We saw an opportunity here and took it. As the ecosystem keeps receiving investments, a new top 10 list of projects ranked by their 30-day growth in total value locked reveals just how quickly DeFi protocols built atop Hyperliquid are scaling. The list isn’t populated by established DeFi blue chips. From lending and stablecoin yield optimizing to next-gen automated market makers and liquid staking platforms, the Hyperliquid DeFi ecosystem is teeming with experimentation—and investor attention. Valantis, Magpie, and Upshift Lead TVL Growth Rankings The project that has appeared this month as the biggest TVL gainer is Valantis Labs. Its TVL increased a breathtaking 590 percent in the last month. While the details of Valantis’ strategy are not public, its rapid TVL growth suggests that the project is either employing some innovative DeFi primitives that we just don’t know about yet or is offering some highly competitive yield farming incentives. In second place comes Magpie, a name that is well-known in DeFi circles, and which registered a 413 percent leap in its TVL. Magpie’s main business seems to be making stablecoins less stable in a DeFi sense, and fixing superliquid routing in ways that keep DeFi users from tripping over themselves while seeking capital-efficient strategies in an increasingly competitive DeFi landscape. Upshift, a rising star on Hyperliquid, has posted an impressive 299 percent growth in its TVL. Ascending swiftly, it is now capturing the attention of risk-oriented DeFi users. Its appeal can be traced to its supply of unique leveraged yield and structured product options. These offerings are enticing nearly-conservative DeFi users to take on more risk and to explore downside-protected options that, in a bull market, could help them amplify on-chain returns. Top 10 Projects on Hyperliquid by 30D TVL Growth The @HyperliquidX ecosystem continues to expand its presence, not only driven by the growing popularity of the Hyperliquid derivatives exchange, but also by the increasing number of projects launching on its chain, creating… pic.twitter.com/v9gh8KGAyK — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 28, 2025 The figures showing triple-digit growth hint at an even wider spectrum of investors who are keen on the new, uncorrelated opportunities that the Hyperliquid chain presents. This is a trend that we see right now very much mirroring the early growth phases of other successful Layer 1 ecosystems. Emerging Protocols Show Ecosystem Depth Apart from the top three, several newer or lesser-known projects are building some real momentum. Hyperlend’s total value locked (TVL) went up a staggering 247 percent, thanks to the surging demand for permissionless on-chain lending markets. Hyperlend, whose name seems more close to a completed streetname than the kinds of projects one might find in DeFi, is gaining popularity because of its “lightweight interface” and “efficient borrowing mechanisms,” especially for smaller-cap assets. Wet HypurrFi saw a jaw-dropping 171 percent growth in its total value locked (TVL) to follow up. The modular yield vaults it offers are deep and shallow, with the kinds of risks associated with each that you can kind of tower over when you carve out a niche and think really hard about risk-adjusted returns foam. And what we’re hinting at when we talk about risk-adjusted DeFi, and why it’s becoming a fast-growing interest among DAOs and even buying interest from some institutions. Sentiment increased by 162 percent and Looped saw 140 percent growth — both projects work in areas that could become the next big trend in DeFi. They are concentrated in two areas: programmable credit markets (Sentiment) and staking incentives (Looped). Programmable credit markets — that’s just a really cool term for saying that we have a way to use smart contracts to do something other than just ‘money transfers.’ At the older end of the spectrum, HyperSwapX and Felix Protocol notched respectable increases in 30-day total value locked (TVL) of 93.7 percent and 32.3 percent, respectively, indicating that even the more established of DeFi platforms are enjoying a pretty serious resurgence when it comes to attracting fresh capital and new users. The core protocol of Hyperliquid itself registered a 73.8 percent increase in total value locked, an increase that underlined the fact that the native infrastructure of the chain continues to pull in users and their user-responsive liquidity in the midst of a more generalized ecosystem boom. Hyperliquid’s Evolution: From Derivatives to DeFi Hub Once hailed for its high-speed, gas-free decentralized derivatives exchange, Hyperliquid today is something much larger—a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem that looks every bit the rival of more established Layer 1s when it comes to innovation and total value locked (TVL) growth. The platform has made it, particularly for new project teams looking to experiment with capital efficiency and modular finance, a user-centric, fast, and gasless environment. But even for this relatively small number of teams, the platform’s natural integration of tokens, governance models, and interoperable protocols is moving a step closer to liquidity and composability. With the advent of Hyperliquid, the next several months could become a decisive period as more developers launch on the protocol, driving user adoption amid a burgeoning ecosystem. If growth trajectories hold, Hyperliquid could soon transition from an emerging protocol to a core DeFi chain. As total value locked surges across a diverse range of projects, the Hyperliquid ecosystem is demonstrating that it is more than simply a derivatives venue—it’s a full-stack financial playground where the next generation of real-time decentralized finance is being built.

45275953,https://nulltx.com/?p=150045,1748584600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Solana Accelerates Ecosystem Growth with NYC Conference, New Integrations, and Seeker Phone Launch",https://nulltx.com/solana-accelerates-ecosystem-growth-with-nyc-conference-new-integrations-and-seeker-phone-launch/,"Solana experienced a vibrant week underscored by important announcements, expansion of its ecosystem, and a very noticeable uptick in its market performance. From important events around the integration of real-world assets (RWA) to the unveiling of new DeFi and hardware products, the Solana ecosystem keeps pushing the envelope. And for all this momentum, the Solana Accelerate conference in New York City on May 22–23 was the perfect backdrop—a chance for the network and its partners to show off some serious innovations that emphasize Solana’s growing role in both TradFi and DeFi. The infrastructure of Solana is spreading. So is institutional interest. Solana is now going after retail, with its ecosystem growing fast. All this paints a promising picture of the Solana blockchain as the next phase of Web3.Growth. But things within that pretty picture—ahem—might not be as rosy as they seem to be. Verdict: Solana paints a promising picture of next-phase growth, but is it real? Market Performance and Capital Inflows Highlight Growing Confidence The native token of Solana, SOL, swelled 5% and hit $176, driven by the week of the Accelerate conference. The larger Solana ecosystem saw its total market capitalization rise by 3%, an almost unbroken string of up days in its price. But the trading volume of SOL fell by 15%, signaling that we are now in a period of less short-term trading and speculation on the price of SOL, but with an almost unchanged level of long-term interest. No one is abandoning ship, and the interest shown in the price of SOL hasn’t markedly changed. One of the more notable signs of Solana’s burgeoning appeal is the $175 million in assets bridged to the network over the past week. This influx of capital from other blockchains underscores Solana’s emerging position as a multi-chain hub for DeFi, NFTs, and now real-world asset trading. In the meantime, Bitcoin set a new record high, approaching $112,000, and pushed up right by a huge $427 million buying spree. And even though none of this is directly related to Solana, a rising crypto tide helps all boats, including Layer 1s like Solana, to pull in both institutional and retail cash. Solana Tackles Traditional Finance and DeFi with Bold Moves A prominent announcement emerged from Kraken, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges across the globe, which disclosed its plans to allow for trading of U.S. stocks on the Solana blockchain. This new offering will be directed toward non-U.S. users and marks a daring attempt to bridge the gap between conventional finance and blockchain tech. As market participants from all over the world seek quicker, cheaper, and more reliable (i.e., permissionless) pathways into the U.S. markets, enabling such a pathway via Solana would seem to place the net gain squarely in Kraken’s corner. The Accelerate event also saw innovative developments in DeFi, with Jupiter revealing its new lending protocol, created in collaboration with Fluid. This partnership looks to deliver increasingly efficient lending and liquidity solutions to the growing, multifaceted DeFi sector of Solana. Meanwhile, Kalshi, a regulated prediction market platform, has begun allowing its customers to make deposits on Solana through the Zero Hash service, using cash. They can now transact in the way that’s most comfortable and familiar to them. Total value locked (TVL) on the Solana network increased 2% to reach $10.997 billion. This growth helps Solana keep ahead of BNB Chain in the TVL race. However, DEX volume on Solana fell 14.62% to $21.28 billion, ending a multi-week streak of increasing volume. That said, Solana is still far and away leading all blockchains in weekly DApp revenue. Week in Solana: Accelerate in NYC, Seeker Phone in August. SOL climbs 5% to $176! Kraken brings stock trading to blockchain! Jupiter launches lending with Fluid! $175M bridged to network! Let's explore Solana's ecosystem expansion week 1/6 pic.twitter.com/uFyleVtDsN — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 28, 2025 Hardware Expansion and Security Efforts Intensify This week also brought a focus on hardware, with the announcement that the eagerly anticipated Solana Seeker Mobile phone will begin shipping in August. The device has SKR token integration and uses the decentralized TEEPIN architecture, purportedly making it much more private for on-chain use. Bringing Web3 into the hands of the everyday user is something Solana is very much about, and the Seeker phone is a step—in hardware, not just software—toward that goal. Staying a top priority is security, and in a high-profile incident featuring Solana co-founder Raj Gokal, the hacking of the Migos Instagram account was used to try to extort 40 BTC from Gokal. The incident ultimately remained a failed attempt at high-dollar extortion, but it does shine a light on the ongoing need for top-tier security as Solana and its leadership keep hitting the headlines. Ledger made a big splash when it came out with a Solana-specific version of its Flex hardware wallet, providing users with a tailored solution for optimal storage and management of Solana-based assets. Looking Ahead: A Chain That’s Not Slowing Down Across the financial, mobile hardware, DeFi infrastructure, and security sectors, Solana is making it clear that its ambitions extend far beyond being just another Layer 1. Progress at Solana has been meaningful and multifaceted. This positions the blockchain as a potentially powerful player in the next wave of Web3 adoption. With the Solana phone launch on the horizon and new financial integrations underway, Solana’s week of announcements reflects not just momentum but maturity. It’s a chain that’s actively building, actively growing, and actively preparing for the future — one real-world asset, mobile device, and protocol at a time.

The post highlights a specific reference within the IMF’s report that connects the R3 enterprise blockchain platform to the XRP Ledger , stating that the IMF explicitly confirmed that “R3 is based on the XRP blockchain.” The tweet adds the word “Documented,” emphasizing the official nature of the reference. Even as recent as 2024, the IMF confirmed that “R3 is based on the XRP blockchain.” Documented. https://t.co/JLuIZBBMgf pic.twitter.com/gHgIu6apN0 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 27, 2025 Palau’s Sovereign Stablecoin Initiative The IMF paper includes an annex focused on Palau, detailing the country’s financial infrastructure and digital currency initiatives. According to the table, Palau has no central bank and uses the US dollar as its legal tender. The nation also lacks a domestic central bank-operated payment infrastructure, relying instead on systems provided by U.S. banks for clearing and card issuance. As part of its modernization efforts, Palau launched a digital identification system in 2022 and has been exploring sovereign stablecoin issuance. One section of the table reads, “There is a plan to issue sovereign stablecoins by late 2022 (based on R3 XRP blockchain).” This phrasing has gained attention in digital asset circles due to its specific mention of both R3 and the XRP blockchain in the context of a government-backed stablecoin project. While R3’s Corda platform is widely known for its enterprise blockchain capabilities, this IMF citation appears to affirm a more direct integration with the XRP Ledger than previously emphasized in public-facing institutional reports. Community Reactions and Clarifications In a reply to SMQKE’s tweet, X user Rodrigo Siqueira offered additional context, clarifying that while R3’s Corda does not have a native cryptocurrency, it is capable of integrating with multiple crypto assets, including XRP, XDC, Solana, and Ethereum (via Obscuro). According to Siqueira, such integrations are used for specific purposes such as decentralized finance (DeFi) operations and asset tokenization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Digital Infrastructure in Palau The original IMF report was prepared by a multi-departmental team and includes insights from the Asia and Pacific Department, the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, the Legal Department, and others. The February 2024 publication explores how digital money innovations are impacting the financial landscapes of Pacific island countries, many of which face unique challenges due to geographic isolation and limited financial infrastructure. Palau’s engagement with blockchain-based solutions, particularly in the issuance of a sovereign stablecoin, is a noteworthy example of how smaller jurisdictions are adopting digital finance technologies. The IMF document acknowledges this trend, even referencing Palau’s Digital Residency Law, which enables individuals worldwide to claim blockchain-based residency status with the backing of a sovereign government. Implications for Blockchain and Policy Integration The citation of the XRP blockchain as part of Palau’s stablecoin initiative , as documented by the IMF, remains a point of interest for those tracking the intersection of public policy and blockchain technology. The involvement of R3 and its potential interoperability with crypto assets, such as XRP, adds further dimension to ongoing discussions about how traditional financial institutions and emerging blockchain platforms are integrating in practice.

45276063,https://nulltx.com/?p=150044,1748584736,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,AI Agent Markets Hold Ground as Microcaps Steal the Spotlight,https://nulltx.com/ai-agent-markets-hold-ground-as-microcaps-steal-the-spotlight/,"Over the last 24 hours, the Virtuals ecosystem continued to be lively. The focus, however, was not on the major tokens, which pulled back slightly. Instead, investors turned their attention to high-upside microcaps. Even so, the total market capitalization dipped only a little and seemed to be holding up just fine. The real surprise was with the total trading volume, which continued at a healthy pace. If anything, the market seemed ripe for the re-emergence of AI agents. The minor price drop experienced by the $VIRTUAL token, which holds down the Virtuals ecosystem, did nothing to lessen its prominence in the much broader AI agent market. If anything, all that did was call my attention to the price chart for SANTA, which notched a price rise of more than 200%, and got me wondering how many more wild price rides lesser-known tokens might take in the emerging AI ecosystem. Speculative plays, anyone? Market Snapshot: Consolidation Amid Microcap Momentum As of May 29, 2025, the total market cap for AI agent-related projects sits at $11.59 billion, reflecting a slight 0.22% decline over the past day. The Virtuals ecosystem specifically accounts for $2.76 billion of that value, down 3.76% over the same period. The $VIRTUAL token, central to this ecosystem, currently trades at $2.3452, having dipped 4.11%. The overall mindshare for AI agents climbed to 40.09%, showing that investor attention is still mostly directed toward the sector, even amid some minor price corrections. Virtuals’ mindshare saw a slight dip of 0.25%, settling at 20.51%, which still puts it in a commanding position. These numbers make it clear that even though the market cap regressed a bit, users and investors are not necessarily leaving the space. They are funneling their resources into newer, more flexible projects that have a better chance of growing quickly in the near term. Santa Leads Microcap Rally with Explosive 212% Surge The performance of SANTA (@santavirtuals) clearly stole the show today, with its market cap having shot up 212.5% over the past 24 hours. What seems to be the community-driven momentum of this crypto seems fully in play here, and appearances in virtual spaces seem to be really working for SANTA. Integrating with nearly 100% of blockchain protocols seems like a near-foolproof pathway to growth. SANTA does all of the above. SANTA’s surge set the stage for a much bigger rotation into microcap assets, with many of those posting double-digit gains. WAI climbed 15.24%, BRAIN rose 14.95%, LEO added 13.37%, and HANA followed closely with a 13.35% gain. Virtuals Daily Update | May 29th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/OP2eqn2YVK — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 29, 2025 Investors seem to be gravitating toward the AI agent space, which many seem to regard as the next big thing. This is evident in the growing interest and upside that’s being demonstrated in many early-stage projects. Clearly, something is stirring these very market participants to engage more actively in a portfolio rebalancing phase. This is also reflected in a pretty clear downward slide that many more mature tokens have been taking of late. Ecosystem Outlook: Volatility Ahead but Fundamentals Remain Strong Although price shifts in the ecosystem of virtual assets may be becoming more pronounced, the virtual assets ecosystem remains fundamentally strong. With more than 40% of the decentralized market occupied by AI agents, the virtual assets ecosystem is definitely not short on interest in AI-driven on-chain entities. The slight drop in the $VIRTUAL token price isn’t likely a bad omen but rather the latest step in the broader diversification of interest among core ecosystem tokens. As maturing market cores consolidate, they’re often prone to the pullback we’re seeing in Virtuals. However, that’s not bearish for Virtuals as a whole. Quite the opposite: the interest redistribution could be a precursor to a more well-rounded core and could actually lead to a breakout rather than a breakdown. In the future, the microcaps in the Virtuals community—and investors too—will be watching for upward performance from our key tokens. Will they reach new heights? And how about the chance they might reach those heights via fresh protocol upgrades, new integrations, or ecosystem grants? There’s clear demand for new playthings like experimental and early-stage AI agents. That puts the Virtual ecosystem in a prime spot to capitalize on the next growth surge—one powered by the intersection of experimental AI and emerging decentralized technologies. The Daily Update of Virtuals gives an account of a market that is dynamic and in evolution, which, while it has slightly cooled at the top, is generating growth and innovation from the bottom up. It is uncertain whether the momentum this market is building among microcaps can be sustained or whether it will rotate back into larger microcaps like $VIRTUAL, but this update tries to give an account of where things might be headed next.

In the past 24 hours, Toncoin perpetual futures open interest (OI) surged by 33%, climbing to $190 million — the most since February 18. The $47 million surge in open interest was driven by large buying on the futures market, even as the price was pulling back. Analysts and traders are watching the situation closely — a rise in open interest even as the price is pulling back is being interpreted as a potential setup for volatility in either direction. Over the past 24h, $TON perpetual futures OI surged +33% from $143M to $190M – its highest level since Feb 18. Interestingly, OI stayed elevated even after the price pullback. Past spikes like this have often preceded corrections – worth watching closely: https://t.co/wXpcaQoKul pic.twitter.com/IwbflHdkwZ — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 At the same time, on-chain data reveals that a substantial support level is coalescing at $3.24. There, a vast contingent of Toncoin holders has recently arrived in the marketplace. Coupled with some fresh technical developments and an ever-expanding utility—thanks to its ongoing integration into Telegram—that Toncoin seems to be entering a new, attention-grabbing phase is, in our view, a matter of not just possibility but also likelihood. Futures Open Interest Surges as Traders Pile In In the current trading cycle, one of the most noticeable developments is the rapid increase in open interest on Toncoin perpetual futures. Open interest measures the total number of open futures contracts, and a single-day jump of 33% means a lot more contracts are now open. That kind of movement—very much in the range of what you would call a “speculative” price advance—frequently reflects rising trader enthusiasm, engagement, and a certain level of leverage. Increases in open interest — especially those that coincide with gains in prices — tend to be associated with short-term corrections. During these instances, it seems that the lava in the layers beneath a volcano has heated up. In contrast, high open interest in Toncoin and a modest pullback in its price suggest the opposite: that even if ton traders took a minor hit, they might be braced for a major event in the near term. This is a configuration that warrants close oversight. The reaction from the market over the next few days could establish the overall direction of Toncoin in the short term. This is especially true should additional buying or selling occur or if any overzealous traders begin to cover their short positions. Strong On-Chain Support Around $3.24 A key demand zone around $3.24 is currently supporting Toncoin’s price. On-chain data from SentoraHQ shows that roughly 1.21 million wallets have close to 740 million TON at this level. That makes $3.24 a pretty solid support level. A large number of holders down there are very likely to be defending their positions against any further downside. #Toncoin is holding above a major demand zone at $3.24, where 1.21 million wallets scooped up nearly 740 million $TON , shows on-chain data from @SentoraHQ . This level could act as strong support! pic.twitter.com/2wkq8m4CnD — Ali (@ali_charts) May 29, 2025 Significant accumulation areas like this serve as not just psychological support but also as technical support for a token when it is traversing the kind of volatile price waters we have seen recently. The $3.24 level is particularly noteworthy for not just the sheer volume of tokens held there but also for the number of individual wallets involved — a very robust signal of interest amongst both retail and smaller institutional investors. Provided that Toncoin can keep its price action above this zone, the bulls could remain in control, and the token might be ready to stage a rebound if the overall market mood brightens again. Adoption Grows as Telegram Integrates TON The Toncoin ecosystem is experiencing a real-world utility boost beyond just market metrics and technical levels, and it’s no small integration we are talking about. Telegram, one of the most popular messaging platforms in the world, has just started incorporating Toncoin into its app, allowing in-app payments and broadening other use cases for this cryptocurrency. Telegram has officially begun to make Toncoin not only a messaging platform currency but a payment currency within its massive global user base. Integrating Toncoin into Telegram can change the token’s game for the better. It exposes the token to a massive audience. There are 700 million people using Telegram. These users are not just hanging out, though. In Telegram, users are increasingly engaging in interactions that can be monetized, be it through businesses or through various social and even political means. Telegram is not just a website with a whole bunch of people; it’s a place where a lot of real stuff goes on. Also, Toncoin has recently broken out of a lengthy downtrend and added a technical tailwind to its fundamental momentum. The market is still in the early stages of digesting these changes, but Toncoin’s combination of rising interest from traders, clear support from on-chain participants, and newfound integration into Telegram’s infrastructure suggests that it’s laying the groundwork for a new chapter. Currently, the $3.24 support zone and futures activity are the main focus. How Toncoin behaves in the next few days—in terms of consolidating, correcting, or climbing—will likely depend on how these two intersecting forces play out.

A US court ruling from a federal circuit court of appeal has temporarily paused a previous decision that went against these reciprocal tariffs. This unexpected halt signals a period of deliberation by the court, as reported by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, leaving businesses and economists pondering the potential economic impact and future of trade policy . What Were the Trump Tariffs and Why the Challenge? To understand the significance of this US court ruling , we need to rewind slightly. The tariffs in question were largely imposed during the administration of former President Donald Trump, often targeting goods from countries like China, citing concerns over unfair trade practices, national security, or as leverage in trade negotiations. These weren’t just minor adjustments; they represented a significant shift in U.S. trade policy , moving towards a more protectionist stance. These tariffs, applied to various imports ranging from steel and aluminum to a wide array of Chinese goods under Section 301 investigations, were met with mixed reactions. While proponents argued they protected domestic industries and jobs, critics highlighted increased costs for consumers and businesses, retaliatory tariffs from other nations, and disruptions to established supply chains. The legal challenges against these tariffs often centered on the authority under which they were imposed, questioning whether the executive branch overstepped its powers or failed to follow proper administrative procedures. A ruling against the tariffs, as was temporarily reversed, would have potentially invalidated some of these measures, leading to significant refunds for importers and a reshaping of trade relationships. Decoding the US Court Ruling: What Does “Temporarily Halted” Mean? The core of the recent news is the federal circuit court’s decision to temporarily halt the ruling that found fault with the Trump tariffs . What exactly does this mean? It’s a Pause, Not a Reversal: The court has not overturned the previous ruling on the merits. It has simply put it on hold. Time for Consideration: The court stated it needs time to review ‘related filings’. This could include appeals, briefs from involved parties (like the government defending the tariffs or importers challenging them), or requests for clarification. Status Quo (for now): While the halt is in place, the tariffs that were challenged and found unlawful in the lower ruling likely remain in effect. Businesses cannot currently rely on the invalidated ruling to avoid paying the tariffs or seek refunds based on that specific decision. Uncertain Duration: The term ‘temporarily’ is key. The halt could last days, weeks, or potentially months, depending on the complexity of the filings and the court’s schedule. This temporary halt introduces a layer of uncertainty. Businesses that might have been preparing for the potential removal or invalidation of certain tariffs based on the previous ruling now face ambiguity. Will the original ruling be upheld after the court’s review, or will the halt be made permanent, or will the court issue a new decision? Crucial Economic Impact: Who Feels the Effects of This Trade Policy Uncertainty? Any shift, or potential shift, in trade policy carries significant weight for the economy, and this US court ruling is no exception. The uncertainty surrounding the future of these tariffs has a crucial economic impact that resonates across various sectors: Challenges for Businesses: Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies that import goods subject to these tariffs face unpredictable costs. This makes long-term planning difficult. Do they absorb the cost, pass it to consumers, or try to find alternative suppliers? Increased Costs: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imports. These costs can increase operating expenses for manufacturers, retailers, and other businesses relying on imported components or finished goods. Investment Hesitation: Uncertainty about trade rules can make businesses hesitant to invest in new projects, expand operations, or commit to long-term contracts that depend on stable import costs. Competitive Disadvantage: U.S. companies using tariffed imports might be at a disadvantage compared to international competitors who do not face these costs. Impact on Consumers: Higher Prices: Businesses often pass increased costs from tariffs onto consumers in the form of higher prices for goods ranging from cars and appliances to clothing and electronics. Reduced Variety: Some imported goods might become too expensive to stock, potentially reducing consumer choice. Broader Economic Effects: Inflationary Pressure: Tariffs contribute to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods and reducing competition. Strained International Relations: Ongoing disputes over tariffs can strain diplomatic and trade relationships with key partners, potentially leading to retaliatory measures. Impact on Global Trade Flows: Uncertainty in a major economy’s trade policy can influence global trade patterns as countries and companies seek stability. While the direct beneficiaries of tariffs are intended to be domestic industries gaining protection, the broader economic impact often involves a complex web of winners and losers, with uncertainty being a net negative for overall economic stability and growth. Navigating the Waters of Global Trade Amidst Tariff Disputes The temporary halt on the ruling against Trump tariffs underscores the volatile nature of global trade in the current geopolitical climate. Trade relationships are not static; they are influenced by political shifts, economic pressures, and legal challenges. Examples of Affected Areas: Historically, the Trump-era tariffs impacted a wide range of goods. For instance: Steel and Aluminum: Tariffs were applied globally based on national security grounds (Section 232). Chinese Goods: Extensive tariffs were placed on thousands of products under Section 301, covering everything from machinery and electronics to furniture and plastics. Goods from Allies: At times, tariffs or the threat of tariffs were used in negotiations with traditional allies over issues like automobile imports or digital services taxes. Each of these categories involves complex international supply chains. A legal challenge and subsequent temporary halt create ripples through these networks, affecting manufacturers in multiple countries, shipping companies, logistics providers, and ultimately, the end consumers. Actionable Insights (for businesses/stakeholders): Given the ongoing uncertainty stemming from the US court ruling and the broader landscape of trade policy : Monitor Developments Closely: Stay informed about the court’s decision and any related government actions. Assess Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Identify dependencies on goods subject to potential tariff changes. Explore diversification options. Engage with Trade Experts: Consult with legal and trade policy experts to understand potential outcomes and plan accordingly. Advocate: Businesses impacted by tariffs can engage with industry associations and policymakers to voice their concerns. The situation highlights the intricate link between domestic legal processes and international commerce. A decision made in a U.S. courtroom can have tangible effects on factories in Asia, shipping lanes across oceans, and prices in shops worldwide. What’s Next After This US Court Ruling? The temporary halt is just one step in a potentially lengthy legal and political process. What could happen next? Court’s Final Decision: The federal circuit court will eventually issue a decision on the merits of the appeal or the filings it is considering. It could uphold the previous ruling against the tariffs, reverse it, or send it back to a lower court for further review. Government Response: Regardless of the court’s final decision, the executive branch (the current administration) has options. They could choose to maintain, modify, or remove tariffs based on their own policy goals, potentially independent of the specific legal challenge, or respond to the court’s directives. Further Appeals: Depending on the outcome at the circuit court level, either party could potentially seek further review, possibly petitioning the Supreme Court, although this is not guaranteed. Political Considerations: Trade policy is often a political hot potato. The upcoming political landscape will undoubtedly influence the long-term trajectory of tariffs, regardless of judicial outcomes. For those watching the broader markets, including the cryptocurrency space, events like this, while not directly tied to crypto, contribute to the overall climate of economic uncertainty. Major shifts in global trade and potential impacts on inflation, corporate earnings, and investor confidence can indirectly influence sentiment and capital flows across all asset classes. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Trade Uncertainty The temporary halt by a US court ruling on a decision challenging Trump tariffs serves as a potent reminder of the complexities and uncertainties inherent in modern trade policy . It underscores how legal battles over past executive actions can continue to shape the present and future of the economy. The crucial economic impact of tariffs, affecting everything from corporate balance sheets to household budgets, means that developments like this are closely watched by businesses, investors, and governments worldwide. While the final outcome of this specific legal challenge remains to be seen, the period of temporary halt highlights the ongoing volatility in global trade . Businesses must remain agile, prepared for potential shifts in costs and market dynamics. For the wider public and market participants, it’s a signal to continue monitoring the intersection of law, politics, and economics, as decisions made in courtrooms and government offices can have far-reaching effects on the global financial landscape.

Bitget is a post-trade platform for dealing with assets in the crypto-space. It allows users to serve their financial needs in an adequately integrated crypto ecosystem. The launch of RLUSD here marks an effort to make Ripple’s stablecoin as accessible to everyone as possible. At the launch, Ripple’s senior vice president of business operations, Monique Morrow, appeared in a live video stream to present Ripple’s stablecoin, as well as the basic post-trade concepts of the Bitget trading platform. To commemorate going public, Bitget is conducting a lottery for 500 RLUSD. This is a likely attempt to entice traders of all stripes to experiment with the coin. Retail users, as well as institutional traders, are urged to explore RLUSD’s functionalities. And what are those, exactly? Well, for one, the stablecoin is genuinely stable. It has a solid foundation, is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and is natively issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as well as on Ethereum, giving it a unique dual-chain structure. @Ripple USD $RLUSD has been listed on @Bitgetglobal 's spot trading platform Bitget lists #RLUSD , an enterprise-grade USD-backed stablecoin issued by Ripple. The exchange will also give away 500 RLUSD to celebrate the launch. As a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar,… pic.twitter.com/riSe7WQpNP — CryptoDep #StandWithUkraine (@Crypto_Dep) May 29, 2025 RLUSD Aims to Redefine Stablecoin Standards The market entry of RLUSD is underscored by three foundational principles: trust, liquidity, and compliance. Being a product of Ripple—one of the most established firms in the crypto payments sphere—the stablecoin is deeply embedded in Ripple’s existing infrastructure, which gives it a strategic advantage over somewhat riskier, independent stablecoin projects, most of which are just that: projects. RLUSD has an immediate path to adoption in real-world finance through Ripple’s global payment networks and enterprise relationships. Regulators and market participants are meant to see the coin as reliable and transparent, because it’s fully backed by dollar reserves and issued by a trusted party. RLUSD supports both XRPL and Ethereum, giving developers an excellent deal of freedom to create cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps) or payments solutions. This freedom is crucial in fintech, where blockchain interoperability is vital for businesses that want to bridge traditional finance with decentralized protocols. Bitget Expands Its Stablecoin Offerings Bitget is attempting to make stablecoin trading an important part of its business. It has chosen to list RLUSD among the products it offers on its trading platform to achieve that aim. RLUSD joins other stablecoins that Bitget supports, such as the USD1, in trading pairs with top cryptocurrencies (including BTC and ETH) that serve as the foundation for the versatile digital asset platform that makes Bitget the rebel among crypto exchanges. RLUSD’s listing coincides with Bitget’s recent drive to back fresh financial crafts, especially those that hit the mark in functionality for enterprise uses. The exchange’s watertight infrastructure, packed with Bitcoin and layered with high-grade deposit security, makes it a secure and compliant place for anyone to try their hand at trading RLUSD. Adding RLUSD to Bitget Savings, the platform’s interest-earning product, seems to be under consideration. If this integration takes place, it could elevate RLUSD’s appeal as well as its traction in trading. More importantly, it could mean demand for RLUSD will become significant enough to resemble a “savings stablecoin”—one that earns interest even when saved, as opposed to being spent or traded. Bridging Traditional Finance and Decentralized Innovation RLUSD’s debut on Bitget means more than just another stablecoin getting listed on an exchange; it signifies a larger movement afoot in the cryptocurrency world where tried-and-tested, payment-related financial infrastructure is merging with payment-related decentralized infrastructure. Ripple’s long history as a payment-focused blockchain company gives RLUSD a kind of institutional credibility that most stablecoin issuers lack and that at least some enterprises looking to use a stablecoin might find appealing. Additionally, the issuance of RLUSD on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum highlights Ripple’s strategic, forward-looking vision of the multi-chain future of finance. With this reality in mind, Ripple is pursuing a strategy that gives RLUSD the best chance of becoming a meaningful tool in the real world across different use cases. In essence, RLUSD will be able to achieve those aims better because it involves cross-chain issuance. As global regulatory talks about stablecoins keep moving, the push for compliance and transparency can also help RLUSD win early trust in places that are tightening the rules on digital assets. Users and developers searching for not just reliable but also adaptable stablecoins should find RLUSD a good contender. In the upcoming months, everyone will be watching to see how RLUSD performs in terms of adoption, trading volume, and integration into payment and DeFi ecosystems. With Bitget providing a powerful platform for it to gain exposure and Ripple’s enterprise backing to lend it legitimacy, RLUSD might very well emerge as a strong entity in the next chapter of the stablecoin evolution.

The “Percent of Total Supply in Profit” metric tracks how much of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply was acquired at a price lower than its current market value. Right now, it seems that a lot of top coins are seeing a historically high amount of profit among their holders. Here are the figures for some of the major coins: Bitcoin (BTC): 73.1% Ethereum (ETH): 79.6% Litecoin (LTC): 83.5% Chainlink (LINK): 92.3% Ripple (XRP): 90.5% Polkadot (DOT): 91.5% Cardano (ADA): 87.9% Solana (SOL): 95.4% The figures for Chainlink, Ripple and Solana are especially impressive. The data indicates that the market has experienced widespread increases in the prices of assets, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin. This could be seen as a sign that the market is quite strong. But it could also mean that the market in general is due for a correction, as people might be tempted to take profits after the long, nearly uninterrupted upward trend we’ve seen. Bitcoin, XRP Lead the Pack in Holder Profits New data shows that Bitcoin has the highest amount of its supply in profit. Currently, 98.4% of circulating Bitcoin is worth more than it was worth when it was acquired. This reflects the long-term bullishness of Bitcoin. It also reflects the conviction held by many who hold Bitcoin. XRP is closely behind with 98.3 percent of its supply in favorable territory for holders. This is a surprising figure given all the regulatory and legal trouble XRP has faced, including a lawsuit from the SEC. XRP is now almost completely in profitable territory thanks to its recent price recovery. Pretty much all XRP holders are now making money, which confirms that the market has pretty much shaken off the earlier uncertainty it had with regard to this token. Other significant assets are likewise registering stout profit rates. Chainlink counts 80.5 percent of its supply in profit; Dogecoin, 77.9 percent; Ethereum, 71.5 percent; and Cardano, 71.0 percent. Not on par with Bitcoin or XRP, these numbers nonetheless suggest a large swath of token holders in these networks is seeing returns on its investments. Percent of Total Supply in Profit is a straightforward metric that shows how much of a cryptocurrency’s current circulating supply is held at a profit—meaning the coins were bought at a lower price than they’re worth today. Currently, some notable top caps' supply in profit… pic.twitter.com/QU3sGrtV07 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 28, 2025 What This Metric Tells Us About Market Sentiment The Percent of Supply in Profit is a metric that is simple and direct. A token is either in profit or it isn’t, with the profit margin being minimal for some. This offers a simple yet effective way of viewing how positioned in the market investors are. Of course, when large amounts of a coin’s supply are in profit, it more often than not indicates that the price has been moving in a positive direction recently and that the holders themselves are exhibiting bullish sentiment. Yet this trend can also signal something more ominous. When a token becomes overbought—as indicated by the variety of signals described above—its price is probably at or near an unsustainable peak. Although this peak may persist for a time, it will inevitably be followed by a cooldown phase. Since this is the typical life cycle of overbought tokens, these sorts of price trends represent the kind of living danger signs that traders should be wary of. Conversely, when most of a coin’s supply is losing money, this usually signals that the market is awash with pessimism and fear. Historically, these moments of low sentiment have often coincided with buying opportunities. They tend to mark the moments when a coin is way undervalued and is just about to recover in price. To gain a better overall understanding, this metric is frequently examined together with other ones such as the Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Network Realized Profit/Loss. When looked at together, they offer insight into whether or not the market is in an overbought or oversold condition, or somewhere in the middle. Rising Profits: Opportunity or Warning? With the continual evolution of cryptocurrencies and the emergence of new coins, it’s anticipated that an increasing portion of the supply of individual assets will be held in profit. But looking at percentages instead of actual numbers gives us a clearer, inflation-adjusted picture of the current market. This allows us to reach conclusions that aren’t misled by simple volume comparisons. At present, the profits being made by the holders of Bitcoin, XRP, and other major coins are nearly universal. That is an unambiguous thumbs-up for the kind of upward momentum we like to see. And yet, it also makes us think about being cautious. At least, it should make us think about being cautious because crypto’s cyclical nature means that periods of high profitability often lead to market resets—consolidations or corrections. The percentage of supply in profit isn’t predictive by itself, but combined with larger market analysis, it becomes a pretty nifty gauge of investor sentiment. Whether this current round of nice moves turns out to be the prelude to sustained new highs or just the thing that kicks off the next wave of profit-taking, the fact is that right now the entire crypto market is in a nice phase, and everyone is watching to see what happens next.

One of the most popular decentralized exchanges in the world of crypto is back to proving its dominance, by not only racking up user activity but also by being profitable.

One exceptional example of this mounting momentum is that of a shrewd whale investor who has held the Uniswap (UNI) token since 2020. This investor is presently raking in the rewards from a smart purchase made three years ago. Meanwhile, another development that could very well bolster Uniswap’s position in DeFi, the recent deployment of Uniswap v4 on Arbitrum, has achieved some level of success in a very short period of time.

This investor, known for holding assets through thick and thin (exactly what “diamond hands” means), has now seen profits ripple up to around $994,000. He began amassing the UNI tokens when they were valued at $5.99. As of now, the market price hovers just above $7.47. It seems that the valor and wisdom of this whale in going long are paying off handsomely.

That is a figure—calculated by @wojaknft—that most investors would be pleased to show their mothers. This case illustrates the kinds of rewards that can accrue from an investor truly understanding market cycles and the potential of protocols. While many traders skedaddle early or follow the kind of hype-driven, at-the-moment trends that usually die down shortly after they peak, this investor has shown that positioning consistently in a relatively new asset like UNI can pay off handsomely if you understand what you’re holding and why. Uniswap v4 on Arbitrum: Adoption Accelerates Uniswap v4 on Arbitrum is now not far short of four months since its launch, and it is gaining significant traction. The protocol has pulled together a total of 1,823 liquidity pools, 427 of which are what the developers now call “hooked pools”—those custom pools that integrate additional logic or functionality. And yes, there is now enough enthusiastic development activity around Uniswap v4’s modular design for 182 individual hooks to be listed as deployed. Less than 4 months since @Uniswap v4 launched on Arbitrum: 1,823 pools 427 hooked pools 182 hooks deployed Uniswap is cooking pic.twitter.com/nRQGkNNpko — Entropy Advisors (@EntropyAdvisors) May 28, 2025 Among its most innovative features, Uniswap v4 introduced “hooks,” allowing developers to create custom liquidity pool behavior. Uniswap v4’s hooks are now enabling a sharp uptick in experimentation and new decentralized trading strategies that the protocol’s developers believe will soon be visible on Arbitrum’s lower-fee, faster-execution Layer 2 network. Uniswap v4’s success on Arbitrum is part of a much broader trend. DeFi apps are leaving the high gas fees on Ethereum’s mainnet behind and are migrating toward Layer 2 solutions. Arbitrum, the best Layer 2 alternative to Ethereum, offers a scalable, cost-efficient environment in which to build DeFi primitives. And Uniswap is, by far, the leading DeFi app on that platform. A Protocol That Keeps on Cooking From record-breaking profits for whale investors to a tidal wave of developer energy on Arbitrum, Uniswap is showing that it’s not some kind of legacy protocol coasting on past glories. Instead, it’s changing, growing, and energizing as ever. The return of significant investors and the increasing value of the UNI token suggest that confidence in the protocol’s future is growing. At the same time, the launch and rapid expansion of Uniswap v4 on Arbitrum demonstrate that the team and ecosystem remain at the cutting edge of DeFi innovation. Investors and smart investor behavior, coupled with state-of-the-art technology, might very well be setting Uniswap up for a fantastic next chapter. While other protocols compete in the DeFi space, Uniswap not only occupies a premier position but, in its way, also demonstrates leadership. Uniswap is building with intention, attracting serious venture capital, and providing a platform where developers can experiment and offer what we should think of as the future of finance. In a quickly changing market, few projects keep their relevance intact while also pushing the limits. Uniswap, it appears, does both. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45276309,https://nulltx.com/?p=150039,1748585322,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Arbitrum DAO Surges Toward Record-Breaking Profitability in May,https://nulltx.com/arbitrum-dao-surges-toward-record-breaking-profitability-in-may/,"Arbitrum DAO is on a path that could see it deliver its most profitable month to date, with a projected Gross Profit Margin of 98% for May. This is a rather stunning milestone that highlights something we suspected all along: Arbitrum’s economic strength is growing, along with its operational efficiency. Arbitrum DAO is on pace for its highest-ever Monthly Gross Profit Margin, hitting 98% in May. For context: Gross Profit Margin = Blockspace Revenue (Tx Fees, Timeboost, Orbit License) – Associated Costs (Developer Guild, DA) With Pectra reducing the cost of Blobs and Timeboost… pic.twitter.com/IW543oYiyb — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) May 28, 2025 Profits have jumped because revenue streams are shooting up and costs are pretty stable. Arbitrum makes money from transaction fees, Timeboost auctions, and Orbit licensing fees. At the same time, costs tied to the Developer Guild and DAO operations have stayed within reasonable limits, allowing the DAO to act more like a business with decent margins that is also spending enough to ensure that it will grow. The DAO now seems to be walking a tightrope very efficiently. Pectra and Timeboost: Driving Efficiency and Revenue This movement toward leaner operations is being driven by two major forces. One is Pectra, an upgrade of Ethereum that is coming soon and expected to lower the price of data blobs. Data blobs are core to Arbitrum, which requires Ethereum for data availability. The Avatar DAO has operational expenses that are tightly tied to the cost of those blobs. So better Ethereum translates to a lower cost of Arbitrum. Timeboost is the other significant new feature introduced. It is a bidding mechanism, whereby users and protocols can pay for priority access to blockspace. Arbitrum has become the first Rollup to offer this as a feature, and it has quickly evolved into a significant revenue-generating machine for the protocol. Pectra and Timeboost, together, signal a far-reaching pivot in the Arbitrum ecosystem. The DAO is not just adding new revenue streams; it is doing so in a way that doesn’t throw new bolts of complexity into the system or add overhead, which means a healthier financial model. Weekly Protocol Revenue Shows Clear Market Leaders In the previous week, protocols based on Arbitrum brought in a total of $1.18 million. That represents a 12 percent increase from the week before. This revenue performance definitely puts the decentralized layer-2 platform, which sits atop Ethereum, in the spotlight as far as demand and usage go. The largest revenue generator was GMX, a decentralized exchange focusing on perpetual trades, which generated $500,000. GMX remains a powerhouse on Arbitrum, where it provides high-leverage trades with low slippage. The strong revenues it produces almost certainly confirm its place at the top of the list of applications on the Arbitrum network. Gains Network finished in the second position, providing $140,000 of weekly revenue. It is an increasingly popular platform where synthetic assets are the main attractions. User scores on Smoothness, Mainstream appeal, and Friendship suggest it is a very user-friendly and appealing platform to use. Ostium Labs had revenue of $90,000, giving it the third-highest total among the top earners. Of note: Ostium is a newer protocol that’s gaining momentum and emerging as a serious competitor. Penpie and Uniswap tied for the fifth spot, each earning $74,000. Uniswap’s presence, as a major DeFi protocol, underscores the network’s appeal to not just native Arbitrum applications but also well-established projects from other ecosystems. Last week, @arbitrum protocols generated $1.18M in revenue (+12% WoW). One exchange, half a million in revenue. GMX is dominating the leaderboard. @GMX_IO : $500k @GainsNetwork_io : $140k @OstiumLabs : $90k @Penpiexyz_io : $74k @Uniswap : $74k pic.twitter.com/s1GEq6ZYj4 — Entropy Advisors (@EntropyAdvisors) May 28, 2025 A Leaner, Profitable DAO with a Strong Outlook The numbers tell a clear story: Arbitrum DAO is attaining a level of profitability and operational odds-and-ends that sets it apart. Its ability to grow revenue through tools like Timeboost and Orbit licensing, while keeping operational expenses under control, spotlights the clear power of decentralized coordination, when properly aligned with economic incentives. In the future, Arbitrum is set to keep up this momentum. With reductions in user costs from Ethereum upgrades and a continually expanding ecosystem, the DAO has now laid down the groundwork for long-term, sustainable financial health. If current trends continue, May could prove to be a real turning point—not just for Arbitrum, but also for the more general conversation around sustainable, profitable DAO governance. The Layer 2 landscape is competitive, but Arbitrum is not merely expanding within it; it is demonstrating that decentralization and efficiency can coexist and even, in this case, potentially set a new standard for what successful blockchain ecosystems might look like.

The regulator sought to protect investors and prevent the use of unauthorized digital asset trading platforms as a means of money laundering by criminals. Thailand’s regulatory agency warned investors using the pinpointed platforms to consider taking action regarding their assets on the platform before the platform’s closure date. At the same time, the regulator cautioned the public and investors to be careful when using services from unlicensed digital asset business operators, as they would not be protected by law. Both were at risk of being scammed by offenders who either wanted to steal their digital assets or get help with moving funds illegally. However, OKX spokesperson told Cryptopolitan that the company was aware of the recent announcement by the Thailand SEC regarding restricted access to certain digital asset platforms, including OKX, and they reaffirmed that the exchange was strongly committed to maintaining standards of regulatory compliance and to supporting a safe, transparent, and responsible trading environment. “We respect the legal frameworks of applicable jurisdictions and work proactively with regulators around the world. As a firm, we are fully committed to engaging with governments and law enforcement agencies to prevent illicit activities such as money laundering.” -OKX Spokesperson Thailand’s SEC directed investors to check and confirm the list of licensed business operators at the regulator’s official website and the SEC Check First application.

Ltd., the parent company behind the crypto exchange platform OKX, and nine individual supporters who promoted unlicensed services through different social media channels. The defendants were allegedly in violation of the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 (2018). Evidence-based on a referral and the SEC’s further investigation found that on 15th October 2021, OKX provided services for a digital asset trading system, facilitating the trading and exchange of digital assets while charging a fee of 0.1% of the trading value. Additionally, OKX solicited and promoted its services through its website and various social media channels, including Telegram under the account name “OKX TH,” Twitter (now X) through the handle “OKX Thai Community,” and Line OpenChat under the name “Thai Community.” The OKX activities were liable to be an operation of digital asset exchange business under Section 3 of the Emergency Decree, for which OKX had not obtained a license, in violation of Section 26, and subject to offenses and penalties under Section 66 of the Emergency Decree. OKX also received assistance and support in promoting its services and sales promotion activities from nine individuals, including Mr. Sarun Boonmesrisanga, Mr. Nut Joongwong, Mr. Kritsana Kritsananuwat, Mr. Smithi Charoenmin, Mr. Kittithat Benchacharoenpat, Mr. Saurawit Sanguanphokai, Mr. Akarawath Rujiruangchai, Mr. Rachata Chuesaibua, and Mr. Varut Vanichayakosol.

For those tracking innovation across technology sectors, including the decentralized space often discussed in the crypto community, the convergence of AI and hardware presents exciting possibilities. Leading AI development platform Hugging Face is making a notable move in this direction, recently unveiling two new Humanoid Robots aimed at democratizing access to advanced robotics. Exploring the New Hugging Face Robots Hugging Face, known primarily for its work in natural language processing and open-source AI models, has been steadily expanding its focus into robotics. Their latest announcement introduces two distinct, open-source robotic platforms: HopeJR and Reachy Mini. This release signifies a concrete step in making sophisticated hardware more accessible for AI development and research. Let’s take a closer look at what these new Hugging Face Robots offer: HopeJR: This is a full-size humanoid robot designed for complex physical interaction. It boasts 66 actuated degrees of freedom, allowing for a wide range of movements, including walking and detailed arm manipulation. The goal is to provide a robust platform for developing and testing advanced robotics algorithms in a human-like form factor. Reachy Mini: A smaller, desktop-sized unit. While not capable of full-body locomotion like HopeJR, it is highly interactive. Reachy Mini can move its head, talk, and listen, making it an ideal tool for testing AI applications focused on interaction, communication, and basic manipulation in a controlled environment. Both robots are designed with the developer and researcher in mind, aiming to lower the traditional barriers associated with high-end robotics hardware. The Power of Open Source Robotics A core philosophy behind Hugging Face’s approach is the commitment to open source. This principle is central to their AI models and platforms, and they are extending it to their hardware initiatives. Making these new robots open source means that the designs, software, and potentially even hardware specifications are available for anyone to study, modify, and build upon. As Hugging Face co-founder and CEO, Clem Delangue, emphasized, the goal is to prevent the robotics field from being dominated by a few large entities using proprietary, ‘black-box’ systems. Open Source Robotics fosters collaboration, accelerates innovation, and allows for greater transparency and understanding of how these complex systems work. This mirrors the open-source movement seen in software development and even aspects of the decentralized technology space, where shared knowledge drives progress. Making Robotics Accessible with Affordable Robots Beyond being open source, a critical factor in lowering the barrier to entry is cost. Robotics hardware has historically been prohibitively expensive for many researchers, students, and smaller development teams. Hugging Face is tackling this head-on with aggressive pricing targets for their new units. The full-size HopeJR is estimated to cost under $3,000 per unit. The desktop Reachy Mini is even more accessible, projected to cost between $250 and $300, depending on factors like tariffs. These price points position them as significantly more Affordable Robots compared to many existing professional or research-grade platforms. This affordability can open up robotics research and development to a much wider audience, potentially leading to a surge in creative applications and advancements. Hugging Face’s Broader Push into AI Robotics The release of HopeJR and Reachy Mini is not an isolated event but part of Hugging Face’s broader, multi-year strategy to become a key player in the AI robotics space. Their efforts began gaining significant momentum with the launch of LeRobot in 2024. LeRobot is an initiative providing a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools specifically curated for building robotics systems. This year, Hugging Face has continued to build out its AI Robotics ecosystem. They released an updated version of their 3D-printed robotic arm, the SO-101, developed in partnership with The Robot Studio. They also expanded the training data available on the LeRobot platform through a collaboration with AI startup Yaak, adding valuable data for training systems like self-driving machines. The recent acquisition of humanoid robotics startup Pollen Robotics in April provided Hugging Face with essential expertise and capabilities needed to develop the new humanoid platforms, according to CEO Delangue. What This Means for the Future The introduction of affordable, open-source humanoid robots like HopeJR and Reachy Mini has significant implications for the future of AI and robotics development. By providing accessible hardware platforms alongside their open AI software tools (like LeRobot), Hugging Face is creating an integrated ecosystem that empowers a diverse community of developers. This accessibility can accelerate experimentation, education, and the development of novel applications for robots in various fields. It aligns with a broader trend towards democratizing technology, moving power and innovation from centralized entities to a wider, distributed network of creators. Availability While an exact shipping timeline is still being finalized, Hugging Face anticipates shipping the first units of these robots by the end of the year. A waitlist is currently open for those interested in acquiring either HopeJR or Reachy Mini to begin their own AI Robotics projects. Conclusion Hugging Face’s unveiling of HopeJR and Reachy Mini marks a pivotal moment in making advanced robotics more attainable. By focusing on Open Source Robotics and delivering truly Affordable Robots , they are actively working to lower the barriers that have traditionally limited participation in this field. These new Humanoid Robots , supported by Hugging Face’s growing AI Robotics platform, represent a revolutionary step towards a future where sophisticated robotic hardware is accessible to a much wider global community of innovators and developers.

In fact, both these crypto coins have seen double-digit increases on the monthly charts, which came as BTC reached a new ATH. Despite this, many whales are now turning to Unilabs (UNIL) – a phase two presale star. This crypto ICO event has been great so far, having raised over $1M and potentially soaring to $2M before June ends. Early buyers of the UNIL crypto coin are now enjoying nearly a 30% return. As Unilabs also made headlines by launching the first AI-powered DeFi asset manager, many whales think that UNIL has the most room for growth in the long run. Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Picks Up Steam With Over $1M Raised While the price of ADA and the DOGE price have been seeing good growth on the weekly charts, all eyes seem to be on Unilabs (UNIL) . Whales are interested in this crypto coin as they have noticed early buyers of it are now enjoying nearly a 30% return. Interest is high as nearly 300M UNIL tokens have been sold in the second presale round alone, helping Unilabs raise over $1M. This project was already gaining attention because it introduced something new to the DeFi market. It launched the first AI-driven DeFi asset management platform with over $30M AUM. In addition to their asset management, users can access the Unilabs Launchpad, which uses AI to forecast the most promising crypto coins long before they become popular. Thus, Unilabs could become a fan-favorite among millions. Anybody looking for governance voting rights on the platform and a share of its total fees is buying up the UNIL crypto coin during its presale. It is now in its second stage and costs just $0.0051 – nearly a 30% increase from its starting value of $0.004. But, this value will continue rising to $0.0062 after the third presale starts. Given that Lido and Yearn Finance skyrocketed post-launch, the AI integration of Unilabs makes it one of the top projects to watch this year. Sssebi: The Price of ADA May Soar to $0.80 Cardano (ADA) is one of the best cryptos and has seen some growth. CoinMarketCap shows its value has increased nearly 10% in the past 30 days. During that time, the price of ADA grew from around $0.70 to over $0.75. Market expert Sssebi thinks this bullish momentum will continue for Cardano (ADA). According to his X post, this altcoin consolidates within a symmetrical triangle. With buy pressure in the $0.70 area, he foresees a breakout for the price of ADA to $0.80 soon. Although this Cardano price prediction has turned some heads, many investors are still skeptical. Since the price of ADA has already soared over 60% on the YTD chart, its highest growth may be behind it. Therefore, traders are turning to crypto coins like UNIL instead. Experts Claims a Bullish Trend Is Coming for the DOGE Price Dogecoin (DOGE) is another crypto coin riding a bullish wave. On the one-month chart, the DOGE price surged from around $0.18 to over $0.22, as per CoinMarketCap. In other words, nearly a 25% jump for this meme coin in just a few weeks. The community is watching this token because of the analyst CEO’s bold Dogecoin price prediction. In a recent post, CEO told his X followers that history is repeating for this meme coin as its current chart is very bullish. He foresees the DOGE price potentially soaring past $1 soon. But, some traders are cautiously optimistic about Dogecoin (DOGE). It is worth noting that this meme coin has not yet reached the $1 mark, although it was launched in 2013. Since it also has a high market cap of around $35B, a lot of new money must come in for the DOGE price to soar. As a result, investors are focusing more on UNIL. What Makes Unilabs (UNIL) Stand Out From Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE)? Unilabs (UNIL) is becoming a huge hit among whales, although the price of ADA and the DOGE price may continue their growth. It will have more utility than the hype-based DOGE meme coin while boasting a smaller market cap than ADA. Thus, the adoption rate of the UNIL crypto coin will be faster. As a result, traders rush to get this token before its value skyrockets after a major crypto exchange listing.

These crypto coins experienced a double-digit increase thanks to the market-wide rally after BTC soared past $110K. Even market experts like Kaleo and Henry excited traders with their bullish Ethereum and Solana predictions. Meanwhile, one crypto coin in its second presale round is also going viral – Unilabs (UNIL) . This project has already crossed the $1M funds raised milestone in its presale and could reach $2M before June ends. Since it also redefined the market with its unique AI-driven DeFi asset management platform, traders are looking at UNIL as one of the best cryptos to buy for fast returns this year. Unilabs (UNIL) Smashes the $1M Milestone in Initial Coin Offering Unilabs (UNIL) has been stealing the spotlight while the ETH price and the Solana price are seeing growth. This is all thanks to its great initial coin offering performance, which has already raised over $1M and provided early buyers with a 30% return. Nearly 300M UNIL tokens have been bought in the second presale phase alone. All these numbers are guaranteed to increase soon since this crypto ICO event is still in its early stages. Interest in Unilabs is rising as it recently launched the first DeFi asset manager, which uses AI technology to its advantage. On it, users get access to cutting-edge features that help them maximize their profits. For instance, Unilabs Launchpad uses AI-powered insights to locate the best cryptos regarding growth potential. This will let users buy them before they explode in popularity. By holding the UNIL crypto coin, traders will get many perks. Notably, Unilabs will take up to 30% of its total generated fees and redistribute them back to UNIL holders. This will be done in a five-tiered system that rewards people who hold the most UNIL. Now is a good time to buy this crypto coin since it costs just $0.0051, but its value will soar to $0.0062 after the third presale stage begins. Plus, a Tier-1 CEX listing will trigger a massive spike. Kaleo: The ETH Price Looks Ready To Reach $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) is one of the best cryptos at the moment. CoinMarketCap shows that the ETH price increased from around $1,800 to over $2,600 in the past 30 days. In other words, Ethereum experienced nearly 50% growth in a few weeks. Market expert Kaleo thinks this bullish uptrend will continue for Ethereum (ETH). In a recent X post, Kaleo said he is incredibly bullish on this crypto coin. He even foresees the ETH price potentially soaring to $4,000. Despite this bullish Ethereum price prediction, some traders are still skeptical. Since it has a high market cap of around $320B, much new money must come in for the ETH price to rise. Therefore, traders are focusing on UNIL, which could see faster growth than the ETH price. Analyst Claims the Solana Price May Pump to $300 Solana (SOL) is another crypto coin that is turning some heads now. On the one-month chart, the value of Solana increased by over 15%, as per CoinMarketCap. The Solana price grew from around $150 to over $170 in that period. The community is also excited about this token because of analyst Henry’s bullish Solana price prediction. According to his X post, this crypto coin is seeing a classic range-bound accumulation that comes before an explosive uptrend. Thus, he foresees the Solana price potentially soaring to $300. Although this statement has made some waves for Solana (SOL), many investors still put it on the sidelines for UNIL. This could be because the Solana price has only managed to grow around 5% in the past year alone, which suggests it may have trouble maintaining a long-term bullish rally. Can Unilabs (UNIL) Gain More Traction Than Crypto Coins Like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL)? While the ETH price and the Solana price could continue their uptrends, Unilabs (UNIL) is also making a name for itself. The opportunities for passive income thanks to this crypto coin are outstanding. For instance, it offers up to 122% APY in staking rewards. This factor and its redistribution model could make it more appealing than Ethereum and Solana. Its smaller market cap also ensures faster price growth than these crypto coins. As a result, investors are stocking up on UNIL as it could be one of the best cryptos to buy this year.

French football powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has reportedly made a groundbreaking move, establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve . This development, initially reported by BeInCrypto, positions the Ligue 1 champions at the forefront of integrating cryptocurrency into traditional institutional finance within the sports sector. While many sports teams and leagues have dipped their toes into the crypto space through fan tokens, sponsorships, or NFTs, PSG’s reported decision to hold Bitcoin directly on its balance sheet is a distinct and potentially transformative step. It signals a level of confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a strategic asset. What Exactly is a Sports Team Bitcoin Reserve? In traditional finance, companies and institutions often hold reserves in various assets, primarily fiat currency, but also potentially in gold, real estate, or other stable investments, to manage liquidity, hedge against inflation, or diversify their holdings. A Sports Team Bitcoin reserve means the club is choosing to allocate a portion of its treasury funds directly into Bitcoin. This differs significantly from other crypto activities we’ve seen in sports: Fan Tokens: These are cryptocurrencies specifically for fans, offering voting rights, rewards, and access to exclusive content. They are primarily a fan engagement and revenue-generating tool, not a treasury management strategy. Sponsorships: Crypto exchanges or projects sponsoring teams provides marketing for the crypto entity and revenue for the team, but the team doesn’t necessarily hold the sponsored cryptocurrency. NFTs: Non-fungible tokens representing digital collectibles are another revenue stream and fan engagement method, not a direct investment in a core cryptocurrency like Bitcoin for treasury purposes. By establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve , the club is making an investment decision about its own corporate treasury, similar to how some major corporations have started holding Bitcoin. Why Would a Football Club Embrace Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? PSG’s move into holding Institutional Bitcoin is likely driven by several strategic considerations: 1. Inflation Hedge: Like many corporations exploring Bitcoin, PSG may view BTC as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of traditional fiat currencies. Holding a scarce digital asset could preserve purchasing power over the long term. 2. Asset Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to their treasury diversifies their holdings beyond traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing crypto-specific volatility). 3. Innovation and Brand Image: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like Bitcoin can enhance PSG’s brand image as innovative and forward-thinking. This resonates with a younger, globally connected, and tech-savvy fanbase. 4. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term appreciation potential. A successful investment could directly benefit the club’s financial health. 5. Attracting a Global Digital Audience: Embracing Bitcoin connects PSG with the vast and growing global cryptocurrency community, potentially attracting new fans and commercial opportunities in digital markets. This step into Institutional Bitcoin by a major football club is a powerful signal to the market and other traditional institutions. Is PSG Truly the First Crypto Sports Pioneer in This Way? The claim that PSG is the first sports organization to introduce a Bitcoin reserve needs careful consideration. While many sports entities are involved with crypto, holding Bitcoin directly on the balance sheet for treasury purposes is indeed less common than fan tokens or sponsorships. Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pioneering the ‘corporate treasury’ use case. PSG appears to be the first major professional sports *team* to publicly announce such a move specifically for Bitcoin reserves. Other sports entities might have exposure to crypto through investments in blockchain companies or receiving payments in crypto, but a dedicated ‘Bitcoin reserve’ signals a deliberate strategy to hold BTC as a primary treasury asset. This distinction is crucial and positions PSG as a notable pioneer in the intersection of Crypto Sports and corporate finance. Benefits and Challenges of a Football Club Crypto Strategy Adopting a Football Club Crypto strategy, particularly one involving holding volatile assets like Bitcoin, comes with potential rewards and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Financial Upside: If Bitcoin appreciates, the value of the reserve increases, boosting the club’s assets. Enhanced Reputation: Seen as innovative and aligned with future technology trends. New Revenue Streams: Opens doors for crypto-related partnerships and fan engagement initiatives. Global Reach: Connects with the worldwide crypto community. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the reserve. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires robust security measures against hacking and theft. Public Perception: Fluctuations in the reserve’s value could attract negative media attention or fan scrutiny. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex under current standards. Any Football Club Crypto strategy involving treasury reserves requires careful risk management and a long-term perspective. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Sports ? PSG’s reported move could be a watershed moment for Crypto Sports integration. If successful, it could inspire other major sports clubs and organizations across football, basketball, baseball, and other leagues to explore similar strategies. We might see a trend where: More teams consider holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury management. Crypto assets become more integrated into sports finance beyond just marketing and fan engagement. Competition increases among teams to be seen as technologically advanced and appealing to the digital generation. New financial products and services emerge specifically for sports organizations dealing with crypto. This development underscores the increasing convergence of the traditional financial world, institutional investment, and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, now reaching into the mainstream world of global sports. Actionable Insights for Fans and Investors For fans, this news highlights PSG’s commitment to innovation and potentially offers new ways to engage with the club in the future, perhaps through crypto-enabled platforms or services tied to the club’s digital strategy. For crypto investors, PSG’s move is another data point indicating growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While one team’s investment is not a guarantee of future price movements, it adds to the narrative of Bitcoin gaining acceptance as a legitimate asset class among diverse institutions. It’s a reminder that the integration of crypto into mainstream sectors is accelerating, creating both opportunities and the need for continued education and careful consideration of risks. A Bold Step into the Digital Future Paris Saint-Germain’s reported establishment of a PSG Bitcoin Reserve marks a bold and significant step. As potentially the first major sports team to directly hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset, they are navigating uncharted territory within the sports industry. This move reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin among institutions and signals a potential shift in how major sports organizations manage their finances and engage with the digital economy. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of diversification, inflation hedging, and brand innovation are clear. The world will be watching to see if other clubs follow PSG’s lead, further solidifying the link between Crypto Sports and the future of finance.

As of press time, ETH is trading at $2,631, down 3.79% in the past 24 hours, suggesting short-term selling pressure. But beneath the surface lies a classic technical setup that could decide the next big move to its resistance around $2,700–$2,800. Liquidation Cluster: A Trouble or an Opportunity? According to a post analyst, “The Kingfisher” , there’s a significant concentration of long liquidations between $2,600 and $2,700. This creates a liquidity “magnet” meaning, if ETH dips into this zone, we could see a domino effect of liquidations. With price currently near $2,631, ETH is closer to is crucial zone. The thesis highlights that the short liquidations above are comparatively light. This asymmetry suggests a steeper downside risk, especially if market sentiment flips bearish. A slip could trigger a flush toward $2,510, or even $2,319 if panic sets in. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Ethereum’s 1-D chart shows an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern, with resistance holding near $2,800. A strong daily close above $2,800 would confirm the triangle breakout. In that case, ETH could rise above the $3,000 psychological resistance to surge toward $3,100–$3,300, backed by short squeezes and breakout momentum. Conversely, If ETH fails to break out and drops below $2,510, it would invalidate the bullish pattern. A further breakdown below $2,320 would open the gates to $2,200, where the next major support lies. Read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term targets!

On Wednesday, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled that many of Donald Trump’s tariffs exceed the authority granted to the president by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The federal court struck down Trump’s April 2nd executive order establishing tariffs against 57 countries worldwide and several follow-up executive orders modifying the duties’ rates and start dates. The CIT also axed a slew of earlier tariffs Trump had applied to Mexico, Canada and China, which he claimed were retaliation for failing to stop the flood of illegal narcotics into the US. The Trump Administration immediately appealed the CIT’s ruling and requested a stay on the judgment, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted . White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the CIT’s ruling on Thursday, arguing that Trump’s “sensitive diplomatic and trade negotiations” were being “derailed by activist judges.” Equities largely tracked sideways throughout the legal drama, with the S&P 500 ticking up 0.4% on Thursday and the Nasdaq Composite jumping by 0.39%.

The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and finding opportunities for Bitcoin Yield is becoming increasingly sought after. Traditionally, earning yield on crypto often involved lending platforms that required you to give up custody of your assets. But what if you could earn yield while keeping your Bitcoin safe and sound in your own wallet? That’s where a new development on the Lightning Network is making waves. What is Amboss Rails and How Does it Offer Bitcoin Yield? Amboss, a well-known name in the Lightning Network ecosystem for analytics and node management, has launched a service called Rails. This innovative platform is designed to allow users to earn Bitcoin Yield directly on the Lightning Network. Unlike some other yield-generating methods, Rails operates on a self-custodial basis, meaning you retain control of your private keys and your Bitcoin throughout the process. Rails achieves this by facilitating two primary activities on the Lightning Network: Payment Routing: By running a Lightning node connected to Rails, users can earn small fees by routing payments across the network. When someone sends a Lightning payment, it travels through a series of nodes. Your node can earn a small fraction of the transaction fee for participating in the route. Liquidity Leasing: The Lightning Network relies on ‘channels’ filled with liquidity (Bitcoin) to route payments. Rails allows users to lease out their channel liquidity to other nodes or businesses that need it. In return for providing this crucial liquidity, users can earn yield. This dual approach leverages the fundamental mechanics of the Lightning Network to create earning opportunities directly tied to network activity and infrastructure needs. Boosting Lightning Network Activity Through Amboss Rails One of the key goals behind Amboss Rails is not just to offer users a way to generate Passive Bitcoin Income , but also to significantly boost the overall health and liquidity of the Lightning Network itself. A more liquid network is a more efficient and reliable network for payments. Think of it like a road network. The more well-maintained roads with sufficient capacity there are, the smoother traffic flows. Similarly, the more liquidity available in Lightning channels, the easier and more reliable it is for users to send and receive payments quickly and cheaply. By incentivizing users to provide liquidity and run well-connected nodes through yield generation, Rails directly contributes to making the Lightning Network a more robust and attractive platform for everyday transactions. This could play a crucial role in driving wider adoption of Bitcoin for payments. Who Can Benefit from Amboss Rails and Crypto Earning? Amboss Rails is designed with a variety of users in mind, particularly those who are serious about participating in and benefiting from the growth of the Lightning Network . The platform is targeting both institutions and businesses, recognizing their potential to contribute significant liquidity and benefit from reliable Crypto Earning opportunities. Early partners like CoinCorner, a prominent Bitcoin exchange, and Flux, a decentralized infrastructure provider, are already integrating with Rails. This indicates interest from established players in leveraging the service for their operations and potentially offering it to their users. While the service is sophisticated and likely requires some technical understanding to set up and manage a Lightning node effectively, the concept of earning Passive Bitcoin Income without handing over custody is appealing to a broad range of Bitcoin holders, from individuals with larger holdings to companies looking to optimize their treasury assets. Understanding the Mechanics: Payment Routing and Liquidity Leasing To truly grasp how Amboss Rails enables Bitcoin Yield , let’s look a bit closer at the two core mechanisms: Payment Routing: When a Lightning payment is initiated, the network finds a path of connected nodes with open channels and sufficient balance to route the payment. Nodes along the path earn a small fee (routing fee) for forwarding the payment. The amount earned depends on the volume of payments routed and the fees the node charges (which can be adjusted). Liquidity Leasing: Nodes or businesses needing more capacity in their channels to send or receive larger payments can ‘lease’ liquidity. Through Rails, users can offer their channel capacity for lease. The leasing terms (duration, yield rate) are agreed upon, and the provider earns yield for the period the liquidity is locked in the leased channel. Both methods are integral to the functioning of the Lightning Network and provide legitimate ways to earn a return based on providing essential network services. Challenges and Considerations for Earning Passive Bitcoin Income While the prospect of generating Passive Bitcoin Income through Amboss Rails is exciting, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Technical Complexity: Running a reliable Lightning node and managing channels effectively requires technical knowledge. Users need to understand channel management, balancing, and maintaining uptime. Variable Yield: The amount of Bitcoin Yield earned through routing fees can fluctuate significantly based on network activity and payment volume. Liquidity leasing might offer more predictable returns but depends on demand for liquidity. Capital Requirements: Earning meaningful yield typically requires dedicating a reasonable amount of Bitcoin to channels for routing and leasing. Channel Management: Actively managing channels, opening and closing them strategically, and ensuring they are well-connected is crucial for maximizing earning potential. Rails aims to simplify some aspects of this, particularly on the leasing side, but users should still approach it with a clear understanding of how the Lightning Network operates. The Future of Bitcoin Yield and the Lightning Network Amboss Rails represents a significant step forward in making Bitcoin Yield accessible on the Lightning Network in a self-custodial manner. By creating incentives for users to provide essential network services like routing and liquidity, it not only offers earning potential but also directly contributes to the network’s growth and efficiency. As the Lightning Network continues to mature and adoption increases, services like Rails could become increasingly popular, providing a virtuous cycle where earning opportunities grow alongside network usage. This could solidify the Lightning Network’s position as the premier layer-2 solution for fast, cheap Bitcoin transactions. For anyone interested in earning yield on their Bitcoin while supporting decentralized network infrastructure, exploring Amboss Rails and understanding the mechanics of Crypto Earning on the Lightning Network is a compelling prospect. Summary: Amboss Rails Opens New Doors for Bitcoin Earning In conclusion, Amboss has launched Rails, a self-custodial service enabling users to earn Bitcoin Yield on the Lightning Network . Through payment routing and liquidity leasing, Rails offers a novel way to generate Passive Bitcoin Income while maintaining control of your assets. Targeting businesses and institutions initially, with partners like CoinCorner and Flux on board, the platform aims to boost Lightning Network liquidity and adoption. While requiring some technical engagement, it presents a significant opportunity for those looking to participate in the network’s growth and benefit from Crypto Earning directly on layer 2.

In a filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, Georgia-based data broker giant LexisNexis Risk Solutions (LNRS) says that it discovered a breach affecting 364,333 people. “We learned that on December 25, 2024, an unauthorized third party acquired certain LNRS data from a third-party platform used for software development. The issue did not affect LNRS?s own networks or systems… The types of impacted personal information varied by affected individual, and could have included name, contact information (such as phone number, postal or email address), Social Security number, driver’s license number or date of birth. No financial or credit card information was affected.” LNRS says it immediately sent letters to affected customers to inform them of the breach, while offering free identity monitoring services to affected individuals for two years. LNRS also says it has not yet detected any instance involving the misuse of the stolen customer data. The firm is urging customers to stay vigilant and report any suspicious activity related to their financial accounts. LNRS says it has “launched an investigation with the assistance of leading external cybersecurity experts, notified law enforcement and took steps to review and further enhance our security controls.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

45278258,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=737590,1748589019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45278258.jpeg,China’s tech giants are moving away from Nvidia,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-tech-giants-build-ai-without-nvidia/,"Chinese tech giants are tearing themselves away from Nvidia after being backed into a corner by the White House. Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu have started moving their AI development onto Chinese-made chips, as Donald Trump’s new export restrictions slam the brakes on Nvidia’s sales to China. These companies have no choice, as their remaining stock of Nvidia processors is drying up fast, and the next batch may never come. According to the Financial Times , the trigger came last month when Trump’s administration tightened export rules again. This time, it blocked Nvidia’s already weakened H20 chips, the only model the company had tweaked to barely stay legal under earlier restrictions set under Joe Biden. Now that option’s dead too. Chinese firms are being forced to plan around a complete cutoff, with insiders saying their current Nvidia inventory might only carry them through to early 2026. And even if new chips get approved, they take three to six months to arrive … if they ever do. Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu test Chinese chips instead Baidu’s head of its AI cloud division, Shen Dou, told analysts last week that his company is already experimenting with other chips. He said Baidu sees “domestically developed self-sufficient chips, along with increasingly efficient homegrown software stacks” as a future-proof base for their AI ecosystem. Shen also said that their team is especially focused on finding chips that can take over inference tasks—basically, the part of AI that does the thinking after a model is trained. Eddie Wu, who leads Alibaba, said earlier this month that his company is now “actively exploring diversified solutions to meet rising customer demand.” That means they’re testing replacements, knowing their reliance on Nvidia can’t continue. At Tencent, Martin Lau told analysts they still have enough powerful chips to train models for “a few more generations,” but added they’re now being more cautious with how chips are used and said the company might “potentially make use of other chips” to handle future needs. Beijing’s own security research arm is paying close attention too. The China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, which works under the state security ministry, posted that while the US restrictions were damaging, they had led to more Chinese innovation in the AI chip sector. They specifically pointed to Huawei’s Ascend series, saying demand for those chips is rising fast. So far, buyers have mainly been big state-owned operations like China Mobile and industries like defense, finance, and health. But now, tech firms like Baidu and Alibaba are getting in line to grab whatever is available. Huawei chips bring legal risk but growing demand There’s one huge problem though. Washington is still watching Huawei closely. US authorities issued a warning this month saying that using Ascend chips anywhere in the world could lead to criminal charges. That’s why companies testing them are staying quiet, even though everyone knows what’s going on behind the scenes. Still, analysts at GF Securities believe Nvidia might try to release another chip that fits the new US rules. They expect something around early July, and say it’ll likely be built on Nvidia’s Blackwell platform. But it won’t come with high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, which is a critical piece of fast data processing. It’s also unclear if it will have NVLink, which lets Nvidia chips communicate faster with each other. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, admitted during the last earnings call that there’s nothing on the table right now. “We don’t have anything at the moment,” Huang said, leaving companies like Alibaba and Tencent in limbo. If they want to ditch Nvidia, they’ll have to rebuild their entire system around something else. The code they currently run is built on Nvidia’s CUDA software. Porting it to Huawei’s CANN platform takes months and usually requires help from Huawei engineers to make sure everything runs properly. Huawei is trying to step up production, working with partners and even launching its own chip-making plant. But still, demand is already outpacing supply. Other Chinese chipmakers like Cambricon and Hygon are also being pulled into the ring. Baidu and Alibaba have even started building their own processors to make sure they don’t run out of options.

Maintaining transparency around its reserves is crucial for user trust and the stability of the broader cryptocurrency market. Recent disclosures from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas offered a significant update on the composition of the company’s Tether reserves, highlighting substantial Bitcoin holdings and considerable Gold reserves. What Exactly Did Tether Disclose About Its Crypto Reserves? Speaking to attendees, Paolo Ardoino confirmed that Tether holds over 100,000 BTC. At the time of the announcement, this Bitcoin holdings position was valued at more than $10 billion, underscoring Tether’s significant stake in the leading cryptocurrency. Beyond digital assets, Ardoino also revealed that Tether possesses over 50 tons of physical gold as part of its Tether reserves, adding a traditional safe-haven asset to its portfolio. This announcement, reported by CoinDesk, provides a more granular look at the assets underpinning the USDT stablecoin, which aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. While Tether regularly publishes attestations regarding its reserves, specific details like the exact amounts of particular assets like Bitcoin and gold offer valuable insight into their strategy and the depth of their backing. Why Are Strong Stablecoin Reserves So Important? The stability and trustworthiness of a stablecoin like USDT are directly tied to the quality and accessibility of its underlying reserves. These reserves are the assets that stablecoin issuers hold to back the value of the tokens in circulation. When a user wants to redeem their USDT, Tether is expected to be able to provide them with the equivalent value in U.S. dollars or other assets. Key functions of robust stablecoin reserves include: Maintaining the Peg: Sufficient reserves allow the issuer to manage supply and demand, buying back tokens if the price dips below the peg or issuing new ones if demand drives the price above. Enabling Redemptions: Users need confidence that they can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying asset (in USDT’s case, USD) at any time. Strong, liquid reserves ensure this capability. Building Trust: Transparency and strength in reserves are fundamental to building and maintaining user trust in the stablecoin issuer and the token itself. Tether’s disclosure of specific, large crypto reserves like Bitcoin holdings and Gold reserves is intended to reinforce this trust by demonstrating tangible asset backing. What Do These Massive Bitcoin Holdings Signify? Tether has publicly stated its strategy to allocate a portion of its profits into investments, including Bitcoin. Holding over 100,000 BTC makes Tether one of the most significant non-public company holders of Bitcoin globally. This indicates: Confidence in Bitcoin: Tether views Bitcoin as a valuable asset class and a potential store of value, suitable for inclusion in its Tether reserves. Diversification Strategy: Including Bitcoin diversifies the reserve portfolio beyond traditional assets like Treasury Bills, potentially offering different risk/reward characteristics. Market Impact: While these holdings weren’t acquired overnight, Tether’s continuous accumulation has likely been a factor in Bitcoin’s market dynamics, positioning them as a major player in the crypto reserves space. This level of Bitcoin holdings adds a substantial, albeit volatile, component to the stablecoin reserves. Is Gold Reserves Tether’s Play for Traditional Investors? The inclusion of over 50 tons of physical gold is a notable aspect of Tether’s Tether reserves strategy. Gold has historically been seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. By holding physical gold, Tether is adding a tangible, widely recognized store of value to its backing assets. This could potentially appeal to a broader range of investors, including those more comfortable with traditional assets than purely digital ones. The decision to include Gold reserves suggests a move towards a more diversified and perhaps more conservative element within the crypto reserves mix, balancing newer digital assets like Bitcoin with established traditional assets. How Does This Disclosure Impact Confidence in the USDT Stablecoin? Transparency regarding stablecoin reserves has been a major point of discussion and sometimes contention in the crypto industry. By publicly stating the specific amounts of significant assets like Bitcoin and gold, Tether aims to increase confidence in the backing of the USDT stablecoin. For many users and market participants, knowing that tangible and high-value assets form a significant part of the Tether reserves provides reassurance. While discussions about the full auditability and liquidity of all reserve components continue, this direct disclosure from the CEO at a major industry event is a step towards greater openness regarding their stablecoin reserves. Key Takeaways for Readers: Tether holds significant amounts of both Bitcoin (over 100k BTC) and physical gold (over 50 tons) in its reserves. These assets form a substantial part of the backing for the USDT stablecoin. Holding Bitcoin reflects a strategic investment and diversification into digital assets. Holding gold adds a traditional, tangible store of value to the Tether reserves. These disclosures aim to increase transparency and confidence in Tether’s ability to back USDT. Paolo Ardoino’s announcement at Bitcoin 2025 provides a clear snapshot of two major components within the Tether reserves: massive Bitcoin holdings and substantial Gold reserves. This revelation underscores Tether’s strategy to diversify its backing assets and reinforces its position as a major player not just in stablecoins but also as a significant holder of key traditional and digital assets. For users of the USDT stablecoin and observers of the crypto reserves market, this transparency is a crucial factor in evaluating the stablecoin’s reliability and the overall health of the stablecoin reserves landscape.

Are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/QKR8YgcyPP — André Dragosch, PhD (@Andre_Dragosch) May 29, 2025 Highlighting a chart titled “Rolling Correlation: 10-Year UST Futures”, Dragosch has revealed that the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin and the US 10-Year Treasury Futures has plummeted to its lowest level ever recorded. The revelation has triggered a serious discussion on ‘are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy Bitcoin?’ US 10-Year Treasury Yield: A Simple Analysis At the start of April, the US 10-Year Bond Yield was 4.213%. Though at a point on April 4, it slipped as low as 3.859%, between April 7 and 11, it climbed steeply by 15.44%. On April 11, it hit the month’s peak of 4.590%. After hitting the peak, the market witnessed two minor corrections that month: a 4.48% correction b/w April 14 and 16 and a 4.34% correction b/w April 24 and 29. In the early half of this month, the US 10-Year Bond Yield saw a steady rise. Between May 1 and 21, it surged by 9.99%. At one point on May 22, it reached a peak of 4.629%. Currently, the yield sits at 4.420% – at least 4.49% below the peak of the month. Bitcoin Price Action: An Overview At the beginning of April, the Bitcoin price was $82,497.20. Although between April 1 and 8, the price dropped by 10.27%, between April 9 and 30, it almost steadily grew by 23.34%. In the early half of this month, the Bitcoin market also witnessed a steep increase. Between May 1 and 22 alone, the market jumped by 18.63%, from $94,123.24 to a peak of $11,653.95. Since May 23, the market has dropped by over 5.16%. A Final Note During May, both US 10-Year Treasury Yield and Bitcoin price saw significant increases, indicating a risk-on environment where both traditional safe assets and riskier assets were bought. However, Bitcoin’s initial April drop while yields also fluctuated, then its subsequent strong recovery coinciding with rising yields, hints at some capital rotation into Bitcoin as bond attractiveness waned. The subsequent minor corrections in both assets at the end of April and May suggest some profit-taking or shifting market sentiment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $358 Million Net Outflow: 10-Day Inflow Streak Ends BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the exception of the day, recording net inflows of $125 million alone, according to data provider SoSoValue.

Investment strategies are constantly evolving, and Pantera Capital, a prominent name in cryptocurrency investment, recently revealed a fascinating approach. They are looking beyond direct investment in digital assets and putting capital into publicly listed companies that hold significant crypto reserves on their balance sheets. This move signals a growing trend in how institutional players view and interact with the digital asset ecosystem. Why are Companies Building Crypto Reserves ? The idea of a company holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum as part of its corporate treasury might seem unconventional to some, but it’s a strategy gaining traction. Companies adopt this approach for various reasons: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about fiat currency devaluation, some companies see assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value that can appreciate over time, preserving purchasing power. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class like crypto can diversify a company’s holdings beyond traditional cash, bonds, and stocks. Alignment with Future Technologies: For companies operating in or adjacent to the tech sector, holding crypto can align their balance sheet with the decentralized future they might be building or interacting with. Attracting Talent and Investors: For some, having crypto reserves can signal forward-thinking leadership and potentially appeal to employees and investors interested in the digital asset space. This trend of companies accumulating crypto reserves provides a new avenue for investors like Pantera Capital to gain exposure to the digital asset market indirectly. Exploring Pantera Capital’s Investment Choices Pantera Capital, in a note to its investors, highlighted specific companies they have invested in due to their strategic decision to hold cryptocurrencies. This provides concrete examples of their strategy in action. According to reports, these include: Twenty One Capital: Described as a cryptocurrency venture company with a focus on Bitcoin investments. Investing here provides Pantera exposure to a company whose core business revolves around the leading cryptocurrency. DeFi Development: This entity has reportedly adopted Solana (SOL) as a strategic reserve asset. This investment gives Pantera exposure not just to a specific altcoin, but to a company actively involved in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, utilizing SOL within that ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming: This company has chosen to hold Ethereum (ETH) as a reserve asset. Investing in SharpLink Gaming offers Pantera exposure to a company in the gaming sector that sees value in holding the second-largest cryptocurrency, likely recognizing its importance in areas like NFTs and decentralized applications. These examples showcase Pantera’s diversified approach, targeting companies holding different key cryptocurrencies, reflecting varying strategic decisions by those companies. Is This a Smarter Institutional Investment Strategy? Pantera Capital articulated a clear rationale for investing in these companies rather than just buying the underlying cryptocurrencies directly. They believe this approach can offer greater upside potential . But why might that be the case? Investing in a public company holding crypto reserves means you are not just betting on the price movement of the crypto asset itself. You are also investing in the company’s core business, its growth prospects, management, and operational efficiency. If the company is successful in its primary business while also benefiting from the appreciation of its crypto holdings, the investment’s return could potentially outperform a simple direct investment in the crypto asset alone. Consider a scenario where a company uses its crypto reserves strategically, perhaps leveraging them for financing, integrating them into services, or simply benefiting from their balance sheet value while its main operations generate significant profit. The value derived from the successful core business combined with the crypto appreciation could provide a compounding effect not available through direct crypto ownership. Furthermore, investing in publicly listed companies often comes with layers of regulation, reporting requirements, and corporate governance that might appeal to large institutional investment firms seeking structures they are familiar with. What are the Potential Benefits of This Approach? For an investor like Pantera Capital, and potentially for other institutional investment firms considering similar strategies, the benefits can be numerous: Indirect Exposure with Structure: Gaining exposure to crypto price movements through regulated, publicly traded entities. Potential for Compounded Returns: Upside from both the underlying crypto asset’s performance and the company’s business growth. Access to Specific Sectors: Investing in companies allows targeted exposure to sectors like gaming, DeFi, or venture capital that are actively using or focused on specific cryptocurrencies. Familiar Investment Vehicle: Public stocks are a traditional asset class, making this strategy potentially easier to integrate into existing portfolios and risk management frameworks compared to direct crypto holdings. Regulatory Clarity (Relative): While crypto regulation is evolving, investing in a regulated public company provides a degree of familiarity and existing legal frameworks. This method provides a nuanced way to participate in the crypto market’s growth, blending traditional equity investment with digital asset exposure. Are There Downsides or Challenges? No investment strategy is without its risks. Investing in companies with crypto reserves introduces unique challenges: Double-Edged Sword of Volatility: The company’s stock price can be affected by both the volatility of its core business and the extreme volatility of its crypto holdings. Company-Specific Risk: You are exposed to the operational risks, management decisions, and financial health of the specific company, independent of the crypto market. Valuation Complexity: Valuing a company with significant, volatile crypto assets on its balance sheet can be more complex than valuing a traditional company or simply valuing the crypto asset itself. Correlation Risk: In market downturns, both the company’s stock and its crypto reserves might fall in tandem, amplifying losses. Tax and Accounting Issues: How companies manage and report their crypto reserves can introduce accounting complexities that might impact their financial statements. Investors must carefully evaluate both the company’s fundamentals and the potential impact of its crypto holdings. How Does This Differ from Direct Crypto Investment? Directly buying Bitcoin , Ethereum , or Solana means you own the asset itself. Your investment performance is directly tied to the price fluctuations of that specific cryptocurrency. Investing in a company with crypto reserves adds a layer of indirection. With direct crypto, you manage your own wallets, keys, and security. With company stock, you rely on the company’s management to handle the custody and strategic use of the crypto assets. Direct crypto offers pure exposure to the asset’s price. Investing in a company offers exposure to the asset’s price *plus* the performance of the company’s business. For large institutional investment firms, the infrastructure, regulatory environment, and reporting requirements around public equities are often more established than those for direct crypto holdings, making the company-based approach potentially more accessible or preferable for certain mandates. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Investment ? Pantera Capital’s strategy is indicative of a broader trend: institutional capital is finding increasingly sophisticated ways to enter the crypto market. While direct investment in Bitcoin ETFs and other funds is growing, strategies involving equity in crypto-exposed companies offer alternative risk/reward profiles. As more companies adopt crypto reserves, either as a treasury strategy or because their business involves digital assets, the universe of investable public companies with significant crypto exposure will likely grow. This provides traditional investors and crypto-focused funds like Pantera more options beyond simply buying crypto directly. This evolution suggests that the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world will continue to blur, creating new hybrid investment opportunities and strategies for sophisticated investors. Conclusion: A Strategic Evolution in Crypto Exposure Pantera Capital’s investment in publicly listed companies holding crypto reserves represents a notable strategic move in the institutional investment landscape. By targeting entities like Twenty One Capital, DeFi Development, and SharpLink Gaming, which hold assets like Bitcoin , Solana, and Ethereum , Pantera aims to capture potentially greater upside than direct crypto investment alone. This approach leverages the growth potential of both the underlying digital assets and the companies’ core businesses. While this strategy introduces unique complexities and risks compared to direct crypto ownership, it offers a structured, potentially more familiar pathway for large investors to gain exposure to the burgeoning digital asset class. It underscores the maturing of the crypto market and the innovative ways institutional capital is finding to participate in its future.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin’s unstoppable ascent showed a nice and steady rise. This recovery was possible due to easing tensions from the trade tariffs war, which led BTC to surge to a new all-time high of $112K. The price fell back recently as a post by Donald Trump brought back the trade tensions with european union this time, which led to a brief dip to $108K. But, 48 hours later he paused the recent impose with EU until June 9th.This move stopped the situation to get worsened. However, despite that, bears took it down to $105K, and recently it is taking 20-day EMA support. When the pause was announced, it seemed like the positivity and bullish narratives would quickly return to the table from crypto traders, and it would take out the $112K resistance, but the bulls’ strength felt short to flip $112K.. Now, in the past couple of days, its price action is withdrawing back from its all-time high level, and it seems like it is on the verge of falling to the 50-day EMA band in the short term, around $ 100 K. Also, the Market sentiment has shifted from optimistic to pessimistic. The BTC long/short ratio currently stands at 0.9501, which has declined from 1.0288, indicating that bulls have weakened. This shows that bullish forces have halted the momentum in the short term, and bears are not on the sidelines anymore; they are kicking in to push the price lower. However, if a situation changes in the short term and bearishness wanes, then the newly formed all-time high must be taken out. If it does, then it will enter price discovery mode. In that condition, BTC could target a near-term target of $120,000, with the potential for even higher levels in the coming months. However, if bulls fail toreignite momentum then a pullback to $100,000 or lower, could be likely. Supporting this cautious view, on-chain data reveals that a substantial amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 1 to 2 years, 180-days to 1year, and 90-days to 180 days has recently become active. This kind of movement is often interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting that short-term holders below 2 years might be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

As interest builds up around Solana’s performance, newer alternative coins like Mutuum Finance are also entering into the fray among investors on the lookout for the next huge crypto. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built not to fall to the collapse risk of its algorithmic counterparts. This transparent and secure architecture, supported by open-source smart contracts and now formally attested through the completion of a Certik audit, guarantees healthy financial transactions. With the intersection of next-generation lending technology and robust infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is reshaping the future of decentralized finance. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.5 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,400 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with a preset price of $0.06, profits will be 100%. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. Solana may be eyeing $1,000, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight with a potential 8000% ROI. With over $9.5 million raised, 11,400+ investors, and a current presale price of $0.03 ahead of a $0.06 launch, early buyers could multiply their money fast. Backed by a Certik audit, stablecoin launch, and strong DeFi utility, MUTM is one of the top cryptos to watch now. Don’t miss out—join the presale.

While crypto enthusiasts often focus on blockchain developments and digital asset news, macroeconomic factors, like the progress of a significant trade agreement , play a crucial role in shaping the overall economic outlook and influencing investor sentiment. A recent statement from the White House has brought this into sharp focus. White House Confidence in a Swift Trade Agreement According to a report from Jin10, White House National Economic Council (NEC) Director Kevin Hassett has expressed optimism regarding the timeline for reaching a significant trade agreement . Director Hassett indicated that he anticipates a deal could be finalized within the next one to two weeks. This projection, coming directly from a senior economic advisor within the White House , signals a potential breakthrough in ongoing negotiations and could have substantial implications for the global economy . For market participants, including those in the crypto realm, such pronouncements are carefully watched. They offer insights into potential shifts in global economic policy and stability, factors that indirectly but significantly affect the flow of capital and risk appetite across various asset classes. Understanding the Significance of a Global Trade Agreement Why does news about a trade agreement matter so much, especially for those interested in digital assets? Trade deals between major economic blocs or nations are not merely about tariffs and quotas; they are foundational pillars of the global economy . Here’s why they hold such weight: Economic Stability: Agreements reduce uncertainty for businesses involved in international trade, encouraging investment and long-term planning. Growth Potential: By opening markets and streamlining processes, trade deals can stimulate economic growth for participating nations. Supply Chain Resilience: Well-structured agreements can help diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on single points of failure. Currency Dynamics: Trade balances and capital flows influenced by agreements can impact currency valuations, which in turn affect international investment and asset prices. A positive resolution to trade discussions, as hinted by the White House , is generally perceived as a boost to the economic outlook , potentially leading to increased investor confidence and liquidity in global markets. Potential Market Impact: What Could Happen? The anticipation of a finalized trade agreement within a specific, short timeframe can trigger various reactions across financial markets. The market impact is multifaceted: Stock Markets: Typically, progress or resolution in trade disputes is viewed positively by stock markets, particularly for companies with significant international exposure. Reduced uncertainty can lead to rallies. Commodities: Prices of key commodities, especially those heavily traded between the involved parties, can react significantly. Agricultural products and industrial metals are often sensitive. Currencies: The currencies of the nations involved may strengthen if the agreement is seen as economically beneficial and stabilizing. Bond Yields: Increased optimism about the economy can sometimes lead to a rise in bond yields as investors shift towards riskier assets. For the crypto market, the connection is often indirect but noticeable. Positive macroeconomic news, like a beneficial trade agreement , can contribute to a broader ‘risk-on’ sentiment, where investors feel more comfortable allocating capital to assets perceived as higher risk, like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, unexpected hurdles or negative outcomes could fuel ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially leading to sell-offs in volatile assets. The overall economic outlook heavily influences this sentiment. Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to a Trade Agreement While the White House Director’s comments suggest optimism, the path to a final trade agreement is rarely without its challenges. Complex negotiations involve numerous details, potential sticking points, and domestic political considerations for all parties involved. Key challenges often include: Specific terms on tariffs and market access. Intellectual property rights and technology transfer. Enforcement mechanisms for the agreement. Addressing existing trade imbalances. Despite these potential hurdles, the opportunity presented by a successful agreement is substantial. A finalized deal could unlock new markets, reduce costs for consumers and businesses, and foster greater international cooperation, all of which contribute to a healthier global economy and potentially, a more robust environment for investment across all asset classes, influencing the overall market impact positively. Navigating the Economic Outlook: Actionable Insights Given the potential for a trade agreement within the coming weeks, what should market watchers, including crypto investors, consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official announcements from the White House and other negotiating parties. Details matter. Assess Broader Market Sentiment: Observe how traditional markets (stocks, bonds, commodities) react to trade news. This often provides clues about overall risk appetite. Understand Correlation: Recognize that while crypto has its unique drivers, it is not immune to macroeconomic forces and the prevailing economic outlook . Evaluate Your Portfolio: Consider how your investment strategy might be affected by potential shifts in the global economy and market impact from trade developments. The next one to two weeks could be pivotal, not just for international trade relations, but for understanding the potential shifts in the global financial landscape and their subsequent market impact . Conclusion The statement from the White House National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett, suggesting a trade agreement could be reached in 1-2 weeks, introduces a notable element of optimism into the current economic outlook . While the specifics of the potential deal remain under wraps, the prospect of resolving significant trade tensions carries the potential for positive market impact across the board, bolstering confidence in the global economy . For participants in the cryptocurrency market, understanding these broader macroeconomic signals is key to navigating the interconnected world of finance and making informed decisions.

An emotional Ross thanked the Bitcoin community for its continuous support. On 29 May 2015, a federal judge had sent Ross to serve a double-life sentence plus 40 years in prison without the possiblity of parole. Silk Road founder reflected on his time in prison saying, “there were days when I thought I would die in that awful cage,” but he fought to find joy even in the darkest time. Addressing the attendees, Ross said that the idea he risked his life and lost freedom for, grew into a movement. A movement so big that a decade later it came back around to free him, he added. “There is still more freedom to be won” Ross revealed that after he appeared at Bitcoin conference in 2021 through a phone call from prison, he was thrown into solitary confinement and put under heavy surveillance. But he said it was worth it and it made him feel like that for a moment he broke through the prison. “Today is the mirror image of that,” he noted. Talking about winning back his freedom, he said, “winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful.” Ross declared from the stage that we’re not there yet, there is still more freedom to be won and there’s still more work to be done. “Freedom is worth the struggle,” he added. Ross is catching up with latest technology Ross Ulbricht is still catching up with the technology after coming out of a “time capsule.” He noted: “I effectively went into a time capsule in 2013 and now I’m coming out like Rip Van Winkle. I mean, just a few months ago when I walked out of prison, I’d never seen a drone. I had never experienced VR or chatted with AI.” Talking about the developments in the crypto industry since he went to prison, Ross said, when he launched Silk Road there was just one exchange you could buy bitcoin on. “Now, it seems like every app I download has a built-in wallet with one-click buying options.” He added that There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right. “There’s DeFi and Web 3 and now there’s AI to help me navigate it all. It’s nuts.” In a heartfelt video montage that played before he took the stage, scenes of Ulbricht adjusting to life beyond prison filled the screen. He was seen walking on the beach, learning to surf, sharing quiet moments with his wife and enjoying the newfound freedom. “Freedom, decentralization and unity” Ross concluded his speech by reminding the bitcoin community about the three core principles that they should stick by to grow further – freedom, decentralization and unity. Recalling his time in prison, Ross said that guards and administration like when prisoners are divided, that way it’s easier to rule them. But when the prisoners were united, the administration listened, he added. “When we all went on hunger strike together, they showed up and listened.” Ross urged the crypto community to not see each other as enemies. “So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united, we can have each other’s backs, just like you had mine, freedom, decentralization, unity. Stay true to these principles and the future is ours.” The post Ross Ulbricht Gets Hero’s Welcome at Bitcoin 2025, Says ‘Fight for Freedom isn’t Over’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Ross Ulbricht,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-30 07:30:47

Morgan, has drawn attention to the banking giant’s historical recognition of Ripple as a potential disruptor in the field of global cross-border payments. The tweet, accompanied by two slides bearing J.P. Morgan’s branding and content, emphasizes Ripple’s capabilities in transforming traditional banking operations through blockchain-based processing. The material cited comes from a J.P. Morgan research document discussing banks’ involvement in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. It outlines key areas where blockchain is expected to have a transformative impact, including payments, clearing, settlement, and compliance processes such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). A specific focus is given to Ripple as an example of a blockchain solution with the potential to “disrupt cross-border payments processing across the industry globally.” Remember, JPM knows. “Ripple has the potential to disrupt cross border payments processing across the industry globally.” *just reading up on Mr. Morgan today and a few documents came to mind. pic.twitter.com/vFqaq467Sm — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 27, 2025 Ripple Positioned as a Notable Blockchain Use Case The first image from the shared documentation elaborates on the various transformational areas enabled by blockchain, with a visual reference listing cross-border payments, KYC/AML synergies, trade finance, and syndicated lending among others. Ripple is mentioned by name in the context of blockchain-based payment systems that aim to reduce the time needed for cross-border transfers from days to seconds, at lower costs. The analysis notes that although banks have traditionally shown limited involvement with direct cryptocurrency trading due to regulatory concerns, they continue to explore blockchain’s broader application in infrastructure and enterprise-level systems. Ripple is highlighted as a blockchain initiative capable of reshaping the processing of international payments by addressing legacy inefficiencies. Interoperability and Infrastructure Integration The second slide included in the tweet presents Ripple as a representative example of blockchain-based crypto-processing. It illustrates a network involving cloud-based ledger technology connecting financial institutions across different regions. The diagram emphasizes Ripple’s function in enabling the international movement of funds while utilizing existing financial infrastructure. The process illustrated involves a sender, a receiving financial institution, and a market maker that facilitates currency exchange and payment finality. According to the slide, the value proposition lies in secure, inexpensive, and fast fund transfers in any currency, positioning Ripple as an interoperability layer for the fragmented global financial ecosystem. It outlines the basic flow of payment and currency conversion managed through Ripple’s system, showcasing the model as an alternative to conventional banking structures.

Morgan’s Recognition of Emerging Fintech Models SMQKE’s tweet underscores the fact that major institutions such as J.P. Morgan have long been aware of the potential for blockchain projects such as Ripple to impact traditional finance. The referenced material reflects an assessment that blockchain platforms, especially those focused on payments, could lead to significant cost reductions and operational efficiencies for banks. J.P. Morgan’s document specifically mentions cost-saving projections derived from blockchain adoption, including reductions in reporting, onboarding, and business operation costs. Furthermore, it highlights that regulatory encouragement, particularly from central banks and financial oversight bodies, could accelerate this transition and further validate the integration of distributed ledger technologies. As crypto researcher SMQKE notes, this documentation provides a clear indication that Ripple’s role has not gone unnoticed within leading financial entities, and that it is considered among viable blockchain solutions capable of reshaping global financial processes.

Announced on Thursday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, the investment vehicle will offer uncapped BTC exposure with “downside protection” tied to gold. Per an official release , the fund is set to run for 5 years and aims to provide uncapped upside participation in Bitcoin. The fund will offer 1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold. Fund Would Address Investors’ Fears Over Bitcoin’s Sudden Price Drops At Cantor, we are focused on delivering innovative products that support clients seeking exposure to digital asset investments,” said Brandon G. Lutnick, Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald. He called it a “ground breaking investment vehicle” that helps investors tap into Bitcoin’s potential growth with downside protection based on the price of gold. Speaking at the conference, Lutnick addressed investors, noting that the fund Balances Bitcoin’s volatility with the precious metal’s stability. “There are still people on the earth that are scared of Bitcoin, and we want to bring them into this ecosystem,” he said. The fund will be available to investors in the coming weeks, the company added.

Following a string of corporate implosions in 2022, including Celsius and BlockFi, there has been a surge in crypto-backed lending. For instance, in March, Bitcoin software firm Blockstream Corp. secured a multi-billion dollar investment in its crypto lending funds. David Mercer, chief executive of the institutional trading platform LMAX Group, told Bloomberg that the new lenders will be “much more institutional in nature.” “More banks will enter the space and provide credit mechanisms to some of the largest institutions you can imagine to trade these assets.” The post Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management to Launch Gold-Hedged Bitcoin Fund appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Gold,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-30 07:39:52

Ethereum (ETH) This week, the broad market entered into a pullback, and Ethereum also closed with a 2% loss. This is nothing to be concerned about as long as ETH stays above $2,400, which is a key support. At the time of this post, the price was hovering around $2,650. While the momentum on higher timeframes remains bullish, the current price action shows a loss of strength for buyers, who were unable to push the asset to the key resistance at $2,800. Hopefully, this happens once the ongoing pullback is over. Looking ahead, the second-largest cryptocurrency can make new highs as soon as it breaks the resistance at $2,800. That will open the way for a price above $3,000 next. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) XRP appears to be returning towards $2 after closing the week with a 9% loss. This fall comes after the price failed to break the $2.6 resistance earlier this month. Since then, sellers have dominated the price action. On May 20th, the daily MACD also did a bearish cross, which hinted at this correction to come. At this time, the price is bouncing on the $2.2 level, but if buyers don’t return anytime soon, sellers are likely to take the asset to $2. Looking ahead, XRP is still stuck in the $2 to $2.6 range and is bouncing between these two key levels. Until a clear breakout happens, it is unlikely to see a major move from this cryptocurrency. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA did not manage to test the resistance at $0.9 since sellers came early to reverse the price action at $0.85. Since then, this cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend and closed the week with a 14% loss, the biggest on our list. Even if Cardano remains bearish, it has strong support at $0.7 and $0.64, where buyers returned in the past. Since the price is now testing the $0.7 support, a bounce here appears likely. Looking ahead, ADA failed to make a higher high in the past two months. This is concerning because it may be an early sign of weakness and a possible continuation of the downtrend that started back in December 2024. A loss of the $0.64 support would confirm this. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana was sharply rejected by the resistance at $186, and the price entered a pullback, which saw it lose 9% of its valuation this week. Sellers can continue to maintain the pressure, considering that the most important support is found at $152, and there is quite some distance left until there. The volume is also in decline since January, with no sign of a reversal. This supports a bearish bias despite the recent rally since April. Moreover, if SOL fails to break the resistance at $186 later on, then this could be interpreted as a lower high in a major downtrend. Looking ahead, Solana may stay bearish in the coming days. This can change if the support at $152 stops sellers and reverses the downtrend. This level is critical for where Solana will go next this year. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) HYPE appears to have topped at $40, at least for the time being. This comes after an impressive rally that saw the price increase by 330% since its bottom at $9.5 back in early April. However, sellers are dominating at this time, and they managed to push HYPE down by 8% this week. This corrective move was expected after such a rally and may last for quite a while before buyers will return. Key support levels are found at $30 and $27. For this reason, best to be patient and let this downtrend find a bottom before considering an entry. Looking ahead, HYPE remains a very strong contender in the altcoins space as one of the few tokens to make a new all-time high this year. As soon as this correction is over, buyers could return in force towards new highs.

This puts an end to one of its most high-profile enforcement actions in the crypto space. Joint Dismissal Motion “Huge win for crypto today. The SEC’s case against us is dismissed,” Binance revealed in a May 30 X post . The company also thanked SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and President Trump’s team “for pushing back against regulation by enforcement,” adding, “U.S. innovation is back on track – and it’s just the beginning.” The dismissal follows a joint motion filed on May 29 by the SEC, Binance, and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao. The petition, submitted to a federal court in Washington, D.C., requested that the agency’s original complaint be dropped. The regulator stated that dropping the case was appropriate “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter,” and clarified that the decision does not reflect its views on other cryptocurrency-related litigation. The lawsuit was also dissolved with prejudice, meaning it cannot be reopened. This ruling comes after the lawsuit was paused twice earlier this year, in February and April. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, created under Acting Chair Mark T. Uyeda, played a key role in the decision to move forward with the action. The financial watchdog first sued Binance, Zhao, and its U.S.-based arm in June 2023. The lawsuit accused them of violating securities laws by offering unregistered securities to U.S. investors, mishandling customer funds, and misleading investors. The agency also claimed the exchange had failed to put in place proper financial controls. It was the last major regulator still pursuing Binance after a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. government last year, in which Zhao pleaded guilty and stepped down as CEO. A Changed Approach The SEC has been reversing its approach to crypto regulation under President Donald Trump’s second administration. The development is the latest in a string of enforcement actions that the agency has since dropped. In earlier months, it abandoned or settled complaints against Coinbase, Ripple , and Kraken. Additionally, the agency closed its investigations into Robinhood Crypto, Uniswap Labs , and OpenSea. Paul Atkins has since taken over as SEC Chairman, bringing a pro-crypto stance and a commitment to create a framework for digital assets.

Burwick Law has requested the freeze of LIBRA assets in wallets linked to Hayden Davis. The law firm, one of the main drivers of class-action lawsuits for meme tokens, has requested the additional freezing of LIBRA tokens in wallets linked to the initial team and influencers. The New York Southern District Court has granted an order to limit the trading or transfers of assets from LIBRA team wallets. The main problem with LIBRA is that even defunct tokens can be active on-chain. LIBRA is entirely permissionless and even continues to trade with vestigial volumes on several exchanges. However, the volumes are not enough to absorb any of the holdings without tanking the price. LIBRA never recovered, but retail investors seek the proceeds from the initial team sale in the first hours after the launch. | Source: CoinGecko In the case of LIBRA, the token led to over $250M in user losses, and never recovered from its initial crash. Unlike other meme tokens, LIBRA has lost all confidence, and traders are not touching it even for an irrational pump. The low volumes mean even the team and initial investors are technically incapable of shedding their assets, unlike other more liquid memes. Additionally, the wallets of Kelsier Ventures have mostly divested their LIBRA, instead holding SOL and USDC, as well as other assets that cannot be frozen. The request arrives just a day after Circle froze $57M in USDC tokens, making them unmovable on-chain. Further requests have been sent to freeze any remaining USDC in the team and influencer wallets linked to early LIBRA traders. The requests by Burwick Law also targeted the same USDC wallets which also received a request from an Argentinian court. In that case, Circle was directly contacted and performed the freezing transaction. Circle can then re-issue the USDC, to be used in trader compensation. The Libra Team 1 wallet was one of the affected wallets with a freeze of 13.06M USDC. LIBRA has a total of 24,519 holders as of May 2025, though most of the tokens are still concentrated in team wallets. Burwick Law aims to block LIBRA by court order The request by Burwick Law does not involve any on-chain actions. Instead, the firm has obtained a court order against the usage of crypto held in the wallets of the LIBRA team and associates. In the case of Hurlock v. Kelsier Ventures et al, Burwick Law obtained a Temporary Restraining Order. For now, it remains uncertain how this order can be implemented on-chain, as the movement of Solana assets is still unrestrained. The restraining order affects any remaining LIBRA in the team’s wallets, as well as the identified $110M in proceeds, which Burwick Law links to other wallets belonging to Hayden Davis’s Kelsier Ventures. The court order to ban further transactions is one of the first attempts at recovery for the victims of the meme token. The high profile of LIBRA and its connections to Argentina’s President Javier Milei meant the asset was treated as more than just another meme. LIBRA launched during the peak craze for celebrity and official tokens, managing to bring in up to $250M in investments, before erasing over 90% of its value in minutes.

The conference, filled with optimism and new ideas, has set a hopeful tone. But now, with more than $11 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiring today, traders are worried that this will lead to massive volatility ahead. $9.8B Bitcoin Options Expiry Today According to data from Deribit , a leading crypto derivatives platform, around 92,459 Bitcoin contracts will expire today. These contracts are worth nearly $9.8 billion, a significant jump from last week’s figures. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $105,982, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The maximum pain price, the level where most options lose money, is $100,000. Although this is below the current price, analysts think Bitcoin won’t drop all the way to that level. Traders have set a put-to-call ratio of 0.89, showing more bets on price gains. $1.6 Billion Ethereum Options Expiry Ethereum is also seeing a big expiry day, with 623,949 contracts worth about $1.6 billion set to expire today, again according to Deribit data. Ethereum’s price is currently at $2,600, down about 4% in the past 24 hours. Its maximum pain price is $2,300, while the put-to-call ratio of 0.81 suggests that traders still believe prices could go higher. How the Crypto Market Could React Today This week’s Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry is much bigger, covering the whole month. Historically, big monthly expiries like this can lead to short-term volatility, as traders adjust their positions or hedge against sudden price swings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traders seem split, as some hope for a price rise, while others are cautious and ready to protect themselves. On the other hand Ethereum’s market looks balanced, with chances to grow but also some caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Some analysts suggest that ETH’s rally could target its Macro Range high area in the coming weeks. Ethereum Resembles 2024 Setup After struggling to break past the $2,600 mark, Ethereum has reclaimed this level as support. Over the past two days, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has held this key level while attempting to break above the $2,700 mark. Since recovering from its sub-$2,000 dip earlier this month, ETH hovered between $2,400 and $2,600, failing to reclaim the range’s upper zone despite its $2,738 multi-month high on May 10. Nonetheless, this week’s rally has seen the cryptocurrency rise above its local range and attempt to gain more strength to stop its sideways trajectory and continue its 50% recovery rally. Analyst Titan of Crypto noted that ETH just broke out of a two-week bullish flag, leading to today’s surge to the $2,788 level. He suggested that if the breakout is confirmed, the pattern’s target sits around the $3,800 level. Crypto Jelle pointed out that Ethereum is “still moving as planned, pushing deeper into the resistance area” around the $2,850 mark. Several analysts have named this level as the resistance before the $3,000 mark, and the wall “standing in the way of altseason.” Rekt Capital highlighted that Ethereum has been successfully retesting a crucial horizontal level since re-entering its $2,220-$3,900 Macro Range. Notably, Ethereum has been closing above the $2,468 mark for the past four weeks, setting up the stage for a “lift across the range.” With this successful retest, the King of Altcoins is “repeating early 2024 history.” Notably, ETH recorded a 50% four-week breakout after smashing the $2,486 resistance and retesting it as support. However, “the only difference is that it has just taken longer this time,” the analyst added. ETH Gains Momentum Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows considers that ETH is showing strength as its trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC) gains momentum and BTC dominance motion seemingly fades. The analyst also noted the ETH’s Weekly MACD bullish cross and reclaim of its multi-year support trendline. Based on this, he forecasted that Ethereum could soon soar to the $4,000 resistance. It’s worth noting that Ethereum is outperforming the flagship cryptocurrency this quarter for the first time since 2022, registering a 45% increase since April 1. Additionally, ETH continues to hold above its key level despite BTC’s dip below the $106,800 support.

Merlijn The Trader highlighted ETH’s price action after its golden cross, which appears to resemble its performance from the last time the setup occurred. According to the post, during the November 2024 setup, Ethereum saw a small dip before a “massive pump” on the eleventh day. “This time? Pump already started.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Arthur Hayes predicted that Ethereum could reach $5,000 this year. Hayes argued that Ethereum could potentially reach a new all-time high despite its recent underperformance compared to rival cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana (SOL). The celebrity said that ETH is currently the most hated layer-1 blockchain and that historically the most disliked assets tend to provide the best returns when market cycles turn. According to Hayes, this suggests that ETH could double and outperform. “I think ETH could go to $4,000 or $5,000 this year. “I think ETH is the most hated tier-1 asset right now. And usually at some point in the cycle you want to be in the most hated asset, so I think ETH could outperform.” Apart from Hayes, Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets at Standard Chartered, also stated that he has an bullish expectation for Etheruem and shared that he has a price target of $4,000 for 2025 and $7,500 for 2029. As a result, a jump to $4,000, which is seen as the common denominator and lower bound of Kendrick and Hayes’ price prediction range, would represent a jump of approximately 50% from ETH’s current price of $2,640. *This is not investment advice.

In 2023, that moment belonged to Official Trump. Those who entered early watched in disbelief as the token rocketed past $75, multiplying investments. Now, with many looking back and regretting their hesitation, a new meme coin is emerging with a similar, and potentially bigger trajectory: Punisher Coin ($PUN). With more than $30,000 secured in its first hour, a projected $0.045 listing price, and built-in staking plus referral incentives, Punisher Coin is quickly gaining traction as the next breakout meme coin for traders chasing high-upside opportunities. Punisher Coin Launches With a Mission, And $50K Raised Instantly Unlike its predecessors, Punisher Coin isn’t relying solely on meme power, it’s backed by a tactical roadmap. In just the first stage of its presale, it pulled in over $50,000 within stage 1. This kind of early support sends a clear message: the community is tuned in and ready to rally. That’s exactly what makes it one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy right now. The presale operates in tightly controlled phases. With a total token supply of 2 billion and a deflationary burn model, every unsold allocation is permanently removed from circulation. The price is set to climb in each phase, encouraging early entries while maintaining scarcity. These aren’t just coins to hold and hope. Punisher Coin’s presale is structured to build utility, not just hype, making it a smarter entry point for those who missed their shot with Official Trump. Official Trump: From Punchline to Power Player The early days of Official Trump were filled with skepticism. With its bombastic branding and unapologetic meme politics, few believed it would gain traction beyond a core community. Yet, as social media engagement exploded and speculative energy took hold, Official Trump began climbing. Initial supporters who held firm through the noise found themselves sitting on extraordinary gains. From sub-cent pricing to highs exceeding $0.075, the token proved that viral culture, when paired with aggressive marketing, could yield life-changing returns. But not everyone was lucky enough to catch it in time. And for those still hoping for the next big break, Punisher Coin is now under the spotlight. Punisher Energy: The War Tactic Turning Heads What separates Punisher Coin from the typical meme playbook is its Punisher Energy system, a daring mechanic that encourages holders of struggling meme tokens to abandon ship and join the Punisher movement. When converted, those users receive bonus $PUN tokens, while simultaneously draining liquidity from less effective tokens. It’s bold. It’s aggressive. And it’s working. Add to that a community engagement engine powered by real-money missions, where users earn $PUN or USDT for participation. Combine that with a referral system paying 5% in ETH and 10% bonus tokens to referred buyers, and the entire ecosystem begins to look more like a military campaign than a meme coin drop. This battle-ready strategy is a major reason why Punisher Coin is rapidly being seen as one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy before the next wave begins. Conclusion Not everyone bought Official Trump before it made headlines, and many still wish they had. But the next opportunity is already live. Punisher Coin is rewriting the meme coin narrative with its unique mission model, community-first perks, and lightning-fast presale growth. With $50K raised in hours and a system built for strategic expansion, the window to act is narrowing. For anyone serious about catching the next breakout, Punisher Coin is one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy, before its chart starts to look like another missed opportunity.

Having already taken a pro-crypto stance, Vance believes the U.S. stands to leap big if it moves with haste in this sector. He noted, “The People's Republic of China doesn't like Bitcoin. Well, we should be asking ourselves, why is that? Why is our biggest adversary such an opponent of bitcoin, and if the communist Republic of China is leaning away from Bitcoin, then maybe the United States ought to be leaning into Bitcoin.” Having risen to presidency on the crypto wave, Donald Trump has steadfastly aired his commitment to promote growth in the crypto industry by enhancing adopting and easing regulations. For instance, Senator Cynthia Lummis announced at the same conference that President Trump was in high gear to support the BITCOIN Act, which could see the U.S. government purchase one million Bitcoin. Bitcoin Being Part of the Mainstream Economy Already a crypto investor with Bitcoin worth between $250,000 and $500,000 , Vance believes that the apex cryptocurrency should be entrenched in the mainstream economy. While addressing the crowd at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, he acknowledged that crypto is here to stay and they should be seen as a hedge against bad governance and policy making. He added, “It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.” Vance also touched on the significance of the stablecoin market, highlighting that the Trump administration does not perceive it as a threat to the U.S. dollar, but sees it as an economic force multiplier. In this case, he urged Congress to roll their sleeves and okay the GENIUS Act , which could clear the air about stablecoins’ regulatory framework Why the U.S. Wants to Take the National Bitcoin Reserve Route Establishing a national Bitcoin reserve would not only safeguard U.S. financial sovereignty but also position the country at the forefront of the digital monetary era. First and foremost, Bitcoin is emerging as a globally recognized store of value. Much like gold, Bitcoin is scarce—capped at 21 million coins—making it resistant to inflationary pressures that plague fiat currencies. In a world where central banks are printing unprecedented amounts of money, holding Bitcoin can act as a hedge against devaluation of the U.S. dollar, especially in times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical tension. Second, Bitcoin can serve as a geopolitical tool. Nations like El Salvador and institutions around the world are already integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. If adversarial or competing countries were to accumulate substantial Bitcoin reserves first, they could gain significant leverage in global financial negotiations. A U.S. Bitcoin reserve would mitigate this risk and strengthen the country’s economic position in an increasingly multipolar financial system. Furthermore, Bitcoin promotes financial transparency and decentralization. Unlike traditional reserves such as gold or foreign currency, Bitcoin holdings can be publicly audited on the blockchain. This transparency could increase public trust in national monetary policy and help reduce inefficiencies and corruption. Economically, investing in Bitcoin has the potential for long-term capital appreciation. Early adoption could yield significant returns, helping to offset national debt or fund future technological innovation. It would also signal the U.S.’s commitment to supporting Web3 innovation and digital financial infrastructure, encouraging startups, attracting talent, and reinforcing the country’s leadership in technology. Finally, a national Bitcoin reserve would act as a strategic insurance policy against the decline of traditional fiat systems. As trust in legacy institutions erodes, the ability to pivot to decentralized monetary alternatives could become crucial for national resilience. In short, a national Bitcoin reserve is not merely a financial decision—it’s a strategic imperative. It ensures the U.S. remains adaptive, secure, and competitive in the digital age. Delay could mean ceding economic leadership to nations better prepared for a decentralized financial future.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 08:08:03

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $105,804 (-2%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $108,910.55 24-hour low $104,684.72 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $110,019 Price Prediction $119,922 (+8.01%) Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility (30-day variation) 5.04% Green Days 17/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $93,698 200-Day SMA $86,424 14-Day RSI 77.24 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a rejection around $109K and triggered a decline. Resistance for BTC is at $108,944 Support for BTC/USD is at $104,718 The BTC price analysis for 30 May confirms that BTC faces a surge in bearish volatility as the price rejected the $109K level. As a result, sellers pushed the price toward immediate support channels below $106K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price hovers below $106K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a surge toward $109K. However, sellers strongly defended further surges, resulting in a bearish correction below Fib channels toward $105K. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.3 billion, showing a rise in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $105,804, declining by over 2% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows bearish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades above the midline at 54, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buyers strongly defend $105K support The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the $105K level. However, buyers strongly defended the decline below $105K, holding the price around EMA20 trend line. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.42, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $108,944, it will fuel a bullish rally to $112,255. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $104,718, beginning a bearish trend to $102,183. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure after the price peaked at $109K. This triggered short-term holders to exit their positions, resulting in the recent decline. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063.

Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

Dark Defender has previously predicted a move to $18.22 , adding credence to his confidence in the asset’s potential. This projection aligns with the wave patterns previously outlined by the analyst. Hi there. #XRP is forming another Wave Structure in the weekly frame, creating the upcoming surge to $23. This new wave structure aligns with our previous targets and our historical pattern in November 2024.

The asset recently completed wave 1 and is consolidating in the second wave. The chart shows that the third wave, which is often the largest, could hit double-digits with a highlighted mid-level target zone between $5.85 and $6.39. The analyst points out that the 261.8% Fibonacci extension level corresponds closely with this zone, reinforcing its importance as a technical milestone. Historical Pattern Reappears The technical setup references a pattern that previously emerged in November 2024. Shortly after Donald Trump’s election victory and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement , XRP began a remarkable surge, climbing over 500% to a multi-year peak of $3.39. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts have consistently drawn parallels to the November breakout , as XRP appears to be mirroring crucial technical patterns from that period. Dark Defender’s chart highlights a long-term weekly resistance line, which XRP has remained below for weeks. His analysis suggests that a breakout above a similar resistance trendline contributed to this price surge, and the chart shows that wave three will break above the current trendline. Long-term XRP Targets Looking forward, Dark Defender expects the asset’s journey to culminate in a target range between $18.22 and $23.20, close to the 361.8% Fibonacci extension level. The Elliott Wave pattern shows a correction in wave 4, but the chart suggests that the asset will remain above $6.39 before resuming its bullish journey and reaching the ultimate target range. XRP is currently trading at $2.26, up 0.51% from yesterday. Analysts believe that the digital asset has spent enough time consolidating , and while Dark Defender did not provide a specific timeline for this price surge, the asset is very close to the resistance level, and the breakout to kickstart wave 3 could occur anytime from now.

45280119,https://coinpaper.com/9375/cme-data-shows-nearly-half-of-xrp-futures-volume-happens-offshore,1748593089,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,CME Data Shows Nearly Half of XRP Futures Volume Happens Offshore,https://coinpaper.com/9375/cme-data-shows-nearly-half-of-xrp-futures-volume-happens-offshore,"With almost half of CME’s XRP futures trading happening outside U.S. hours, the XRP Army continues to make its global footprint. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has unveiled that 46% of its regulated XRP futures volume was recorded after U.S. trading hours, highlighting the magnitude of global participation. XRP Community Cuts Across the Globe Per CME data, its XRP futures trading volume hit 4,032 contracts, with the transaction amount skyrocketing to $86.6 million in the first 6 days of inception, showcasing XRP’s international appeal. The CME’s standard and micro XRP futures contracts—sized at 50,000 XRP and 2,500 XRP, respectively—are cash-settled and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which tracks the cryptocurrency’s price daily at 4:00 p.m. London time. XRP futures trading is a form of derivatives trading that enables participants to speculate the predetermined price of XRP at a specific time without actually owning this altcoin. Traders usually enter into contracts where they predict whether the price of XRP will go down or up, and in the process, they are not required to sell or buy real XRP tokens. Therefore, the high demand for CME’s XRP futures trading, shows that the XRP Army is not only found on American soil, but also in the whole world. With the XRP community’s strength being felt on the global stage, its fierce activism and loyalty cannot be ignored. This is because it acts like a grassroots movement that pushes for XRP adoption, legal awareness, and financial literacy. As a forward-thinking crypto movement, the XRP Army offers a mix of power, purpose, and passion. For instance, Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s cryptic tweet about a ”10x times” increase late last year sparked speculation within the XRP community about the token's future price potential. XRP Futures Trading Sees Surge as Investor Interest Rises XRP futures trading has experienced a significant surge in recent weeks, signaling renewed investor confidence and growing market interest in the digital asset. With open interest jumping to $4.67 billion across major exchanges, XRP is proving to be more than just a utility token — it's becoming a speculative powerhouse. This spike in futures trading activity is driven by several key factors. Firstly, positive sentiment around Ripple’s ongoing legal clarity in the U.S. has played a major role. As the lawsuit with the SEC edges closer to resolution, traders are positioning themselves in anticipation of a favorable outcome. This optimism is reflected in increased leverage and open interest, particularly on platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX. Additionally, XRP's role in cross-border payments continues to fuel long-term demand. Institutions and retail investors alike are recognizing its utility in the financial ecosystem, which is strengthening bullish momentum. Technical traders are also responding to XRP’s recent price movements and volatility, which present prime opportunities for profit through derivatives. Analysts note that this uptick in futures trading is not merely speculative hype but a signal of XRP’s growing maturity as an asset class. The combination of real-world use cases, regulatory optimism, and heightened trading volumes has created a compelling environment for both short-term traders and long-term holders. As the broader crypto market eyes a potential bull run, XRP futures may serve as a leading indicator of investor sentiment. If current trends persist, XRP will continue to be among the top-four cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization, with this altcoin occasionally dethroning Tether (USDT) from the third position. In a landscape where volatility often equals opportunity, XRP futures are drawing both cautious and aggressive traders, each betting on the token’s next breakout moment. CME Continues to Set the Crypto Ball Rolling CME is playing a significant role in enhancing crypto adoption by providing a trusted and regulated platform for institutional investors to access cryptocurrency markets. By enabling institutional capital inflow and providing secure crypto investment tools, CME is bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional finance. For instance, following Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) approval, CME hit a record trading volume of $94.9 billion in January 2024, representing a remarkable 35% increase. Having kicked off XRP futures trading, CME is encouraging institutional investment through an expansive global outreach.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-30 08:18:09

Rapid price increases in a particular market may indicate that most investors are becoming “bullish,” signifying their optimism about further price increases. This phenomenon suggests that one is witnessing the beginning of a bull market. Investing in the best altcoins can yield significant rewards, as they offer opportunities for diversification and potentially higher returns. However, it is imperative to approach the altcoin landscape cautiously and conduct thorough research. Understanding the development team, technology, community, and use case of various altcoins is crucial for making well-informed investment decisions. Moreover, staying updated on market trends and regulatory changes is essential for effectively navigating the constantly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. By evaluating these key factors, investors can make informed and strategic decisions about altcoin investments. Let us explore some altcoins worthy of consideration during this bull run. COIN Market Capitalization Current Price Ethereum (ETH) $318.8 billion $2640 Ripple (XRP) $136 billion $2.31 Solana (SOL) $92 billion $176 BDTCOIN (BDTC) $4.9 Billion $137 SUI (SUI) $11.84 Billion $3.54 Which Altcoin To Buy in The Next Crypto Bull Run Ethereum (ETH) Market cap: $318.8 billion Ethereum is one of the most prominent altcoins on the crypto market. Of the nearly $3.45 trillion representing the total market capitalisation of the over 20,000 crypto assets, more than 13% is held in ETH. It is a distributed computing network where users can utilise the blockchain to run dApps and host smart contracts critics of Ethereum point to high transaction fees. However, ETH is here to stay, with thousands of apps and other altcoins powered by its blockchain. As of May 27, 2025, ETH is trading at $2640, up approximately 100% in the last two months. Ripple (XRP) Market cap: $132.14 billion Developed by Ripple Labs in 2012, Ripple (XRP) stands out as a decentralized payment network designed for quick, cost-effective financial transactions. With an open-source protocol, Ripple eliminates reliance on intermediaries, enabling P2P transactions in seconds. The XRP ledger validates transactions through a consensus protocol, offering efficiency without relying on traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms. As of May 27, 2025, it is trading at $2.31 and has increased by 43% over the last two months. Solana (SOL) Market cap: $107.41 billion Solana gained popularity among crypto investors due to its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees. It is a blockchain platform that focuses on overcoming the speed and scalability challenges faced by many existing blockchains. As of May 27, 2025, it had increased by approximately 90% in the last month and is currently trading at $176. The surge in SOL brought the digital asset to its highest point in two years, reaching levels last observed in April 2022, three months after the conclusion of the bull cycle in 2021. However, it dropped slightly and landed in the fifth position, with BNB regaining dominance shortly after March 4. BDTCOIN (BDTC) Market Cap: $4.9 Billion BDTCOIN is one of the most outperformed altcoins in the Crypto Market. BDTCOIN is a gold-backed, real Cryptocurrency. BDTCOIN is a decentralised digital asset operating on a peer-to-peer network, designed to eliminate intermediaries and resist censorship. Its transactions are recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger, ensuring transparency and security. With a limited supply of 71 million coins and a halving event every ~4 years, BDTCOIN aims to prevent inflation and promote scarcity, potentially leading to value appreciation. It utilises advanced cryptographic algorithms, such as SHA-256 and ECDSA, for secure transactions and relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) for network validation. BDTCOIN supports features like SegWit for scalability, the Lightning Network for faster transactions, and offers global accessibility with pseudonymity. It is also divisible into 100 million “jus” for micro-payments and incorporates smart contract functionality for secure agreements. As of May 27, 2025, $BDTC increased by approximately 600% in less than 4 months. BDTC started trading on CEX in February 2025. $BDTC is available to trade on major CEX like Lbank, MEXC, AscenDEX. More exchanges listing is on the way. SUI (SUI) Market Cap: $11.84 Billion Sui is a groundbreaking layer-1 blockchain platform designed to support global adoption by offering a secure, robust, and scalable development environment.

Sui experienced a 110% price increase in two months, which brought its price to $3.54. Factors Contributing to Altcoin Growth Market Demand : Altcoins thrive on market demand. Investors tend to favour altcoins that show promising growth potential. Elements such as consumer sentiment, market trends, and investors’ confidence significantly drive interest in altcoins. Regulatory Policy : Regulatory policies can play a pivotal role in shaping the growth of altcoins. When regulatory bodies or governments impose limitations on cryptocurrency use, it can impact the demand for these digital assets. Technology : The core technology behind an altcoin plays a crucial role in its development and success. Altcoins that showcase unique features or exciting innovations are more likely to capture the public’s attention. Competition : The cryptocurrency market is highly competitive, which can significantly impact the growth of alternative cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. Those offering similar features may struggle to carve out a niche for themselves. Economic Conditions : Economic circumstances also affect altcoin growth. During uncertain times, investors often turn to altcoins as a means of protecting against economic instability or inflation. Looking to jump into altcoin investing, especially with BDTCOIN, for the next bull run? Awesome! It’s a thrilling space, but let’s ensure you’ve a well-thought-out plan. Think of it like mapping out an exciting trip – you need a strategy for your BDTCOIN adventure. Keep Your Cool (No Panic!) The crypto market, especially for altcoins like BDTCOIN, is a wild ride. Don’t let FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) push you to buy high, and don’t panic-sell if BDTCOIN dips. Stick to your plan! Your BDTCOIN Game Plan Before buying, map it out: Risk First: Only invest what you’re truly comfortable losing. Decide how much of that “fun money” specifically goes to BDTCOIN . Use stop-loss orders as your emergency brake if prices drop. Smart Entry: Don’t go all-in at once. Use Rupee-Cost Averaging (RCA) – buy smaller amounts of BDTCOIN over time, especially on dips, to smooth out your entry price. Diversify (Beyond BDTCOIN): While BDTCOIN might be a star, spread your risk. Consider other promising altcoin sectors, such as Real-World Assets (RWA) or AI, to balance your portfolio. Know When to Take Profits It’s tempting to hold forever, but greed can hurt! Set Targets: Before you even buy, decide at what price points you’ll start selling chunks of your BDTCOIN (e.g., 25% at X price, another 25% at Y price). Scale Out: Sell your BDTCOIN in pieces as its price climbs. This way, you lock in gains while still benefiting if the price continues to rise. Balance Your Risk BDTCOIN offers big rewards but can be volatile. Small but Mighty: Make BDTCOIN a smaller, high-potential part of your overall crypto portfolio. Blue-Chip Backup: Establish a solid foundation with “blue-chip” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum for stability. Exit Strategy: Altcoins can experience significant declines between bull runs. Have a clear exit strategy and target prices for BDTCOIN before you invest. Don’t plan to hold it forever without serious research. Research, Research, Research! Don’t buy BDTCOIN just because of hype. Do your homework! Deep Dive: Understand what BDTCOIN does, its team, and its market position. Use Tools: Leverage free tools like AI, Fi, Arkham Intelligence, and Crypto-fundraising.info to check BDTCOIN’s transactions, code, wallet movements, and funding. Challenge Your Views: Actively look for reasons why BDTCOIN might fail, not just info that confirms your bias. Utilise the tools mentioned above to conduct thorough research on a project’s fundamentals, market position, and team. You may also achieve this by performing a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Regularly question your thesis and seek reasons for a project’s failure instead of merely searching for information that confirms your bias.

According to data from CNBC, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 31 points in early morning trading, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.16%, and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.21%. This came after a wave of uncertainty on Thursday when a federal court first blocked and then reinstated the majority of the president’s tariffs, triggering confusion across global trade desks. The legal drama unfolded late Wednesday night when the Court of International Trade decided to freeze most of the current tariffs imposed by the administration. But by Thursday afternoon, that same court reversed course, putting a temporary hold on its own order. Stocks recoil as legal chaos deepens This constant policy flip-flop is throwing both markets and global trade partners into a loop. The S&P 500, which was up nearly 0.9% during early Thursday trading, turned south fast after the Trump administration hinted at a possible appeal. The issue isn’t just whether the tariffs are good or bad, it’s that nobody knows when they’re real. That’s paralyzing for companies trying to plan shipments and for countries negotiating trade deals. Even with the turbulence, stocks have had a solid May. The S&P 500 is still up more than 6% this month, the Nasdaq Composite has jumped 10%, and the Dow has added about 4%. For this week alone, the S&P has risen 2%, the Dow gained 1.4%, and the Nasdaq is up 2.3%. Traders are also watching closely for inflation data. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index for April is expected to show annual inflation at 2.2%, with a monthly increase of 0.1%. The core PCE, which cuts out food and energy, is projected to come in at 2.6% for the year, also rising 0.1% month over month. Crypto drops as investors brace for inflation Crypto markets weren’t spared either. Bitcoin dropped 2.8% and now trades at $105,430. Ether fell 4% to $2,617, XRP dropped 4.4% to $2.19, and Solana (SOL) tumbled 6%, now sitting at $162. The declines come as traders try to make sense of global economic signals that are increasingly impossible to predict. Source: TradingView But interestingly enough, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is currently at 60, which is strongly Greed. Retail investors aren’t feeling good about any of it. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) said bearish sentiment jumped to 41.9% this week, up from 36.7% last week. That’s higher than the long-term average of 31%, and this marks the 26th time in 28 weeks that pessimism has outpaced the norm. On the flip side, bullish sentiment dropped to 32.9%, down from 37.7%, and sits below the historical average of 37.5% for the 16th time in 17 weeks. In a special question, 64% of respondents said that the tariffs, along with the economy and inflation, are the top reasons they expect markets to drop in the next six months. Only 11% pointed to corporate earnings, 10% to valuations, and 9% to monetary policy or interest rates.

This would suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to make its next upside move. Nevertheless, a major hurdle is on the horizon in the form of the weekly Stochastic RSI, posturing a swing back down in the indicators that can potentially bring some future heavy downside price momentum. Caution is required. Keeping it simple in trading In the field of technical analysis there are countless charts and indicators that can point a price in one direction or another, and often, at any particular point in time. Therefore, one strategy that tends to iron out the often perverse market fluctuations over time is that of keeping things very simple. There are a small number of indicators for Bitcoin, that if used over the longer time frames, will generally help to show the main trend that $BTC is following, and give pointers as to when we need to sit up and take notice that a trend break is about to occur. The Stochastic RSI is one of the most reliable indicators in this respect. It is used to measure momentum and identify overbought or oversold conditions. On the higher, weekly time frame, the Stochastic RSI is exhibiting an overbought condition - thus the cause for concern. Before looking at the bigger picture, the shorter time frames are currently looking bullish. They are suggesting that there could be a nice upside surge that could develop into the weekend. Correction from all-time high still taking place Source: TradingView In the 4-hour time frame it can be seen that the correction from last week’s all-time high is still taking place. The bears were able to force the price below the important $106,000 support, and $BTC is now at the $105,000 support level. There is the possibility that the price could drop through here, but it isn’t expected. If it does, the furthest dip to the downside would likely be to the $102,500 horizontal support. What is more likely is that the price will start to bounce from here, and could then gain momentum from all the short time frame Stochastic RSI indicators crossing up from the bottom. The targets would be to break back above $106,000, pierce up through the descending trendline, make a higher high, and then have the possibility of getting back to the all-time high. 3-day chart shows concerns are beginning Source: TradingView The 3-day chart shows that concerns are beginning. The ascending trendline is in the process of being broken, and should the current red candle still be on the wrong side of this trendline by the end of Friday, the breakdown will be confirmed. Having said that, the horizontal supports are very important, and a close above $106,000 would be seen as a victory for the bulls. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame is looking ominous, with the indicator lines shaping to fall back down through the 80.00 level, and by doing so, bringing downside price momentum with them. Weekly Stochastic RSI signals a potential cross-down Source: TradingView As already mentioned, the weekly time frame is potentially the most problematic at this point in time. While it can be seen that the price is starting to roll over, it’s at the bottom of the chart where things are starting to become a little worrying. The Stochastic RSI has the blue indicator clearly angled down, and it is posturing to cross over the red indicator line. However, it’s not all doom and gloom quite yet. If the expected rally does take place into the last part of this week, the indicator lines could just end up flatlining along the top, much as they did in a 3-week period at the end of 2024. That said, they will have to come down at some point, putting an end to the upside price momentum. Is there still time in this bull market cycle for the indicator lines to drop all the way back to the bottom and then come back up for one last hurrah into Q4? Yes there is. Also, the indicator lines could bounce along the top for an extended period of time. The main take away here is that when the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators are at the top it signals caution to long-term traders, whereas when they are at the bottom, buys are signalled.

He shared a post on X outlining the current status of XRP ETF applications awaiting final decisions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The image he shared lists prominent asset managers, their filing dates, SEC decision deadlines, and key notes on each application. This provides a comprehensive overview of the competitive field for XRP-based investment products. $XRP ETFS Waiting SEC Final Decision Bitwise ETP is live, and it holds 109,812,107 XRP in Cold Storage Ill let you do the math when we have 18+ Spot ETFS Live pic.twitter.com/ATXKVPEzO7 — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) May 28, 2025 The Current State of XRP Spot ETFs Several major asset managers, including Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, CoinShares, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton, have submitted filings for spot XRP ETFs. Most filings were acknowledged by the SEC in February 2025, with final decision deadlines set for October 2025. The exchanges involved include Cboe, Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX, reflecting broad institutional interest in launching XRP-based products. Bitwise stands out as the first to file for a spot XRP ETF, having been acknowledged by the SEC in February. Van Winkle also drew attention to Bitwise’s ETP, which is already live, and holds over 109 million XRP in cold storage. Referencing this figure, Van Winkle invited his followers to consider the potential impact once over 18 spot XRP ETFs are live. XRP is an attractive asset to institutions , and the launch of all these products could bring a significant increase in institutional holdings and market activities, potentially sending the asset’s price up. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Demand and Market Outlook The list of applicants and the scale of assets involved indicate growing institutional demand for regulated XRP investment vehicles. The presence of established firms such as Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, alongside newer entrants, points to a competitive race to capture early market share. Several applications also propose innovative structures, such as including XRP among multiple digital assets within broader ETF offerings. 21Shares filed to list its Core XRP Trust shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange in November, and Grayscale followed suit in January, applying to convert its XRP Trust into a spot ETF . Grayscale’s filing has the closest deadline at October 18, and Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and CoinShares have the farthest, at October 25. However, many market participants are convinced that the SEC will approve these products earlier. One commenter argued that the commission has no excuse for delaying approval, and Polymarket recently raised the likelihood of XRP ETF approval to 85% , reflecting the confidence of the community. As the deadlines approach, all eyes are on the SEC to see if XRP will finally join the ETF ranks in the U.S. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

BTC's losses followed a $358 million net outflow from the 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Thursday, their first since May 13 and highest single-day tally since March 11, according to data source SoSoValue . Renewed trade war fears also weighed over the sentiment. Other majors, such as ETH, SOL, and DOGE, posted larger losses, with smaller tokens like OP, ARB, BONK, and PEPE falling by over 10% each, according to data source Coingecko. Focus on U.S. core PCE Consumer prices, represented by the personal consumption expenditure index, rose 0.15% on a monthly basis in April, bringing the annual inflation rate down to 2.2% from 2.3% in March, according to economists surveyed by FactSet. The core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.12% on a monthly basis and 2.5% on an annual basis. Another good month for inflation could raise Fed rate cut bets, boding well for BTC and other assets.

The report states that the average holder of these ETFs is currently sitting on a 21% paper loss, reflecting the gap between Ether’s current trading value and the purchase price of the funds. Ether, which is trading at $2,601, is well below the cost basis for both ETFs — with BlackRock’s average at $3,300 and Fidelity’s even higher at $3,500. The asset’s decline over recent months has significantly impacted investor sentiment and ETF performance. Tariffs Triggered the Downturn The last time Ether traded above $3,000 was in early February. The downtrend began shortly after then-President Donald Trump issued executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico. The crypto market reacted sharply, and Ether’s price plummeted to a yearly low of $1,472 on April 9 — the same day those tariffs took effect. Glassnode highlighted that ETF outflows accelerated when the spot price of Ether dipped below the average cost basis in August 2024, and again in January and March 2025. This reflected growing investor concerns and a broader crypto market correction. Signs of Recovery and Renewed Interest Despite these losses, Ether has rebounded by over 44% in the past month. From May 16 onward, spot Ether ETFs have recorded nine consecutive days of inflows totaling $435.6 million. The inflows are partly attributed to easing concerns around Trump’s tariff policies, especially after a US federal court blocked most of them on May 28. Market watchers believe this court ruling could fuel a broader crypto recovery, with Ether potentially leading the charge. Spot ETFs recorded their last net outflow on May 15, marking a shift in investor behavior. Mixed Reception Since Launch Since their launch in July 2024, US-based spot Ether ETFs have accumulated $2.94 billion in inflows. Ether was trading at roughly $3,536 at the time, making current prices a major drawdown for early participants. Glassnode noted that ETF volume was modest at first, making up just 1.5% of spot market trades. Although that share rose to 2.5% during November 2024 — coinciding with Trump’s re-election and a market-wide rally that pushed Ether to $4,007 — the figure has since fallen back to earlier levels. Lack of Staking a Key Limitation Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in March, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, acknowledged one weakness in their offering. He said the spot Ether ETF is “less perfect” without the inclusion of staking, a feature many crypto investors now consider standard. The sentiment underscores the challenges facing Ether ETFs, even as the broader market shows signs of stabilization. Investors remain hopeful that recent momentum can be sustained, but for now, many remain underwater.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-30 09:13:10

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s risk signal is trending downwards, an indication that the market risk is falling. According to the widely followed analyst, there’s an increase in liquidity from buyers, a fact which could push up the price of the crypto king. “We are setting up for another solid run on the long time frame.” Source: Willy Woo/X Woo, however, says that the strength of Bitcoin’s recent bullish run from the price of $75,000 reached around April 6th to the price of $112,000 recorded on May 22nd is beginning to weaken. Over the short term, the widely followed analyst says , “This week is absolutely critical, if we do not get follow through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” Woo further says , “In the short term, my main concern are the late-comer speculators taking long positions while an immense amount of potential profit-taking is ready to dump (SOPR). This week’s spot buying will strongly influence the next 1-2 months of price action. We are in a pivot zone.” The SOPR, an acronym for the Spent Output Profit Ratio, is an on-chain metric used to determine market sentiment by revealing whether the Bitcoin that is moving is being sold at a loss or profit.

This liquidation was triggered by bitcoin’s dip below $105,000 early Friday. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Wynn has been liquidated on four positions so far, totaling 1,134 BTC (over $118.8 million). He still has an open position with 40x leverage on the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid, which is sitting on an unrealized loss of $4.7 million at the time of writing. $1B Bitcoin Bet Backfires CryptoPotato reported last week that Wynn built his 40x leverage long Bitcoin position from $390 million to $1.1 billion within seven days. Well-known as a high-risk leverage trader and meme coin maxi, the whale continued to increase his bets as bitcoin’s price kept rising. As BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) of $111,970 on May 22, the bet increased to $1.14 billion with an unrealized profit of over $39 million. By May 24, Wynn had pumped the bet to $1.25 billion, even as BTC had slipped from its ATH and was consolidating around $108,000 to $109,000. Although analysts’ predictions and on-chain data suggested that BTC had more room for growth in the short term, macroeconomic changes triggered a reversal in the asset’s trajectory. Buying and Holding is Better: Wynn While Wynn took profits from his big BTC bet, he believed the asset could hit the $115,000 to $118,000 target this week. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Bitcoin is down 2.5% in the past 24 hours and was trading around $105,093 at writing time. Due to bitcoin’s decline over the last few hours, Wynn has been liquidated in four positions holding 91 BTC ($9.7 million), 527 BTC ($55.3 million), 421 BTC ($43.9 million), and 95 BTC ($10 million). Data from the Hyperliquid analytics platform, Hypurrscan, shows that the liquidations were triggered when BTC hit $106,330, $104,950, $104,150, and $104,620, respectively. Addressing his liquidation on X, Wynn tweeted that his bets have exposed the corruption in the crypto market. He insisted it is better to buy and hold BTC in cold storage rather than follow his investment strategy. One thing for sure is that I have exposed just how corrupt these markets are. Guess it’s better to just buy and hold $BTC on spot / cold storage it. — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 30, 2025 The post Crypto Whale Wynn Who Bet $1B on BTC Gets Liquidated for $118M Amid Price Dip appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Whales,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ARKM,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-30 09:15:41

At the same time, oil prices edged lower for the second consecutive week as traders braced for another OPEC+ output hike. The price of Gold Aug 25 (GC=F) dropped up to 0.8% during morning trade and headed for a weekly fall of nearly 2%. Investors are waiting for the US personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed’s primary inflation metric, due later in the day Gold Aug 25 price. Source: Yahoo Finance Kelvin Wong, senior analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte, said that the current sell-off was due to technical factors ahead of the metrics release. “The price action in gold has twice failed to break above the key near-term resistance level of $3,328 — both in the U.S. session yesterday and again early in the Asian session today,” he noted. Gold is still considered a safe haven amid market uncertainties Markets have been unsettled once again after a federal appeals court on Thursday granted Trump a temporary reprieve from a decision that had threatened to remove much of his planned tariffs. Tensions with China have also resurfaced. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described talks with Beijing as “a bit stalled.” Earlier in the week, the White House said it would start cancelling some Chinese student visas and curb sales of chip-design software to Chinese firms, prompting a swift protest from Beijing. Such uncertainty in the market is likely to keep some interest in the bullion. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also said that gold would remain a part of the firm’s long-term portfolios as a defense against rising prices, alongside crude oil. By 1:40 p.m. in Singapore, spot gold had trimmed losses but was still down 0.5% at $3,300 an ounce. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index inched higher after swinging the previous day. Other precious metals, including silver (SI=F), palladium (PA=F), and platinum (PL=F), all slipped lower. Crude oil prices decline for the second consecutive week Brent crude futures declined 21 cents (0.33%) to $63.94 a barrel by 06:26 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 22 cents (0.36%) to $60.72. Both contracts have dropped about 1.3% since Monday, and the Brent July futures contract is due to expire on Friday. Much of the pressure came from expectations that OPEC+ and its partners would approve another output hike on Saturday during a meeting. Analysts at JPMorgan said the global surplus has increased to roughly 2.2 million barrels per day, a gap that may force prices lower, in order to restore balance. The analysts predict crude will trade near current levels before easing into the high $50s by the end of the year. Supply worries were compounded after Trump’s broad tariffs were reinstated on Thursday, overturning a lower-court order issued a day earlier. Crude, which is often considered a safe haven alongside gold, has now fallen more than 10% since Trump rolled out his “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2. At the same time, tensions deepened further after Washington told a wide range of companies to halt shipments of goods such as ethane and butane to China without a license, and revoked existing permits for some suppliers. Even so, JPMorgan noted that global demand ticked up last week thanks to strong U.S. travel over the Memorial Day holiday. The bank estimates monthly demand growth at about 400,000 barrels per day as of May 28, roughly 250,000 barrels below earlier projections.

With price action now facing resistance around the $112,000 mark, traders are assessing whether this is a temporary pause or a precursor to a broader pullback. This article evaluates the monthly forecast using multi-timeframe analysis, combining short-term indicators with the weekly macro structure. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The Bitcoin price today is around $105,800, retreating slightly from recent highs near $112,000.

While this decline has made the markets nervous about the risk of further declines, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the news of Singapore-based crypto options data platform Greeks.live, 93 thousand Bitcoin (BTC) and 624 thousand Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on May 30 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.89, the maximum loss point is $ 100,000 and the notional value is $ 9.79 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.81, a maximum loss point of $2,300, and a notional value of $1.62 billion.

Analysts stated that Bitcoin has been following a volatile course this week, and that Ethereum is stronger compared to BTC. While the Pull/Call ratios show that the market is slightly optimistic in anticipation of a price increase, the Maximum Loss levels ($100,000 for BTC, $2,300 for ETH) carry the risk that prices could be pulled back to these levels. Analysts stated that price fluctuations may occur in BTC and ETH based on these rates. “Bitcoin has been mostly volatile this week, Ether has been relatively strong and the accumulation has been ongoing for two weeks. Data suggests that the market is still optimistic about BTC reaching new highs in the near future. ETH’s upward shock has started to slow down and the market has recalibrated ETH’s price and volatility. “Deliveries are less than 8% of total positions, a decline, and crypto institutions are not showing much reaction to new highs in Ethereum. This suggests low expectations for a near-term rally in ETH and more expectations for a steady, moderate increase.” May 30 Options Data 93,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.89, a Maxpain point of $100,000 and a notional value of $9.79 billion. 624,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.81, a Maxpain point of $2,300 and a notional value of $1.62 billion.

With recent upgrades like Hydra scaling and a renewed push in the DeFi market, Cardano (ADA) is positioning itself for a potential move back toward the $1 threshold, a key psychological and technical level. While ADA’s growth curve leans steady and sustainable, attention is shifting toward high-upside newcomers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly gaining traction as a new cryptocurrency with aggressive ROI potential in 2025. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.5 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,400 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. Cardano Eyes Recovery as $1 Becomes Key Milestone in 2025 Outlook Cardano (ADA), currently priced at $0.76, is gradually rebuilding market confidence as it grinds its way back to the critical $1 point, which was once its breakout level. The blockchain’s development , like Hydra’s scalability enhancement and increased developer activity, is an indication of commitment to long-term use and adoption. Despite a volatile background and questions about why crypto is down from time to time, ADA still retains its appeal as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today, especially for investors focusing on real-world use cases and network maturity. As the market turns its focus towards recovery and reaccumulation, ADA’s steady trajectory is in sharp contrast with the explosive growth potential of newer tokens like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. That more than 11,400 investors have invested $9.5 million in the presale is a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $1 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards. Ten lucky users will be given $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each for completing a series of simple steps. Cardano’s journey to $1 reflects steady fundamentals and long-term potential, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the breakout star for 2025. With over $9.5 million raised and 11,400+ investors already on board, MUTM offers up to 100% ROI at launch—and far greater upside post-launch. Its hybrid lending model, Certik-audited smart contracts, and upcoming stablecoin make it a top crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss your chance—join the presale before the next price hike.

Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Yet To Surpass +1 SD Line In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin is currently looking from the perspective of the MVRV Ratio. The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular indicator that, in short, tells us about how the value held by the investors as a whole compares against their initial investment. Related Reading: Toncoin Open Interest Spikes 33%—Will History Repeat With A Pullback? When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders are carrying more than they put in. In other words, they are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under the threshold suggests the overall network is underwater. The analytics firm has used the MVRV Ratio to define pricing bands that correspond to extreme deviations from the average investor profitability (that is, the mean value of the MVRV Ratio). These bands help point out periods where investor profits/losses are unusually high. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode in the report that shows the trend in these pricing bands for Bitcoin over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin price has been trading above the mean level of this model since a while now. Recently, the asset has also broken above the +0.5 standard deviations (SD) line. This line corresponds to the price at which the MVRV Ratio attains a value that’s 0.5 standard deviations above the all-time mean. At present, the level is situated around $100,200. The level that BTC is yet to surpass in this latest rally is the +1 SD one, located at $119,400. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency breaking above this line has generally led to a top for its price. The explanation behind this pattern lies in the fact that the larger investor profits grow, the more tempted holders become to take them. At extreme deviations of the MVRV Ratio, selling pressure from holders giving in to this temptation becomes significant, hence why the asset approaches a long-term top. In the current cycle, Bitcoin has breached the +1 SD level of the model on two occasions, ending up with the formations of the March 2024 and December 2024 peaks. For now, the current rally is still below this level, but above the +0.5 SD that also corresponds to a significant level of gains.

After years of uncertainty, the government is preparing to release a discussion paper on crypto regulation in June. For a country that’s gone from heavy taxes to long periods of silence, this could be a defining moment. With the global market heating up and Bitcoin recently touching a new all-time high above $111,900, India’s timing is interesting. What’s in the paper? Will it invite public opinion? Could this be the start of a more structured approach to crypto in India? Let’s unpack what we know so far. Supreme Court Steps In: Silence is No Longer an Option The pressure isn’t just coming from the markets. India’s Supreme Court has strongly called out the government’s delay in addressing crypto regulation. It warned that the ongoing legal vacuum is creating space for misuse and made it clear that banning crypto isn’t the solution. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh questioned why, while other global economies are moving ahead with their own regulatory frameworks, India is yet to make a clear decision. This paper appears to be a direct response. According to reports, the government’s upcoming proposal will draw heavily from the IMF and Financial Stability Board’s recent synthesis report. There are also signs that it might open the floor for public input, giving stakeholders a chance to contribute to the process. India’s Journey So Far: Tax First, Clarity Later India’s crypto story has had its share of growing pains. The 2023 budget introduced a 30% tax on crypto profits, which pushed many users and exchanges to rethink their presence in the country. While firms were required to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit, the sector still lacks formal recognition. The Reserve Bank of India has remained cautious, often highlighting risks like money laundering and terror financing. At the same time, it has continued to promote its central bank digital currency as a safer alternative to private crypto assets. According to a recent report by think tank Esya Centre , nearly 90% of Indian crypto trading has moved offshore, largely in response to existing policies. Industry voices have warned that the current setup limits innovation and drives users toward unregulated platforms. Global Momentum Is Building – Can India Keep Pace? While India works through its roadmap, global powers are setting the tone. In the US, President Donald Trump has shifted the country’s stance with a bold pro-crypto approach. His administration has pardoned several digital asset leaders, backed a strategic bitcoin reserve, and seen the Senate pass stablecoin-focused legislation. Meanwhile, the European Union is already rolling out its MiCA regulation, setting clear rules for digital asset firms operating across its member states. A Defining Moment for India One senior Indian official noted that the country would approach crypto decisions with the national interest in mind, and avoid “knee-jerk” reactions. That could be key, especially in a market known for sudden shifts and global ripple effects.

Tuo tarpu kriptovaliutų rinkoje pasirodė naujas žaidėjas – Solaxy (SOLX), kuris žada net 8500 % augimo potencialą. Sužinokite daugiau apie Solaxy Šiame straipsnyje apžvelgsime, ką prognozuoja ChatGPT, kokios priežastys lemia Dogecoin atsigavimą bei kodėl Solaxy gali tapti vienu įdomiausių altkoinų 2025 metais. Dogecoin (DOGE) kainos prognozė: artėja naujos aukštumos? Meme kriptovaliuta Dogecoin (DOGE) per pastarąjį mėnesį išaugo net 26,74 %, o rinkos kapitalizacija jau siekia 4,5 mlrd. JAV dolerių. Iš pradžių kaip pokštas pradėtas projektas dabar tapo rimtu rinkos žaidėju. Analitikai prognozuoja, kad iki 2025 m. pabaigos DOGE gali pasiekti $0,67, o ChatGPT kainos prognozė rodo, kad ši kriptovaliuta gali pakilti iki $0,70, viršydama savo ankstesnį visų laikų rekordą. Visgi, pasak Binance, DOGE kaina per artimiausius penkis metus pakils nuo $0,2046 šiandien iki $0,278206 – ne toks drastiškas, bet vis tiek pozityvus augimas. Šį optimizmą grindžia keli veiksniai: Aktyvi bendruomenė, kuri jau daugelį metų palaiko šį projektą; Augantis priėmimas kaip mokėjimo priemonė versle; Stiprus socialinių tinklų palaikymas. Investuokite į Dogecoin Solaxy (SOLX) – nauja kriptovaliuta su 8500 % potencialu Kol Dogecoin siekia naujų aukštumų, investuotojų dėmesį traukia nauja kriptovaliuta – Solaxy (SOLX). Šiuo metu išankstinio pardavimo kaina siekia $0,00174, o jau surinkta daugiau nei $42 mln. investicijų. Numatyta bendra pasiūla – 38 mlrd. monetų, o išankstinis pardavimas tęsis iki 2025 m. birželio 16 d. – liko jau visai nedaug. Solaxy – tai Layer 2 sprendimas, veikiantis Solana tinkle, sukurtas tam, kad išspręstų pagrindines tinklo problemas: Tinklo perkrovas, Aukštus mokesčius, Patikimumo trūkumą. Projekto techninė architektūra (off-chain rollup) jau perėjo Coinsult auditą, ir nenustatyta jokių saugumo pažeidimų. Didžiausias Solaxy (SOLX) privalumas – tai tarpusavio suderinamumas su Ethereum ir Solana tinklu. Tai leidžia užtikrinti mažesnius sandorių mokesčius, efektyvų mastelį decentralizuotų finansų (DeFi), žaidimų ir mikrotransakcijų srityse bei suteikia šiai kriptovaliutai realią technologinę vertę, kuri gerokai pranoksta vien tik meme projekto įvaizdį. Šie veiksniai gali lemti 100x augimą jau šią vasarą – bulių bėgimas dar tik įsibėgėja. Verta investuoti į DOGE ar SOLX? Nepaisant kriptovaliutų rinkos volatilumo, tiek DOGE, tiek SOLX yra vertinami kaip turintys reikšmingą augimo potencialą. Dogecoin turi stiprią bendruomenę, o jo ilgesnio laikotarpio ateitis išlieka pozityvi. Solaxy išsiskiria technologinėmis naujovėmis ir augančia auditorija – daugiau nei 75 000 X (Twitter) sekėjų ir 13 000 Telegram narių. Pagal ChatGPT analizę, Dogecoin gali ir toliau svyruoti, tačiau išliks stiprioje pozicijoje net ir esant „kripto žiemai“. Tuo tarpu Solaxy yra pozicionuojamas kaip vertingas altkoinas 2025 m. rinkoje , turintis tiek technologinę, tiek kultūrinę vertę. Išvada: kaip priimti teisingus investavimo sprendimus? Kriptovaliutų pasaulyje strateginis mąstymas ir tendencijų stebėjimas yra raktas į sėkmę. Jeigu ieškote projektų, kurie siūlo tiek spekuliacinį pelną, tiek realią vertę, verta atidžiau paanalizuoti tiek Dogecoin, tiek Solaxy.

Legal expert and crypto commentator Bill Morgan, sharing the development via X, expressed his astonishment at the nature of the filing, noting that while he was anticipating a procedural move related to the pending status report before the U.S. Court of Appeals, what emerged was an unexpected multi-page submission from someone not even party to the lawsuit. I was expecting some filing in the SEC v Ripple case given what happened to the last motion that was dismissed two weeks ago, especially given that the 60 day period which the parties have before the SEC is required to file a status report with the court of appeals expires on 16… pic.twitter.com/I250sVGKLx — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 29, 2025 The Expected vs. the Unexpected The Ripple vs. SEC case has built anticipation among its close followers in the community. After all, following the recent dismissal of the SEC’s motion two weeks ago, attention had naturally shifted toward the 60-day window set to expire on June 16, 2025. This window relates to the timeline within which both parties must finalize their positions before the SEC is required to submit a formal status report to the appellate court. Given the high stakes and unresolved issues, including remedies, penalties, and regulatory implications for the crypto market, analysts like Bill Morgan were closely monitoring strategic filings and updates that could impact the litigation’s next phase. What nobody expected, however, was a filing from an outsider: Justin W. Keener, an individual not associated with Ripple, the SEC, or any of the involved legal teams, who submitted an “Emergency Request” to the court. The Nature of Keener’s Filing The filing, formally titled “Emergency Request – Presentation of Decisive Evidence in Favor of the Defendants and Favor of Liberty for the American People”, is a sprawling, multi-page document in which Keener claims to possess data and insights that he believes are crucial to settling the controlling questions at the heart of the Ripple case. According to his assertions, these materials cover issues tied to the application and interpretation of the Howey Test — the foundational legal framework used to determine what qualifies as an “investment contract” under U.S. securities law. Keener’s submission reportedly spans arguments over 90 years of securities law evolution, aiming not only to challenge the SEC’s approach to the Howey Test but also to frame the broader regulatory battle as one with profound implications for the liberty and economic well-being of the American public. Despite Keener’s stance as a champion of market freedom, legal experts remain skeptical about the influence of amicus briefs like his in federal court. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Courtroom Saga That Never Ends The Ripple vs. SEC case has become a defining legal saga in the crypto world, attracting the attention of investors, regulators, and legal scholars worldwide. Since the SEC’s original complaint in December 2020, which alleged that Ripple’s sales of XRP constituted unregistered securities offerings, the case has seen a series of dramatic turns. In July 2023, Judge Torres delivered a pivotal ruling distinguishing between institutional sales (which violated securities laws) and programmatic sales on exchanges (which did not). That ruling, followed by a contentious remedies phase and multiple appeals, has left the legal and crypto communities constantly on edge. Although Keener’s filing may not significantly change the case’s legal course, it does highlight the intense public interest and the deep frustrations many feel over regulatory ambiguity. This criticism isn’t new: both retail and institutional investors have long argued that the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation is unclear and overly reliant on enforcement actions. Waiting for the Next Official Move With the appellate timeline ticking down, all eyes remain on the formal moves by Ripple and the SEC in the coming weeks. The status report due on June 16 will likely provide clearer insights into whether the parties are inching toward resolution or bracing for another round of drawn-out appeals. For Ripple, which continues to expand its global partnerships and XRP-centered financial services, the legal clarity that could emerge from these proceedings is vital to its future positioning, particularly in the U.S. market. In the meantime, Keener’s “emergency request” stands as a curious footnote — perhaps a symbol of just how high the emotional stakes have risen in a case that, at its core, touches on questions of innovation, regulation, and the future of the U.S. financial system. As Bill Morgan aptly put it, “this case never fails to entertain (or end).” For now, the crypto world watches and waits, knowing full well that in the Ripple vs. SEC saga, surprises can come from just about anywhere.

This initiative aims to integrate cryptocurrency into the canal’s operations, potentially offering a more efficient payment method for expedited passage. Mizrachi shared this idea on May 29 while speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas alongside other Bitcoin supporters from El Salvador. Panama City Mayor proposes Bitcoin payments for priority canal transit Mizrachi spoke on the panel alongside Bitcoin advocates, El Salvador government advisors Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, and moderator Mike Peterson from Bitcoin Beach. He suggested that cargo ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal can pay their transit fees in Bitcoin and get priority access. The mayor pointed out that this idea could position Panama as a leading digital finance and technology center and bring Bitcoin deeper into the country’s economy. The Panama Canal saves cargo ships weeks of travel time that they would have to spend if they sailed around the southern tip of South America because it links the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The canal handles about 5% of all global maritime commerce, and nearly 10,000 ships passed through it between October 2023 and September 2024, carrying more than 423 million tons of cargo and generating almost $5 billion in revenue for Panama. Mizrachi’s idea comes at a time of political tension since President Donald Trump publicly demanded that the United States take back control of the Panama Canal in December 2024. Trump criticized the toll system by claiming that U.S. ships pay higher fees than ships from other countries and argued that China’s growing influence over the canal threatens American interests. The mayor’s idea to accept Bitcoin payments for faster canal transit in this complicated situation supports Panama’s digital growth goals. It makes the canal more competitive and efficient on the international trade stage. Panama City embraces Bitcoin for tax payments and proposes City-level crypto reserve Panama City approved a new rule that allows people and businesses to pay their municipal taxes, fines, and fees using Bitcoin and other digital currencies. This move shows that the city trusts digital currency and wants to give people more flexible ways to meet their financial obligations to the government. Mayor Mizrachi also proposed to create a dedicated Bitcoin reserve for Panama City to help stabilize its finances and attract new investment opportunities since the city contributes more than half of the country’s gross domestic product. He also said he could set up the reserve at the city level without waiting for the national legislature to pass any new laws. The mayor used strong language to warn lawmakers to avoid rushing into new rules that could slow progress or scare away innovation. He said, “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it,” emphasizing that the government should give Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the space to grow naturally. Mizrachi told lawmakers to watch how people use Bitcoin over time and only bring rules that protect users or improve systems. Mizrachi said the country transacts over $5 billion in Bitcoin annually, but most of it remains hidden because many fear the legal or social risks of being open about their involvement with crypto. The mayor believes that making the system more open, transparent, and officially supported will encourage more people and businesses to come forward. The decision to adopt Bitcoin also comes amidst social and economic tension. Panama declared a state of emergency in the Bocas del Toro province following news that a well-known banana company, Chiquita, was laying off over 5,000 workers. Those employees were demonstrating for additional social security guarantees and improved working conditions. In other discussion forums, Mizrach sai d cr yptocurrencies can function as safety nets when traditional infrastructures do not help the country’s most vulnerable people.

But it’s not all bad news — Bitcoin is still holding firmly above the key $104,000 support level, and with altcoins down by around 2-6%, this pullback might actually be a golden opportunity for investors eyeing the next big move. With Bitcoin now just 3-5% away from setting a new all-time high, history suggests an altcoin rally could soon follow. Keeping that in mind, here are three altcoins AltcoinBuzz believes are well-positioned to deliver strong performances in the c… The post RWA Tokens ONDO & Plume, Upgraded ETH: Altcoins Gearing Up After BTC Dip appeared first on Coin Edition .",CoinMarketCap Feed|Market|Market News|News|Price Analysis|Top Crypto News|Altcoin News|ETH|Ondo (ONDO),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ONDO,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-05-30 09:45:00

The price movement from $7.119 to $6.532 indicates substantial downward pressure, amplified by macroeconomic factors like overall market bearish trends and investor sentiment. At the same time, microeconomic elements, including Uniswap's latest protocol advancements and strategic interest from crypto whales, provide counterbalancing support points, potentially staving off further price declines. Despite the dip, long-term confidence might build as Uniswap gains traction with its latest innovations, suggesting strategic investor consideration. Technical Analysis Highlights UNI price plummeted from $7.119 to $6.532 in 24 hours. Intermediate support was found at $6.40, buoyed by significant trading volumes, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. The price attempted recovery reaching a high of $6.595 but stabilized at $6.522 by 08:00. Consistent lower highs noted throughout the session, suggesting continued bearish sentiment.

In a post published to X, the company stated, “If it’s happening on-chain, it’s happening with Ripple,” and encouraged its 3.1 million followers to explore how blockchain is transforming the financial sector and other industries. The post was accompanied by a short video clip displaying the phrase “It’s happening” alongside a ticking clock, an image of a charging bull, and a directional sign pointing to Wall Street, Broad Street, and the Marunouchi Line. If it’s happening onchain, it’s happening with @Ripple . Find out how blockchain is changing finance…and just about everything else, too. pic.twitter.com/uQXFl0LC4I — Ripple (@Ripple) May 29, 2025 Community Decodes the Clues The timing and style of the message prompted immediate speculation from the XRP Army, a term used to describe XRP’s most engaged community members. One notable reaction came from community member deva tron, who commented , “It’s coming, you’re not ready XRP.” Others joined in the discussion by attempting to decode the imagery and messaging, including by using AI tools to interpret potential meanings behind the teaser. Among the most discussed elements was the reference to the Marunouchi Line, a subway route in Tokyo. Several users pointed out that SBI Holdings, one of Ripple’s long-term partners in Japan, has its headquarters situated near this metro line. Given that SBI uses XRP to support cross-border transactions in parts of Asia, some interpreted the inclusion of this location as a subtle reference to Ripple’s continued efforts to expand blockchain integration in key financial and urban centers globally. Ripple’s Expanding Payment Infrastructure While Ripple has not clarified the purpose of its post, the teaser appears to emphasize the company’s focus on three core areas: payments, custody solutions, and the deployment of its newly introduced stablecoin, RLUSD . These are segments where Ripple has been actively building over the past several months. In the payments domain, speculation has centered around Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road . This digital prime brokerage became a member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) in March 2025. The FICC processes over $11 trillion in daily U.S. Treasury transactions, and its membership allows participation in operations such as repo trading and net settlement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s stated goal is to improve the efficiency of these processes using the XRP Ledger . However, while many in the XRP community had hoped XRP itself would be utilized for settlement, Ripple has clarified that RLUSD will act as collateral, with XRP being used only to cover transaction fees. RLUSD Gains Momentum on Exchanges This week, RLUSD made further progress by being listed on new exchanges, including Bitget and Bitmex. It is already trading on major platforms such as Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini. These developments signal Ripple’s ongoing push to enhance RLUSD’s accessibility and market depth. The company’s focus on improving liquidity and reach for RLUSD reinforces its broader objective of building a stablecoin-based settlement infrastructure that complements XRP’s role within the ecosystem. Strengthening Custody Capabilities On the custody front, Ripple’s expansion continues through institutional-grade infrastructure. Earlier in the year, the company filed a trademark application for “Ripple Custody” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This filing came as the U.S. Treasury began considering external custody providers like Anchorage Digital for managing its Bitcoin reserves. Ripple has already moved to strengthen its custody offering with its acquisition of Metaco and now offers a dedicated Ripple Custody app. The application functions as an authenticator for institutional transactions rather than a personal digital wallet. As of now, the exact purpose behind Ripple’s “It’s happening” teaser remains undisclosed. Still, the deliberate imagery, timing, and tone have fueled speculation that Ripple may soon unveil a significant update or expansion. The community continues to watch closely for any further clues or announcements. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Jamie Raskin Demands Guest List of $TRUMP Coin Dinner appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A heated controversy is brewing in Washington as Rep. Jamie Raskin pushes President Donald Trump to reveal the full list of guests who attended a private dinner after purchasing $TRUMP memecoins. These attendees reportedly spent close to $400 million just to get access. This demand comes during the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas , where major crypto figures like Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, the Winklevoss twins, and pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht are promoting the administration’s strong pro-crypto stance. Jamie Raskin Calls for Transparency: Who Bought Their Way In? In a letter sent Thursday, Raskin pressed President Trump to disclose the names of all 220 buyers who used $TRUMP coins to secure a spot at the private dinner. He pointed out that many of these buyers appear to be foreign nationals who only purchased the coins after the event was announced. “These 220 buyers…collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars — $394 million by one account,” said Raskin, noting that “we deserve to know who is paying for access to our president.” He also expressed serious concerns that the event may break laws regarding foreign government payments, known as emoluments laws. Raskin demanded full disclosure of the sources of funds each attendee used to purchase the coins and set a deadline of June 4, 2025, for this information. The Focus on Justin Sun and Potential Foreign Influence One high-profile figure in the spotlight is Chinese-born crypto investor Justin Sun. He reportedly spent $23 million on $TRUMP coins. Sun has previously faced investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for his connections to a Trump-related crypto firm. Raskin warned that some of the funds may come from illegal sources or foreign governments, raising red flags about possible foreign influence through cryptocurrency. He was clear about what the public should know: beyond “virtually worthless memecoins,” what exactly are these buyers getting in return for their millions? Crypto, Politics, and a Growing Scrutiny This controversy unfolds at a critical moment for cryptocurrency in the U.S. The Trump administration’s aggressive push to embrace crypto, showcased at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, marks a significant shift in policy. However, Raskin’s demands highlight the ongoing concerns about foreign money mixing with political power through digital assets. With the June 4 deadline fast approaching, all eyes are on President Trump to see if he will disclose the details about who is buying access – and with what money.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 09:50:03

And few things influence that pulse more directly than decisions made by the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding Fed interest rates . Recent Mary Daly comments from the San Francisco Fed offer a crucial look into the central bank’s current thinking, providing valuable context for investors watching market trends. What Are the Latest Mary Daly Comments on Interest Rates? Speaking on May 29, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly provided an update on her perspective regarding the trajectory of monetary policy. Her key message offered a blend of caution and potential flexibility: Hold Steady for Now: Daly emphasized the need for the central bank to keep Fed interest rates unchanged at their current level for the time being. Why the Pause? The primary reason cited is the need for more time and data to gain greater confidence that inflation is definitively heading back towards the Fed’s long-term target of 2%. Potential for Cuts: Despite the call for patience, Daly reiterated that the possibility of two interest rate cuts before the end of 2024 remains on the table. This suggests that while the Fed isn’t in a rush, they haven’t abandoned their easing bias entirely. This balanced view highlights the data-dependent nature of the Fed’s current stance, waiting for clear signals before making a move. How Does the Inflation Outlook Influence Fed Decisions? A central theme in Mary Daly comments , and indeed in statements from most Fed officials, is the inflation outlook . The Fed’s dual mandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability (low, stable inflation). After a period of elevated price increases, bringing inflation down to 2% is the primary focus. Daly specifically noted that she is closely watching incoming data to see if inflation continues its recent trend of easing or if signs of persistence reappear. This means the Fed isn’t just looking at headline numbers but also underlying components of inflation, often referred to as ‘core’ inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. A stubborn inflation outlook is the main barrier to initiating interest rate cuts . What Does the US Economy Outlook Look Like According to Daly? Beyond inflation, the health of the labor market is a critical component of the US economy outlook and a key factor the Fed considers. A strong labor market typically supports consumer spending but can also contribute to wage pressures, potentially fueling inflation. According to reports on the Mary Daly comments , she sees no signs of significant labor market weakness so far. This suggests that the economy is currently robust enough to withstand current interest rate levels without causing widespread job losses. The Fed wants to see a gradual cooling, not a sharp downturn, in the labor market. This stable US economy outlook , particularly regarding employment, gives the Fed flexibility to wait longer on rate adjustments if needed to ensure inflation is under control. Why Are Interest Rate Cuts Still Possible This Year? While the immediate focus is on holding steady, the fact that two interest rate cuts are still considered viable by Daly speaks to the Fed’s expectation that the inflation outlook will likely improve over the coming months. The pathway to cuts depends on: Continued Disinflation: A steady decline in inflation readings towards the 2% target. Stable Employment: The labor market remaining healthy but not overheating. Absence of Negative Shocks: No major unexpected events (domestic or international) that could disrupt the economic trajectory. Should these conditions materialize, the Fed would gain the confidence needed to begin gradually lowering Fed interest rates , providing some stimulus to the economy. How Do Fed Interest Rates Impact the Crypto Market? Understanding the Fed’s stance is crucial for crypto investors because Fed interest rates significantly influence global liquidity and investor risk appetite. Higher rates tend to make traditional, safer assets like bonds more attractive compared to riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Conversely, lower rates or the prospect of interest rate cuts can increase liquidity and encourage investment in risk assets. Therefore, monitoring the inflation outlook and US economy outlook through insights like Mary Daly comments helps anticipate potential shifts in monetary policy, which in turn can impact capital flows into and out of the crypto market. The expectation of future interest rate cuts , even if delayed, can be seen as a potentially positive signal for risk assets over the medium term. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty with Daly’s Insights Mary Daly’s recent remarks provide a clear picture of the Fed’s current cautious but optimistic approach. The focus remains firmly on confirming the positive trend in the inflation outlook before considering any moves on Fed interest rates . While the possibility of interest rate cuts this year remains, the timing is highly dependent on incoming data. For those following the US economy outlook and its potential effects on markets, including crypto, paying close attention to further Mary Daly comments and data releases will be essential in the months ahead.

Protocol Staking Not a Non-Security In a May 29 release , the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance indicated that staking crypto through PoS mechanisms is not covered under the Securities Act. According to the staff, such activities “don’t have to register with the Commission” and do not require registration exemptions either. The guidance underscored that staking rewards are earned as compensation for providing a service — running validator nodes — and not based on others’ labor, a key distinction in securities law. Second, custodial staking — where a third party stakes on behalf of a user — is not a securities offering. Staff explained custodians are mere agents and have no control over how much is staked. Commissioner Peirce Praises Regulatory Certainty Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the agency’s Crypto Task Force, supported the action, maintaining it gives much-needed clarity to American crypto users. “Regulatory uncertainty about staking views discouraged Americans from staking,” she said, maintaining it also impeded network decentralization and consensus participation. Peirce has long maintained that a regulatory system that encourages innovation with clear rules for participants is necessary. Crenshaw Criticizes Legal Foundation But Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw was a strong critic of the guidance, declaring that it “falls short of providing a reliable roadmap” for staking classification on the Howey test, the judicial standard for determining securities. “The staff’s analysis is wishful thinking, not law,” Crenshaw said. “It’s another example of the SEC acting on assumptions of future legal outcomes.” Crenshaw warned that omitting settled court decisions could undermine investor protection and legitimacy of the SEC. The SEC’s latest move illustrates the internal conflict regarding regulation of cryptocurrency. Whereas Peirce views the guidance as pro-innovation, Crenshaw considers it a legally dubious deviation from disciplinary regulation. Crypto consumers and staking services providers will likely welcome the clarity — even as legal uncertainties may persist, subject to future enforcement actions and court interpretations.",Blockchain|SEC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-30 09:53:03

Despite short-term volatility, ETH is up 45% monthly, with analysts forecasting a push beyond $3,000 in June. XRP has surged 322% over the past year, but with 98% of its supply now in profit, Santiment warns of a higher risk of profit-taking and a possible short-term correction. Latest ADA Updates Earlier this week, some members of the Cardano community noted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has May 29 as an initial deadline to approve or reject Grayscale’s application to launch the first spot ADA ETF in the United States. The agency, however, opted to delay its decision until July 15. It has a maximum of 240 days to review the product, with a final deadline of October 22. The price of ADA is down 7% on a daily scale, as its downtrend could be attributed to the SEC’s actions and the overall decline of the cryptocurrency market during that time frame. Meanwhile, several key factors suggest that Cardano’s native token may soon regain its upward momentum. As CryptoPotato reported , whales purchased over 180 million ADA last week, which suggests strong confidence in the asset. Another bullish element is the development of Cardano. Just a few days ago, Input Output revealed that Bitcoin Ordinals can now be wrapped and bridged to the Cardano blockchain through Fairgate’s BitVMX framework. “This breakthrough marks a significant advancement in decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling seamless interaction between two of the most prominent blockchain ecosystems,” the team stated. Where’s ETH Headed? Despite the pullback over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is up 45% on a monthly basis , currently trading at just north of $2,600 (according to CoinGecko’s data). ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko Popular industry participants like the X users Daan Trades and Michael van de Poppe expect the asset to pump in the near future under certain conditions. The former saw a “big resistance” at $2,800, which will be “a tough level to break through quickly.” For his part, Michael van de Poppe touched upon the matter when the price was above $2,700, saying: “Ethereum above $2,700 is a great sign. I think we’ll see $3,000+ in June .” Those willing to explore other, even more bullish price predictions involving the second-largest cryptocurrency can take a look at our detailed article here . What About XRP? Ripple’s cross-border token has been on a downward trend lately, but it has seen an impressive 322% increase in the last year. As of this writing, it trades at around $2.20, having declined by 10% over the past week. According to Santiment, the total supply in profit (at least on paper) had surged past 98% earlier this week when the asset traded at $2.3. Thus, XRP outshined ADA (71%), ETH (71.5%), DOGE (77.9%), and LINK (80.5%). While the data might sound optimistic and encouraging, Santiment issued a major warning, stating: “When large portions of a network are heavily in profit, the odds of profit-taking and a short-term pullback rise.” This takes us to Warren Buffett’s famous advice, who years ago advised investors to be greedy when others are fearful and vice versa.

The firm noted that corporate profits plummeted by $118 billion in Q1 2025. The U.S. economy contracted in Q1 on an import surge following the start of President Donald Trump’s second term in office as he initiated a trade war with countries globally. Wall Street economists also changed their outlook to negative growth, largely because of an unexpected rise in imports as corporate institutions and consumers sought to counter the Trump levies imposed in early April. Trump’s policy uncertainty weighs on corporate profits 🇺🇸💸 Trump's trade war has cost companies more than $34 billion in lost sales and higher costs, according to analysis of corporate disclosures, a toll that is expected to rise as ongoing uncertainty over tariffs paralyzes decision making at some of the world's largest companies. pic.twitter.com/CDoN5ASgih — Flying Dutch Fella 🇺🇦🇳🇱🇪🇺 🇬🇪🇨🇦🇬🇱 (@FlyingDutchPall) May 29, 2025 Imports inched up 41.3% for the quarter, driven by a 50.9% increase in goods, reflecting the biggest growth outside the Covid pandemic since 1974. A sharp decline in federal expenditure also contributed to the weak GDP number amid Elon Musk ’s efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Federal government outlays declined 5.1% for the quarter, shaving off about one-third of a percentage point off GDP. “No surprise that GDP took a hit in the first quarter, mainly because the balance of trade blew up as companies imported goods like crazy to front-run tariffs. The more telling number for the future of the expansion was consumer spending, and it grew, but at a relatively weak pace.” -Robert Frick, Corporate Economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. Trump announced a 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. trade partners as well as a flurry of reciprocal tariffs against several nations. On April 9, the President suspended those duties for 90 days to allow for negotiations between its trade partners, with some deals still ongoing . Corporate Institutions ranging from airlines and retailers to motor vehicle manufacturers have also refrained from giving financial guidance for 2025, citing the uncertainty caused by the heightened nature of some levies. Ford suspended its annual guidance on May 5, arguing that tariffs would cost the company about $1.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes. General Motors cut its 2025 profit forecast on May 1, two days after pulling its annual guidance. The company also paused plans to buy back $2 billion of shares in the first half of the year, pending more clarity on the economic outlook. Mercedes pulled its earnings guidance for 2025 on April 30 as it posted lower first-quarter profits. A U.S. court on Wednesday halted most of Trump’s levies from going into effect, ruling that the President overstepped his authority. The uncertainty on corporations was echoed during the Federal Reserve’s 6-7 meeting published on Wednesday, noting that participants judged that the downside risk of employment and economic activity and upside risk of inflation had risen, reflecting the potential effects of tariff increases. Increased imports cause a drop in real GDP According to the second estimate, the real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased at an annual rate of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025. The report also disclosed that real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased by 2.4%. The BEA also reported that real gross domestic income (GDI) decreased by 0.2% in the first quarter, compared to an increase of 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Corporate profits also decreased by $118.1 billion in the first quarter, compared to an increase of $204.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The BEA said the decrease in real GDP in Q1 primarily reflected an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and a decrease in government spending. The government entity believes the movements in growth were partly offset by increases in investment, consumer spending, and exports. Data also revealed that the real GDP was revised up 0.1 percentage point from the advance estimate, reflecting an upward revision to investment that was partly offset by a downward revision to consumer spending. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased by 3.6%, the same as previously estimated. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased by 3.4%, which was revised down by 0.1 percentage points from the previous estimate.

This move, which comes amidst calls from industry groups for greater regulatory certainty, has been met with both applause and criticism from within the Commission itself. On May 29, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance released a staff statement asserting that “Protocol Staking Activities,” specifically crypto staked in a proof-of-stake blockchain, do not require registration under the Securities Act, nor do they fall under its exemptions. The Division elaborated that staking rewards are deemed compensation for services rendered by node operators, rather than profits derived from “others’ entrepreneurial or managerial efforts.” This distinction is crucial, as it places these activities outside the purview of traditional securities regulation. Furthermore, custodial staking, where custodians merely act as “agents in connection with staking” without direct involvement in staking decisions, is also not classified as a securities offering. Ancillary staking services, such as slashing and early unbonding, were similarly declared “merely administrative or ministerial in nature” and not subject to securities classification. Industry Welcomes The guidance provides a much-needed sigh of relief for many in the crypto industry, who have long grappled with regulatory ambiguity. During Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York earlier in May, crypto industry groups had specifically urged the SEC to provide formal guidance on staking , highlighting the prevalent regulatory uncertainty faced by Web3 infrastructure providers. Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, a prominent voice in the agency’s Crypto Task Force, lauded the guidance as “welcome clarity for stakers and staking-as-a-service providers in the United States.” She emphasized that the previous uncertainty had “artificially constrained participation in network consensus and undermined the decentralization, censorship resistance, and credible neutrality of proof-of-stake blockchains.” SEC Democrat Commissioner Criticizes the Move However, the SEC’s sole Democrat commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw , expressed strong dissent. Crenshaw argued that the guidance “fails to deliver a reliable roadmap for determining whether a staking service” constitutes an investment contract under securities laws, as defined by the longstanding Howey test. She criticized the staff’s analysis, stating that it “may reflect what some wish the law to be, but it does not square with the court decisions on staking and the longstanding Howey precedent on which they are based.” It is important to note that the staff statement explicitly mentioned that it “has no legal force or effect” and did not address other forms of staking, such as liquid staking and restaking, leaving room for future regulatory considerations.

Get ready for some really significant news in the US crypto market. After facing some serious headwinds and temporary restrictions, Binance.US, one of the major players in the United States, has just made a crucial announcement that’s set to bring a sigh of relief to many users. Yes, you heard that right – Binance.US is officially resuming its U.S. dollar services! This means users can once again easily make USD deposits on Binance.US and subsequently use those funds to buy crypto on Binance.US , specifically through convenient bank transfers. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the platform. Why is This Binance.US News So Important? You might recall that back in June 2023, Binance.US had to temporarily suspend USD deposits and withdrawals. This move came amidst a challenging regulatory environment, particularly following actions taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suspension of fiat services created considerable difficulties for users looking to fund their accounts or cash out their crypto holdings. It restricted how users could interact with the platform using traditional money, forcing many to look for alternative methods or exchanges. The ability to easily move money between your bank account and a crypto exchange is fundamental to participating in the market. Without straightforward USD deposits Binance.US faced limitations in attracting new users and retaining existing ones who preferred the convenience of direct bank transfers. This news of resuming services isn’t just about restoring functionality; it’s a strong signal that the platform is navigating its challenges and working to provide essential services to its user base. The Big Announcement: What’s Back on Binance.US? Binance.US took to their official X (formerly Twitter) account to share the good news. The core of the announcement is the resumption of U.S. dollar services. Specifically, this includes: USD Deposits: Users can now deposit U.S. dollars into their Binance.US accounts directly from their bank accounts. Crypto Purchases: With deposited USD, users can now purchase cryptocurrencies available on the platform. Method: These services are accessible via bank transfers, primarily through Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers. This marks a significant step towards restoring full functionality, particularly for users who rely on ACH transfers for their speed and low cost compared to wire transfers or other methods. The return of Binance.US bank transfer capabilities is a key element in making the platform more accessible and user-friendly once again. How Can You Make USD Deposits on Binance.US Now? For users eager to get back to using bank transfers, the process on Binance.US is designed to be relatively straightforward, similar to how it worked before the suspension. While the exact steps might have minor UI updates, the general flow involves linking your bank account and initiating a transfer. Here’s a general idea of the steps involved: Log In: Access your Binance.US account through the website or mobile app. Navigate to Deposits: Look for the ‘Wallet’ or ‘Deposit’ section. Select USD: Choose ‘USD’ as the currency you wish to deposit. Choose Method: Select ‘Bank Transfer’ or ‘ACH’. Link Account (if not already): If your bank account isn’t linked, you’ll need to follow the prompts to securely connect it. This usually involves logging into your bank portal through a secure third-party service or verifying micro-deposits. Enter Amount: Specify the amount of USD you wish to deposit. Confirm Transfer: Review the details and confirm the transaction. Once the ACH transfer is initiated, it typically takes a few business days for the funds to settle in your Binance.US account. However, in many cases, exchanges allow you to trade with a portion of the deposited funds almost immediately, while the full amount becomes available after settlement. This speed makes Binance.US bank transfer a preferred method for many. The Benefits: Why is This Good News for Users and Binance.US? The resumption of USD services brings a multitude of benefits, impacting both the users and the exchange itself. Benefits for Users: Convenience: Easily move money from your bank account directly to the exchange without needing intermediaries or alternative methods. Cost-Effectiveness: ACH transfers are typically much cheaper, often free, compared to wire transfers or using debit/credit cards which can incur higher fees. This makes it more affordable to buy crypto on Binance.US . Accessibility: Provides a familiar and widely used method for funding accounts, making crypto more accessible to a broader audience. Faster Access to Funds: While settlement takes time, the ability to initiate deposits directly from a bank account is often quicker than other methods used during the restriction period. Benefits for Binance.US: Increased Trading Volume: With easier funding options, users are more likely to deposit funds and trade, potentially increasing the platform’s overall trading volume. User Retention & Acquisition: The return of a core service helps retain users who might have considered leaving and attracts new users looking for a platform with straightforward fiat on-ramps. Improved Reputation: Successfully restoring services, especially after facing regulatory hurdles, can help rebuild trust and demonstrate resilience. Strengthened Position: In the competitive US market, offering reliable fiat services is essential to compete with other major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. This positive Binance.US news is a win-win, enhancing the user experience while bolstering the platform’s operational capabilities. Buying Crypto on Binance.US: Easier Than Ever? With your USD successfully deposited via bank transfer, the process to buy crypto on Binance.US becomes significantly simpler. You can now use your USD balance directly to purchase a wide range of cryptocurrencies available on the platform. This eliminates the need for workarounds that users might have employed when direct USD deposits were unavailable. The platform typically offers various ways to buy crypto: Spot Trading: Place market or limit orders on the spot market using your USD balance against various crypto pairs (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD, ADA/USD). Buy/Sell Feature: Use a simplified interface that allows you to quickly convert a specified amount of USD into a chosen cryptocurrency at the current market price. The availability of easy USD funding directly impacts the ease and speed with which users can react to market movements and execute their trading strategies. Comparing Deposit Methods: Why Binance.US Bank Transfer Stands Out While exchanges often offer multiple ways to fund your account, the Binance.US bank transfer (ACH) method has distinct advantages, particularly when compared to alternatives like debit/credit card purchases or wire transfers. Let’s look at a simple comparison: Method Speed (Funding) Typical Fees Convenience Availability for Trading Bank Transfer (ACH) 1-3 business days (settlement) Low to None High (Link bank account) Often immediate (partial) Debit/Credit Card Instant Higher (often 3-5%) High (Enter card details) Immediate (full amount) Wire Transfer Same day to 1 business day Moderate to High (Flat fee) Moderate (Requires bank visit/online setup) Immediate (full amount) As you can see, while debit/credit cards offer instant funding, the fees are usually significantly higher. Wire transfers are faster than ACH for settlement but typically involve higher flat fees and might be less convenient. The ACH Binance.US bank transfer strikes a good balance between cost and convenience, making it a preferred method for regular deposits and funding your account to buy crypto on Binance.US . Challenges and Considerations: What Should Users Watch Out For? While the return of USD deposits is fantastic news, it’s important for users to remain aware of the broader context and potential considerations: Withdrawals: The announcement specifically mentioned deposits and purchases. Users should verify the status and availability of USD withdrawals via bank transfer. While deposits resuming is a strong indicator, withdrawal functionality is equally critical for full fiat service restoration. Regulatory Environment: The underlying regulatory challenges that led to the suspension haven’t completely disappeared. The SEC lawsuit is ongoing. Users should stay informed about the regulatory landscape and its potential impact on exchange operations in the US. This is a key piece of ongoing Binance.US news . Platform Stability: While the service is back, monitoring its stability and reliability is wise. Ensure transfers are processing smoothly and within expected timeframes. Terms and Conditions: Always review the updated terms of service and fee schedules on Binance.US, especially concerning deposit and withdrawal limits and processing times. Staying informed and exercising caution, as with any financial platform, is always recommended. What’s Next for Binance.US? The resumption of USD services is a vital step, but it’s likely part of a larger effort by Binance.US to solidify its position in the US market. Future developments might include: Resolving Regulatory Issues: The primary focus will likely remain on navigating the legal and regulatory challenges it faces. A positive resolution would significantly strengthen its long-term viability. Expanding Services: Depending on regulatory clarity, the platform might look to add more trading pairs, features, or services to compete more effectively. Ensuring Fiat Stability: Maintaining stable and reliable fiat on/off-ramps will be crucial for rebuilding and maintaining user trust. This recent development is certainly a positive turn in the ongoing Binance.US news narrative. Actionable Insights: How to Take Advantage of Resumed Services For users looking to benefit from the return of easy USD funding: Verify Your Account: Ensure your Binance.US account is fully verified (KYC) as this is required for fiat transactions. Link Your Bank Account: If you haven’t already, or if you delinked it, go through the process of securely linking your bank account for ACH transfers. Start Small: If you’re cautious, make a small test deposit first to ensure the process works smoothly for you. Understand Limits: Be aware of any daily or transactional limits placed on ACH deposits by Binance.US or your bank. Plan Your Purchases: With easy USD funding, you can plan your strategy to buy crypto on Binance.US more effectively, perhaps taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. The ability to make USD deposits Binance.US offers via bank transfer is a powerful tool for managing your crypto investments. Conclusion: A Positive Step Forward for Binance.US and Its Users The announcement that Binance.US has resumed U.S. dollar deposit and crypto purchase services via bank transfer is undoubtedly a significant and positive development. It restores a fundamental functionality that was sorely missed by users and demonstrates the platform’s commitment to operating in the US market despite regulatory pressures. The return of easy Binance.US bank transfer capabilities makes it more convenient and cost-effective for users to fund their accounts and buy crypto on Binance.US . While challenges remain, particularly regarding the broader regulatory landscape, this piece of Binance.US news is a strong indicator of progress. It benefits users by providing a familiar and efficient way to interact with the platform and benefits Binance.US by potentially boosting activity and trust. For anyone looking to participate in the US crypto market via Binance.US, this is a crucial step towards regaining seamless access.

At this point, an important move came from a Chinese company. Webus International Limited, a China-based company that provides AI-powered mobility solutions, will raise up to $300 million to create a Ripple (XRP) reserve for global payments. According to the official statement, Webus announced that it plans to raise up to $300 million in non-capital financing to create an XRP reserve. The company also said it has renewed its partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings Ltd., one of China's largest online travel platforms. The $300 million funding strategy for the XRP reserve will consist of a mix of existing cash reserves, bank loans, shareholder guarantees, and institutional credit support from traditional banks. However, the company did not specify a timeline for the XRP purchase. Nan Zheng, Chief Executive Officer of Webus, said: “These strategic developments have the potential to create strong synergies between our domestic and international operations, “While our renewed partnership with Tongcheng strengthens our China network infrastructure, an XRP integration has the potential to revolutionize the way we handle cross-border payments for both partners and travelers worldwide.” Webus’ statement comes a day after Nasdaq-listed energy company VivoPower International announced its $121 million strategy to establish its own XRP treasury.

One significant step in this direction is the launch of a tokenized U.S. Treasury bill on the Algorand network, pioneered by the platform Midas. This move signals a growing trend towards integrating real-world assets (RWAs) into the digital asset ecosystem, offering new opportunities for investors seeking stable yield and diversification within DeFi. What is Midas mTBILL and Why Does it Matter for Algorand DeFi? Midas, known for its focus on internet-native investing solutions, recently announced the launch of mTBILL on the Algorand blockchain via their official X account. But what exactly is mTBILL? It’s a tokenized certificate designed to track short-term U.S. Treasury ETFs. Essentially, Midas is packaging exposure to highly stable, government-backed debt into a digital token that can be held, traded, and potentially used within decentralized applications on Algorand. The significance of this launch for Algorand DeFi cannot be overstated. Algorand is known for its robust, scalable, and secure blockchain architecture, making it a suitable platform for handling sophisticated financial instruments. Bringing assets like U.S. Treasury bills onto Algorand opens up possibilities: Enhanced Accessibility: Provides a way for global users, potentially even those with limited access to traditional brokerage accounts, to gain exposure to U.S. government debt. Increased Liquidity: Tokenization can make traditionally less liquid assets more easily tradable on secondary markets. Composability: Once on-chain, mTBILLs could theoretically be integrated into various DeFi protocols on Algorand, such as lending platforms or yield farming strategies, although the specific use cases would depend on Midas and other protocol developers. Transparency: Transactions involving mTBILLs on Algorand are recorded on the public ledger, offering a degree of transparency not always present in traditional finance. This integration aligns perfectly with the broader narrative of RWA tokenization , which aims to unlock the value of diverse assets, from real estate and art to commodities and financial instruments like bonds, by representing them as digital tokens on a blockchain. Midas mTBILL: A Closer Look at the Tokenized Treasury The Midas mTBILL represents a claim on underlying short-term U.S. Treasury ETFs. This structure is crucial because it means the token’s value and yield potential are tied directly to the performance of these highly stable, low-risk traditional financial products. For crypto investors, this offers a potential avenue for stability and yield that is less correlated with the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. Compared to stablecoins, which aim to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, tokenized Treasury bills offer a different value proposition. While stablecoins typically rely on reserves (cash, equivalents, or other assets), tokenized T-bills directly represent ownership or exposure to interest-bearing government debt. This means they can potentially offer a yield derived from the Treasury bills themselves, in addition to price stability (though the price would fluctuate slightly based on the underlying ETF). The design as a tokenized ‘certificate’ tracking ETFs provides a mechanism for managing and representing the underlying assets on the blockchain in a standardized way. Real-World Adoption: The First Atomic Swap on Algorand Proof of the immediate utility and functionality of mTBILL came shortly after its launch. According to a report by Cointelegraph, the first atomic swap involving mTBILL on Algorand was executed by a third party on May 27th. This transaction saw 2 million USDC exchanged directly for mTBILLs. An atomic swap is a peer-to-peer exchange of cryptocurrencies or tokens from one blockchain to another, or in this case, between different assets on the same blockchain (USDC is also available on Algorand) without needing a trusted third party or intermediary. This specific swap demonstrates: The operational readiness of the mTBILL token on Algorand. Demand for this type of tokenized asset. The ability to seamlessly exchange significant value between stablecoins and tokenized RWAs on the network. This successful high-value transaction is a strong indicator of potential institutional or large-scale investor interest in using crypto treasury bills for managing liquidity or seeking yield within the DeFi ecosystem. Exploring the Potential of RWA Tokenization on Algorand The launch of tokenized U.S. Treasury bills by Midas on Algorand is more than just a single product release; it’s a tangible example of the growing RWA tokenization trend. As more real-world assets are brought onto blockchains, the potential for DeFi expands dramatically. This could lead to: New Investment Strategies: DeFi users can diversify their portfolios with assets traditionally only available in legacy finance. Increased Capital Efficiency: RWAs can serve as collateral in DeFi protocols, potentially unlocking significant liquidity. Broader Market Participation: Lower barriers to entry for investing in asset classes like real estate, private credit, and government debt. Algorand’s technical capabilities, including its Pure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, speed, low transaction costs, and focus on regulatory compliance and security, position it well as a platform for hosting these complex tokenized assets. The success of mTBILL could pave the way for Midas and other platforms to tokenize additional asset classes on the network. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? While the launch of Midas mTBILL is a positive step, the RWA tokenization space still faces challenges. These include regulatory clarity across different jurisdictions, the legal frameworks for enforcing ownership of the underlying assets represented by tokens, and ensuring seamless interaction between the blockchain world and traditional finance. However, the opportunities are immense. Tokenized assets like mTBILL could become fundamental building blocks in the next generation of financial markets, combining the efficiency and transparency of blockchain with the stability and scale of traditional assets. For investors on Algorand, it offers a novel way to access yield tied to one of the world’s safest asset classes. Conclusion: A Milestone for Algorand and RWA Tokenization The introduction of Midas’s tokenized U.S. Treasury bill on Algorand marks a significant milestone for both the Algorand ecosystem and the broader RWA tokenization movement. By successfully launching mTBILL and facilitating initial high-value swaps, Midas has demonstrated the viability of bringing stable, yield-bearing traditional financial assets onto a public blockchain. This development enriches the Algorand DeFi landscape, offering users new, potentially more stable, investment options and further solidifying Algorand’s position as a platform capable of supporting sophisticated financial applications. As the trend of RWA tokenization continues to gain momentum, initiatives like mTBILL will be crucial in shaping the future intersection of traditional finance and decentralized technology, making crypto treasury bills a topic to watch closely.

A mysterious filing by Justin W. Keener with an emergency motion has resurfaced again. Decisive Evidence Change The Outcome? Keener says that he has “decisive evidence” which could change the outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC case in favor of Ripple. This unexpected move invited comments from experts like Bill Morgan and Marc Fagel.

He didn’t expect a lengthy, emotional rant against the Howey Test and its court interpretations, especially about “investment contracts.” The rant also criticized the SEC’s actions over the past 90 years. “This case never fails to entertain or end,” he said, which shows how unpredictable the lawsuit has become. Marc Fagel also pointed out that this is the second time the same individual has submitted documents. The SEC even responded to the first one but questioned why the court hasn’t shut down the person’s PACER account yet, given the unauthorized filings. Keener’s first attempt to submit his “decisive evidence” in the Ripple case was shut down back in April, but he’s now trying again. Keener was recently fined $10 million for illegally trading penny stocks without registering as a dealer. Will This Impact The Lawsuit? The XRP community is watching closely if this would have any impact on the lawsuit. Most expect the court to reject it again, but how the judge and SEC respond this time will show whether it has any real impact. In a recent letter to SEC, Ripple said that fungible crypto assets like XRP aren’t securities in secondary sales. Citing legal expert Lewis Cohen and a 2023 court ruling, Ripple argued that these tokens don’t carry the legal traits of securities and requested the SEC to adopt clearer rules, noting that XRP itself was ruled not a security in public trading.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 10:13:06

The pullback comes amid a rise in profit-taking activity, with data showing that BTC holders selling has reached a three-month high. Despite this near-term selling pressure, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains solid. Firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and GameStop have been adding BTC to their corporate treasuries, underscoring continued confidence in the asset’s long-term value. According to Glassnode’s latest weekly report, investor profitability and spending behavior have picked up meaningfully, though current metrics remain well below levels typically seen at the peak of prior bull markets. This suggests that while short-term corrections are underway, the broader uptrend remains intact with room for further upside if institutional accumulation continues. As Bitcoin remains range-bound and profit-taking sets in following its recent gains, retail attention is shifting toward emerging and unique narratives like Bitcoin Pepe, which is nearing the end of its presale. The flagship cryptocurrency’s increasing maturity, declining volatility, and deepening institutional involvement have diluted its appeal among investors chasing explosive upside potential. This dynamic is evident in Bitcoin’s current inability to break out decisively despite broader market optimism. Meanwhile, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are drawing speculative capital from traders willing to tolerate some risk in pursuit of potentially outsized gains. BTC ETFs inflow streak broken US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358.6 million in net outflows on Thursday, marking the end of a 10-day streak of positive flows that had brought in a combined $4.26 billion. The reversal underscores a shift in investor sentiment after a sustained period of inflows, largely driven by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT was the only fund to post net inflows on the day, attracting $125 million, according to data from SoSoValue. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC led the day’s outflows with $166.32 million exiting the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC followed with $107.53 million in net redemptions, while Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB saw $89.22 million in outflows. Bitwise’s BITB posted $70.85 million in redemptions, with additional withdrawals reported from ETFs issued by VanEck, Valkyrie, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton. As of Wednesday, total net inflows across the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs had reached $45.34 billion. With Thursday’s outflows, the cumulative figure dropped to $44.99 billion. Bitcoin Pepe: time to buy in? Even as Bitcoin stabilizes, its recent push to new highs is once again lifting sentiment across the crypto market — a trend that has historically preceded broader rallies. As capital rotates back into digital assets, speculative segments such as meme coins are drawing heightened investor interest. Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a key beneficiary of this shift. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself at the intersection of meme culture and blockchain utility. The project seeks to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability — a technical edge that sets it apart from most meme tokens, which typically lack infrastructure. To develop its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has announced a string of strategic partnerships. These include partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. A collaboration with the GETE Network also aims to extend Bitcoin Pepe’s reach into the cross-chain Web3 gaming space. The project’s attempt to combine real-world utility with viral meme appeal appears to be gaining traction. Its ongoing presale has raised over $12.4 million, with BPEP tokens currently priced at $0.0377. With just over a day left until the presale ends on May 31, 2025, Bitcoin Pepe is drawing increased attention. A listing on centralized exchanges is expected soon after, a potential near-term catalyst for price action.

At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, which hosted important names for three days, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino also made important statements about Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and the cryptocurrency industry. Paolo Ardoino, who made statements supporting and praising Bitcoin, stated that Bitcoin is much more than a digital asset and said, “Bitcoin is the ultimate social network.” Comparing Tether to Facebook, the Tether CEO said, “Tether has experienced growth that is equivalent to what Facebook once did.” Bitcoin and Gold Reserves! Paolo Ardonio, who also announced Tether's reserves, stated that the company has over 100 thousand Bitcoins (worth over $10 billion) and 50 tons of gold in its reserves. Ardoino also said that Tether made around $13 billion in profits in 2024, making it the most successful and profitable name in the crypto industry. The famous CEO also explained Tether's decision to hold gold in its reserves and the reasons for it. Noting that Bitcoin supporters questioned Tether's decision on gold, Ardoino said: “A lot of Bitcoiners don’t like talking about gold because they think it takes something away from Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is perfect. Gold is imperfect. “At this point, gold is not competing with Bitcoin. Gold is competing with fiat money, and that's why we like gold quite a bit.” The famous CEO finally stated that Tether has made a profit of approximately $20 billion in the last three years and said: “Less than 5 percent of this profit has been paid to shareholders. The remaining 95 percent will be used to expand the global distribution network and reinvest in Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

Among the best tokens to invest in are Cardano (ADA) Solana (SOL) Dogecoin (DOGE) and the emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano is gaining momentum with increased institutional support and strategic partnerships positioning it as a strong coin in the crypto market. Solana backed by optimistic forecasts from major financial institutions is projected to reach new heights making it a top cryptocurrency to watch. Dogecoin, bolstered by a dedicated community and influential endorsements continues to show resilience and potential for growth. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new entrant in the market, is attracting attention for its innovative approach and promising ROI potential. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.5 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,400 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. With the crypto fear and greed index indicating a favorable investment climate, these cryptocurrencies represent some of the best options for those looking to capitalize on the upcoming market boom. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin: Leading the Pack as 2025 Approaches Cardano (ADA), which is trading at around $0.76, keeps adding strength to its solid foundation through network enhancements that are geared towards scalability and smart contract adoption, making it a good option among the best crypto investments today. Solana (SOL), which trades at around $174, enjoys its high-speed transactions and growing DeFi ecosystem, driving hopes for its capability to reach higher targets in the near future. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE), still going strong at about $0.22, gains further traction in its loyal base and celebrity backing and thus sits as a strong player among investors seeking convenient exposure to crypto markets. As the established coins accumulate for the rumored 2025 boom, emerging tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also beginning to receive attention for their growth potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,400 investors have invested $9.5 million in the presale, a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $2.50 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin remain solid picks, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the standout. With $9.5M raised and 11,400+ investors, the $0.03 presale offers 100% ROI at launch. Backed by a Certik audit and real DeFi utility, MUTM is a top buy now. Join the presale before the next price increase.

The country’s financial watchdog, the Thailand SEC , is cracking down on several major international cryptocurrency exchanges. If you use platforms like Bybit, OKX, CoinEx, 1000X, or XT, this affects you directly. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand has announced that these platforms will be blocked starting June 28, 2024, due to operating without the required digital asset business licenses. This move highlights the increasing focus on crypto regulation Thailand is implementing to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Why is the Thailand SEC Taking This Action? The primary reason cited by the Thailand SEC for this drastic measure is the operation of these platforms without proper licensing. In Thailand, engaging in digital asset business activities, including operating a cryptocurrency exchange, requires explicit approval from the SEC. This regulatory framework is designed to ensure platforms adhere to strict standards regarding security, compliance, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Operating without a license means these exchanges are not subject to the same oversight as licensed entities, potentially exposing users to higher risks. The SEC views unlicensed operations as a violation of the country’s digital asset laws. By blocking access and pursuing legal action, the regulator aims to: Protect Thai investors from potential risks associated with unregulated platforms. Ensure fair competition among digital asset operators, favoring those who comply with local laws. Strengthen the overall integrity and stability of the Thai digital asset market. Which Crypto Exchanges Are Affected by the Ban? The announcement specifically names five international crypto exchanges that will face the block. It’s crucial for users in Thailand to be aware of which platforms are included. The affected exchanges are: Bybit OKX CoinEx 1000X XT These platforms are popular globally, and many Thai residents have likely been using them due to their wide range of services, diverse altcoin listings, and sometimes competitive fees compared to local options. The impending block means users will lose access to their accounts and funds held on these platforms from June 28th onwards unless they take action. What Does This Mean for Users of Bybit, OKX, and CoinEx in Thailand? This is perhaps the most critical question for individuals using these platforms. The blocking action means that, from the specified date, users within Thailand may find it difficult or impossible to access the websites or mobile applications of Bybit , OKX , CoinEx , 1000X, and XT. This loss of access directly impacts their ability to trade, manage their portfolios, and most importantly, withdraw their assets. The SEC’s typical procedure in such cases involves requiring the blocked platforms to facilitate the withdrawal of assets for their Thai users within a specified timeframe before the block becomes fully effective. However, the statement also mentions pursuing legal action, which could complicate the process. Users should immediately check communications from these exchanges for specific instructions regarding asset withdrawal deadlines and procedures. Navigating Crypto Regulation Thailand: What Are Your Options? For users affected by the ban, understanding the current crypto regulation Thailand has in place is key to finding compliant alternatives. Thailand has a relatively mature regulatory framework for digital assets compared to some other countries. The SEC licenses and oversees several domestic digital asset exchanges and brokers. If you are a Thai resident using one of the blocked exchanges, here are some actionable steps you should consider immediately: Identify Your Assets: Log in to your Bybit, OKX, CoinEx, 1000X, or XT account (while you still can) and make a detailed list of all the cryptocurrencies and funds you hold on the platform. Check for Withdrawal Information: Look for official announcements from the exchange regarding the Thailand situation and withdrawal deadlines for Thai users. Act quickly, as time is limited. Withdraw Your Funds: Initiate withdrawals of all your assets from the affected exchanges to a personal wallet or to a licensed Thai digital asset exchange. Prioritize this step as access will be cut off. Explore Licensed Alternatives: Research and open accounts with digital asset exchanges that are licensed and regulated by the Thailand SEC. This ensures you are trading on a platform compliant with local laws. Examples of licensed exchanges in Thailand include Bitkub, Satang Pro (now Orbix Trade), Zipmex (currently under rehabilitation), and others. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from the Thailand SEC and the affected exchanges. Regulatory situations can evolve. Transitioning to a licensed platform is crucial for continued participation in the Thai crypto market in a compliant manner. Comparing Regulatory Approaches: Thailand vs. Global Trends Thailand’s approach to digital asset regulation reflects a global trend where regulators are increasingly scrutinizing cryptocurrency platforms. Many countries are implementing licensing regimes to bring exchanges under regulatory purview, similar to traditional financial institutions. This aims to mitigate risks such as money laundering, terrorist financing, market manipulation, and investor fraud. While some jurisdictions take a more permissive stance, others, like Thailand, are adopting stricter measures to ensure compliance. The action against Bybit , OKX , and CoinEx , among others, serves as a stark reminder that operating in any country requires understanding and adhering to its specific legal and regulatory requirements. Exchanges that fail to do so risk facing similar consequences. The benefits of regulation, from a governmental perspective, include enhanced investor protection through mandated security standards, segregation of client funds, and robust compliance frameworks. Challenges include the potential for stifling innovation if regulations are too stringent and the difficulty of enforcing rules on borderless internet platforms. What Happens Next? Legal Action and Market Impact The Thailand SEC has stated it will pursue legal action against the non-compliant platforms. The exact nature of this legal action was not detailed in the initial reports but could involve formal complaints, investigations, and potentially penalties or further restrictions. This adds another layer of complexity to the situation, particularly for the exchanges involved. The market impact within Thailand could see an increase in trading volume on licensed domestic exchanges as users migrate their funds. For the blocked international exchanges, losing access to the Thai market represents a loss of users and potential revenue. The news also sends a strong signal to other international platforms operating in Thailand without a license that they risk similar enforcement action. Ensuring Compliance in the Digital Asset Space This situation underscores the critical importance of compliance for any business operating in the digital asset space, especially across different jurisdictions. For international exchanges like Bybit , OKX , and CoinEx , navigating diverse regulatory landscapes is a significant challenge but a necessary one for sustainable global operations. For users, it highlights the importance of using regulated platforms to ensure their assets are protected under local laws. As the digital asset market continues to evolve, we can expect regulators worldwide to refine their approaches. The focus on licensing and investor protection is likely to remain a key theme in crypto regulation Thailand and beyond. Summary: The Clock is Ticking for Unlicensed Crypto Exchanges in Thailand In conclusion, the Thailand SEC’s decision to block access to Bybit, OKX, CoinEx, 1000X, and XT from June 28th is a major development stemming from their operation without the required digital asset business licenses. This action is part of Thailand’s broader efforts to strengthen crypto regulation Thailand , protect investors, and ensure market integrity. Users of these platforms in Thailand must act swiftly to withdraw their assets before the deadline and consider migrating to licensed local exchanges to ensure continued, compliant participation in the market. The situation serves as a powerful reminder of the growing global trend towards stricter oversight of crypto exchanges and the consequences of non-compliance.

Here’s What’s Coming,https://timestabloid.com/today-is-crucial-for-xrp-holders-heres-whats-coming/,"The crypto world is holding its breath today as XRP Las Vegas (XRPLV) kicks off, a moment anticipated not just by retail holders but by serious builders, capital allocators, and global onlookers alike. While the broader crypto scene often gets clouded by flashy stunts, meme-driven hype, and sometimes circus-like spectacles, as we saw this week at another Vegas crypto event, XRP Las Vegas promises to deliver something fundamentally different. In a yesterday post, Crypto analyst Stellar Rippler, known for deep macro insights on the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem, summed it up pointedly in a post on X: “When XRP Las Vegas happens tomorrow, it won’t be costumes, memes, or cow dances. It’ll be suits, smart minds, real builders, and world-changing integrations… XRPLV will be the G20 of crypto.” That framing sets the tone: this is a gathering not for empty noise but for meaningful, ecosystem-shifting announcements that could define XRP’s next chapter. After the circus in Vegas this week, I’m just saying… When XRP Las Vegas happens tomorrow, it won’t be costumes, memes, or cow dances. It’ll be suits, smart minds, real builders, and world-changing integrations. XRPLV will be the G20 of crypto. Quiet rooms. Serious capital.… pic.twitter.com/sYOFaWlD4x — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) May 29, 2025 A Turning Point for XRP XRP holders are watching closely because this isn’t just another blockchain conference; it’s unfolding at a pivotal time for the Ripple ecosystem. After Ripple’s historic partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions, the token has steadily regained both market legitimacy and institutional curiosity. Since then, Ripple has aggressively pursued partnerships, CBDC pilots, cross-border payment corridors, and integrations that stretch beyond U.S. shores, especially in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. XRPLV is set to showcase groundbreaking integrations that harness Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX), and innovations like the EVM-compatible sidechain developed with Peersyst Technology, enabling smart contract functionality on XRPL. Although specifics about today’s announcements are yet to be disclosed, insiders and analysts alike have hinted at potential institutional tie-ups, cross-chain bridge solutions, and further CBDC progress, making this a high-stakes event for both XRP’s price trajectory and its long-term ecosystem health. The Weight of Institutional Eyes Unlike the typical retail-driven hype cycles that dominate crypto headlines, XRPLV is drawing serious capital players — hedge funds, fintech firms, cross-border payment giants, and even central bank observers — who are watching Ripple’s execution carefully. Stellar Rippler’s post underscores this institutional pivot, describing XRPLV as “the G20 of crypto,” where quiet rooms, sharp minds, and major capital converge, far from the chaos of meme coins and speculative frenzies. Ripple’s institutional focus is crucial, given its unique strategy that sets it apart from other cryptocurrency initiatives. While Bitcoin leans into its store-of-value narrative and Ethereum positions itself as the decentralized world computer, Ripple has aimed squarely at real-world financial use cases — frictionless cross-border settlements, instant liquidity access, and seamless integration with existing monetary systems. This development could solidify XRP’s position as a neutral bridge asset in the rapidly evolving digital payments ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Global Spotlight As global regulations tighten and financial institutions cautiously adopt digital assets, XRPLV showcases Ripple’s commitment to compliance and enterprise readiness. The crypto industry has been under immense pressure to prove it can scale responsibly, and Ripple, having weathered one of the most high-profile legal battles in crypto history, stands uniquely positioned to lead by example. Observers expect Ripple executives, technical leads, and partner institutions to unveil new products, pilot results, and perhaps even major corporate integrations that could accelerate the XRP Ledger’s global adoption. Given Ripple’s momentum, any announcements made today will likely ripple (pun intended) across both institutional and retail markets, reinforcing XRP’s reputation not just as a speculative asset but as a foundational component of the evolving digital financial system. Why Today Matters for XRP Holders For XRP holders, today is about much more than price action — it’s about clarity on Ripple’s strategic roadmap. Will Ripple solidify its leadership in cross-border finance? Will the XRPL ecosystem expand meaningfully into DeFi and smart contracts through the EVM sidechain? Will Ripple’s CBDC pilots turn into production-level deployments with central banks? These are the big-picture questions XRP holders want answered, and XRPLV promises to deliver. In short, this is a moment where retail meets institution, where crypto’s potential meets enterprise reality, and where XRP’s years of foundational work could finally translate into scaled, global impact. As Stellar Rippler put it, “The world will watch.” The crypto industry, and potentially the wider financial sector, is now keenly focused on XRP Las Vegas.

If so, you might have noticed a significant shift in momentum recently. A key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , has dropped, signalling that the market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This shift has important implications for investors and enthusiasts alike, impacting Altcoin Performance and highlighting broader Cryptocurrency Trends . What Does the Altcoin Season Index at 22 Really Mean? Let’s dive into the specifics. The Altcoin Season Index , a valuable metric provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a reading of 22. As reported at 00:45 UTC on May 30, this marked a decrease of three points from the previous day. What does this number tell us? It’s a clear indicator that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . The index itself is quite straightforward in its methodology. It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The scale runs from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: For the market to be considered in Altcoin Season, a significant majority – specifically, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins – must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin during the same timeframe. The ‘In-Between’: Readings between 25 and 75 typically suggest a more neutral or mixed market environment, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a dominant edge in performance relative to each other. A reading of 22 falls well within the threshold for Bitcoin Season , indicating that over the last three months, a vast majority of the leading altcoins have lagged behind Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season So, the index says it’s Bitcoin Season . What does this practically mean for those involved in the Crypto Market ? Historically, Bitcoin Season often occurs after a period of strong Bitcoin price increases, where the leading cryptocurrency captures a larger share of the total market capitalization – a metric known as Bitcoin Dominance. While the index specifically tracks relative performance rather than dominance percentage, the two often correlate. During Bitcoin Season , we typically see: Bitcoin Leads the Way: Bitcoin tends to show stronger price momentum and relative stability compared to many altcoins. Altcoins Lag or Decline: Many altcoins may struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin’s gains, and some might even see declines, especially those with lower market caps or less established use cases. Reduced Altcoin Mania: The speculative frenzy often associated with Altcoin Season, where even lesser-known projects can see massive pumps, is typically subdued. Focus Shifts: Investor and media attention often consolidates around Bitcoin’s price movements and developments. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions within the Crypto Market . It doesn’t mean altcoins can’t perform, but the probability of widespread, explosive Altcoin Performance is lower when the index is this low. Comparing Altcoin Performance vs. Bitcoin: The Current Picture The core of the Altcoin Season Index is this direct comparison: how many altcoins are beating Bitcoin over 90 days? With the index at 22, it tells us that roughly only 22% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last three months. This paints a clear picture of where relative strength lies in the market right now. Consider it this way: Metric Condition for Altcoin Season Condition for Bitcoin Season Current Status (Index at 22) % of Top 100 Altcoins Outperforming Bitcoin (Last 90 Days) >= 75% Approx. 22% This table clearly illustrates why the index indicates Bitcoin Season . The vast majority of the largest altcoins have not kept pace with Bitcoin’s price action over the recent past. This isn’t necessarily a judgment on the long-term potential of individual altcoin projects, but it reflects the prevailing short-to-medium term market sentiment and capital flow. Understanding Cryptocurrency Trends: Is This Normal? Observing Cryptocurrency Trends often reveals cyclical patterns. The market rarely moves in a straight line, and periods of Bitcoin dominance are a natural part of these cycles. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes or coincides with a period where altcoins lag behind. Sometimes, this is followed by a phase where profits from Bitcoin are rotated into altcoins, potentially triggering a new Altcoin Season. Several factors can contribute to a shift towards Bitcoin Season : Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainty in traditional markets can sometimes lead investors to favor Bitcoin as a relatively safer, more liquid crypto asset compared to smaller altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional inflows often target Bitcoin first due to its size, liquidity, and established infrastructure (like Bitcoin ETFs). Network Developments: Significant upgrades or events specific to Bitcoin can draw attention and investment. Market Psychology: Strong upward price momentum in Bitcoin can create a fear of missing out (FOMO) effect, pulling capital away from altcoins. Recognizing these Cryptocurrency Trends helps put the current Altcoin Season Index reading into context. It’s a snapshot of the market’s current state, influenced by a confluence of factors. Actionable Insights for the Current Market Given the market is in Bitcoin Season according to the index, what are some things investors might consider? (Note: This is not financial advice, always do your own research). Focus on Bitcoin: If you are bullish on the overall crypto market, concentrating on Bitcoin might align with the current trend indicated by the index. Review Altcoin Holdings: Evaluate the performance of your altcoin portfolio. Are your holdings among the few outperforming Bitcoin, or are they lagging? This might inform decisions about rebalancing. Research Quality Projects: Even in Bitcoin Season, strong altcoin projects with solid fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases can still perform well or present accumulation opportunities at lower prices. Manage Risk: Volatility can still be high. Employ risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses or diversifying within your crypto portfolio (even if that diversification leans towards Bitcoin). Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. A shift back towards a higher reading could signal a potential change in dynamics. Understanding the nuances of Altcoin Performance in different market cycles is key to navigating the crypto landscape effectively. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of the Crypto Market The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 22 is a clear signal that the Crypto Market is currently favoring Bitcoin. This Bitcoin Season means that, for now, Altcoin Performance on average is lagging behind the pioneer cryptocurrency. These Cryptocurrency Trends are part of the market’s natural ebb and flow, influenced by various internal and external factors. While Bitcoin leads, it’s a period for investors to assess their strategies, focus on research, and manage risk, understanding that market conditions can and do change. Staying informed about key indicators like the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable perspective on the prevailing market dynamics.

Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management (CFAM) says that the Fitzgerald Gold Protected Bitcoin Fund will give investors direct exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency as well as one-to-one downside protection based on the price of gold. The firm, which holds approximately $14.8 billion in assets under management (AUM), says the fund will be its first Bitcoin-focused investment vehicle. Says Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Brandon G. Lutnick, “At Cantor, we are focused on delivering innovative products that support clients seeking exposure to digital asset investments. We believe this is a truly groundbreaking investment vehicle—one that helps investors to tap into Bitcoin’s potential growth with downside protection based on the price of gold.” CFAM says the fund is structured with a five-year duration and will begin accepting capital from investors in the coming weeks.

According to multiple crypto analysts, MUTM is not only undervalued at its current price of $0.03 but also offers the strongest mix of utility, real-world use cases, and early-stage ROI potential. Unlike many of its speculative peers that lack functional products or audited technology, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart with a working protocol, a roadmap to launch, and an engaged user base. What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) different? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that supports both P2P (peer-to-peer) and P2C (peer-to-contract) lending and borrowing models. This dual approach enables unmatched flexibility. While P2C offers stable passive income through pool-based lending, the P2P model gives users the freedom to lend and borrow niche tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Pepe (PEPE)—something that major platforms still don’t support. This feature is especially appealing to memecoin traders who have limited options when it comes to borrowing against or earning yield on their assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) solves this gap while also offering customizable loan terms and dynamic interest rates based on pool utilization. Investors who supply liquidity via stablecoins like DAI can earn passive income through interest, which adjusts according to market conditions. At high pool utilization, the yield can climb to double-digit annual returns. For those focused on capital gains, the math speaks for itself. An investment of $1,000 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at today’s price of $0.03 results in 33,333 tokens. As the token reaches a conservative target of $1, those tokens would be worth over $33,000, marking a 30x return. Even at a $0.75 valuation, that same $1,000 becomes $25,000. These numbers aren’t just hype—they’re based on a realistic view of market cycles and the rising importance of audited, functional DeFi protocols. With over $9.45 million raised so far in Phase 5, demand is increasing rapidly. Investors in early phases have already seen their entries rise by 100% to 200%, as earlier rounds were priced as low as $0.01. Those who wait for later phases risk paying more for smaller upside, making now the most strategic time to get in. CertiK audit validates security Security is another reason analysts are confident in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The protocol has been audited by CertiK, one of the industry’s most respected blockchain security firms. The audit, which includes manual code review and static analysis, returned a Token Scan Score of 70, confirming that Mutuum’s backend is not only legitimate but resilient against known vulnerabilities. Unlike many project tokens that serve little purpose beyond speculative trading, MUTM has direct, ongoing utility within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. Holders gain access to yield tiers and in lending pools that actually shape the future of the protocol. As the platform scales, demand for MUTM will increase not only from speculators but from users who need the token to fully utilize the system’s features. As an added benefit, users who deposit ETH or DAI into the liquidity pools receive mtTokens, which accumulate value in real time. A deposit of $5,000 in DAI into an active pool will generate up to 12% annual interest, depending on utilization. That’s $600 a year in passive income, far outpacing most traditional savings accounts or centralized crypto lending platforms. Growing community and roadmap momentum Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has over 11,650 holders and continues to grow.

Starting from May 30 at 10:30 UTC, traders can now take advantage of up to 75x leverage on HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid. However, despite this exciting launch, HYPE’s price has surprised many by dropping 4.5% in the past 24 hours instead of going up. Binance Futures Lists HYPE According to the Binance announcement , the HYPE/USDT perpetual contract went live on May 30 at 10:30 UTC. This new contract is designed to give traders more flexibility and high-leverage opportunities. Binance has set a maximum funding rate of +2.00% or -2.00% at launch, and funding fees are settled every four hours. Binance also mentioned that they may adjust these numbers in the future based on market risks, so traders need to stay alert. This new contract will also be available for Futures Copy Trading within a day, making it easier for newcomers to follow top traders. But Why No Price Pump? Despite this big launch, HYPE’s price didn’t go up. In fact, it dropped by 11% in the past week, now sitting at around $32.8. This has left many people scratching their heads, especially since HYPE has been on fire lately. Over the past month, the token has jumped 78%, beating out other top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, currently ranked as the 12th biggest cryptocurrency in the world.

News recently broke about a significant development in the fight against crypto crime: a key figure behind a massive Crypto scam South Korea has finally been apprehended after evading authorities for over two years abroad. This arrest shines a spotlight on the ongoing challenges faced by regulators and law enforcement globally in tackling large-scale cryptocurrency fraud. Understanding the Massive Scope of the Korean Crypto Scam So, what exactly happened? According to reports, a criminal group orchestrated a vast Korean crypto scam that defrauded over 15,000 individuals out of a staggering 325.6 billion won, which translates to approximately $236.67 million US dollars. This wasn’t a small operation; it was a highly organized effort that ran from December 2021 to March 2023. Here are the key details of this extensive fraud: Total Amount Scammed: 325.6 billion won ($236.67 million) Number of Victims: 15,304 people Timeline: December 2021 to March 2023 Modus Operandi: Promising impossibly high returns on investments in 28 different cryptocurrencies. This scale of loss highlights the devastating impact such schemes can have on individual investors, many of whom likely invested their savings hoping for financial growth. How Did This Cryptocurrency Investment Fraud Operate? Large-scale frauds like this often rely on classic Ponzi or pyramid scheme tactics, adapted for the crypto age. In this specific Cryptocurrency investment fraud , the criminals allegedly lured victims by making unrealistic promises of significant profits. They claimed these returns would come from trading and issuing 28 different cryptocurrencies. It’s highly probable that these cryptocurrencies were either entirely fake, or the scheme relied on bringing in new investors’ money to pay off earlier investors, creating the illusion of profitability until the scheme inevitably collapsed. Schemes promising guaranteed, high, and fast returns are major red flags in any investment, but especially in the volatile and often complex crypto market. The promise of investing in multiple different coins likely added a layer of perceived legitimacy or complexity, making it harder for average investors to spot the fraud. The Hunt for the Crypto Fraud Arrest Ringleader Following the collapse of the scheme and the filing of complaints, South Korean police launched a prolonged investigation. Identifying and locating the key players in such cross-border crimes is incredibly challenging. The alleged ringleader managed to flee the country and remained on the run overseas for over two years. The recent Crypto fraud arrest of this key figure is a significant victory for law enforcement. It demonstrates perseverance and potentially international cooperation in tracking down individuals who believe they can escape justice by crossing borders. While the original report doesn’t detail the specifics of the capture, it underscores the commitment of authorities to pursuing those responsible for large-scale financial crimes, even when they attempt to hide abroad. What This Crypto Crime Law Enforcement Action Means The arrest of a ringleader in a scam of this magnitude sends a strong message. It signals that South Korean authorities are actively pursuing those who exploit the crypto space for criminal gain. This particular Crypto crime law enforcement action is important for several reasons: Justice for Victims: While recovering lost funds is often difficult in these cases, the arrest brings a measure of justice and accountability for the over 15,000 victims. Deterrence: High-profile arrests can deter others considering similar criminal activities. International Cooperation: Pursuing criminals overseas often requires collaboration between different countries’ law enforcement agencies, highlighting the growing need for such partnerships in the digital age. Focus on Crypto Regulation: Incidents like this add pressure on governments to enhance regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency market to protect investors. This case is a stark reminder that despite the innovative potential of cryptocurrency, the market remains vulnerable to sophisticated fraud, and robust law enforcement is crucial. Protecting Yourself from Cryptocurrency Investment Fraud While law enforcement works to catch criminals, the best defense for investors is education and caution. How can you avoid becoming a victim of Cryptocurrency investment fraud ? Beware of Unrealistic Promises: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns with little to no risk, it’s almost certainly a scam. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t invest based solely on social media hype or unsolicited advice. Research the project, the team, the technology, and the market. Verify Exchange and Platform Legitimacy: Use reputable and regulated exchanges. Be wary of new or unknown platforms. Understand What You’re Investing In: Don’t invest in cryptocurrencies or projects you don’t understand. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and be cautious of phishing attempts. Consult Financial Advisors: If unsure, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor (ensure they are knowledgeable about crypto but also independent). The prevalence of scams underscores the importance of due diligence in the crypto market. Conclusion: A Step Forward in the Fight Against Crypto Crime The arrest of the alleged ringleader in this massive Crypto scam South Korea is a significant development. It represents the successful culmination of a long investigation and demonstrates the commitment of authorities to tackling large-scale financial crime in the digital asset space. While the fight against crypto fraud is far from over, this arrest offers hope for justice for the victims and serves as a stern warning to potential criminals. It also reinforces the need for continued vigilance from investors and ongoing efforts from regulators and law enforcement worldwide to make the cryptocurrency ecosystem safer.

Following that, CETUS said on Tuesday that it is prepared to return 100% of user funds lost in a $223 million exploit, based on the outcome of a community vote. Now, a recent optimistic update joined this Friday , May 30th, a recent post from CETUS highlighted that within just 48 hours, the Sui community united to pass this critical on-chain decision. As a result of the vote, more than 90% of validators and stakers voted in CETUS’ favour. As a result, now a on-chain governance proposal to move the frozen funds into a multi-sig wallet. The vote is a critical step in Cetus’s recovery plan after a $223 million exploit on May 22 . Further, it outlined an 8-point recovery roadmap for the coming week, which includes the restoration of data, an upgraded CLMM contract, and the full resumption of other functions like LP functions, as they said in an X post. Despite the positive update, its token price has declined following the altcoin market sentiment. Keep reading to know more. Will CETUS Price Recover? With the proposal passed, it has now authorized the recovery of locked funds, enabling full reimbursement to be possible for affected users. The community awaits the beginning of the user refund process. Once completed successfully, it will become a great example of community-led recovery in the DeFi space. However, the response in CETUS crypto price action seen on Tuesday is not mimicked on Friday, not even the slightest surges are seen, despite the great optimism in CETUS. This has happened because the BTC fell to $105K, ETH fell to $2580, and SUI fell to $3.40, signifying market-wide weakness. As a result, the CETUS price has faced rejection from the Fibonacci 0.5 level at $0.16625 and is down nearly 19% to trade at $0.14492. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SlowMist Breaks Down How a Tiny Code Flaw Led to Cetus’ $230M Collapse , If market sentiment continues, then CETUS price could shatter more in the short term and impede its price recovery journey.

Economists expect a soft PCE print, potentially boosting Bitcoin and other risk assets. A high PCE reading (0.3%+ monthly core) could trigger crypto price drops and volatility. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release its key inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, tonight, putting the crypto market on watch for potential turbulence, which is a critical indicator for the Federal Reserve. With Bitcoin hovering around $106,000 and altcoins in a state of flux, traders are eyeing the PCE data for cues that could tip the scales toward long-awaited interest rate cuts. What Economists Are Expecting from Core PCE Economists expect the core PCE to rise just 0.1% in April, a soft print that would extend a three-month cooling streak in inflation. On a yearly basis, the headline PCE is projected to drop to 2.2%, its lowest in seven months, while the core reading is forecast to ease to 2.5%, the softest since March 2021.

However, a recent collaboration aims to simplify this process significantly for users interested in the USD1 stablecoin . Crypto payment gateway Alchemy Pay (ACH) has officially announced a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ), a DeFi project that has garnered attention due to its links to the Trump family. This collaboration marks a significant step towards providing seamless crypto on-ramp access for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , directly addressing one of the major hurdles for mainstream crypto adoption: converting fiat currency into digital assets easily and efficiently. What Does This Alchemy Pay and WLFI Partnership Entail? The core of this partnership revolves around integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s robust payment gateway services with the WLFI ecosystem. Announced via Alchemy Pay ‘s official Medium blog, the collaboration means that users no longer need to navigate potentially complex cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms to acquire USD1 stablecoin . Instead, they can leverage Alchemy Pay ‘s extensive network of supported payment methods to directly purchase USD1 using their preferred fiat currency. For those new to the space, a ‘ crypto on-ramp ‘ is essentially a service that allows individuals to convert their traditional fiat money (like USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) into cryptocurrency. Think of it as the bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto world. Making this bridge as smooth and accessible as possible is crucial for increasing user adoption and liquidity within specific crypto ecosystems like WLFI ‘s. By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s capabilities, WLFI is significantly lowering the barrier to entry for potential users of its USD1 stablecoin and associated DeFi services. This is particularly important for a project seeking wider reach and participation. Why is Seamless Crypto On-Ramp Access Important for USD1 Stablecoin ? Stablecoins like USD1 stablecoin are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They serve multiple purposes within the crypto landscape, including: Store of Value: Offering stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Medium of Exchange: Facilitating quick and low-cost transfers globally. DeFi Participation: Acting as essential building blocks for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols within decentralized finance platforms. However, accessing stablecoins often requires users to first buy a major cryptocurrency (like BTC or ETH) on an exchange and then trade it for the stablecoin. This multi-step process can be intimidating and cumbersome for newcomers. A direct crypto on-ramp solution, powered by a reputable payment gateway like Alchemy Pay , streamlines this process into potentially just a few clicks, making it far more user-friendly. For WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , enhanced accessibility via a direct on-ramp means: Increased liquidity for USD1 . Easier participation in any DeFi protocols or services offered by WLFI that utilize USD1 . A broader potential user base, including those less familiar with traditional crypto exchanges. How Does Alchemy Pay ‘s Payment Gateway Facilitate This? Alchemy Pay operates a comprehensive payment gateway that connects fiat and crypto economies. Its infrastructure supports a wide array of global and local payment methods, making it a versatile tool for businesses and projects looking to integrate crypto payments or on/off-ramps. Key features of Alchemy Pay ‘s payment gateway that benefit the WLFI partnership include: Extensive Payment Method Support: Acceptance of major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), various bank transfer options, and numerous local payment channels specific to different regions. Global Coverage: Ability to process transactions from users in many countries, expanding the potential reach for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin . Compliance and Security: Handling necessary regulatory compliance and security measures for processing fiat-to-crypto transactions. Ease of Integration: Providing tools and APIs that allow partners like WLFI to seamlessly embed the on-ramp service directly into their platforms or websites. This technical capability is what underpins the ‘seamless access’ touted in the announcement. Users interacting with WLFI ‘s platform (or wherever the integration is live) can now initiate a purchase of USD1 stablecoin and complete the transaction using familiar fiat payment methods, all powered by Alchemy Pay ‘s backend. Exploring the WLFI Project and USD1 Stablecoin World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ) is positioned as a DeFi project. While the original announcement highlights its link to the Trump family, the core focus from a technical perspective is its offering, specifically the USD1 stablecoin . Understanding WLFI ‘s broader goals and the intended use cases for USD1 stablecoin provides context for why a seamless crypto on-ramp is a critical piece of infrastructure for them. Typically, DeFi projects aim to recreate traditional financial services (like lending, borrowing, trading) using blockchain technology, often utilizing stablecoins as the primary medium of value exchange due to their price stability. For WLFI , the USD1 stablecoin likely serves as the native stable asset within its specific DeFi ecosystem or planned applications. Making it easy for users to acquire USD1 directly with fiat is essential for driving activity and participation within that ecosystem. The partnership with Alchemy Pay suggests WLFI is prioritizing user accessibility and aiming to onboard users who may be new to DeFi or crypto but are interested in the specific offerings or community around WLFI . Benefits of the Partnership: A Closer Look Let’s break down the tangible benefits this collaboration brings: For WLFI : Access to Alchemy Pay ‘s global payment gateway network instantly expands the potential user base for USD1 stablecoin . It removes technical hurdles for onboarding new users who hold fiat, increasing liquidity and potentially driving adoption of other WLFI services. It positions WLFI as a more accessible DeFi project. For USD1 Stablecoin Users: The primary benefit is convenience. Users can now purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using their local fiat payment methods without needing to use separate exchanges or complex crypto wallets initially. This simplifies the process significantly, saving time and potentially reducing fees associated with multiple transactions. For the Broader Crypto Ecosystem: Partnerships like this contribute to the overall goal of making cryptocurrency and DeFi more accessible to a mainstream audience. By providing user-friendly on-ramps for specific assets like USD1 stablecoin , they help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Actionable Insight: How to Use the New On-Ramp While specific steps may vary slightly depending on where WLFI integrates the service, the general process for users wishing to purchase USD1 stablecoin via the Alchemy Pay payment gateway would typically involve: Visiting the official WLFI platform or a service that has integrated the Alchemy Pay on-ramp. Locating the option to ‘Buy USD1 ‘ or ‘Add Funds’. Selecting Alchemy Pay as the payment provider. Choosing their preferred fiat currency and the amount of USD1 they wish to purchase. Selecting a supported payment method (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer). Completing the required payment and verification steps through Alchemy Pay ‘s secure interface. Receiving the purchased USD1 stablecoin directly into their connected crypto wallet. This streamlined flow is designed to mimic familiar online purchase experiences, reducing friction for users entering the crypto space. The Road Ahead for Alchemy Pay and WLFI This partnership is a clear indication of both Alchemy Pay ‘s continued strategy to expand its payment gateway services across various crypto projects and WLFI ‘s effort to enhance the accessibility of its USD1 stablecoin . As the DeFi space evolves, seamless on-ramps will remain a critical component for attracting and retaining users. The success of this integration will likely be measured by the ease of use reported by users and the increase in accessibility and liquidity for the USD1 stablecoin within the WLFI ecosystem. Partnerships like this highlight the ongoing effort within the crypto industry to build user-friendly infrastructure that connects the traditional financial world with the innovative possibilities of blockchain and DeFi. Conclusion: Bridging Fiat and USD1 Stablecoin with Ease The strategic partnership between Alchemy Pay and WLFI is a significant development for anyone interested in accessing the USD1 stablecoin . By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s versatile payment gateway , WLFI has effectively created a seamless crypto on-ramp , allowing users to purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using a wide range of fiat payment methods. This move not only enhances the accessibility of USD1 but also contributes to lowering the barrier to entry for the WLFI DeFi ecosystem. As the crypto landscape matures, collaborations focused on improving the user experience, particularly at the fiat-to-crypto conversion point, are essential for driving wider adoption. This partnership is a prime example of such an effort, promising a more convenient path for users to acquire USD1 stablecoin and engage with the WLFI project.

That’s what’s unfolding with XRP, which just saw $4 billion leave in 24 hours, and Pi Network (PI), which plummeted after 2 million tokens hit CEXs. Both coins are struggling with momentum. But while traders prepare for more dips, BlockDAG is flipping the script. Instead of just buying low, it’s giving users a way to earn passively. Due to its 25% referral bonus, you don’t need to invest more to increase your holdings. Simply share your link, and you’ll earn 25% of every purchase made through it. No caps, no added cost, just a chance to earn while the market shifts. Right now, you can get in at just $0.0018 per coin. BlockDAG’s 25% Referral Bonus: The Smart Way to Earn While most are focused on price fluctuations, BlockDAG users are cashing in on something entirely different. The current 25% referral bonus allows holders to earn just by sharing their referral link, no additional funds needed. Every time someone makes a BDAG purchase through your link, you pocket 25% of their transaction in BDAG. And for your referrals? They get a 5% bonus too. This isn’t about chasing trends, it’s about earning in a sustainable way without the pressure to time the market. BlockDAG’s presale is currently in Batch 28, with BDAG priced at an attractive $0.0018. But don’t wait too long, the price will rise to $0.0262 after June 13, and a launch price of $0.05 is already set. More than 21.4 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, with over $277 million raised. With more than 200,000 holders and listings coming to major exchanges like MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank, it’s clear that BDAG is gearing up to make its move. Thanks to the 25% referral system, it’s easier than ever to build your position without spending extra. Just share the link, and watch your rewards grow. No caps, no complex rules, just an opportunity for compounding rewards that keep adding up. With BDAG’s “Go Live” event on June 13, now’s the perfect time to jump in before the price starts climbing. XRP Struggles Amid $4B Outflows and Weak Growth XRP is feeling the pressure as over $4 billion exited the market in just 24 hours, pushing its market cap down from $137.5B to $133.39B before a slight rebound. The price is holding steady at $2.31, staying above crucial moving averages, $2.26 (50-day) and $1.91 (200-day). But if the downward trend continues, a drop below $2.26 could push XRP toward $2.00 and even $1.91. However, it’s not all doom and gloom. Analyst Brett Crypto pointed out that XRP has broken free from a 7-year descending triangle, potentially setting up a rise to $4.43. While technicals and strong volume support the idea, short-term sentiment remains uncertain. The sharp 95% decline in new XRP accounts since December highlights a slowdown in network activity. Until that changes, the pressure on XRP may continue, especially as traders keep an eye on whether the $2 support holds. Pi Network Dips 53%, Investors Brace for Potential Losses Pi Network (PI) is grabbing attention after its price plummeted 53% from its monthly high, dropping to $0.7752. The sharp fall followed over 2 million tokens being sent to exchanges in just 24 hours, creating sell pressure across platforms like OKX, Bitget, and Pionex. This pushed PI below its 50 EMA at $0.7910, signalling a bearish breakdown. If it falls below $0.6584, the next stop could be $0.5545, a drop of nearly 30%. Things could get even tougher, with over 72 million tokens unlocking in the coming days and 280 million more expected next month. If demand doesn’t pick up, PI could see further declines. Right now, the sudden drop is raising concerns about shaken investor confidence. Until we see a reversal in exchange outflows, the selling pressure will likely persist. Resistance is at $0.8600, but buyers will need more to stop this momentum. Final Thoughts XRP is facing mounting pressure as $4 billion in capital has flowed out, coupled with weak network growth. While the long-term outlook suggests it could hit $4.43, short-term dips below $2.26 could lead to further losses. At the same time, Pi Network (PI) has seen a sharp decline, dropping over 53%, with major risks from token unlocks and exchange inflows. As a result, many are shifting focus to BlockDAG, a crypto project offering more than just speculation. With its 25% referral system, you don’t need to buy more to earn more. Just share your referral code and get 25% in BDAG every time someone makes a purchase. The presale price of $0.0018 is locked until June 13, with a confirmed launch price of $0.05. Plus, with a 5% bonus for your referrals, BlockDAG is giving users an easy way to earn while others focus on the volatility. For many, it’s looking like the smarter move.

With Bitcoin recently tumbling from its lofty $106K perch and a sea of red washing over most altcoins in the last 24 hours, ‘crypto crashing’ is a trending search term, and for good reason. Investors are understandably on edge, asking the crucial question: Is this a temporary blip, a correction after a strong run, or are we staring down the barrel of a more significant downturn? Navigating the turbulent waters can be daunting. However, periods of market fear can also present unique, albeit high-risk, opportunities. For the daring investor, the meme coin sector, known for its explosive potential (and equally dramatic nosedives), might be of interest. Some traders will be eyeing specific meme coins, wondering if the current dip offers a discounted entry point. If this dip is just a market correction, the real question becomes: which meme coins are built to survive the storm and thrive when the skies clear? From seasoned tokens with staying power to buzzy newcomers making serious noise, the hunt is on for meme coins that can hold their ground and deliver when the rebound hits. And don’t sleep on the best presales either. Projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) are revving up for launch with real momentum, and could reward early believers with serious upside. In a market like this, timing is everything, and catching the next breakout project before the crowd does could make all the difference. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff, Snipe, Succeed. Master Meme Coin Trading In Telegram. If you’re tired of missing out on the next big meme coin, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is your new secret weapon. Helping you navigate crypto-trading from the convenience of your Telegram app, $SNORT will help you sniff out those early, under-the-radar gems before they hit the mainstream. The integrated Snorter Bot is about to become your Swiss Army knife, giving you all the tools you need to identify promising coins with speed and precision. $SNORT powers a trading experience built for rapid execution, leveraging the low fees and high speeds of chains like Solana. Holding $SNORT tokens can further enhance your edge, offering potential benefits like reduced trading fees within the bot. You can buy $SNORT now for $0.0935, and it’s raised an impressive $246K already. If you stake during the presale, you can expect rewards of up to 1215%. By combining intelligent discovery tools with a powerful trading bot and token holder benefits, $SNORT has the chops to level the playing field and potentially come in strong despite the recent market red. 2. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW) – Solana’s Feline Fury, Challenging the Meme Coin Pack. Some investors see red as a challenge to find the coins that fight back. Enter Cat In a Dog’s World ($MEW) , the feisty alternative to the crowded dog-themed crypto market. Built on the high-speed, low-fee Solana blockchain, $MEW isn’t just another cute face in the meme coin crowd. It embodies a rebellious spirit, playfully ready to claw its way into the territory dominated by the likes of Dogecoin. This feline fury is all about carving a unique niche, backed by a rapidly growing community captivated by its disruption and the technical advantages of its Solana foundation. You can buy $MEW for $0.003362 on Kraken . Coins like $MEW, with distinct branding and passionate followings ( 137K+ followers on X , and 25K+ subscribers on Telegram ), offer resilience, and its clear underdog (or rather undercat) appeal, could make it an intriguing addition for those looking for high-potential plays during market uncertainty. 3. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin Rewards & Token Burns. Multiply Your Bull Run. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is an innovative way to align with $BTC’s potential long-term success. This isn’t just another meme coin. It directly rewards its holders with actual $BTC as the flagship crypto achieves key price milestones. Hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets) to receive your rewards. Furthermore, $BTCBULL incorporates a strategic token burn mechanism, reducing its supply as $BTC climbs, thereby enhancing scarcity and value for its community. While the current market might be red, savvy investors understand that volatility is part and parcel of crypto. Many adopt longer-term perspectives, focusing on foundational assets. $BTC in particular continues to see positive signals in the evolving regulatory discussion, cementing itself as a cornerstone of the digital asset space that isn’t going anywhere. You can snap up $BTCBULL for $0.00254 with 63% staking rewards. We see $BTCBULL going the distance and predict it will reach $0.06467 by the end of 2025, a 2446.06% increase on today’s presale price. For those who believe in $BTC’s enduring trajectory, $BTCBULL offers a unique proposition: a chance to not only ride the wave of the eventual bull run but potentially multiply those gains through its distinct rewards. 4. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) – No Hype, No Stress. Just Good Vibes on The Blockchain. Okay, yes, the market is generally red at the moment, but take a leaf from the playbook of Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) and relax. $CHILL isn’t about chasing fleeting pumps or navigating complexity; it’s cultivated around the simple ethos of providing a relaxed, community-centric space in the often frenetic meme coin universe. The core idea is to build a token where the community can keep calm, fostering a sense of stability and shared patience. The market red can be taxing, but this is where a project like $CHILL might find its unique appeal. It’s a coin that offers a different kind of value, one centred around a low-pressure vibe. If you’re looking for a project less frantic about speculation and more about shared long-term beliefs in a simple concept and its collective, the $CHILL philosophy could be your proposition. $CHILL is available for $0.07465 on decentralized exchanges. In times of uncertainty, the strength of a calm, committed community can be a strong signal, suggesting that sometimes the most chill approach is the one that endures. Red Sea Opportunities: Investing Wisely When Markets Dip A market downturn can reveal unique opportunities for investors. While creating uncertainty, projects in the meme coin sector, like the utility-focused $SNORT or the $BTC rewarding $BTCBULL , aim to offer distinct propositions, even in challenging times. At any time, but even more so in the red, always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose.",Cryptocurrency Market News|Meme coins,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-05-30 12:01:27

The total market capitalization of the industry has fallen by 3.81%, now standing at $3.3 trillion. This sharp downturn was triggered by widespread trader liquidations totaling $712.76 million. Notably, long positions comprised $644.84 million. XRP suffered $29.68 million worth of liquidations, with a staggering $29.26 million coming from longs and only $419.93k from shorts. This outsized ratio reflects overleveraged bullish bets and subsequent panic exits. In this XRP price analysis, we explore where the token could be headed amidst the downturn of events. Whale Activity Surges Amid Price Drop? The exchange outflow chart by CryptoQuant shows a significant uptick in XRP movements today, i.e, on May 30, with over 330 million XRP exiting in various bands. Notably in the 1 M+ XRP category (light blue), followed by 100k–1M XRP (purple) and 10k–100k XRP (green). This spike in outflows typically suggests that whales are moving assets off centralized exchanges, possibly toward cold storage or alternate platforms, often a bullish signal long-term. However, given the price decline, this may also signal precautionary withdrawals amid market uncertainty. In the short term, reduced exchange supply may ease selling pressure, potentially aiding in price recovery. Ripple XRP Price Analysis: XRP price today is at $2.19, marking a 4.38% drop in the past 24 hours and a 10.52% fall over the week. Its market cap has contracted to $128.72 billion, down 4.36%, despite a sharp rise in 24-hour trading volume to $3.49 billion, up 32.74%. This surge in volume amid a price drop reflects liquidation activity. On the price chart, XRP is trading close to its 24-hour low of $2.18, with resistance overhead at $2.26. If bulls manage to reclaim this level, XRP could rebound toward the $2.4 to $2.5 range. However, continued rejection at this resistance could drive the price back to the key support zone at $2.0145. Also read our Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term price targets! FAQs Why did XRP’s price drop despite increased volume? The rise in volume is likely driven by panic selling and liquidations rather than buying interest, which has contributed to the price decline. What does the large exchange outflow on May 30 mean for XRP? It indicates significant whale movement, possibly for long-term holding or strategic repositioning, which could reduce sell pressure on exchanges short term. How much is 1 XRP right now?

In Q2 2025 alone, ONDO gained 70% from its lows of $0.66, and despite a recent cooldown, it’s still holding onto gains of over 40%. With such resilience, ONDO price prediction 2025 has become a hot topic among analysts and retail investors alike, especially as the token continues to build credibility and momentum through high-profile developments. With more than $250 million in TVL and growing institutional interest, ONDO has solidified itself as a major player in the Real World Asset (RWA) space . But how far can it go from here? Let’s dive into the detailed ONDO price forecast from 2025 to 2030. Table of contents Ondo Price Today Ondo Price Prediction 2025 ONDO Cryptocurrency Price Target 2026 – 2030 Ondo Coin Future Forecast 2026 Ondo Token Price Prediction 2027 ONDO Price Prediction Next Bullrun 2028 Ondo Price Forecast Long-term 2029 ONDO Coin Price Growth Potential 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Ondo Price Targets FAQs Ondo Price Today Cryptocurrency Ondo Token ONDO Price $ 0.86097660 -7.94% Market cap $ 2,719,917,646.9603 Circulating Supply 3,159,107,529.00 Trading Volume $ 182,023,481.7483 All-time high $2.14 on 16th December 2024 All-time low $0.08355 on 18th January 2024 Ondo Price Prediction 2025 Analyzing the daily chart reveals a fascinating price action for ONDO, especially following its recent Q2 surge. Experts were anticipating that this altcoin could gain significant traction and potentially break the crucial $1 mark, which coincides with a strong supply level. As institutional collaborations increase, retail adoption appears to be on the rise as well. Also, external factors, such as Bitcoin’s ascent beyond $100K , have contributed to a positive trend in the crypto sector. However, after mid-May, the optimism turned pessimistic when supply at $1 pushed the ONDO price back below the 200-day EMA band . The uptrend observed in Q2 has come to an end, as the price broke through a multi-day support trendline and faced strong resistance from the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. Geopolitical uncertainties have also resurfaced, particularly following recent tensions between the European Union and Trump , leading to a temporary pause until early June. Moreover, over the past few months price action, Q2’s momentum seemed to indicate a breakout from a falling wedge pattern that had formed since December 2024. However, ONDO crypto’s dip below the $0.87521 level has invalidated this pattern, for now. If the price rebounds, the uptrend can only be confirmed by first overcoming the 200-day EMA. Should that happen, a target of $1.20 could be within reach, with the potential to retest $2.05 by year-end. Conversely, with a bearish reversal and ongoing market uncertainty, the ONDO price may decline. If the $0.80 support level is breached, it could fall to $0.66.

After enjoying an impressive run of 11 consecutive trading days with net inflows, these popular investment vehicles experienced a significant shift on May 29th, recording substantial Bitcoin ETF outflows . This sudden reversal has naturally sparked discussions across the crypto market , prompting investors and analysts alike to assess the potential implications for the Bitcoin price and the broader landscape of institutional investment in digital assets. What Happened with US Spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 29? According to data shared by market observer Trader T (@thepfund) on X, May 29th saw a combined net outflow of $347 million from US spot Bitcoin ETFs . This figure represents a clear break from the recent streak of positive inflows that had characterized the market for nearly two weeks. The outflows were spread across several prominent funds, indicating a broad, albeit uneven, movement of capital out of these products. Here’s a breakdown of the funds that saw net outflows: Fidelity’s FBTC: $166.32 million Grayscale’s GBTC: $107.53 million ARK Invest’s ARKB: $89.22 million Bitwise’s BITB: $70.85 million Invesco’s BTCO: $20.05 million VanEck’s HODL: $11.98 million Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: $6.13 million Cumulatively, these seven ETFs accounted for the vast majority of the day’s net negative flow. Who Bucked the Trend Amidst the Bitcoin ETF Outflows? In contrast to the widespread outflows, only one of the actively trading US spot Bitcoin ETFs managed to attract net inflows on May 29th. BlackRock’s IBIT, often a strong performer in terms of inflows, recorded a net positive flow of $125.22 million for the day. This highlights that while there was a general movement towards exiting positions, some funds continued to see buying interest. Other ETFs in the market reported no changes in their holdings, meaning they experienced neither significant inflows nor outflows on that particular day. Understanding the Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Crypto Market Net flows into or out of US spot Bitcoin ETFs are closely watched metrics by investors and analysts. These flows are often seen as a proxy for the level of institutional investment and broader investor sentiment towards Bitcoin. Significant outflows can sometimes exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price , as ETF issuers may need to sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemptions. While a single day of outflows, even a substantial one like $347 million, doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term reversal, it does serve as a reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto market . The recent 11-day inflow streak had contributed to positive sentiment and potentially supported Bitcoin’s price rally towards the $70,000 mark. A sudden outflow event can temper that enthusiasm and lead to price consolidation or a minor pullback. Potential reasons for the outflows could include: Profit-Taking: After a period of positive price action, some investors might be taking profits on their ETF holdings. Market Rotation: Capital might be rotating into other assets or sectors, either within crypto or traditional finance. Macroeconomic Factors: Shifts in global economic outlook, interest rate expectations, or other macro news could influence investor risk appetite. Specific Fund Dynamics: Outflows from a fund like GBTC can sometimes be related to its specific structure or investor base dynamics. The event underscores the interconnectedness between traditional financial products like ETFs and the underlying digital asset market. Monitoring these flows provides valuable insight into the ebb and flow of institutional investment . Why Did Institutional Investment See a Pullback? The primary investors in US spot Bitcoin ETFs are often considered to be institutional players and sophisticated retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin. The sudden shift from consistent inflows to significant outflows suggests a collective decision by a portion of this investor base to reduce their exposure. While the exact motivations are multifaceted and difficult to pinpoint definitively for every investor, the overall trend indicates a temporary pause or reversal in the recent bullish sentiment among some institutional participants. It’s crucial to remember that institutional investment isn’t monolithic; different firms and individuals have varying strategies, time horizons, and risk tolerances. Understanding the drivers behind these shifts is key to navigating the crypto market . While ETFs offer a regulated pathway for institutional investment , they also tie the performance and flows of Bitcoin more closely to traditional financial market dynamics and sentiment. Key Takeaways from the Outflow Event This recent development offers several important insights for anyone interested in US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the broader crypto market : Volatility Remains: Even with increasing institutional adoption, the market for Bitcoin and related products remains volatile and subject to rapid sentiment shifts. Flows are Crucial: ETF flow data provides a real-time pulse on institutional interest and can influence short-term price action. Not a Unanimous Trend: While many funds saw outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract inflows, showing varied strategies among investors. Context is King: A single day’s data point should be viewed in the context of longer-term trends and broader market conditions. For investors, monitoring these flows alongside other fundamental and technical indicators is essential for making informed decisions regarding their exposure to Bitcoin and the crypto market . Conclusion: Navigating the Dynamic World of Bitcoin ETFs The $347 million in net outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 29th marked a notable pause in the recent positive momentum. This event, ending an 11-day streak of inflows, highlights the dynamic nature of the market and the factors influencing institutional investment . While several funds experienced significant Bitcoin ETF outflows , BlackRock’s IBIT managed to attract inflows, showcasing varied investor behavior. This shift serves as a reminder that the path for the Bitcoin price and the overall crypto market is rarely a straight line, and staying informed about these key indicators is vital for navigating the landscape effectively.

He suggested that a phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping might be needed to revive the process. The negotiations had shown promise during earlier meetings in Geneva, where both sides agreed to reduce tariffs for 90 days. However, little follow-up progress has been made. As part of the temporary truce, the US agreed to drop tariffs on Chinese goods to 30%, while China lowered its own to 10%. China also pledged to suspend certain non-tariff barriers, but gave no specifics. Despite establishing a framework for continued economic dialogue, there have been few updates or public signs of ongoing cooperation . Instead, the US has escalated pressure by restricting the sale of AI chips and semiconductor design software to Chinese firms, including Huawei. Bessent expressed optimism that once President Trump shares his intentions directly, China might return to the negotiating table , thanks to the reportedly strong relationship between the two leaders. Meanwhile, Chinese officials have avoided commenting on recent US remarks, and analysts in Beijing suggest they are preparing for a prolonged standoff.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-30 12:10:20

The firm’s recently acquired prime brokerage platform, Hidden Road, has launched a crypto over-the-counter (OTC) service for institutions in the U.S. According to an official release from Hidden Road, the brokerage will enable U.S. institutional clients to settle OTC swaps across leading cryptocurrencies with cash. Hidden Road to Service U.S. Institutions Institutions often use OTC trades to execute large transactions privately rather than on exchanges. This is to prevent huge price swings on open markets. Hidden Road said its Financial Conduct Authority-regulated United Kingdom arm, Hidden Road Partners CIV UK Ltd., will handle the operations of the new OTC Swaps product alongside several crypto cross-margining and financing services. Michael Higgins, International CEO and Global Head of Corporate Development for Hidden Road, said: “The United States digital asset market has long been under-served from a product standpoint. While OTC swaps represent a significant portion of digital asset trading volumes globally, until now, they were largely unavailable to U.S. institutions. With the launch of our swap prime brokerage capabilities for the United States market, we can provide clients with access to an expanded range of products and solutions.” Ripple’s Strategic Move The latest announcement comes less than two months after Ripple acquired Hidden Road for $1.5 billion. Although the deal is expected to close in the coming months, Ripple, with its significant balance sheet, is supporting Hidden Road to expand its capacity and services. The brokerage firm aims to become one of the largest non-bank prime brokers worldwide. While news of Ripple’s $1.25 billion play made the rounds early last month, CryptoPotato reported that the move was beyond a corporate deal. It was more about creating a pipeline for institutional flows into the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the network’s native asset, XRP. Further explanation by market experts revealed that the deal would enable Ripple to expand the XRP ecosystem from handling just retail remittances and enterprise payments to institutional treasury flows and liquidity management. With Hidden Road, which processes at least $3 trillion in volume yearly for more than 300 top market makers, hedge funds, and trading firms globally, Ripple is well on its way to evolving its payment ecosystem .

According to data from CoinGlass, this broke a 10-day inflow streak across all 11 ETFs , with the last similar pullback occurring on May 13. This outflow also marks the largest single-day capital flight since March 11, when investors pulled $396 million from the funds. The sharp outflow followed a drop in Bitcoin’s price, which fell over 3.5% during the day. The world’s largest cryptocurrency slid from an intraday high of $108,850 to briefly dip below the $105,000 mark. The pullback in price appears to have triggered significant selling activity, especially among institutional ETF holders. Fidelity and Grayscale Lead the Exodus The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) bore the brunt of the outflows, losing $166 million in a single day. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed with a $107.5 million outflow. Other notable exits included funds managed by Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Meanwhile, CoinShares, WisdomTree, and Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin trust reported no flows for the day. Despite the general downtrend, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract capital , recording $125 million in net inflows. The fund has now notched up 34 consecutive days of inflows, having last seen a redemption on April 9. Over the past two weeks alone, IBIT has brought in nearly $4 billion, pushing its total net inflows to $49 billion and assets under management beyond the $70 billion mark. Ethereum ETFs Attract Capital Amid Bitcoin Outflows Interestingly, spot Ethereum ETFs defied the bearish trend affecting Bitcoin products. On the same day, they collectively logged $92 million in net inflows, extending their own 10-day inflow streak. The last day of outflows for these funds was May 15. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was once again the front-runner, bringing in just over $50 million in new capital. The fund has now accumulated $4.5 billion in inflows since its launch in July 2024. Commenting on the broader outlook, ETF Store President Nate Geraci highlighted a significant capital rotation, noting that while more than $9 billion has flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past five weeks, gold ETFs have lost nearly $3 billion in the same timeframe. He also pointed to recent SEC clarity on staking, calling it a major step forward for Ethereum ETF products.

Here Are The Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-eth-is-moving-above-2600-analysts-pointed-to-this-level-here-are-the-details/,"Ethereum (ETH) has climbed above $2,600 today following a sharp intraday drop that sparked significant volatility and trading activity in the crypto markets. Some analysts see the recovery as a sign of a possible continued rally towards the $3,000 level. The price of Ethereum opened at $2,788 yesterday before falling sharply to $2,557, down about 6%. However, the asset later rose to $2,621.66, signaling renewed buying pressure and a possible change in sentiment. The sharp sell-off was accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting that both retail and institutional investors actively participated during the decline. Such increases in volume during pullbacks are often a precursor to strong recoveries when investor confidence returns, analysts said. The day’s price action reached a high of $2,642.84 before the session closed, indicating continued price fluctuations and a volatile trend that could continue in the short term. Technical analysis highlights short-term support at $2,570, which has held steady despite heavy selling. The rapid recovery from this area has cemented its importance as a key level to watch in the coming days. Market watchers are optimistic about Ethereum’s medium-term prospects, citing factors such as rising institutional interest and ongoing upgrades to the Ethereum network (including scalability improvements and Layer 2 adoption) as the main drivers of a potential move towards the $3,000 threshold. While the market remains sensitive to both general macro and cryptocurrency-specific developments, Ethereum’s ability to recover from sharp losses is considered a positive signal in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

MANA price could reach a maximum of $0.33 to $1.10 in 2025. Decentraland price with a potential surge could go as high as $5.25 by 2030. Decentraland is a leading community-driven virtual world powered by the Ethereum blockchain , where users can explore, connect, and build using its native ERC-20 token, MANA. Known as one of the top VR metaverse platforms, it continues to grow with regular ecosystem upgrades, strong development activity. If you’re curious about Decentraland’s future and wondering whether MANA is a good investment, this MANA price prediction 2025–2030 will walk you through its potential growth and long-term outlook Table of contents Story Highlights Overview CoinPedia’s Decentraland Price Prediction MANA Price Prediction 2025 Decentraland Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Decentraland Price Prediction 2026 Decentraland Price Prediction 2027 Decentraland Price Prediction 2028 Decentraland Price Prediction 2029 MANA Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Factors Affecting The Price Of MANA Token Historical Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Decentraland Token MANA Price $ 0.27575927 -11.07% Market Cap $ 543,171,032.8595 Circulating Supply 1,969,729,010.3688 Trading Volume $ 60,241,592.9883 All-time High $5.90 on 25th November 2021 All-time Low $0.00788 on 14th October 2017 CoinPedia’s Decentraland Price Prediction As per the formulated price prediction, the MANA crypto price could hit a potential high of $1.05 in 2025. This could be possible if the project seeks assistance from developments and collaborations. In contrast, factors like a prolonged bear run could spiral the price down to $0.42. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.42 $0.73 $1.05 MANA Price Prediction 2025 Decentraland’s price has faced significant challenges, plummeting to $0.1903 on April 6, 2025. However, it managed to recover, doubling to $0.3935 by mid-May. Unfortunately, the rest of May saw a decline, erasing over 50% of the gains made in Q2 2025. As of now, Decentraland price sits below all major EMA bands but is resting on a strong support zone. If this support is breached again, similar to what happened in April, concerns about a drop back to the $0.1903 low could become a reality. On the other hand, if the price bounces back from this support, reaching $0.5612 by the end of June is within a possibility. A more ambitious target of $1.10 could also be on the horizon by the end of 2025, provided a strong bullish momentum returns, like the surge seen in Q4 2024. Still, market participants are likely wondering, “What does the future hold for the MANA price?” To answer this, examining its multi-year chart is crucial. Since the FTX crash in 2021 , MANA has fallen from a high of over $5.91. This long-term activity illustrates its range during both bull and bear markets, which now appears to be a consolidation phase compared to its 2021 peak. In 2025, MANA is at its lowest point, down 95% from its all-time high. If a revival occurs and MANA manages to clear the $1.10 mark by the end of the 2025, it could signal the beginning of a true bullish era for this cryptocurrency.

45287712,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=737774,1748607560,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45287712.jpeg,US Treasury yields set for monthly loss as markets wait on key Fed inflation data,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/treasurys-steady-on-key-fed-inflation-data/,"Treasury yields stayed still on Friday while traders waited on fresh inflation figures and followed President Donald Trump’s ongoing legal push to keep his reciprocal tariffs alive. The numbers barely moved — the 30-year yield ticked up by less than a basis point to 4.927%, while the 10-year yield sat flat at 4.422%, and the 2-year held at 3.939%. But the lack of movement doesn’t mean the market’s calm. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday sided with the White House, agreeing to freeze a ruling from a lower trade court that had overturned the reciprocal tariffs, which first kicked in back in April. That legal win came just hours before the Trump administration told the court it would go to the Supreme Court if the pause wasn’t granted. Trump pushes tariffs, market waits for Fed Trump’s team isn’t stopping with the courts. Officials are also working on a backup — using a section of the Trade Act of 1974 to roll out temporary tariffs up to 15% for as long as 150 days, The Wall Street Journal reported. That plan alone has added a new layer of stress to a market already dealing with inflation risk, weak data, and deficit fears. And all of it is happening as Wall Street watches for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Federal Reserve’s top inflation metric, which dropped Friday morning. Traders want a clear sign that spending and inflation are slowing, something that could boost the case for rate cuts later this year. Current pricing suggests around 50 basis points in cuts are expected by December. But until then, Treasuries are heading toward their worst monthly performance this year. A Bloomberg bond index tracking US government debt fell 1.2% in May, as bond prices slipped and yields rose across all maturities. It’s the third straight monthly climb for the 30-year yield — the longest since 2023. The 2-year and 10-year also posted their first monthly increases of 2025. Investors are blaming Trump’s chaotic fiscal plans, especially his push for new tax cuts without offering a clear way to shrink the budget deficit. Bond traders brace for long-term Treasury risks Despite the broader selloff, buyers came back in this week as yields stayed high and weak data made Treasuries more attractive. That relief may last if the PCE report and other numbers suggest slower growth. If that happens, the short end of the yield curve (particularly the 2-year) could rally hard. But the long end is still under pressure, thanks to the ballooning global supply of low-risk assets. Over at Goldman Sachs, John Waldron said that investors are more spooked by US debt levels than by tariffs right now. He warned that the underlying fear is whether there will be enough demand to absorb all the bonds Washington keeps issuing. At Citigroup, Dirk Willer and his team think the term premium — the extra payment buyers demand for holding long-term bonds — is likely to rise another 50 basis points over the next year. It already hit a 10-year high earlier this month, showing the growing discomfort with locking in money for the long haul. Henry Neville, a portfolio manager at Man Group, has been tracking how far real-world yields on the 10-year diverge from what’s considered their fair value. That gap has shrunk a lot. Since 2020, the average spread has been about 150 basis points, the narrowest in any decade since the 1960s. And between May 2023 and July 2024, the gap stayed under 100 basis points for 15 months straight, a record-setting streak. “Persistent readings below 100 are for me the key tell that the dollar and dollar assets may be losing their luster,” Henry wrote in a note on Friday. If that trend holds, domestic buyers will have to pick up the slack as foreign interest cools. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Aimed squarely at supercharging development and adoption, this initiative could reshape how resources are allocated within the network. Let’s dive into the details of the Stacks Ecosystem Funding proposal, known as SIP-031, and what it means for the future of Bitcoin Layer-2. What is the Stacks SIP-031 Proposal? Published on May 27th on the Stacks forum, SIP-031 is a comprehensive plan designed to create a dedicated STX ecosystem endowment. Think of it as a centralized fund specifically purposed to fuel growth, innovation, and infrastructure within the Stacks network. The proposal outlines a multi-pronged approach to building this treasury, primarily through transfers from existing entities within the ecosystem and, notably, through a temporary adjustment to the network’s token economics. How Will the Crypto Endowment Be Funded? Understanding STX Token Emissions The proposed endowment wouldn’t appear out of thin air. SIP-031 details two primary funding mechanisms: Transfers from Existing Entities: This involves consolidating resources currently held by various foundations or groups associated with the Stacks ecosystem into the new endowment. Increased STX Token Emissions: This is perhaps the most discussed aspect. The proposal calls for a temporary increase in the annual issuance of STX tokens over the next five years. Currently, the annual STX emission rate is around 3.52%. SIP-031 suggests raising this average rate to approximately 5.75% for this defined period. It’s crucial to understand that this is proposed as a temporary measure to quickly capitalize the endowment, with emissions expected to return to baseline levels thereafter. This adjustment to STX Token Emissions is central to the plan’s ambition. This strategic increase in token emissions is designed to provide the endowment with substantial capital upfront, enabling it to make significant investments in the ecosystem’s future. Why is This Stacks Ecosystem Funding Initiative Necessary? Addressing Key Challenges The proposal doesn’t just appear randomly; it’s a direct response to identified challenges hindering the Stacks ecosystem’s full potential. The authors of SIP-031 highlight several critical issues: Underfunding Relative to Competitors: Despite its unique position as a Bitcoin layer, Stacks has faced challenges in securing comparable levels of funding and resources seen in other layer-1 or layer-2 ecosystems. This limits its ability to compete effectively for talent and projects. Operational Fragmentation: Resources and initiatives are currently spread across various entities, leading to potential inefficiencies and lack of coordinated effort. A consolidated endowment aims to streamline this. Limited Access to Growth Tools: Developers and projects within Stacks sometimes lack access to the sophisticated tools, grants, and support structures available in better-funded ecosystems. Insufficient Resources for Developers: Attracting and retaining top-tier developers requires competitive grants, bounties, and infrastructure support, areas where the ecosystem needs strengthening. By creating a robust Stacks Ecosystem Funding mechanism, the proposal seeks to directly tackle these hurdles, providing the necessary capital and structure to accelerate development. What are the Potential Benefits for Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth? A well-funded and strategically managed endowment could unlock significant potential for Stacks and, by extension, contribute substantially to overall Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth . The benefits could include: Faster Development Cycles: Increased funding can support core protocol development, tooling, and infrastructure improvements at a much quicker pace. Attracting Top Talent: Competitive grants and bounties can incentivize developers and researchers to build on Stacks. Supporting Key Projects: The endowment can provide crucial funding for promising dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms building on Stacks. Enhanced Marketing and Adoption Efforts: Resources can be allocated to educational initiatives, marketing campaigns, and partnerships to drive user adoption. Improved Ecosystem Coordination: A central fund can help align various ecosystem participants towards common goals. Ultimately, the success of this endowment could solidify Stacks’ position as a leading platform for innovation on Bitcoin. What Happens Next with the Stacks SIP-031 Proposal? Proposals in decentralized ecosystems like Stacks follow a specific process to ensure community consensus. For Stacks SIP-031 , the next steps are clearly defined: Community Feedback: The proposal is currently open for discussion on the Stacks forum, allowing anyone in the community to provide input, raise concerns, and suggest modifications. This feedback phase is crucial for refining the proposal. Committee Setup: A dedicated committee will likely be formed to review the feedback, potentially revise the proposal, and prepare it for a formal vote. Voting: The final decision rests with the STX token holders, who will vote on whether to approve or reject the proposal. The outcome of this vote will determine if the STX ecosystem endowment becomes a reality. This community-driven process ensures that significant changes like adjusting STX Token Emissions and establishing a large Crypto Endowment are made with the broad support of the network’s participants. Considering the Implications: Risks and Rewards While the potential benefits for Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth are substantial, it’s also important to consider potential downsides. The temporary increase in STX Token Emissions , for instance, could lead to short-term inflationary pressure, although the long-term benefits of a well-funded ecosystem are argued to outweigh this. Governance of the endowment will also be critical to ensure funds are allocated transparently and effectively for the benefit of the entire Stacks community. The success of this Stacks Ecosystem Funding initiative hinges on careful planning, transparent execution, and continued community oversight. Summary: A Bold Step for Stacks The SIP-031 proposal represents a bold and ambitious plan to address critical funding and coordination challenges within the Stacks ecosystem. By proposing the creation of a significant Crypto Endowment , funded in part through a temporary adjustment to STX Token Emissions and consolidation of existing resources, Stacks aims to accelerate Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth and development. The path forward involves crucial community discussion and ultimately, a vote by STX holders on the future of Stacks Ecosystem Funding . This process highlights the decentralized nature of the network and the importance of community participation in shaping its destiny.

The main factor driving the surge appears to be support from a leading cryptocurrency exchange. The Top Performers Despite the overall pullback of the cryptocurrency market in the past 24 hours, some lesser-known altcoins defied the negative trend by recording substantial gains. Two of the best performers today (May 30) include Pocket Network (POKT) and Livepeer (LPT). The price of the former has exploded by a whopping 350% on a daily scale , currently trading at roughly $0.058 ( per CoinGecko’s data). This is the highest mark observed since December last year, while POKT’s market capitalization surged past $100 million. POKT Price, Source: CoinGecko For its part, LPT soared by over 80% within the timeframe. As of this writing, its valuation stands at a four-month high of around $10.17, with a market cap of more than $420 million. LPT Price, Source: CoinGecko The most obvious factor driving the price increase is the latest announcement from Upbit. The leading Korean crypto exchange allowed trading services with the assets, listing the LPT/KRW, LPT/USDT, and POKT/KRW pairs. Pocket Network (POKT) is a US-based decentralized infrastructure protocol that provides RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services for dApp s . It is composed of full nodes that hold blockchain data and are rewarded with tokens for fulfilling requests. Livepeer (LPT) is also headquartered in the States. It is a decentralized video streaming network built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide an accessible, scalable alternative to traditional services like AWS or YouTube’s backend. Its main focus is on video transcoding, which is the process of converting raw video files into formats suitable for different devices. Upbit’s Previous Influence This isn’t the first time the prices of certain cryptocurrencies have headed north following support from the Korean platform. In February, the company enabled users to trade the TRUMP/KRW, TRUMP/BTC, and TRUMP/USDT, which resulted in a significant rally for the meme coin associated with the American president. A few months later, Upbit and Binance showed support for DeepBook (DEEP), listing the trading pairs DEEP/KRW and DEEP/USDT, respectively. The asset’s valuation jumped by double digits following the disclosures.
