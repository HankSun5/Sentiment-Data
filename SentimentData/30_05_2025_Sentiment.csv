Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/400-million-xrp-abrupt-surge-heres-the-significance/,"XRP recorded a significant increase in on-chain transaction volume recently, with nearly 400 million transactions processed in a single day. This spike in network usage marks one of the most active periods in recent months, drawing attention from analysts and investors alike. However, despite the sharp rise in activity, XRP’s market price has remained relatively stable. Market Activity and Technical Outlook For May, data shows several transaction volume surges, culminating in the sharp increase observed on the 27th. These types of movements often reflect large-scale transfers between wallets, which could be linked to institutional portfolio adjustments or internal exchange settlements. Despite the volume spike, price movement has remained subdued. XRP continues to trade within a narrow range, fluctuating between $2.20 and $2.50. This price behaviour suggests investor hesitation, with no clear directional momentum developing so far. Technical analysis of the XRP/USDT pair indicates a symmetrical triangle formation, a classic sign of market consolidation. Currently, the price is testing support at both the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). A minor golden cross is visible, but it has not resulted in significant upward momentum yet. If the price breaks out, it may aim for resistance levels near $2.60 to $2.70. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Caution Still High While the recent jump in transaction volume signals increased network activity, it does not necessarily guarantee short-term price appreciation. Market interest, particularly among retail investors, appears limited. This is evident in the relatively low trading volume on exchanges, suggesting that traders are waiting for a confirmed breakout before re-engaging. For now, XRP must hold above the $2.20 support level to avoid a deeper pullback. Should buying pressure increase and the price move above $2.50, a renewed uptrend could emerge, supported by the growing network utility. However, without a decisive move from market participants, the asset remains locked within its current range. In summary, although XRP’s on-chain performance has improved notably, its price has yet to reflect that strength. Investors are advised to monitor volume and resistance levels closely as the market searches for direction. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Understanding the broader economic climate is crucial for anyone navigating digital assets. A recent report from Odaily sheds light on a key development within the US economic sphere that warrants attention: comments from a top White House official regarding US trade policy and the future of US trade deals . What Did the White House Economic Council Director Say About Trade Tariffs Impact? According to the report, Kevin Hassett, who served as the Director of the White House National Economic Council (NEC) during the period referenced, expressed significant confidence regarding a recent ruling concerning tariffs. Hassett’s comments focused on the potential trade tariffs impact and the administration’s strategy moving forward. Here are the key takeaways from Hassett’s statement: Confidence in Overturning Ruling: Hassett is confident that a recent tariff ruling will be successfully overturned upon appeal. No Impact on Agreements: He believes this specific ruling will not negatively affect ongoing trade agreements. Expectation of More Deals: More trade agreements are anticipated in the coming weeks. Deals Ready for Decision: Three trade agreements were specifically mentioned as being ready for then-President Donald Trump’s final decision. This perspective from a high-ranking official within the White House economic council offers insight into the administration’s view on the stability and direction of its trade agenda, despite potential legal or regulatory challenges. Who is Kevin Hassett and Why Does His Opinion on US Trade Deals Matter? Kevin Hassett is an economist who held prominent positions within the US government, including chairing the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and serving as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC). The NEC is a principal forum used by the President for considering policy matters involving domestic and international economic issues. Its Director plays a crucial role in coordinating economic policy-making across various government agencies. Hassett’s statements carry weight because they reflect the administration’s official stance and expectations regarding its economic and trade policies. His confidence in overturning a tariff ruling and the expectation of impending US trade deals signal a particular outlook on the administration’s ability to navigate trade disputes and secure new agreements. Understanding Trade Tariffs and Their Potential Market Ripple Effects Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. Governments use them for various reasons, including protecting domestic industries, generating revenue, or as a tool in trade negotiations. While seemingly straightforward, tariffs can have complex and far-reaching economic consequences: Potential Impact Area Description Consumer Prices Can increase the cost of imported goods, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. Domestic Industries Can make domestically produced goods more competitive but may also increase costs if industries rely on imported components. Export Markets Can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, harming domestic exporters. Supply Chains Can disrupt established global supply chains, forcing companies to find new suppliers or relocate production. Market Sentiment Trade disputes and tariffs often create uncertainty, which can negatively impact investor confidence and lead to volatility in stock markets, commodity prices, and even potentially influence sentiment in digital asset markets. The specific tariff ruling mentioned by Hassett, though unnamed in the report, likely pertains to a particular industry or country. His confidence in its reversal suggests the administration believes its trade strategy remains legally sound or that alternative legal avenues will succeed. This perceived stability, or lack thereof depending on the outcome, contributes to the overall economic narrative that influences global markets. Why Does White House Economic Council Commentary Matter for the Global Economy? The economic policies set by major global powers like the United States have a significant impact on international trade flows, currency valuations, and overall market stability. The White House economic council plays a key role in shaping these policies and communicating them to the public and markets. When a high-ranking official like Kevin Hassett speaks with confidence about overturning a tariff ruling and the impending success of US trade deals , it sends a signal: Signal of Resolve: It indicates the administration’s determination to pursue its trade agenda despite obstacles. Signal of Stability (Potential): If the appeal is successful and deals are struck, it could reduce uncertainty surrounding specific trade relationships. Signal of Negotiation Stance: It might also provide clues about the administration’s negotiating leverage and priorities in ongoing discussions. For those monitoring global markets, including the cryptocurrency space, these signals are part of the larger mosaic of economic data and political developments that inform investment decisions and risk assessments. While not a direct driver of crypto prices, the health and stability of the global economy, heavily influenced by US trade policy , can impact capital flows and investor appetite for riskier assets. Navigating the Future: What Does This Mean for US Trade Policy and Beyond? Hassett’s comments paint a picture of an administration actively pursuing its trade objectives and confident in overcoming legal challenges to its tariff strategy. The expectation of more US trade deals suggests ongoing efforts to reshape trade relationships through negotiation rather than solely relying on tariffs. Key Aspects to Consider: Benefits: Successful trade deals can open new markets for US goods, potentially boost economic growth, and provide greater certainty for businesses engaged in international trade. Overturning a potentially disruptive tariff ruling could prevent negative consequences for specific industries. Challenges: Trade negotiations are complex and can face political hurdles both domestically and internationally. The success of appeals is never guaranteed. Furthermore, the specific terms of new trade deals can have varied impacts across different sectors of the economy. Examples: The mention of three deals ready for the President’s decision highlights concrete progress in specific negotiations, although the details of these agreements were not provided in the report. Actionable Insights: Stay informed about developments in US trade policy and global trade relations. Monitor the outcomes of tariff appeals and the details of any new trade agreements announced. While the link to crypto is indirect, major shifts in global trade can influence broader market sentiment and economic forecasts. The confidence expressed by a figure within the White House economic council is a data point in the ongoing story of global economic relations. It underscores the dynamic nature of international trade and the continuous efforts by governments to shape it. Conclusion: The Interconnectedness of Global Economics and Trade Tariffs Impact Kevin Hassett’s statements regarding the expected overturning of a tariff ruling and the anticipation of further US trade deals offer a glimpse into the perspective from the highest levels of the US economic policy-making body. His confidence, as reported by Odaily, suggests a belief within the administration that their approach to US trade policy is resilient and set to yield further results in the form of new agreements. While this news directly concerns international trade and US economic strategy, its relevance extends to anyone observing global markets. The potential trade tariffs impact , the stability (or instability) created by trade disputes, and the positive momentum from new US trade deals all contribute to the overall economic environment that indirectly influences investment climates, including the appetite for digital assets. Keeping an eye on these macroeconomic signals, even those originating from the White House economic council , provides valuable context for navigating the complexities of today’s interconnected financial world.

While the headlines might seem focused purely on traditional finance, the latest economic data out of the United States holds significant clues for the future direction of the crypto market. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis recently released its second estimate for the first quarter of 2025, and the numbers caught many by surprise. Decoding the Latest US GDP Numbers So, what exactly did the data show? The report indicated that the US GDP , or Gross Domestic Product – the total value of goods and services produced in the country – contracted at an annual rate of 0.2% in Q1 2025. This figure was slightly less severe than the 0.3% decline that analysts had broadly expected, but it still represents a significant shift. Think of GDP as a report card for the US economy . A positive number means the economy is growing, while a negative number signals a slowdown or contraction. The previous quarter (Q4 2024) saw a healthy expansion of 2.4%. This sharp reversal into a GDP contraction in Q1 is therefore a notable event, suggesting the economic momentum seen late last year has faded. Here’s a quick look at the recent trend: Q4 2024 (Final Estimate): +2.4% Expansion Q1 2025 (Second Estimate): -0.2% Contraction This data point is crucial because it’s one of the primary indicators economists and policymakers use to gauge the health and direction of the economy. While this is the second of three estimates, the final number is usually close to the second, meaning this contraction is likely to stick. What Does This Economic Data Signal for the US Economy? A GDP contraction , even a modest one like 0.2%, immediately raises questions about the underlying strength of the US economy . While one quarter of negative growth doesn’t automatically mean a recession (which is typically defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction), it certainly puts recessionary fears back on the table for many analysts. What could be behind this slowdown? Several factors might contribute, including: Cooling Consumer Spending: Consumers are the engine of the US economy. If high inflation or borrowing costs are finally biting, they might be pulling back on spending. Reduced Business Investment: Uncertainty about the future economic outlook can lead companies to delay investments in new equipment, buildings, or hiring. Impact of Higher Interest Rates: The Federal Reserve’s past interest rate hikes are designed to slow the economy to combat inflation. This contraction suggests those policies are having their intended effect, perhaps more strongly now. Understanding this specific piece of economic data is key to forming a broader view of the macroeconomic landscape. Connecting the Dots: Economic Data and the Crypto Market Impact Now, let’s get to why this matters for you, the crypto enthusiast. Traditional economic data like the US GDP report can have a significant crypto market impact , albeit sometimes indirectly. Here’s how the dots connect: Investor Sentiment: A weakening US economy often leads to a shift in investor sentiment. When the economy looks shaky, investors tend to become more risk-averse. This can mean pulling money out of assets perceived as higher risk, which sometimes includes cryptocurrencies, and moving into safer havens like government bonds. Monetary Policy Expectations: A contracting economy puts pressure on the Federal Reserve. If the economy continues to slow, the Fed might feel compelled to lower interest rates sooner than previously anticipated to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates can make riskier assets, including crypto, relatively more attractive compared to low-yield traditional investments. Inflation Outlook: While the GDP report itself isn’t an inflation print, a slowing economy can potentially ease inflationary pressures as demand cools. A clearer path towards lower inflation could also influence the Fed’s actions and market sentiment, impacting crypto. Dollar Strength: Economic performance can affect the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international investors. So, while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, their prices are still heavily influenced by global macroeconomic conditions and the liquidity available in the system, much of which is tied to the health of the US economy and the policies of its central bank. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market After This US GDP Report Given this new piece of economic data , what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key economic data releases, not just US GDP . Inflation reports, jobs numbers, and Fed announcements are all critical pieces of the puzzle. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: A potentially slowing economy can bring increased market volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Watch the Fed: Pay close attention to statements from Federal Reserve officials. Their reaction to this data will be a major factor influencing market expectations regarding future interest rates. Consider Diversification: While crypto is your focus, think about how this economic backdrop affects your overall investment strategy. This GDP contraction serves as a reminder that the crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. External economic forces play a significant role in shaping its landscape. In Conclusion: A Warning Signal from the US Economy The Q1 2025 US GDP report showing a 0.2% contraction is a crucial piece of economic data that investors should not ignore. It signals potential headwinds for the US economy after a period of expansion and could influence everything from Federal Reserve policy to overall market sentiment. While the direct link isn’t always immediate, the potential crypto market impact from a slowing economy and subsequent policy responses is undeniable. Staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is just as important as tracking on-chain metrics or project developments when navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

This is where the AI crypto browser aims to shine. The intelligent agents within the Donut browser are designed to understand your intent and autonomously execute these kinds of blockchain transactions . Think of it like having a personal crypto assistant built directly into your browser. Here’s how it could simplify things: Token Swaps: Instead of manually finding the best DEX, approving tokens, setting slippage, and executing the swap, you might simply tell the AI agent, “Swap 1 ETH for USDC,” and it handles the rest, finding the optimal route and price. Yield Farming: Participating in yield farms often involves depositing liquidity pairs, staking LP tokens, and managing rewards. An AI agent could potentially monitor opportunities, suggest strategies, and even execute deposits or withdrawals based on parameters you set. Portfolio Optimization: Managing a diverse portfolio requires constant monitoring and rebalancing. An AI agent could analyze market conditions, track your holdings, and suggest or automatically execute trades to maintain your desired asset allocation or risk level. This level of automation has the potential to drastically lower the barrier to entry for interacting with DeFi and other web3 protocols. Transforming User Interaction with Decentralized Applications Beyond automating transactions, the AI crypto browser is set to redefine how users interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Today, interacting with a dApp often feels like using a clunky, early-internet website. Donut aims to make this experience intuitive, efficient, and safer. Key features planned for the Donut browser that enhance dApp interaction include: Built-in Wallets: Seamless integration of secure crypto wallets means you don’t need separate browser extensions or apps to connect to dApps. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Access: Direct access to various DEXs simplifies trading and liquidity provision. AI-Powered Risk Screening: A critical feature is the use of AI to analyze smart contracts and dApp interactions for potential risks, scams, or vulnerabilities, providing users with warnings before they connect their wallets or sign transactions. This adds a crucial layer of security that is often missing in the current landscape. By integrating these features and layering AI on top, Donut Labs is creating a more unified, intelligent, and user-friendly gateway to the decentralized web. This could be a major catalyst for broader adoption of decentralized applications in the coming years. The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities While the vision is compelling, building an AI crypto browser comes with significant challenges. Training AI agents to safely and effectively interact with the ever-evolving landscape of smart contracts and protocols is a complex task. Ensuring the security of the AI itself and preventing potential exploits is paramount. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI and crypto also presents a hurdle. However, the opportunities are immense. If successful, Donut could become the preferred way for millions of new users to enter the crypto space, abstracting away much of the technical complexity and risk currently involved. The $7M funding provides Donut Labs with the resources needed to tackle these challenges head-on and capitalize on the opportunity to be a leader in the next generation of crypto infrastructure. What Does This Mean for the Future? The investment in Donut Labs signals a growing trend: the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. As AI becomes more sophisticated, its ability to understand, navigate, and execute actions within complex digital environments like the blockchain increases. A dedicated AI crypto browser could pave the way for a future where interacting with DeFi, NFTs, and other web3 services is as simple as telling an AI agent what you want to achieve. Donut Labs anticipates that their approach will contribute significantly to broader adoption of decentralized technologies in the coming decade. The ability to automate and simplify complex blockchain transactions , combined with enhanced security features, could finally make web3 accessible to a mainstream audience. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Interaction The $7M funding secured by Donut Labs is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a vote of confidence in the future of AI-powered crypto interaction. By developing an AI crypto browser designed to simplify blockchain transactions and enhance the user experience with decentralized applications , Donut Labs is at the forefront of building a more accessible and intelligent decentralized web.

The global crypto market cap has recently soared past an incredible milestone, exceeding $3.5 trillion. This isn’t just a number; it reflects a massive influx of capital and growing confidence in the digital asset space. What’s behind this surge? According to the on-chain analytics experts at Sentora (formerly known as IntoTheBlock), a major catalyst is the increasing institutional demand . What’s Fueling the Crypto Market Cap Surge? The headline figure of the crypto market cap crossing the $3.5 trillion threshold is certainly attention-grabbing. Sentora’s report highlights that while the entire ecosystem is contributing, the primary engine driving this recent growth is the significant interest and investment coming from large institutions. Bitcoin’s Role: A large part of this institutional focus is centered around Bitcoin . With the advent of regulated investment products like spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions, traditional finance players now have easier, more familiar avenues to gain exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Capital Influx: Institutions manage vast sums of capital. Even a small allocation from a large pension fund, hedge fund, or corporate treasury can represent hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars flowing into the market, disproportionately impacting the overall crypto market cap . Validation and Confidence: Institutional involvement often lends an air of legitimacy and maturity to an asset class. Their participation signals to other large players, and even sophisticated retail investors, that the market is becoming more established and less speculative than in its earlier days. Beyond Bitcoin: Strength in the Broader Ecosystem While Bitcoin might be leading the charge in terms of institutional flows, Sentora’s data reveals that the health of the crypto ecosystem extends far beyond just the king coin. The broader landscape is showing robust signs of recovery and growth, indicating increasing utility and adoption. DeFi’s Rebound: Decentralized Finance ( DeFi ) is seeing a significant resurgence. Sentora noted that DeFi loan books have rebounded to an impressive $30 billion. This metric is a key indicator of activity and confidence within decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading protocols. The recovery here suggests users are actively engaging with decentralized applications again after previous market downturns. Stablecoins’ Steadfast Growth: Stablecoins , digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, have also seen remarkable growth. Sentora’s report points out a substantial 56% increase in their capitalization over the past year. This growth is crucial as stablecoins act as the primary medium of exchange within the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading, lending, and payments without needing to constantly convert back to fiat currency. Their expanding market cap reflects increased activity and liquidity across the entire space. How is Regulation Shaping the Future? The evolving regulatory landscape in the United States is playing an increasingly important role in the crypto narrative, particularly concerning DeFi and stablecoins . Sentora highlighted that guidance and potential regulations from key bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are poised to significantly shape the future trajectory of these sectors. Clarity for Institutions: Regulatory clarity is often cited as a major hurdle for institutions considering deeper involvement in crypto. Clear rules around classification (is an asset a security or a commodity?), trading, and custody can provide the certainty large compliance departments require. Defining DeFi: Regulators are grappling with how to oversee decentralized protocols. Future guidance could impact how DeFi operates, potentially affecting everything from user interfaces to the underlying smart contracts. While some fear over-regulation, clear guidelines could also legitimize certain activities and attract more mainstream users and capital. Stablecoin Frameworks: Given their role in facilitating transactions and their potential to scale, stablecoins are under intense scrutiny. Proposed regulations aim to ensure their stability and prevent their use in illicit activities. A robust regulatory framework for stablecoins could pave the way for their wider adoption in payments and traditional finance. While regulatory developments can introduce uncertainty in the short term, many market participants view thoughtful regulation as a necessary step towards the long-term maturity and sustainability of the digital asset market. Benefits and Challenges of Increased Institutional Adoption The surge in institutional demand bringing the crypto market cap to new heights comes with both significant benefits and potential challenges: Benefits: Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital means deeper markets, making it easier to buy and sell assets without causing significant price swings. Reduced Volatility: Institutional trading strategies are often less emotional and short-term focused than retail, potentially leading to more stable market movements over time. Enhanced Legitimacy: Their participation validates crypto as a serious asset class, attracting further investment and talent. Infrastructure Development: Institutions require sophisticated tools and services, driving innovation in custody, trading platforms, and data analytics. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large pools of institutional capital could potentially lead to greater centralization of power and influence within certain protocols or assets. Market Manipulation Risks: While regulations aim to prevent this, large players could potentially exert undue influence on market prices. Regulatory Hurdles: The very regulations designed to attract institutions can also impose restrictions that impact the decentralized nature of some crypto projects, particularly in DeFi . Correlation with Traditional Markets: Increased institutional involvement could lead to crypto markets becoming more correlated with traditional finance, potentially reducing its diversification benefits. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast What does this mean for you, the individual interested in or invested in crypto? The market reaching a $3.5 trillion crypto market cap driven by institutional demand is a strong signal of maturation. It suggests that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative bets, but as legitimate components of global financial portfolios. Keep an eye on how regulatory discussions progress, as they will significantly impact the operational landscape for DeFi and stablecoins . Understanding the difference between assets primarily driven by retail vs. those attracting institutional interest (like Bitcoin ) can also be key to navigating market dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets? Sentora’s latest data paints a clear picture: the crypto market is experiencing a period of significant growth, propelled by the increasing appetite from institutional investors, particularly for Bitcoin . This influx of sophisticated capital, coupled with the robust recovery seen in sectors like DeFi and the expanding utility of stablecoins , underscores the ecosystem’s resilience and evolving nature. As regulatory frameworks begin to solidify, they promise to further shape this burgeoning market. The journey to $3.5 trillion is a testament to the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric, potentially ushering in a new era for crypto.

While your focus might be on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the latest altcoin moves, paying attention to the broader financial landscape, especially the US stock market , is more crucial than ever. Today brought some notable news from Wall Street as markets opened with significant upward momentum. Let’s dive into what happened and why it matters for your digital asset portfolio. Positive Signals from the Stock Market Open The start of trading saw major indices pushing into positive territory, reflecting a notable shift in investor sentiment as the stock market open got underway. Here’s a quick look at the performance of the key benchmarks: S&P 500: Gained +0.79% NASDAQ Composite: Led the charge with a significant +1.43% increase Dow Jones Industrial Average: Posted a modest +0.14% gain This broad-based rise across different sectors indicates a potential increase in risk appetite among investors, a factor that often has ripple effects across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Understanding the S&P 500’s Move The S&P 500 , often considered a bellwether for the overall health of the U.S. economy and stock market, showing a nearly 0.8% gain right out of the gate is a strong signal. This index represents the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Its positive movement suggests confidence in the earnings outlook and economic stability, at least for the short term. For crypto investors, a rising S&P 500 can sometimes correlate with positive sentiment spilling over into digital assets, especially those seen as growth investments. Why the NASDAQ’s Surge is Particularly Interesting for Crypto The NASDAQ , heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, posted the most significant percentage gain among the major indices today. This is particularly relevant for the crypto market because many crypto investors and projects are aligned with the technology sector. Historically, there has been a notable correlation between the performance of the NASDAQ and the price movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A strong NASDAQ often suggests positive sentiment towards tech innovation and growth assets, which can directly benefit the crypto space. When tech stocks are rallying, it can create a favorable environment for digital assets that are also perceived as high-growth, disruptive technologies. The Dow Jones and Broader Market Health While the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s gain was more modest compared to the NASDAQ and S&P 500, its positive opening contributes to the overall narrative of a strong market start. The Dow tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies, often referred to as ‘blue-chip’ stocks. Its positive performance suggests that confidence isn’t limited just to the tech sector but is potentially spreading to broader industrial and financial areas of the economy. This widespread positivity can reinforce the overall bullish sentiment in the traditional markets, which, as mentioned, can influence the crypto market through various channels, including investor confidence and capital flows. What Does This Stock Market Open Mean for Crypto Investors? The correlation between traditional markets, especially tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies has become more pronounced over recent years. Here’s a breakdown of what today’s positive US stock market opening could imply for your crypto investments: Benefits: Positive Sentiment Spillover: A rising stock market can indicate increased investor confidence and risk appetite, potentially leading investors to allocate more capital into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Macro Environment Indicator: Strong stock performance might reflect underlying positive economic factors (like favorable inflation data or optimistic growth forecasts) that could also support the crypto market. Validation of Growth Assets: The NASDAQ’s strong performance, in particular, can signal continued belief in growth-oriented and technology-driven assets, which aligns well with the narrative surrounding many cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Increased Correlation Risk: While correlation can be beneficial during market rallies, it also means crypto is more susceptible to downturns in traditional markets. If stocks fall, crypto might follow. Less Diversification: High correlation means holding both stocks and crypto might offer less diversification benefit than in the past. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Given the connection, how should a crypto investor react to this positive stock market open ? Monitor Key Economic Data: Keep an eye on the factors driving the stock market (inflation reports, jobs data, central bank commentary) as they increasingly influence crypto. Watch Tech Sector Performance: Pay close attention to the NASDAQ and major tech stocks, as their movements often foreshadow trends in the crypto market. Consider the Macro Landscape: Don’t view crypto in isolation. Understand its place within the broader financial ecosystem. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Recognize that increased correlation means crypto’s volatility might be tied more closely to macro swings. Concluding Thoughts Today’s strong opening across the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow Jones is a significant event in the traditional finance world, and its implications for the cryptocurrency market are noteworthy. While crypto has its unique drivers, the increasing interconnectedness with global markets means that positive signals from Wall Street, particularly from the tech-heavy NASDAQ, can contribute to a favorable environment for digital assets. Staying informed about these traditional market movements is no longer optional but a vital part of navigating the complex and exciting world of cryptocurrency investing.

Last week, a hacker hit Cetus with a sophisticated smart contract exploit targeting the decentralized exchange’s (DEX) concentrated liquidity market maker (CLMM) pools, purloining approximately $223 million worth of assets from the platform. The DEX quickly froze $162 million worth of the stolen assets. Now, the Sui community is currently voting on a proposal that enables a special transaction to return those frozen assets from two attacker addresses back to Cetus. If passed, the vote would approve a one-time authentication of two special transactions hard-coded with the two attacker addresses, stolen asset objects, and their destination. The votes are weighted by validator stake, but the Sui Foundation’s stake is excluded to maintain neutrality. The vote passes if more than 50% of the total stake participates and there are more “yes” votes than “no” votes. The voting period ends next week, but early passing could happen as early as Thursday if the remaining unvoted stake cannot change the outcome. That appears poised to happen, with 71% of the validators having already voted “yes” at time of writing, compared to 0.3% for “no,” 1.5% abstaining and 27.2% who had yet to vote. Cetus also announced this week that it is in a position to fully cover the remaining losses via cash, token treasuries and a loan from the Sui Foundation, pending the vote’s passage. “Because full recovery is dependent upon the results of the community vote, we humbly ask for the Sui community’s full support to recover the funds via the upcoming vote. We recognize that this is an extraordinary ask forced by our actions, however we think it is the right decision especially for those affected.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

45265608,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164180,1748563251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45265608.jpeg,AI Licensing Deal: NYT and Amazon Forge Landmark Agreement,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nyt-amazon-ai-deal/,"BitcoinWorld AI Licensing Deal: NYT and Amazon Forge Landmark Agreement In a significant development impacting both the media landscape and the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, The New York Times has entered into an AI licensing deal with Amazon. This agreement allows the tech giant to use The Times’s extensive editorial archives to train its various AI platforms. This move comes less than two years after The New York Times initiated a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging copyright infringement over the use of its content for AI training without proper authorization or compensation. What Does the Amazon AI Deal Involve? The core of this agreement is the licensing of The New York Times’s diverse editorial content to Amazon. According to statements from The Times, this includes a broad spectrum of material designed to enhance Amazon’s customer experiences powered by AI. Key aspects of the deal include: Access to news articles published by The New York Times. Inclusion of content from NYT Cooking, the outlet’s popular food and recipe site. Utilization of material from The Athletic, The Times’s sports-focused publication. Potential integration of this content into Amazon’s Alexa software, suggesting AI-driven interactions could leverage Times information. While the specific financial terms of this Amazon AI content licensing agreement have not been publicly disclosed, it marks a notable first for both parties involved. For Amazon, it represents their initial foray into securing such a large-scale content licensing deal specifically for AI training purposes. For The New York Times, it’s their first official generative AI-focused licensing agreement, signaling a strategic shift towards potentially collaborating with AI developers under controlled terms. Why Did The New York Times Pursue an AI Licensing Deal Now? The context of this deal is crucial. In late 2023, The New York Times filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft. The suit claimed that these companies used millions of articles published by The Times to train their AI models, including large language models central to Generative AI applications, without obtaining consent or providing compensation. Both OpenAI and Microsoft have disputed these allegations. This legal action highlighted the complex and often contentious relationship between content creators and AI developers regarding the use of copyrighted material for training data. The decision by New York Times AI strategy to pivot from litigation against some AI companies to a licensing partnership with another like Amazon suggests a potential path forward for publishers seeking to monetize their archives in the age of AI. Unlike OpenAI, which has reportedly signed numerous similar licensing deals with various publishers globally (including The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, NewsCorp, and Axel Springer), Amazon’s deal with The Times appears to be a foundational step in its content acquisition strategy for AI development. Implications of Licensing Media Content for AI Training Deals like this Media Content licensing agreement between The New York Times and Amazon raise important questions about the future of journalism, AI development, and copyright in the digital age. Publishers face the challenge of protecting their intellectual property while also exploring new revenue streams and adapting to technological shifts. Potential Benefits: Revenue for Publishers: Licensing provides a potential new income source for media organizations whose traditional models are under pressure. Improved AI Models: Access to high-quality, verified journalistic content can theoretically lead to more accurate, reliable, and nuanced AI models. Controlled Use: Licensing agreements can provide publishers with more control over how their content is used by AI companies compared to unauthorized scraping. Potential Challenges: Undisclosed Terms: The lack of transparency in deal terms makes it difficult to assess the true value exchanged and set precedents for future agreements. Impact on Traffic: If AI models directly answer user queries using licensed content, it could potentially reduce direct traffic to publisher websites. Defining Fair Use: The legal battles and licensing deals are part of a larger effort to define what constitutes fair use of copyrighted material in the context of AI training. This agreement between The New York Times and Amazon is more than just a business transaction; it’s a significant indicator of how major content creators and technology platforms are navigating the complex intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence capabilities. As AI models become more sophisticated, the value and necessity of high-quality, verified human-created content for their training becomes increasingly apparent, making these licensing deals a critical trend to watch.

45265617,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=761135,1748563253,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45265617.jpeg,Ethereum Tests Key Weekly Resistance – Analyst Sets $4K Target If ETH Breaks Out,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-tests-key-weekly-resistance-analyst-sets-4k-target-if-eth-breaks-out/,"Ethereum is taking the lead in the crypto market as Bitcoin continues to consolidate near its all-time highs. After months of lagging behind BTC, ETH is now making a strong move, with bulls pushing price action toward the critical $2,800 resistance. This level, which has consistently capped upside momentum since early February, now stands as the key battleground for Ethereum’s next major leg. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Market sentiment has shifted as Ethereum shows signs of reclaiming dominance, driven by renewed spot demand and strengthening technicals. Top analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on the rally, emphasizing the importance of the $2,850 mark. According to Pillows, this is the most significant resistance Ethereum has faced in this cycle, and breaking through it could unlock a powerful move toward $3,000 and beyond. Momentum has been building steadily over the past few weeks, and ETH’s recent resilience against macroeconomic pressure is adding to the conviction. If bulls manage to flip this resistance into support, it could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin surge. For now, all eyes are on Ethereum as it flirts with a breakout that could reshape market dynamics heading into June. Ethereum Eyes Expansion Phase Amid Shifting Global Dynamics Ethereum is positioning itself for a potentially expansive move as both technical indicators and market sentiment continue to align in its favor. After weeks of consolidation and steady gains, ETH is now testing the $2,850 resistance—a level that has held price down since February. The setup suggests that Ethereum is not only regaining momentum but could also lead the next phase of the crypto rally. While the crypto market gains traction, broader macroeconomic forces are reshaping investor behavior. A recent decision by the U.S. Federal court to strike down former President Trump’s tariffs on various countries has created fresh uncertainty across global markets. This policy reversal could introduce volatility in traditional finance, as trade dynamics shift and new fiscal responses take shape. Despite this uncertainty, Ethereum appears to be thriving. There’s a view that crypto assets like ETH could perform well under tight economic conditions, and current price action supports that view. ETH is showing resilience, supported by growing spot demand, a bullish structure, and rising investor confidence. Pillows highlighted in his latest analysis that if Ethereum reclaims the $2,850 level in the coming sessions, the path to $4,000 will open quickly. This would represent a major breakout and likely trigger a wave of capital rotation from Bitcoin and stablecoins into altcoins. For now, ETH remains just below a breakout point. If bulls can push decisively above resistance, it would confirm the start of an expansionary move that could reshape the broader market, positioning Ethereum as a leading force in the next phase of the cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Reclaims Weekly Key Levels Ethereum is showing renewed strength on the weekly chart, currently trading at $2,728.36 after reaching a high of $2,789.50. This move marks a significant recovery from recent lows near $1,600 and confirms the formation of a strong uptrend. ETH has now reclaimed the 34-week EMA at $2,511.42 and is pushing above the 100-week SMA at $2,605.71. These moving averages now act as dynamic support levels, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The next critical level to watch is the 50-week SMA, currently sitting at $2,729.64, just slightly above the current price. A confirmed weekly close above this level would mark the first time ETH has sustained strength above it since late 2023. That could open the door for a push toward the $3,200–$3,600 zone, with $4,000 in sight if momentum accelerates. Volume has also picked up on this recent move, signaling healthy participation from buyers. Historically, similar recoveries from major moving average clusters have preceded expansive legs in Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally As long as ETH maintains this structure and closes the week above $2,700, bulls are likely to retain control. The breakout above $2,850—last defended in early 2024—remains the final hurdle before Ethereum can challenge prior cycle highs.

Recent analysis suggests several powerful forces are aligning, potentially driving the premier cryptocurrency to new heights. If you’re watching the crypto market , understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial. A deep dive into on-chain and technical data reveals five compelling signals that point towards continued upside potential for Bitcoin . These factors aren’t just isolated events; they represent shifts in market structure and investor behavior that have historically preceded significant price appreciation. Let’s break down what these signals are and why they matter for the future trajectory of Bitcoin . Signal 1: Sustained Whale Accumulation One of the most telling signs of smart money confidence is the behavior of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. These entities control vast amounts of Bitcoin and their movements can significantly influence market dynamics. Recent data indicates a sustained pattern of accumulation by these large wallets. What does this mean? Reduced Supply on Exchanges: When whales move Bitcoin off exchanges into cold storage, it signals an intent to hold for the long term, reducing the readily available supply for selling. Confidence in Future Price: Accumulation suggests these large players believe the current price is attractive and expect it to rise considerably in the future. They aren’t selling into strength; they’re buying dips or accumulating steadily. Market Strength: Sustained buying pressure from large players provides a strong foundation for price support. This consistent absorption of supply by whales is a fundamental bullish signal, suggesting strong hands are positioning for significant gains. Signal 2: Strong Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products, particularly in the United States, has been a game-changer for the crypto market . These vehicles provide traditional investors with an accessible and regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin . The inflows into these ETFs have been substantial and consistent. Here’s why this is bullish: New Capital Injection: ETFs bring significant new capital into the market that might otherwise not have directly invested in Bitcoin . This includes institutional funds, wealth managers, and retail investors using traditional brokerage accounts. Demand Exceeding Supply: The rate at which these ETFs are buying Bitcoin to back their shares often exceeds the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined daily. This creates a supply shock dynamic. Validation and Legitimacy: The success and adoption of Bitcoin ETF s lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially attracting even more conservative investors over time. The sustained demand from the ETF sector is a powerful engine driving the Bitcoin price higher by absorbing available supply. Signal 3: Elevated Investor Sentiment Market psychology plays a significant role in price movements. While not a fundamental driver, elevated investor sentiment can fuel momentum and extend rallies. Various metrics, from social media trends to survey data and funding rates in derivatives markets, suggest sentiment remains broadly positive towards Bitcoin . Why is positive sentiment important? Increased Participation: Positive sentiment encourages more people to buy, from retail investors entering the market to existing holders increasing their positions. Reduced Selling Pressure: When sentiment is high, holders are less likely to sell on minor price dips, leading to more resilient price action. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: In the short to medium term, widespread belief in a rising market can contribute to that rise as buying activity increases. While sentiment can be fickle, its current elevated state indicates a general bullish outlook across the crypto market , supporting the potential for continued price increases. Signal 4: Rising Open Interest Despite All-Time Highs Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures or options) that have not been settled. Typically, when an asset reaches new all-time highs, open interest might decline as traders take profits or close positions. However, in the current cycle, open interest in Bitcoin derivatives has remained elevated or continued to climb even as the price reaches record levels. What does this signal? New Money Entering: High open interest at highs suggests new positions are being opened, not just old ones being rolled over or closed. This indicates fresh capital and new market participants are entering the derivatives space, often with bullish bets. Confidence in Continuation: Traders are willing to take on leveraged positions even at high prices, implying confidence that the rally is not over. Potential for Volatility: While bullish, high open interest also increases the potential for large price swings due to liquidations if the market moves sharply in one direction. This metric, analyzed alongside funding rates, provides insight into the leverage and conviction within the market, and current readings suggest a strong belief in further upside. Signal 5: Potential Short Liquidations Above $111,000 The derivatives market isn’t just about bullish bets. Many traders take short positions, betting on the price to fall. Data on liquidation levels shows where these short positions would be forced to close if the price rises, potentially triggering a cascade of buying. Analysis points to significant clusters of short positions that could face liquidation if Bitcoin surpasses levels between $111,000 and $115,000. Why is this a bullish signal? Liquidation Cascades: When the price hits these levels, automated systems force short sellers to buy Bitcoin to cover their positions. This sudden buying pressure can rapidly accelerate the price increase. Fuel for the Rally: These forced buys act as fuel, pushing the price higher and potentially triggering further liquidations at even higher levels. Weakening Opposition: Liquidating short positions removes market participants betting against the price rise, reducing selling pressure. The presence of these potential liquidation zones above current price levels creates a technical setup where a move higher could gain rapid momentum, helping propel the Bitcoin price towards and potentially beyond these targets. Putting It All Together: A Broader Bull Cycle Individually, each of these five signals provides a piece of the puzzle. Taken together, as highlighted by the Cointelegraph analysis of on-chain data and technical indicators, they paint a compelling picture of a market structure geared for further appreciation. Sustained whale accumulation reduces supply, robust Bitcoin ETF inflows create consistent demand, elevated sentiment encourages participation, high open interest shows conviction, and potential short liquidations offer technical upside fuel. The report suggests this isn’t just a temporary bounce, but rather that Bitcoin is firmly entrenched in a broader bull cycle. This cycle is characterized by fundamental shifts in adoption, market infrastructure (like ETFs), and increasing confidence from both retail and institutional players. Price Targets: $120,000+ and Beyond? Based on these bullish signals and the broader market context, the analysis indicates a strong likelihood of Bitcoin surpassing the $120,000 mark in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, the potential exists for the price to reach as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025. It’s important to remember that price targets are projections based on current data and market conditions. The path to these levels is unlikely to be a straight line, and volatility is inherent in the crypto market . However, the confluence of these five bullish factors provides a data-driven basis for these optimistic forecasts. What Does This Mean for Investors? For those participating in or watching the crypto market , these signals offer valuable insights: Actionable Insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange reserves, whale wallet movements, and long-term holder behavior. Track ETF Flows: Watch weekly or monthly reports on Bitcoin ETF inflows to gauge institutional and traditional investor demand. Understand Sentiment: While not a primary driver, sentiment indicators can help understand market psychology and potential short-term swings. Be Aware of Liquidation Levels: Understanding where significant liquidation clusters lie can help anticipate potential areas of accelerated price movement. Consider Long-Term Perspective: The analysis points to a broader bull cycle, suggesting that focusing on the long-term trend rather than short-term volatility may be beneficial. Potential Benefits: Significant price appreciation for existing holders. Opportunities for new investors to participate in a potentially growing market. Further maturation and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. Potential Challenges: Market volatility means significant price swings are possible. External factors (regulatory news, macroeconomic shifts) can impact the market. Reaching price targets is not guaranteed and depends on the continued strength of these signals and overall market conditions. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook Supported by Data The convergence of sustained whale accumulation , strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, positive investor sentiment, rising open interest at highs, and technical liquidation zones above current levels presents a powerful case for continued upside in the Bitcoin price . These signals, derived from detailed on-chain data and technical analysis, suggest the current market environment is robust and poised for further growth. While no market move is guaranteed, the weight of evidence points towards a high probability that Bitcoin is set to climb higher, with targets of $120,000 and potentially $200,000 appearing increasingly plausible within the next year and a half. For anyone interested in the future of finance and digital assets, keeping a close watch on these key indicators is essential.

According to market data from Coingecko, AVAX, which had a fully diluted valuation of about $10.2 billion and a 24 hour average trading volume of around $610 million, dropped nearly 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $22.44 at the time of this writing. What Happened to Avalanche Fundamentals The Avalanche network has grown to a vibrant web3 ecosystem with more than $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) and nearly $2 billion in stablecoins market cap. The mainstream adoption of the Avalanche network by institutional investors has been bolstered by the notable development of its ecosystem’s tokenization technology. As a result, the Avalanche network has achieved more than 46k active daily on-chain users. Meanwhile, several fund managers – led by VamEck, and Grayscale Investments – are seeking to offer spot AVAX ETFs in the United States in the near future. AVAX Price Expectations In the weekly timeframe, AVAX price has been recovering from the 2022 crypto bear market. The utility-focuses altcoin has been forming a macro bullish continuation since March 2024, which is characterized by a falling symmetrical channel in the weekly timeframe. In the four hour timeframe, AVAX price has been forming a symmetric triangular pattern in the past four weeks. AVAX price has respected a rising logarithmic trend established since April 9, thus signaling a bullish continuation pattern. According to on-chain data , AVAX price has established a robust support level above $22.8, especially after 362k wallets accumulated more than 21.65 million AVAX coins. Consequently, a consistent close beyond the liquidity level above $25 will trigger a fresh rejuvenated rally toward the target range between $35 and $55.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 00:10:41

The Blockchain Builders Fund , a fund with strong ties to Stanford University, has successfully closed its oversubscribed Fund I, securing a substantial $28 million. This significant milestone marks a fresh wave of investment specifically targeting promising pre-seed and seed-stage blockchain startups. What is the Blockchain Builders Fund and Why Does it Matter? The closure of the Blockchain Builders Fund ‘s first fund at $28 million, exceeding its initial target, signals robust investor confidence in the future of blockchain technology and its applications. What makes this fund particularly noteworthy is its affiliation with Stanford, suggesting a potential pipeline of talent and research-backed insights informing its investment decisions. By focusing on the earliest stages of startup development – pre-seed and seed – the fund is positioning itself to support founders right from the ground floor. This is a critical phase where startups require not just capital, but often strategic guidance, network access, and operational support to transform innovative ideas into viable products and businesses. Fueling Innovation: How the Fund is Investing in Web3 Startups The fund hasn’t just been raising capital; it’s already actively deploying it. According to a press release via Chainwire, the Blockchain Builders Fund has already allocated over $16 million from Fund I across a diverse portfolio of 40 projects. This demonstrates a rapid pace of investment and a broad scope of interest within the web3 ecosystem. The investments span several key sectors poised to drive the next wave of web3 adoption and innovation: Artificial Intelligence (AI): Exploring the intersection of AI and blockchain, potentially funding projects focused on decentralized AI, AI-enhanced dApps, or blockchain infrastructure for AI. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Supporting the evolution of financial applications built on blockchain, from lending and borrowing protocols to decentralized exchanges and novel financial instruments. Infrastructure: Investing in foundational technologies that make web3 more scalable, secure, interoperable, and user-friendly, such as layer 2 solutions, developer tools, and data protocols. Real-World Assets (RWA): Backing projects that tokenize or bring tangible assets onto the blockchain, unlocking new possibilities for liquidity and ownership in areas like real estate, art, or commodities. This strategic allocation across varied, high-growth sectors highlights the fund’s vision for a multi-faceted web3 future, powered by innovative web3 startups . The State of Blockchain Funding : A Sign of Market Confidence? In a market cycle that has seen periods of cautious investment, the successful oversubscription and closure of a $28 million fund dedicated to early-stage web3 is a positive signal. It suggests that despite market volatility, there remains significant capital eager to back foundational technologies and disruptive business models within the blockchain space. The fact that the fund is already more than halfway deployed ($16M out of $28M) across 40 projects reinforces the narrative that promising opportunities exist and are being actively pursued by investors. This level of activity in blockchain funding at the early stage is often seen as a leading indicator for future growth and innovation in the ecosystem. Why Focus on Early-Stage Crypto ? The Potential and the Risks Investing in early-stage crypto startups comes with inherent risks. Many projects fail to gain traction, navigate regulatory hurdles, or achieve product-market fit. However, the potential rewards can be substantial. Early-stage investments offer the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of technologies and companies that could potentially reshape industries. For the Blockchain Builders Fund, focusing on this stage allows them to work closely with founders, helping to shape their strategies, build strong teams, and navigate the complex web3 landscape. It’s an investment in potential, betting on visionary teams building the infrastructure and applications for the decentralized future. Navigating the Future: The Role of Venture Capital Web3 With $16 million already deployed, the Blockchain Builders Fund still has over $12 million remaining in Fund I. The plan is to invest this remainder by the end of the year. This indicates a continued push to identify and support promising projects in the coming months. The role of venture capital web3 funds like this is crucial for the health and growth of the ecosystem. They provide the necessary capital for innovation, help translate complex technical ideas into marketable products, and connect startups with the resources they need to scale. Their investment decisions often highlight emerging trends and areas of perceived high potential within the market. Conclusion The closure of the Blockchain Builders Fund’s $28 million Fund I is a significant development, injecting vital capital into the early-stage web3 ecosystem. With investments already spread across key areas like AI, DeFi, infrastructure, and RWAs, the fund is actively backing the builders of the decentralized future. This move underscores continued confidence in the potential of blockchain technology and highlights the critical role of venture capital in nurturing the next generation of web3 innovation.

As the chief executive officer of one of the most talked-about ventures in digital assets — Twenty-One Capital Inc., Mallers aims to reshape corporate Bitcoin holdings and challenge Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds over 580,000 BTC, valued at approximately $64 billion. Jack Mallers aims for Saylor’s crown with billion-dollar Bitcoin bet Twenty-One is supported by the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald LP, stablecoin powerhouse Tether Holdings SA, and the Japanese investment firm SoftBank Group. The company is not simply following the ever-expanding list of businesses chasing after the opportunity to imitate Strategy , Michael Saylor’s software firm that has been transformed into a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin — it is trying to beat it. Twenty-One Capital, backed by notable entities including Tether and Cantor Fitzgerald, recently disclosed a $458 million Bitcoin acquisition. The firm plans to publish its Bitcoin addresses to verify its reserves, emphasizing transparency in its operations. In contrast, Michael Saylor’s Strategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, recently purchasing an additional 4,020 BTC, bringing its total holdings to over 580,000 BTC. Mallers envisions Twenty-One Capital acquiring up to 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply, approximately 1 million BTC, signaling a bold ambition to rival Saylor. Many people outside the crypto community have recognized Jack Mallers mostly for being emotional in 2021 when he announced that Bitcoin would become legal tender in El Salvador at the biggest conference in Miami. How Mallers ended up as the leader of Twenty One may be as interesting as Mallers’s story about turning El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele onto Bitcoin. Mallers narrates his journey to explore Bitcoin Mallers explained that his path to Twenty-One went through Tether Holdings SA CEO Paolo Ardoino, who has known Mallers since his early days in Bitcoin. Mallers began revealing his exploration of Bitcoin. He explained that he grew up in and around traditional finance and was first exposed to Bitcoin in 2013 when his father co-founded and sold a discount futures brokerage. Apart from his father, his stepmother is deep in the crypto world, known as BitcoinMom on X. Mallers dropped out of college and founded Zap Solutions Inc., Strike’s parent company, when he was 23. Mallers also revealed that Tether’s sister company, Bitfinex, was the first major exchange to implement the Lightning Network. He continued by saying that he was one of the most vocal early developers of the Lightning Network, referring to the Bitcoin payment protocol. “And so Paolo and I would talk, and that was à la 2017,” the CEO of Strike concluded. In the meantime, Tether was establishing a deeper relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald, the investment bank that US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick led before he was recruited to work as part of President Donald Trump’s executive staff. Cantor helps oversee Tether’s reserves and holds a convertible bond with the largest Stablecoin operator. Lutnick has helped transform Tether, a firm formerly eyed with suspicion by Washington, into an unlikely ally of the president. Due to Cantor’s ties with Trump, Mallers mentioned that Tether is the only link between him and the bank and Lutnick, whose son Brandon currently manages the company. He admitted that he did not know Brandon well, but he was his banker. Crypto investors prefer Mallers to Saylor as a perfect choice for Twenty-One Mallers and Tether crossed each other’s paths over the years, including overlapping in El Salvador, where Strike and Tether now have headquarters. When Mallers launched Strike in El Salvador in 2021, it became the most downloaded app in the country. Strike first relied on Tether’s USDT stablecoin as a substitute for the dollar, but it quickly dumped USDT in favor of partnerships with banks in El Salvador. In 2023, Strike started adding Tether again to its platform. However, it was not until the end of last year when the concept for Twenty- One began to take shape, Mallers said. Mallers remembers meeting Tether and their team in November at a Plan B Forum, a conference co-hosted by the Swiss city of Lugano and Tether. “We had a smart conversation about the direction of the world, their plans, and my plans,” Mallers said. For many people, Mallers is an appealing choice to lead Twenty-One because he is so frank about his defense of Bitcoin. Whereas Saylor frequently appears as a serious businessperson, Mallers comes across with the “crypto bro” appeal that is quite attractive to retail crypto investors. Additionally, Mallers, like many online influencers, is active on his YouTube channel, where he uploads videos and hosts a weekly podcast about Bitcoin and the financial systems called The Jack Mallers Show. Mark Palmer, a senior analyst for fintech and digital assets at Benchmark, also stated that although Michael Saylor’s role as a promoter of Strategy and Bitcoin had been incredibly helpful, Jack Mallers, who is a charming person and famous in the crypto world, is a great choice to promote both Twenty-One Capital and Bitcoin.

Co-sponsored by eight other members of Congress—five Republicans and three Democrats—the legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. The CLARITY Act establishes how the United States should treat cryptocurrencies and digital assets. For years, the crypto industry has thrived in a legal gray zone. The absence of clear rules has confused and stifled innovation . This bill is meant to change that. It is a follow-up to last year’s Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), but it further lays out oversight duties. Representative Dusty Johnson said that America was poised to lead the world in the digital assets market but emphasized that this could not happen without a clear regulatory framework. The bill is long and is expected to be the focus of extensive negotiations among the two parties and chambers. In the meantime, it is a strong step forward for crypto legislation in Congress. Key provisions target market oversight The Clarity Act assigns most of the responsibility for supervising crypto trading markets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill confers “exclusive regulatory jurisdiction” on the CFTC for digital commodity spot markets — the areas where commonly used assets such as Bitcoin trade. Meanwhile, the SEC will continue to oversee digital assets classified as securities —those you invest in with the expectation of profiting from the efforts of others. According to this structure, crypto firms would be free to register with the CFTC or the SEC, depending on the digital assets they work with. The bill tenures provisional registration for crypto firms to begin operating while agencies work out the regulations. It also requires platforms to follow anti-money laundering rules outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act. For example, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and wallet providers will be excluded from SEC oversight in some cases. The Clarity Act, if implemented, would allow regulators only 12 months to promulgate rules. That timeline is relatively short in the arcane realm of financial rule-making, which can frequently drag on for years. Congress sparks debate with Clarity Act introduction The Clarity Act comes at a moment of increasing political fascination with crypto and pressure to regulate. Whereas the stablecoin bill is considered further along the track, this latest attempt targets larger market structure issues. The measure is backed heavily by House Republicans, particularly those on the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees. But its future is uncertain. Democrats are divided. Some worry the bill is overly friendly to the crypto industry. Others worry about links between crypto firms and Donald Trump, who has recently re-emerged in the political world. Still, a handful of Democrats have backed clear crypto standards — particularly if they safeguard consumers. The crypto industry, beyond Congress, is paying close attention. The bill has won praise from the crypto advocacy group Stand with Crypto. They describe it as a “big step forward” when providing companies and developers the legal certainty they need to do business in the U.S. Some experts suspect the bill and stablecoin legislation could eventually be bundled into a single package. That would produce an even broader crypto law — possibly the first in the United States. President Trump has urged Congress to pass both bills by August, before the congressional recess. But inside sources say that’s a highly ambitious goal. There will be hearings on the new bill next week. Members of Congress will also have an opportunity to publicly debate what’s in it, amendments, and the way forward.

Get ready for some exciting news that bridges the gap between blockchain technology and everyday student life. Zebec Network (ZBCN), known for its innovative Solana-based payment solutions, has just made a significant move that could change how students manage their money across the United Kingdom. In a press release shared via Chainwire, Zebec announced its acquisition of Science Card, a prominent platform already serving over 50,000 students in top UK universities. This isn’t just another corporate deal; it’s a strategic play set to accelerate the adoption of crypto debit card UK services and revolutionize student finance crypto possibilities. Breaking Down the Big News: The Zebec Acquisition Let’s dive into the details of this pivotal Zebec acquisition . Zebec Network is building a name for itself with its real-time, continuous payment streams and on-chain payroll solutions. By acquiring Science Card, they’re not just buying a company; they’re gaining immediate access to a large, established user base within a key demographic – university students. Science Card has built a strong presence within the UK university ecosystem, providing card services tailored to students. Imagine having a payment platform already integrated into campus life, trusted by thousands. That’s the foundation Zebec is now building upon. This move significantly strengthens Zebec’s existing suite of card offerings, which includes payroll cards and general-purpose crypto debit cards. Why is this such a big deal? For Zebec, it’s about rapid expansion and user acquisition in a targeted market. For UK students, it opens the door to potentially more flexible, efficient, and innovative ways to handle their finances, powered by blockchain technology. Bringing the Crypto Debit Card UK Experience to Students One of the most tangible outcomes of this acquisition is the potential for widespread adoption of the crypto debit card UK market specifically among students. While crypto debit cards have been around, integrating them directly into a platform already used by tens of thousands of students removes significant barriers to entry. So, what exactly is a crypto debit card? Think of it like a regular debit card, but instead of drawing funds directly from a traditional bank account, it’s linked to your cryptocurrency holdings. When you make a purchase, the crypto is instantly converted to the local currency (in this case, GBP) at the point of sale. This allows users to spend their crypto like regular money anywhere cards are accepted. For UK students, this could mean: Easy Spending: Using crypto to pay for textbooks, groceries, rent, or a well-deserved coffee without needing to manually convert it beforehand. Global Access: Potentially easier international transactions or online purchases. Exploring Crypto: A practical, low-friction way for students to engage with their crypto holdings in their daily lives. By integrating their crypto debit card capabilities with the Science Card platform, Zebec is poised to make spending crypto as easy as swiping a regular student ID or bank card on campus and beyond. Leveraging the Science Card UK Platform The genius of this acquisition lies in the existing infrastructure and user base of Science Card UK . This isn’t Zebec starting from scratch to build a student network; they’re plugging into one that’s already established and trusted. Science Card has successfully navigated the complexities of partnering with UK universities and understanding the specific financial needs and habits of students. Their platform likely includes features relevant to student life, such as discounts, budgeting tools, or integration with university services. Zebec’s challenge and opportunity now is to seamlessly integrate their blockchain payment technology and crypto debit card functionality into the existing Science Card experience. This means maintaining the familiar aspects that students rely on while introducing the new benefits of blockchain. Consider these integration possibilities: Adding an option to link a crypto wallet to the Science Card account. Allowing users to top up their card balance using various cryptocurrencies supported by Zebec. Providing educational resources within the app about managing crypto and using the debit card. The existing relationship Science Card has with over 50,000 students across leading UK institutions provides Zebec with a direct channel to a tech-savvy demographic that is often open to exploring new financial technologies. The Broader Impact on Blockchain Payments UK While the immediate focus is on students, this Zebec acquisition also has wider implications for the landscape of blockchain payments UK . A successful integration and adoption within the university sector could serve as a powerful case study for bringing blockchain-based payment solutions to other demographics and industries in the UK. The UK has been a significant hub for fintech innovation, but the widespread adoption of crypto for everyday payments is still in its early stages. Initiatives like this, which target a specific, receptive market segment with a practical use case (spending), can help normalize and accelerate the use of blockchain technology for transactions. Key takeaways for the UK blockchain payment space: Increased Visibility: Putting crypto debit cards into the hands of tens of thousands of students raises awareness and understanding. Infrastructure Development: This push requires robust backend systems for conversions, compliance, and transaction processing within the UK’s regulatory framework. Setting Precedent: A successful model in the student sector could inspire similar initiatives in other consumer or business segments. Furthermore, Zebec’s foundation on the Solana network highlights the potential for fast, low-cost transactions, which are crucial for micro-payments and frequent spending typical of student life. This acquisition could showcase Solana’s capabilities for real-world payment applications in the UK market. What Does This Mean for Student Finance Crypto? Let’s get specific about the impact on student finance crypto . University life often involves managing budgets carefully, dealing with student loans, part-time work, and various expenses. Introducing a crypto element adds a new dimension. For students who already hold crypto, this provides an easy way to access the value of their digital assets without complex off-ramping processes. For those new to crypto, the integrated platform could serve as a gentle introduction, making it less intimidating to get started. Potential Benefits for Students: Benefit Explanation Convenience Spend crypto easily at millions of locations worldwide. Access to Funds Quickly use the value of crypto holdings for immediate needs. Potential Rewards Some crypto cards offer rewards in crypto or other benefits (details pending Zebec’s integration). Financial Education Opportunity to learn about digital assets and blockchain in a practical way. Potential Challenges Students Should Be Aware Of: Price Volatility: The value of crypto can change rapidly, impacting the spending power of funds held. Regulatory Clarity: The UK’s stance on crypto regulation is evolving, which could affect services. Tax Implications: Spending crypto may have tax consequences depending on individual circumstances and local laws. Understanding Fees: Be aware of any conversion fees, transaction fees, or card maintenance fees. Actionable Insights for Students: If you’re a student at a UK university served by Science Card, keep an eye out for announcements from Zebec and Science Card regarding the integration. Understand how the new features work, research the cryptocurrencies supported, and start small if you’re new to spending crypto. Always prioritize understanding the risks involved, especially regarding volatility. Looking Ahead: The Future of Zebec and UK Student Finance The Zebec acquisition of Science Card is a bold step that positions Zebec to become a key player in the crypto debit card UK market, leveraging an established student network. It highlights the growing trend of blockchain companies seeking real-world use cases and direct consumer adoption. The success of this integration will depend on several factors, including the seamlessness of the technology, the clarity of communication to students, and adapting to the UK’s specific financial and regulatory environment. If successful, it could pave the way for further innovation in student finance crypto and significantly contribute to the broader adoption of blockchain payments UK . This isn’t just about payments; it’s about potentially empowering a new generation with tools to interact with digital assets in a practical, everyday context.

Meta AI, the AI assistant integrated across Meta’s suite of applications, has reached a remarkable benchmark, signaling widespread adoption and Meta’s aggressive push into the AI space. For those following the intersection of technology and digital platforms, this milestone is particularly noteworthy. Rapid Growth in Meta AI Users During the company’s annual shareholder meeting, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta AI now boasts one billion monthly active users. This figure represents a doubling of its user base in a relatively short period, up from 500 million monthly active users reported in September 2024. This rapid growth underscores the increasing consumer interaction with AI features embedded within popular social platforms. The integration of Meta AI across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger has clearly contributed to its swift ascent in user numbers. Making the AI assistant readily available where people already spend their time has removed significant barriers to adoption. What’s Next for Meta AI? Looking ahead, Mark Zuckerberg outlined Meta’s strategic focus for the AI assistant. The primary goal for this year is to enhance the user experience and position Meta AI as a leading personal AI assistant. Key areas of development include: Personalization: Making the AI more tailored to individual user needs and preferences. Voice Conversations: Improving the capability for natural and effective voice interactions. Entertainment: Expanding its use cases within entertainment contexts across Meta’s apps. This focus on deepening the experience suggests Meta is moving beyond basic AI interactions towards creating a more integral and valuable tool for its massive user base. Meta AI Milestone: Paving the Way for Monetization? With a user base of this scale, the question of monetization naturally arises. Zuckerberg indicated that the plan is to first build out the AI assistant’s capabilities and user engagement before focusing on generating revenue. However, he did mention potential future avenues for monetization as the assistant evolves: Inserting paid recommendations within interactions. Launching a subscription service for users seeking access to more compute power or premium features. Should Meta pursue a subscription model, it would enter into direct competition with established players like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which already offers paid tiers for enhanced access and capabilities. This move could reshape the landscape for consumer-facing AI services. The Role of the Standalone AI Assistant App Adding to Meta’s AI momentum, the company launched a standalone Meta AI app just a month prior to this announcement. While the primary driver of the billion users is likely the integration within existing apps, the dedicated app provides a focused environment for users who wish to interact with the AI outside of their social feeds. It also serves as a platform for Meta to test and roll out new AI features more directly. The rapid accumulation of Meta AI users demonstrates the tech giant’s commitment to making AI a core part of its ecosystem and future business model. As the AI assistant continues to evolve, its potential impact on how people interact with technology and digital content will be significant.

One of the most anticipated events in the crypto space is just around the corner. The Circle IPO is officially on the calendar, signaling a significant step for the stablecoin giant and the broader digital asset market. When is the Circle IPO Happening? According to recent reports, stablecoin issuer Circle is targeting the week of June 2nd for its initial public offering. This timeline suggests that the company has finalized key details, including the pricing structure and the official schedule for the launch. This move comes after previous attempts and market explorations, indicating Circle’s readiness to go public amidst improving market sentiment. BlackRock Circle: What’s the Interest? Adding another layer of intrigue to the offering is the reported interest from financial titan BlackRock. The world’s largest asset manager has shown interest in potentially acquiring a 10% stake in Circle. This isn’t the first time BlackRock and Circle have collaborated; BlackRock is a reserve manager for Circle’s USDC stablecoin, holding a portion of its reserves in BlackRock-managed money market funds. This existing relationship makes BlackRock’s potential investment in the public offering a notable development. Is a Pre-IPO BlackRock Deal Likely? While BlackRock’s interest is significant, securing a major pre-IPO deal at this late stage seems unlikely. According to Jay Woods, a strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, such substantial investment agreements are typically finalized much earlier in the IPO process. This suggests that if BlackRock were to acquire a stake, it would likely happen as part of the public offering itself rather than a separate, private transaction beforehand. Why is the Circle Stock Generating Buzz? The potential launch of Circle Stock is generating considerable buzz for several reasons: Improving Market Conditions: The broader financial markets, including tech and crypto-related sectors, have seen more favorable conditions recently, creating a better environment for new public offerings. Strong Demand: There appears to be robust interest from both retail and institutional investors. Reports suggest that major players like ARK Invest are considering a substantial purchase, potentially up to $150 million, signaling confidence in Circle’s business model and future prospects. Leading Stablecoin Position: Circle is the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Its central role in the digital economy and decentralized finance (DeFi) makes it a compelling investment opportunity for those looking for exposure to the crypto space through a regulated entity. What Does This Stablecoin IPO Mean for Crypto? Circle’s move to become a publicly traded company marks a significant milestone for the entire digital asset industry. As a major Stablecoin IPO , it provides traditional investors with direct exposure to a core piece of the crypto infrastructure through a regulated, transparent corporate structure. This could pave the way for more crypto-native companies to follow suit, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital economy. The Bigger Picture: Crypto IPOs on the Horizon? The successful launch of the Crypto IPO by Circle could serve as a crucial test case and a catalyst for other cryptocurrency companies considering going public. It demonstrates that investors are willing to back established, revenue-generating businesses within the crypto ecosystem. This trend could lead to increased transparency and regulatory clarity for the industry as more companies adopt the reporting standards required of public entities. Conclusion Circle’s planned IPO in early June, coupled with strong institutional interest from firms like BlackRock and ARK, highlights growing confidence in the stablecoin issuer and the broader crypto market. While a pre-IPO deal with BlackRock seems improbable at this stage, the overall market reception is expected to be positive. This public offering is not just about Circle; it represents a maturing moment for the crypto industry, offering traditional investors a new avenue to participate in the digital asset revolution.

The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to political debate, but recent developments in the UK are particularly noteworthy. Nigel Farage, the prominent leader of the Reform Party, has unveiled ambitious plans that could fundamentally alter the landscape of UK crypto regulation if his party secures victory in the upcoming general election. This isn’t just minor tinkering; Farage is proposing a bill designed to propel the UK into becoming a global ‘crypto powerhouse’, a vision that surprisingly echoes the stance taken by former US President Donald Trump. What is the Core of the Proposed UK Crypto Bill? At the heart of Nigel Farage’s pitch to the nation’s crypto enthusiasts lies a specific legislative proposal – a dedicated UK crypto bill . This bill isn’t a vague promise; it outlines concrete steps intended to foster growth and adoption within the digital asset space. According to reports, the key pillars of this proposed legislation are designed to make the UK a significantly more attractive jurisdiction for crypto investors and businesses alike. Let’s break down the main components: Reduced Capital Gains Tax: One of the most significant proposals is the intention to slash the capital gains tax rate on crypto investments down to a flat 10%. This is a dramatic reduction from current rates, which can be as high as 20% for higher-rate taxpayers, and is seen as a direct incentive to encourage investment and trading activity within the UK. Regulatory Sandbox for Innovation: The bill aims to establish a dedicated regulatory sandbox specifically for crypto innovation. This provides a controlled environment where businesses can test new technologies, products, and services without facing the full burden of existing regulations initially. It’s designed to encourage experimentation and growth in a safe manner, allowing regulators and innovators to work together. Ensuring the Right to Use Crypto for Payments: A foundational element of broader crypto adoption is its utility in everyday transactions. The proposed bill seeks to explicitly protect and ensure the right for individuals and businesses to use cryptocurrency for payments. This move could pave the way for greater integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. These proposals collectively signal a potential shift from a cautious, sometimes perceived as restrictive, regulatory approach to one that is actively seeking to attract crypto talent and capital. Understanding Nigel Farage’s Crypto Stance For many, linking Nigel Farage crypto policy might seem unexpected. Known primarily for his euroscepticism and populist politics, his foray into the specifics of digital asset regulation highlights the growing importance of crypto as a political issue. Farage’s messaging positions this move as part of a broader strategy to modernize the UK economy, cut red tape, and attract industries of the future. His engagement with the crypto topic isn’t just about economic policy; it’s also a clear attempt to connect with a specific demographic. The cryptocurrency community, particularly younger individuals, often expresses frustration with traditional financial systems and regulatory hurdles. By proposing policies that are seen as pro-crypto, Farage and the Reform Party are directly appealing to this segment of the electorate. This political manoeuvre is proving to be potentially effective. Recent polls and reports indicate that the Reform Party has seen a notable surge in support, particularly among younger voters aged 18-34. While it’s difficult to attribute this rise solely to their crypto stance, it undoubtedly plays a role in differentiating them from more established parties and signalling an openness to new technologies that resonate with this demographic. The Reform Party Crypto Policy: Mirroring Trump’s Approach? One of the most intriguing aspects of Farage’s proposal is the explicit comparison being drawn to Donald Trump’s recent pivot towards a more crypto-friendly position in the United States. Trump, who previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, has increasingly embraced digital assets, holding crypto and making public statements supportive of the industry, often contrasting his view with that of the Biden administration. The parallels between the two leaders’ approaches are striking: Aspect Nigel Farage (UK) Donald Trump (US) Overall Goal Make UK a “crypto powerhouse” Support crypto industry, prevent hostile regulation Key Proposals (Farage) / Stance (Trump) Lower Capital Gains Tax, Regulatory Sandbox, Right to Payments Preventing Fed CBDC, Accepting Crypto Donations, General Pro-Crypto Rhetoric Target Demographic Younger, tech-savvy voters Younger, tech-savvy voters, crypto community Political Strategy Differentiate from opponents, attract future industries Differentiate from opponents, appeal to a growing voter bloc Public Persona Populist, anti-establishment Populist, anti-establishment This mirroring suggests a potential emerging trend in populist politics globally: recognizing the growing economic and political significance of the crypto space and actively courting its participants. Both leaders, known for their anti-establishment appeal, seem to understand that the crypto community often views excessive regulation and traditional financial structures with suspicion. By positioning themselves as champions of crypto, they tap into this sentiment. What Does This Mean for Crypto Tax UK? Let’s delve deeper into the potential impact on crypto tax UK . The current system can be complex, with capital gains tax applied to profits from selling, trading, or gifting crypto. The rate depends on an individual’s overall income and whether they are a basic or higher-rate taxpayer, ranging from 10% to 20% (on gains above the annual allowance). For businesses, crypto is generally subject to Corporation Tax. Farage’s proposal for a flat 10% capital gains tax rate on crypto is a significant departure. This would make the UK’s crypto tax regime potentially one of the most competitive among major economies. The argument for this reduction is multi-faceted: Stimulate Investment: A lower tax burden incentivizes investors to enter the market and trade more actively, potentially increasing liquidity and market size. Attract Capital: Lower taxes can make the UK a more attractive destination for international crypto investors and funds. Simplify Compliance: While not explicitly stated how it would be simplified beyond the rate, a flat rate could potentially simplify calculations for some investors. Increase Tax Revenue (Potentially): The Laffer Curve principle suggests that sometimes lowering tax rates can lead to increased overall tax revenue due to stimulated economic activity. Proponents of the 10% rate would argue this could be the case for crypto. However, critics might raise concerns about fairness (is it equitable to tax crypto gains lower than other asset classes?) and the potential impact on government revenue in the short term. Nevertheless, for crypto investors in the UK, this specific proposal is likely the most immediately impactful part of the potential bill. Challenges and Opportunities for UK Crypto Regulation Implementing a comprehensive UK crypto regulation framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and preventing illicit activity is a delicate balancing act. Farage’s proposed bill presents both significant opportunities and considerable challenges. Opportunities: Becoming a Global Leader: A clear, favorable regulatory environment could position the UK as a preferred location for crypto businesses, startups, and talent, competing with jurisdictions like Switzerland, Singapore, or parts of the US. Fostering Innovation: The regulatory sandbox, in particular, offers a structured way to allow new ideas to flourish without being stifled by outdated rules. Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector can contribute to job creation, investment, and overall economic output. Increased Adoption: Making it easier and more appealing to hold and use crypto could accelerate mainstream adoption among the UK population. Challenges: Defining ‘Crypto’: Regulation needs clear definitions. What specific digital assets would fall under this bill? How would it handle rapidly evolving areas like DeFi, NFTs, or stablecoins? Consumer Protection: While encouraging innovation is key, ensuring adequate protection for retail investors from scams, fraud, and market volatility remains paramount. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system requires robust AML/CTF measures, which can be complex with decentralized technologies. Balancing with Traditional Finance: How would this new framework interact with existing financial regulations and institutions? Would it create an uneven playing field? Political Opposition: Any new bill, especially one touching on complex and sometimes controversial areas like crypto, will face scrutiny and potential opposition from other political parties and stakeholders. The success of such a bill would heavily depend on the details of its implementation and the ability of regulators to adapt to the fast pace of technological change in the crypto space. Can the UK Truly Become a Crypto Powerhouse? Nigel Farage’s ambition is clear: to make the UK a dominant force in the global crypto economy. The proposals within the potential UK crypto bill , particularly the tax reduction and regulatory sandbox, are certainly steps that align with this goal. Countries that have adopted favorable regulatory environments have seen significant growth in their crypto sectors. However, achieving ‘powerhouse’ status requires more than just a favorable bill. It necessitates: Talent Pool: Ensuring a skilled workforce in blockchain technology, cybersecurity, and finance. Infrastructure: Reliable digital infrastructure and connectivity. Banking Relationships: Crypto businesses often struggle with obtaining banking services; supportive traditional finance is crucial. Global Reputation: Building trust and a reputation for regulatory clarity and stability on the international stage. While the proposed bill lays a foundation, becoming a ‘powerhouse’ is a long-term project requiring sustained effort and a holistic approach across various sectors. The Road Ahead for Reform Party Crypto Policy The future of the Reform Party crypto policy hinges significantly on the outcome of the next UK general election. If the party gains substantial influence or forms part of a government, these proposals could move from aspiration to legislation. The rising support for Reform, particularly among demographics interested in crypto, gives these proposals a degree of political weight they might not have had previously. It will be crucial to watch how other political parties react to these proposals. Will they ignore them, criticize them, or perhaps adopt similar, albeit modified, stances to appeal to the same voters? The conversation around crypto regulation in the UK is clearly evolving, pushed forward by these explicit political commitments. For anyone involved in the UK crypto space, understanding the nuances of these proposals and the political forces behind them is essential. It could signal a fundamental shift in how digital assets are treated in the country, impacting everything from investment strategies to business operations. Summary: Nigel Farage and the Reform Party have put forward a bold vision for the UK’s future in the digital asset space, proposing a dedicated UK crypto bill aimed at creating a ‘crypto powerhouse’. Key elements include a significant reduction in crypto tax UK capital gains to 10%, the establishment of a regulatory sandbox, and ensuring the right to use crypto for payments. This approach mirrors recent moves by Donald Trump in the US, highlighting a potential global trend among populist leaders to appeal to the growing crypto community. While the proposals offer clear benefits for fostering innovation and attracting investment, they also present challenges related to implementation, consumer protection, and integration with existing financial systems.

Recently, attention has been drawn to a prominent Hyperliquid whale trader, identified as James Wynn, who is reportedly facing a substantial unrealized loss on a large Bitcoin position. What Happened to the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bitcoin Long? According to data shared by HypurrScan and cited by JinSe Finance, James Wynn, known for his significant trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform, holds a substantial Bitcoin long position. This position, however, is currently underwater, facing an unrealized loss estimated at a staggering $5.4 million. The details surrounding this specific trade highlight the inherent risks associated with high leverage: Trader: James Wynn (a known Hyperliquid whale) Platform: Hyperliquid Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) Position Type: Long (betting on price increase) Leverage: 40x Current Situation: Facing an unrealized loss of approximately $5.4 million An ‘unrealized loss’ means the position is currently losing money based on the market price, but the loss isn’t locked in unless the position is closed or, critically, liquidated. Understanding Leveraged Trading and Liquidation Price This situation brings the concepts of leveraged trading and the liquidation price into sharp focus. Leveraged trading allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. In this case, 40x leverage means James Wynn is trading a Bitcoin position 40 times larger than the initial margin (collateral) he put down. While leverage can significantly amplify profits if the market moves favorably, it equally magnifies losses when the market moves against the position. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out the initial margin. This is where the liquidation price becomes critical. The liquidation price is the specific market price at which a leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent the trader’s losses from exceeding their margin. For James Wynn’s 40x Bitcoin long, the reported liquidation price is set at $106,340. This means if the price of Bitcoin were to drop to this level, Hyperliquid would automatically close his position, realizing the full loss and potentially more, depending on market conditions during liquidation. For a 40x long position, a relatively small percentage drop in the price of Bitcoin can lead to liquidation. Conversely, a 40x short position would face liquidation if the price rose significantly. Why Do Traders Use Such High Leverage? Given the immense risk, one might wonder why traders, especially large ones like a Hyperliquid whale , would use such high leverage like 40x. The primary reason is the potential for outsized returns. Consider this: Without leverage, a 1% increase in Bitcoin price yields a 1% profit on the invested capital. With 40x leverage, a mere 0.25% increase in Bitcoin price could theoretically yield a 10% profit on the initial margin (0.25% * 40 = 10%). This potential to generate significant profits from small price movements attracts aggressive traders. However, the flip side is equally true: a small adverse price movement can lead to rapid and substantial losses, including the loss of the entire initial margin upon reaching the liquidation price . The Implications of a Large Crypto Loss A potential crypto loss of $5.4 million is significant, even for a whale trader. While whales often have deep pockets and can withstand large losses, an event like this highlights the extreme volatility and risk present in the crypto markets, particularly on perpetual futures platforms like Hyperliquid. For the individual trader, reaching the liquidation price means their entire margin for that position is gone. For the platform and other traders, a large liquidation can sometimes add selling pressure to the market, although sophisticated platforms like Hyperliquid have mechanisms designed to minimize market impact. This situation serves as a stark reminder: High leverage is a double-edged sword. Market conditions can change rapidly, turning profitable positions into losing ones quickly. Liquidation is a real and present danger in leveraged trading. Lessons for Traders from This Hyperliquid Whale Situation While the scale of a Hyperliquid whale ‘s position is far beyond that of most retail traders, the principles and risks remain the same. This event offers valuable lessons: Understand Leverage: Never use leverage you don’t fully comprehend. Know the exact price point where your position will be liquidated. Risk Management is Key: Always trade with a stop-loss order to limit potential losses before the liquidation price is reached. Only risk a small percentage of your total trading capital on any single trade. Start Small: If you’re new to leveraged trading, begin with very low leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) to understand the dynamics before considering higher amounts. Volatility Matters: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets. High leverage combined with high volatility dramatically increases the risk of rapid liquidation. Don’t Blindly Follow Whales: While tracking large traders can offer insights, their risk tolerance and capital reserves are vastly different from yours. A loss they can absorb could be catastrophic for a smaller trader. The potential crypto loss faced by James Wynn underscores that even experienced, large-scale traders are not immune to the inherent risks of the market and the amplified dangers of high leverage. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale of High Stakes Bitcoin Longs The situation involving the Hyperliquid whale James Wynn and his substantial unrealized loss on a 40x Bitcoin long serves as a powerful cautionary tale. It vividly illustrates the immense potential rewards and, more importantly, the catastrophic risks associated with high-stakes leveraged trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market. With a reported liquidation price of $106,340 looming, the outcome of this specific position remains uncertain. However, the event itself provides a crucial reminder for all traders: understand your tools, manage your risk diligently, and be acutely aware of the price points that could lead to a significant crypto loss . In the world of high leverage, the margin for error is incredibly thin. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

A recent development that has captured attention is the latest funding round for Twenty One , a prominent Bitcoin treasury firm. The company has successfully raised an additional $100 million, pushing its total capital raised to an impressive $685 million. This news comes as the firm makes significant strides towards a major SPAC merger , signaling growing confidence in the institutional adoption of digital assets and highlighting the potential for substantial Cryptocurrency Investment in structured financial products. Twenty One’s Funding Milestone: Reaching $685 Million The additional $100 million was secured through convertible senior secured notes. This type of financing allows investors to potentially convert their debt into equity at a later date, often under specific conditions. According to CoinDesk, this recent infusion of capital stems from existing investors and sponsors exercising options that were part of an earlier fundraising round in April. Key details of the financing include: Amount Raised: An additional $100 million. Financing Instrument: Convertible senior secured notes. Total Capital: Brings Twenty One’s total capital raised to $685 million. Source: Existing investors and sponsors exercising April options. Note Terms: 1% coupon rate, due in 2030. This substantial fundraising underscores strong investor belief in Twenty One’s strategy and future prospects, particularly as a leading Digital Asset Firm focused on treasury management involving Bitcoin . Navigating the Path to Public Markets: The SPAC Merger with CEP Beyond the funding news, Twenty One is actively progressing towards a merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners (CEP). The chosen route for this significant corporate event is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger structure. What is a SPAC merger? A SPAC, often called a “blank check company,” is a firm with no commercial operations that is formed solely to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company. For a private company like Twenty One, merging with a listed SPAC offers an alternative path to becoming a publicly traded entity compared to a traditional IPO. The strategic rationale behind this SPAC merger with a reputable financial institution like CEP is clear. It provides Twenty One with: Public Listing: Access to public capital markets. Enhanced Credibility: Association with a long-standing financial player like Cantor Equity Partners. Increased Visibility: Greater exposure to institutional and retail investors. This move is a significant step for a Digital Asset Firm seeking mainstream financial integration. Twenty One’s Strategy: A Focus on Bitcoin and Treasury Management Twenty One positions itself as a Bitcoin treasury firm. This implies a focus on holding and managing significant amounts of Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, potentially similar to other public companies that have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Led by Brandon Lutnick, the firm’s actions suggest a strong conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. This is further evidenced by their disclosed $458 million Bitcoin acquisition earlier this month. Such substantial acquisitions by institutional players are closely watched indicators of increasing institutional confidence and can influence overall sentiment around Cryptocurrency Investment . What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investment and the Market? The developments surrounding Twenty One , its significant fundraising, and its impending SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners carry broader implications for the digital asset landscape and Cryptocurrency Investment : Institutional Validation: Large fundraising rounds and mergers involving established financial names signal growing institutional acceptance and integration of digital assets. M&A Trend: This highlights a potential trend of mergers and acquisitions as digital asset firms seek scale, regulatory clarity, and access to traditional financial markets. Maturation of the Space: The use of sophisticated financial instruments like convertible notes and structures like SPACs indicates the increasing maturity of the digital asset industry. Focus on Bitcoin: Twenty One’s clear focus on Bitcoin treasury management reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a potential corporate reserve asset. For investors interested in the institutional side of crypto, Twenty One’s journey provides a compelling case study of how a Digital Asset Firm is navigating growth and seeking integration with traditional finance. Conclusion Twenty One’s successful raising of an additional $100 million, bringing its total capital to $685 million, is a significant financial milestone. Coupled with the active progress towards a SPAC merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners, these events underscore the firm’s ambitious growth trajectory and the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world. As a dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm, Twenty One’s strategic moves, including its recent substantial Bitcoin acquisition, reflect a strong commitment to digital assets. This progression is a positive indicator for the broader landscape of institutional Cryptocurrency Investment and the continued evolution of the Digital Asset Firm ecosystem.

When it comes to digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, the lack of a defined legal framework has been a significant hurdle for many businesses looking to integrate this technology. However, recent comments from a major player in the traditional finance space suggest that progress on this front could be a game-changer. The prospect of a US stablecoin bill is being viewed with optimism by industry leaders. Why Does the MoneyGram CEO See This as a ‘Huge Unlock’? Anthony Soohoo, the CEO of MoneyGram, a long-standing global leader in cross-border peer-to-peer payments, recently shared his perspective on the potential impact of forthcoming stablecoin regulation in the U.S. According to reports from financial news aggregators, Soohoo described the passage of such legislation as a “huge unlock” from a business standpoint. But what exactly does this mean, and why is a company like MoneyGram so interested in stablecoins? For MoneyGram, a business deeply entrenched in facilitating the movement of money across borders, stablecoins represent a potential evolution of their core services. Here’s a breakdown of why clear rules around stablecoins could be so impactful: Faster Settlements: Traditional cross-border payments can involve multiple intermediaries and take days to settle. Stablecoins, built on blockchain technology, offer the potential for near-instantaneous settlement, drastically reducing transaction times. Lower Costs: Reducing the number of intermediaries and streamlining the settlement process can lead to significant cost savings, both for the business and the end consumer sending or receiving money. Expanded Reach: Stablecoins could potentially open up new corridors and markets where traditional banking infrastructure is less accessible or more expensive. Innovation in Financial Products: Regulatory clarity allows companies to build new services and products on top of stablecoin rails, fostering innovation in payments, remittances, and potentially other financial services. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: The current ambiguous regulatory landscape creates risk and hinders investment. A clear US stablecoin bill would provide the necessary legal certainty for businesses to confidently invest in and deploy stablecoin-based solutions at scale. Soohoo’s comments underscore the growing recognition among established financial institutions that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, are not just a fringe technology but a powerful tool that can enhance existing business models and create new opportunities, provided the regulatory environment is conducive. What Could Stablecoin Legislation Entail? While the specifics of any potential US stablecoin bill are still being debated in Congress, discussions generally revolve around key areas aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring stability and consumer protection. Potential elements of such legislation could include: Issuance Standards: Requirements for stablecoin issuers regarding reserves (what assets back the stablecoin), transparency, and auditing. This is crucial for ensuring that a stablecoin maintains its peg to the underlying asset (like the US dollar). Licensing and Supervision: Establishing which regulatory bodies (e.g., banking regulators, SEC, CFTC) would oversee stablecoin issuers and potentially other entities involved in stablecoin activities. Consumer Protection: Rules designed to protect users from fraud, ensure clear disclosure of risks, and provide recourse in case of issues. Interoperability: Potentially addressing how different stablecoins and traditional financial systems can interact seamlessly. Passing comprehensive crypto regulation, specifically for stablecoins, is seen by proponents as essential for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in financial innovation. Without clear rules, businesses might hesitate to build and operate stablecoin services within the U.S., potentially pushing this activity to other jurisdictions. The Broader Impact of a US Stablecoin Bill The enthusiasm expressed by the MoneyGram CEO highlights a significant shift. It indicates that major players in traditional finance are not only observing the digital asset space but are actively anticipating and advocating for regulatory clarity to leverage this technology. A well-crafted US stablecoin bill could have ripple effects beyond just payments and remittances: Increased Institutional Adoption: Regulatory certainty is a major factor for larger financial institutions considering entering the digital asset space. Clear rules for stablecoins could pave the way for broader adoption across various financial sectors. Enhanced Dollar Dominance: By providing a clear framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins, the U.S. could strengthen the international role of the dollar in the digital age. Foundation for Future Innovation: Stablecoins are often seen as a foundational element for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based applications. Regulation could provide a stable base for these sectors to grow responsibly. While challenges remain, including finding the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks, the potential benefits articulated by leaders like MoneyGram’s CEO underscore the importance of legislative action. The passage of a thoughtful US stablecoin bill is widely anticipated as a crucial step towards integrating digital assets more fully into the mainstream economy. Conclusion: A Path to Growth Through Clarity Anthony Soohoo’s characterization of a US stablecoin bill as a “huge unlock” for business is a powerful endorsement from a company that understands the complexities of moving money globally. His comments reflect a growing sentiment within the financial industry that clear, effective stablecoin legislation is not just about regulating a new technology, but about enabling significant business efficiencies, cost reductions, and opportunities for innovation. As discussions continue in Washington, the business world, from established giants like MoneyGram to agile fintech startups, will be watching closely, hopeful that regulatory clarity will indeed unlock the full potential of stablecoins and other digital assets in the United States.

Judson Althoff, a Chief commercial officer of Microsoft, told workers that the British Universal bank signed on to buy 100,000 licenses of Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant, marking a significant deal. At the standard list price of $30 per user per month, this deal could generate approximately $36 million in annual revenue for the tech firm, though large clients typically receive bulk discounts. Microsoft has embedded Copilot, its flagship AI offering, across its products. During the firm’s third-quarter earnings call on April 30, CEO Satya Nadella listed an array of Copilot-infused applications and strong adoptions. According to Nadella, the tech firm is previewing a first-of-its-kind software engineering agent capable of asynchronously handling developer tasks. He noted that GitHub Copilot now has over 15 million users, a more than fourfold increase year-over-year, with adoption by both digital-native firms like Twilio and large enterprises including Cisco, HPE, Skyscanner, and Target, all leveraging the tool to embed AI across the entire software development lifecycle. Microsoft reveals its main focus of increasing Copilot adoption The people who wished to remain anonymous as the deal was privately revealed that Althoff said several dozen clients — such as Accenture Plc, Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG, and Siemens AG — now have more than 100,000 Copilot users. Microsoft is concentrating on getting Copilot adopted and is closely monitoring how much of the customer workforce is using the tools, Satya Narayana Nadella, a chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft, said during a company-wide town hall event. Following its close partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and as such, it is inserting Copilot into its suite of productivity apps. The world’s largest software maker is seen as a leader in commercializing AI products. Microsoft said in January that its AI suite, which includes cloud infrastructure and AI applications, was on track to achieve at least $13 billion in annual revenue. Despite all these progresses, Wall Street is still eager to see proof that the multibillion-dollar bet is working. Corporate clients describe Copilot as a measured rollout and a series of trials Many anecdotes have emerged on corporate customers adopting Copilot, but Microsoft has not shared a total customer count or the financial impact of those sales. Other corporate clients have said the tools need a lot of internal tweaks and employee training. Moreover, many say their use of Copilot is best described not as a race to equip all of their employees with the expensive software as quickly as possible but as a measured rollout plus a series of trials. Weeks after disclosing plans to lay off 6,000 workers — nearly 3% of the workforce — Microsoft also has reason to rally the troops. In the meeting, Nadella addressed the cuts and explained that they were driven by organizational changes rather than employee performance. The layoffs were concentrated on the people who build the company’s products, suggesting that even engineering jobs are not immune to the age of artificial intelligence. Microsoft declined to comment on the matter. Representatives from Barclays, Accenture, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Siemens also did not provide a statement.

Bitcoin $90,000 Dream Is A “Fairy Tale” “To make it clear,” the analyst wrote, “the idea to casually dip to 90K and resume the daily uptrend sounds like a fairy tale to me.” According to Dr. Cat, such a move would require Bitcoin to breach no fewer than four critical support levels on higher timeframes, which he considers “so unrealistic that… [it] may come only in the dreams of someone sidelined waiting for these prices.” Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Instead, Dr. Cat identifies a narrow window of “imbalances” across the daily, 2-day, and 3-day Ichimoku indicators—most notably between $102,600 and $106,300—that remain untapped. “These are pending a touch,” he noted, pointing to the Kijun Sen and Tenkan Sen levels as crucial balance markers. The weekly Chikou Span (lagging span), a key indicator in Ichimoku theory, currently sits above prior candle closes—a historically bullish condition that suggests Bitcoin is still in a strong uptrend unless it closes below those support levels. Dr. Cat charted these historical supports using the 26-period look-back rule: approximately $103.600 for this week, rising to $108.300 by mid-June before dipping toward $99,000 by late June. “If CS has managed to keep above candles so well until now on the steepest past slope, it’s very unlikely to go below them,” he emphasized. However, the bullish case comes with a short fuse. A pivotal technical event—the bullish TK cross on the weekly chart—is expected on June 9. “But if [it’s] below ATH, it will be fake as Kijun Sen will be flat,” he warned. In plain terms: unless Bitcoin prints a new all-time high shortly after the TK cross, the signal will be invalidated. On the other hand, a new ATH post-cross would confirm what Dr. Cat calls a “super clear and bullish signal: very, very unlikely not to be followed immediately by a strong bullish continuation.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock Notably, he flags a divergence between BTCUSD and BTCEUR, the latter of which is already showing the Chikou Span dipping into candle territory, a neutral-to-bearish signal. “BTCEUR… looks significantly worse than BTCUSD,” he observed. “This chart is simply neutral and can go either way: much higher than here, or as low as ~70K EUR.” He attributes some of the current BTCUSD bullishness to USD weakness, adding that mid-June will likely clarify whether this price strength is structurally sound or artificially inflated. Zooming out to the monthly chart, Dr. Cat unveiled his most aggressive forecast yet: $270,000 per BTC, based on Ichimoku Price Theory’s “4E model.” While he acknowledged this as a “wild guess,” he argued that the crypto market tends to defy consensus expectations. “Plenty of people seem to be skeptical of this bull run,” he said. “And even if they expect it to continue, they bet mostly on shy/moderate targets. My bet is on the latter [being surpassed].” The next two to three weeks will be decisive. A failure to break all-time highs in June—combined with Chikou Span weakness or daily trend breakdowns—could signal a prolonged cool-off into Q4. Until then, all eyes are on the weekly TK cross and the market’s reaction. At press time, BTC traded at $108,783.

Veteran gold advocate and renowned Bitcoin skeptic, Peter Schiff, recently stirred the pot by attending the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. His presence alone was noteworthy, but it was his outspoken commentary that truly grabbed headlines, reigniting the fiery Peter Schiff Bitcoin debate. Schiff didn’t hold back, leveling sharp criticisms against the leading cryptocurrency and firmly reiterating his long-held belief that only gold holds the status of a true reserve asset. What Exactly Did Peter Schiff Claim About Bitcoin? Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, used the platform not to praise Bitcoin, but to dismantle its perceived value and purpose. His core arguments, as stated during or around the conference, were pointed and direct: No Intrinsic Value: Schiff asserted that Bitcoin is an asset devoid of intrinsic value. Unlike commodities or productive assets, he argues, Bitcoin doesn’t inherently produce anything or have a physical use case beyond speculation. This lack of inherent worth, in his view, means it cannot create real wealth in the traditional sense. A ‘Giant Cult’: Perhaps his most provocative claim was labeling the Bitcoin community a “giant cult.” This suggests a group bound by fervent, perhaps irrational, belief rather than fundamental value or logic. Not a Technological Innovation: Countering a common narrative, Schiff dismissed Bitcoin as a significant technological breakthrough, instead comparing its structure and market dynamics to that of a meme coin – assets often driven purely by hype and community sentiment rather than underlying technology or utility. Gold is the ONLY True Reserve Asset: Schiff doubled down on his stance that gold is the unparalleled store of value and the sole true reserve asset. He cited the continued purchasing of gold by central banks globally as evidence supporting this claim, contrasting it sharply with their lack of significant Bitcoin holdings. These statements underscore the fundamental divide between gold bugs like Schiff and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world. For Schiff, Bitcoin’s value is purely speculative, a bubble waiting to burst, while gold’s value is timeless, proven by millennia of history and its tangible nature. Exploring the Core of the Bitcoin Intrinsic Value Debate The concept of Bitcoin intrinsic value is a central point of contention. For traditional investors like Schiff, intrinsic value is often tied to physical properties, utility, or the ability to generate future cash flows (like a stock). Gold has industrial uses, serves as jewelry, and has a long history as a medium of exchange and store of value. Bitcoin proponents argue that its value isn’t ‘intrinsic’ in the traditional sense, but derived from other crucial factors: Decentralization: Its independence from central authorities makes it censorship-resistant and a hedge against traditional financial system risks. Scarcity: The hard cap of 21 million coins creates digital scarcity, a key driver of value, similar to how the limited supply of gold contributes to its value. Network Effect: The growing number of users, developers, and businesses built around Bitcoin increases its utility and security. Security: The robust proof-of-work mechanism makes the network incredibly secure against attacks. Utility as Digital Gold/Store of Value: In a digital age, Bitcoin offers a way to store and transfer value across borders without intermediaries, acting as a digital alternative to gold. While Bitcoin lacks physical form or industrial use, its value proposition lies in its unique digital properties and the robust network supporting it. The debate hinges on whether these digital attributes constitute a form of ‘intrinsic’ or fundamental value in the 21st century. Is the Bitcoin Community a ‘Giant Cult’? Addressing the Bitcoin Cult Claim Schiff’s description of the community as a Bitcoin cult is undoubtedly inflammatory. While the term ‘cult’ typically implies blind devotion, manipulative leadership, and isolation from reality, the Bitcoin community is characterized by passionate belief, strong evangelism, and a shared vision for a decentralized future. Similar to early adopters of any revolutionary technology or movement, Bitcoin enthusiasts often display deep conviction and are eager to convert others. They pore over technical details, debate economic theories, and actively participate in promoting adoption. This passion can sometimes be perceived as cult-like by outsiders, especially given the asset’s volatility and the strong conviction many holders have in its long-term success despite setbacks. However, comparing it directly to a harmful cult ignores the open, decentralized nature of the community, the lack of a single leader, and the fact that participation is voluntary and based on investment thesis or ideological alignment rather than coercive control. While pockets of extreme views or toxic behavior exist, labeling the entire global community a ‘cult’ is a broad generalization that many find unfair and dismissive. Bitcoin vs Gold: The Ultimate Reserve Asset Showdown The core of Schiff’s argument and a perpetual topic of discussion is the Bitcoin vs Gold comparison. For centuries, gold has been the go-to asset during times of economic uncertainty, held by individuals and nations alike as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Its status as a Gold reserve asset is well-established. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a newcomer, only gaining prominence in the last decade. Its proponents argue it possesses properties that make it superior to gold in the digital age. Let’s look at a comparison: Feature Gold Bitcoin Intrinsic Value (Traditional View) Yes (Physical, Industrial, Jewelry) Debatable (Digital Utility, Network Effect) Scarcity Finite (Mining is difficult but supply increases) Absolutely Finite (Hard cap of 21 million) Portability Difficult (Heavy, requires security) Easy (Digital, can be sent anywhere instantly) Divisibility Difficult (Cutting/melting) Easy (Divisible up to 8 decimal places – satoshis) Verifiability Requires expertise/equipment Easy (Blockchain transparency) Storage Cost/Security Requires secure vaults, insurance Requires digital security (wallets, keys) Historical Precedent as Money/Store of Value Thousands of years ~15 years Central Bank Adoption as Reserve Asset Widespread and increasing Minimal (Some exploration/discussion) Volatility Relatively low High While gold has the advantage of history and stability, Bitcoin excels in areas like portability, divisibility, and transparency in the digital realm. The debate isn’t just about which is better, but whether Bitcoin can carve out its own role as a digital store of value or even a future reserve asset alongside, or perhaps eventually challenging, gold. Why Do Central Banks Still Prefer Gold? Schiff correctly points out that central banks are currently buying gold, not Bitcoin. This preference for Gold reserve asset status among national banks stems from several factors: History and Trust: Gold has been a trusted store of value and medium of exchange for millennia. Central banks have vast experience managing gold reserves. Stability and Liquidity: While not immune to price swings, gold is generally less volatile than Bitcoin and has deep, established global markets for trading. Regulatory Clarity: The legal and regulatory framework around holding and managing gold is well-defined internationally. Bitcoin, conversely, faces significant regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions. Physical Control: Central banks can physically hold and secure their gold reserves within their borders, offering a sense of direct control that differs from holding digital assets distributed globally. However, the landscape is slowly evolving. Some central banks and international bodies are exploring digital currencies (CBDCs) and the potential implications of decentralized cryptocurrencies. While mass adoption of Bitcoin as a central bank reserve asset isn’t imminent, the conversation is no longer entirely off the table for some forward-thinking institutions. Actionable Insights for Investors What should investors take away from the ongoing Peter Schiff Bitcoin vs. Gold debate? Do Your Own Research: Don’t rely solely on the opinions of one person, whether they are a gold bug or a Bitcoin maximalist. Understand the fundamentals of both assets. Consider Diversification: Many investors choose to hold both gold and Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio, leveraging the unique characteristics of each. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is significantly more volatile than gold. Assess how much risk you are comfortable taking. Long-Term Perspective: Both gold and Bitcoin are often viewed as long-term stores of value. Consider your investment horizon. Schiff’s criticisms, while harsh, highlight legitimate questions about Bitcoin’s valuation and role. However, they often overlook the innovative aspects and growing adoption that make Bitcoin a compelling asset for many in the digital age. Conclusion: An Unending Debate Peter Schiff’s appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference and his subsequent remarks served as a stark reminder of the ideological chasm separating traditional finance advocates and the cryptocurrency world. His claims of Bitcoin having no Bitcoin intrinsic value , being a ‘giant cult,’ and his insistence on gold as the sole Gold reserve asset are consistent with his long-held views. While Schiff’s criticisms resonate with those skeptical of digital assets, they fail to fully capture the arguments for Bitcoin’s value derived from its decentralized network, absolute scarcity, and growing utility as a digital store of value. The Bitcoin vs Gold debate is far from over, reflecting differing views on what constitutes value and security in the modern economy. Ultimately, the choice between Bitcoin, gold, or a combination of both depends on an individual investor’s financial goals, risk appetite, and belief in the future trajectory of both traditional and digital assets. Schiff’s comments, though controversial, contribute to a necessary dialogue about the nature of money and value in the 21st century.

The latest development sparking discussion comes from Spain, where banking behemoth Santander is reportedly exploring a potential entry into the cryptocurrency market. According to insights shared by ‘Unfolded’ on the social media platform X, the initial focus of this exploration centers on early-stage plans for a stablecoin. This move by a major global bank like Santander underscores the growing trend of Santander crypto interest within established financial institutions. Why Are Giants Like Santander Eyeing Banking Stablecoins? Santander isn’t operating in a vacuum. Its reported interest in stablecoins reflects a broader trend across the financial industry. Banks and financial institutions are recognizing the potential efficiencies and new opportunities that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, can offer. But why the sudden (or perhaps not so sudden) pivot? Efficiency in Payments and Settlements: Traditional cross-border payments can be slow, expensive, and involve multiple intermediaries. Stablecoins operating on blockchain technology offer the potential for near-instantaneous, 24/7 settlements at significantly lower costs. This is particularly attractive for corporate banking and interbank transfers. Exploring Tokenized Assets: Beyond simple payments, stablecoins can serve as the foundational layer for trading and settling other tokenized assets, such as real estate, securities, or commodities, on a blockchain. Banks want to be at the forefront of this potential revolution in asset management and trading. Meeting Evolving Customer Needs: Corporate clients, especially those involved in international trade or digital businesses, are increasingly looking for faster and more flexible payment solutions. Stablecoins could provide a digital-native answer to these demands. Staying Competitive: The rise of FinTech companies and dedicated crypto platforms offering digital asset services is pressuring traditional banks to innovate. Ignoring the digital asset space is no longer a viable long-term strategy. Anticipating Regulatory Shifts: While the regulatory landscape for stablecoins and other digital assets is still evolving, banks are positioning themselves to be ready when clearer frameworks emerge. Developing internal expertise and pilot programs now is crucial for future compliance and market participation. The exploration of banking stablecoins by institutions like Santander signals a strategic move to adapt to a changing financial ecosystem. It’s not just about dipping toes; it’s about understanding how digital value transfer can integrate with existing financial infrastructure. What Could a Santander Bank Digital Currency Look Like? While details are scarce, a stablecoin issued or utilized by a major bank like Santander would likely differ in significant ways from the stablecoins most commonly used in the public crypto market (like USDT or USDC). Here are some potential characteristics: A Santander stablecoin would likely be: Fiat-Backed 1:1: Pegged directly to a major fiat currency like the Euro or potentially the US Dollar, with reserves held by the bank itself, ensuring stability. Permissioned or Enterprise-Focused: Initially, it might not be a public stablecoin accessible to everyone. Instead, it could operate on a permissioned blockchain network, limited to verified institutional clients or used internally for interbank settlements. Regulatory Compliant: Designed from the ground up to adhere to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, as required by traditional banking standards. Use Case Specific: Focused initially on specific applications like cross-border payments, corporate treasury management, or the settlement of tokenized securities, rather than broad retail adoption. This approach allows banks to explore the technology in a controlled environment, mitigating some of the risks associated with public, permissionless networks while adhering to their regulatory obligations. The concept of a bank digital currency , whether a stablecoin or a direct digital representation of liabilities, is becoming a key area of focus. Benefits of Institutional Crypto Adoption for the Financial System The potential entry of major players like Santander into the crypto space through initiatives like stablecoins carries significant implications, not just for the bank itself, but for the broader financial system and the digital asset market. This trend of institutional crypto adoption offers several potential benefits: For Banks and Institutions: Operational Efficiency: Reduced costs and time for transactions, especially cross-border. New Revenue Streams: Potential for offering new digital asset services, custody, and facilitating tokenized markets. Enhanced Risk Management: Potential for real-time settlement reduces counterparty risk in certain transactions. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Staying relevant in a rapidly digitizing global economy. For the Crypto Market: Increased Legitimacy: Participation from regulated financial giants lends credibility to the digital asset space. Potential for Increased Liquidity: As institutions engage, they can bring significant capital and trading volume. Development of Robust Infrastructure: Institutional needs drive the development of more secure, scalable, and compliant digital asset infrastructure. For Users (eventually): Faster, Cheaper Transactions: While initial focus might be institutional, the underlying technology improvements could eventually benefit retail users. New Financial Products: Access to tokenized assets and other digital-native financial services. This evolution signifies a maturation of the digital asset space, moving beyond speculative retail trading towards integration into core financial functions. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges of Stablecoin Regulation and Adoption While the potential is clear, the path for banks entering the crypto space, particularly with stablecoins, is fraught with challenges. The primary hurdle remains stablecoin regulation . Here’s a look at some key challenges: Challenge Description Implication for Banks Regulatory Uncertainty Lack of clear, harmonized global or even regional rules specifically for stablecoins and digital assets held by regulated entities. Creates legal and compliance risks, hinders development and deployment. Technical Integration Integrating new blockchain technology with complex, often legacy, banking systems. Requires significant investment, expertise, and presents operational challenges. Security Risks Threats of hacking, smart contract vulnerabilities, and cyberattacks targeting digital asset infrastructure. Requires robust security protocols and constant vigilance to protect assets and data. Competition Competing with existing public stablecoins, other banks developing similar solutions, and potential Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Requires a strong value proposition and efficient execution to gain market share. Public Perception Addressing concerns about volatility (even for stablecoins, perceived risk), scams, and the association of crypto with illicit activities. Requires clear communication and building trust with clients and the public. Overcoming these challenges requires close collaboration between banks, regulators, and technology providers. The success of initiatives like Santander’s potential stablecoin will heavily depend on navigating this complex landscape. Examples of Institutional Crypto Adoption Beyond Santander Santander’s exploration is part of a larger trend. Several other major financial institutions have already taken steps into the digital asset space, providing a roadmap and context for Santander’s potential move: JPMorgan Chase: Launched JPM Coin, a private, permissioned blockchain-based system for wholesale payments between institutional clients. This is a prime example of a bank-issued digital currency for specific use cases. DBS Bank (Singapore): Established a digital asset exchange, allowing institutional and accredited investors to trade cryptocurrencies and eventually tokenized assets. Goldman Sachs: Has been active in cryptocurrency trading and exploring tokenization of traditional financial assets. Various Banks in Pilot Programs: Many banks globally are participating in pilot programs exploring blockchain technology for interbank settlements, trade finance, and other applications, often involving forms of digital tokens or stablecoins. These examples demonstrate that institutional crypto adoption is not just theoretical; it’s actively happening. Banks are exploring different angles, from direct trading and custody to issuing their own digital currencies for specific purposes. Santander’s focus on stablecoins aligns with the payment and settlement efficiency angle pursued by many. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? While Santander’s initial stablecoin plans are likely focused on institutional use, developments like this have broader implications for the financial world and anyone interested in crypto: Watch for Regulatory Clarity: Increased institutional involvement puts more pressure on regulators to provide clear rules. Keep an eye on regulatory announcements in major financial hubs. Clearer rules could accelerate adoption. Observe Use Case Development: Pay attention to how banks like Santander plan to use stablecoins. Will it be limited to internal transfers, or will it extend to corporate payments, trade finance, or even facilitating tokenized asset trading? Understand the Difference: Recognize that a bank-issued stablecoin might operate differently (e.g., permissioned network, strict KYC) than public stablecoins you might use on a crypto exchange. Institutional Flow Matters: As more institutions engage, it can potentially bring more stability and volume to certain parts of the crypto market, particularly those related to infrastructure and regulated digital assets. The Future of Finance is Hybrid: Santander’s move reinforces the idea that the future financial system will likely be a hybrid, integrating traditional finance with elements of decentralized or distributed ledger technology. Santander’s reported exploration is a signal that major banks see a future where digital assets play a role. It’s a development worth following closely. Conclusion: Santander’s Stablecoin Step and the Future of Banking Santander’s early-stage exploration into the crypto market, specifically focusing on stablecoins, is a significant indicator of the direction traditional finance is heading. It’s not an isolated event but rather part of a larger wave of institutional crypto adoption as banks seek to leverage the potential efficiencies and opportunities presented by digital assets. While challenges, particularly around stablecoin regulation and technical integration, remain substantial, the strategic imperative for banks to innovate in the digital realm is clear. Whether Santander’s plans fully materialize and how their potential bank digital currency is implemented will be key developments to watch. What is certain is that the lines between traditional banking and the digital asset world are increasingly blurring, promising a more integrated and potentially more efficient financial future.

This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a complete pivot, signaling strong conviction in the future of a specific blockchain ecosystem. The decision involves exiting a long-held position in one of crypto’s giants to go all-in on another. Understanding the Bold Solana Treasury Shift At the heart of the news is Sol Strategies’ decision to fully allocate its treasury assets to Solana (SOL). Previously holding a position in Bitcoin (BTC), the company has now liquidated its entire Bitcoin holdings to acquire a substantial amount of SOL. Specifically, Sol Strategies announced via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it purchased 26,478 SOL for $4.7 million. This acquisition brings their total Solana treasury holdings to a staggering 420,355 SOL. To put this into perspective, based on recent market valuations, this Solana treasury is estimated to be worth approximately CAD $100 million. This isn’t pocket change; it represents a significant corporate asset base now solely tied to the performance and growth of the Solana network. Why the Bitcoin Exit? The decision to execute a complete Bitcoin exit from their treasury is perhaps as noteworthy as the move into Solana. For many companies holding crypto on their balance sheets, Bitcoin has been the default, perceived as the safest and most established digital asset. Sol Strategies’ departure from this common practice suggests a strategic re-evaluation of their long-term asset management goals and a potentially higher conviction in the growth trajectory and utility offered by the Solana ecosystem compared to Bitcoin for their specific objectives. Sol Strategies’ Vision: More Than Just a SOL Investment Sol Strategies explicitly stated that this massive SOL investment is not merely a speculative play on the price of Solana. The company articulated a clear rationale rooted in a long-term commitment to the Solana ecosystem . A key part of their strategy involves supporting validator growth within the network. By holding and potentially staking such a large amount of SOL, Sol Strategies can play a significant role in the network’s security, decentralization, and overall health. This suggests a belief in Solana’s technology, its development community, and its potential to scale and handle widespread adoption. Here’s a quick look at the key figures: Previous Treasury Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) New Treasury Asset: Solana (SOL) Recent Acquisition: 26,478 SOL Cost of Acquisition: $4.7 million Total SOL Holdings: 420,355 SOL Estimated Value of Treasury: ~CAD $100 million Stated Goal: Long-term commitment, support validator growth What Does This Mean for the Solana Ecosystem? A treasury move of this magnitude from a known entity like Sol Strategies can have several implications for the Solana ecosystem : Increased Confidence: It can signal strong institutional or corporate confidence in Solana’s technology and future prospects, potentially encouraging other investors. Validator Growth Support: By dedicating significant capital to SOL holdings, Sol Strategies can contribute to the network’s security and decentralization through staking, aligning their financial interests with the network’s operational success. Market Sentiment: Large, publicly announced purchases can positively influence market sentiment around SOL. Potential for Further Development: A company deeply invested in the ecosystem is more likely to participate in or fund further development and innovation on Solana. Is a Full Treasury Allocation Risky? While the move signals strong conviction, allocating an entire treasury to a single, volatile asset like SOL does come with inherent risks. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their price swings, and concentrating assets removes the diversification benefits that holding multiple assets (like Bitcoin and others) might offer. However, Sol Strategies’ focus on validator growth suggests they may be looking beyond short-term price movements and are focused on the yield and network participation benefits that come with staking. Looking Ahead: Sol Strategies and the Solana Treasury Sol Strategies’ decision is a bold statement in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto treasury management. It moves away from the more common diversified or Bitcoin-centric approaches and places a significant bet on Solana’s continued growth and success. The outcome of this strategy will be closely watched, not only by those interested in Sol Strategies’ performance but also by the broader crypto community keen to see how such a concentrated, ecosystem-focused treasury performs over the long term and what impact it has on the Solana ecosystem itself. This development highlights a growing trend where companies are not just holding crypto but are strategically aligning their assets with specific blockchain ecosystems they believe will drive future innovation and value.

That vision is becoming more of a reality as companies like Rain, a prominent cryptocurrency card issuer, continue to innovate. Rain is making waves with its latest announcement: expanding support for stablecoin payments specifically on the Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and Stellar (XLM) networks. This move is significant for users looking for faster, potentially cheaper ways to spend their stablecoins. The Expansion of Stablecoin Payments Rain’s decision to integrate support for stablecoins residing on the Solana, Tron, and Stellar blockchains marks a notable step in bridging the gap between the crypto economy and traditional finance. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value relative to an asset like the US dollar, are increasingly popular for transactions due to their reduced volatility compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. By enabling payments using stablecoins from these specific networks, Rain is tapping into ecosystems known for their transaction speed and efficiency. This expansion means users holding stablecoins (such as USDC or USDT, which are available on these networks) can potentially access and spend those funds more readily through their Rain debit or credit card. It simplifies the process that might otherwise involve multiple steps like sending funds to an exchange, converting them to fiat, and then transferring to a bank account. The direct spending capability via a card offers a more seamless experience. What is the Rain Crypto Platform? Before diving deeper into the network expansion, it’s helpful to understand Rain itself. Rain operates as a cryptocurrency platform that facilitates the use of digital assets in the traditional payment ecosystem. Essentially, they provide cards (both debit and credit options are mentioned) that allow users to spend their crypto holdings at merchants worldwide that accept card payments. The platform handles the backend conversion process. When a user makes a purchase, Rain typically converts the necessary amount of cryptocurrency (now including supported stablecoins on SOL, TRX, XLM) into the required fiat currency at the point of sale. This abstraction makes the transaction feel like a regular card payment for both the user and the merchant. Rain has demonstrated growth and attracted investor confidence, notably securing $24.5 million in an investment round led by Norwest Ventures. This funding indicates market belief in the potential of crypto-to-fiat payment solutions and provides Rain with resources to expand its offerings, such as this latest network integration. Connecting Your Funds: How the Crypto Card Works Using a crypto card like the one offered by Rain typically involves linking your crypto wallet or account on the Rain platform to the physical or virtual card. When you make a purchase: You swipe or tap the card at a point-of-sale terminal or use it online. The transaction request goes to the card network (like Visa or Mastercard, depending on the issuer). The request is forwarded to Rain. Rain calculates the equivalent amount of crypto (in this case, the stablecoin on the specific network) needed to cover the fiat cost of the transaction. Rain executes a conversion of the required crypto amount into fiat currency in real-time (or near real-time). The fiat is used to settle the transaction with the merchant. The equivalent crypto balance is deducted from your Rain account. This process requires robust infrastructure to handle rapid conversions and fluctuating crypto prices, although stablecoins mitigate the price volatility aspect significantly. Why Solana Stablecoin Payments? Solana has gained prominence for its high transaction throughput and low transaction costs compared to some other blockchains. These characteristics make it particularly attractive for payment applications.

Excerpts from court documents in the SEC, Binance case. Source: Eleanor Terrett Terrett shared the news via her X page, attaching an image from the legal filing, which identified the SEC as the plaintiff and Binance Holdings Limited, BAM Trading Services Inc., BAM Management US Holdings Inc., and Changpeng Zhao as the defendants. SEC, Binance credit Crypto Task Force for resolution The SEC initiated this civil enforcement action against Binance on June 5, 2023, and it filed an amended complaint on October 16, 2024 (Docket No. 282). The joint stipulation seeks to allow both parties to dismiss the ongoing lawsuit. “Whereas, in light of the foregoing, and in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter, the Commission believes the dismissal of this Litigation is appropriate,” the May 29 filing in the District Court for the District of Columbia read. Both parties hinted at the possibility of a dismissal in February when the SEC and Binance asked the judge to stay the case. Then again, in April, when the same request was filed. The parties mentioned how the establishment of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force “might impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this litigation,” in the court documents. The SEC’s Acting Chairman, Mark T. Uyeda introduced the task force on January 21, 2025, to present a regulatory framework for crypto assets in the lead up to providing regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency space. Paul Atkins’ SEC sets a precedent The SEC’s willingness to dismiss Binance’s lawsuit follows a trend that has seen the agency end its litigation against other crypto companies like Coinbase, Consensus and Kraken, which were settled earlier this year. It has also ended investigations into Circle, Immutable and several others. Sentiments on X are bullish about the SEC and Binance finally burying the hatchet, but a number of users in the reply section of Eleanor Terrett’s X post have drawn comparisons to the protracted settlement of the SEC’s case against Ripple Labs . The Ripple case is a similar high-profile case. It began in December 2020 and has seen multiple developments, including a final judgment on August 7, 2024, imposing a $125 million civil penalty on Ripple. Still, the SEC appears committed to ending aggressive enforcement actions initiated against crypto firms during Gary Gensler’s tenure with the financial watchdog.

A recent development, specifically a US Court Ruling in Washington, D.C., referencing a prior Trade Court Ruling , might seem distant from crypto at first glance, but it underscores principles of law, government action, and judicial oversight that are profoundly relevant to the Regulatory Environment crypto navigates. Let’s dive into why this seemingly unrelated court reference holds importance for anyone tracking the future of digital assets and regulated markets. Understanding the US Court Ruling and its Context According to reports, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., made a notable reference to an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade. While specific details regarding the case before the Washington D.C. court remain largely undisclosed at this time, the reference points back to a significant legal challenge concerning Government Policy – specifically, the halting of a reciprocal tariff policy enacted by the previous administration. This reference is more than just a procedural note; it signifies how legal precedents set in one area of law can be considered and applied in others. The original Trade Court Ruling was a landmark decision that challenged the executive branch’s authority in implementing certain trade measures, asserting the judiciary’s role in reviewing such actions. The fact that a different U.S. District Court is now referencing this decision suggests its principles are being considered relevant in other legal contexts, potentially broadening its impact beyond international trade disputes. What Was the Original Trade Court Ruling About? To grasp the significance of the Washington D.C. court’s reference, we need to understand the original Trade Court Ruling . This decision stemmed from challenges against a specific tariff policy. Here are some key aspects, based on public reporting about the original case: The Policy: The case involved tariffs imposed under specific statutory authority, often related to national security or trade imbalances. The Challenge: Plaintiffs, typically importers or affected businesses, argued that the implementation of these tariffs exceeded the executive branch’s delegated authority or failed to follow proper legal procedures. The Ruling: The U.S. Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs, at least in part, ruling that the administration had overstepped its bounds or improperly applied the law in imposing the tariffs. This ruling effectively halted the implementation of the specific reciprocal tariff policy in question. The Principle: At its core, the ruling was an assertion of Judicial Review – the power of courts to review the constitutionality or legality of actions taken by the legislative and executive branches of government. This original ruling was a significant check on executive power in the realm of trade, demonstrating that even policies enacted under broad statutory language are subject to legal challenge and judicial oversight. Why Does This US Court Ruling Matter for the Regulatory Environment? Now, let’s connect these dots back to the Regulatory Environment , which is of paramount concern to the cryptocurrency community. The crypto space is currently grappling with significant uncertainty regarding how existing laws apply to digital assets and whether new regulations are needed. Various government agencies – from the SEC and CFTC to the Treasury and Congress – are actively discussing or pursuing different approaches to oversight. This US Court Ruling , by referencing a significant Trade Court Ruling on Government Policy , highlights several crucial points relevant to crypto: Judicial Review is a Check on Power: The principle of Judicial Review means that government agencies, including those regulating or seeking to regulate crypto, are not beyond the reach of the law. Their interpretations of statutes, the procedures they follow, and the scope of the rules they propose can all be challenged in court. Precedent Matters: Court decisions, especially those from federal courts, create precedents. While a ruling on trade tariffs isn’t directly about Bitcoin, the legal reasoning employed by the court regarding the limits of executive authority, the interpretation of statutes, or the requirements for administrative action can be cited in future cases involving other government policies, including those targeting digital assets. Clarity Through Litigation: Sometimes, the precise boundaries of Government Policy and regulatory authority are only truly defined through legal challenges. This is a path the crypto industry is already navigating, with ongoing lawsuits against regulatory bodies seeking clarity on whether certain tokens are securities, the scope of exchange oversight, and other critical issues. Impact on Market Certainty: Legal challenges and the potential for judicial intervention can introduce uncertainty, but they can also, over time, lead to greater clarity regarding the rules of the road. A clear Regulatory Environment is something the crypto market desperately needs to foster innovation and attract mainstream adoption. Rulings like the referenced Trade Court Ruling , even in a different sector, contribute to the overall body of law that defines how government interacts with industry. Think of it this way: If a court rules that a government agency overstepped its authority in imposing tariffs based on a certain interpretation of a law, that ruling’s reasoning might be relevant if another agency is accused of overstepping its authority in regulating crypto based on a similar broad interpretation of a different law. Navigating the Complexities: Challenges and Perspectives The interplay between Government Policy , the Regulatory Environment , and Judicial Review is complex. There are differing perspectives on the appropriate role of each branch of government: Advocates for Strong Executive/Agency Power: Argue that agencies have the necessary expertise and are best positioned to respond quickly to rapidly evolving areas like technology and finance. They may view extensive judicial intervention as hindering effective governance. Advocates for Judicial Oversight: Emphasize the importance of checks and balances. They believe courts play a crucial role in ensuring that government actions stay within the bounds set by statutes and the Constitution, protecting individuals and industries from arbitrary or unlawful power. Industry Perspective (including Crypto): Often seeks clear, predictable rules. While some in crypto may chafe under regulation, many recognize that a lack of clarity is detrimental. They watch court cases closely, hoping for decisions that provide certainty and fairness, ensuring that regulations are applied correctly and don’t stifle innovation unnecessarily. The Washington D.C. court’s reference to the Trade Court Ruling is a small piece of this larger puzzle, illustrating how judicial challenges to Government Policy are an ongoing feature of the U.S. legal system and contribute to shaping the overall Regulatory Environment . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Given the indirect but relevant implications of this US Court Ruling and the underlying Trade Court Ruling , what should those interested in crypto take away? 1. Pay Attention to Legal Precedents Beyond Crypto: Don’t limit your focus only to court cases explicitly involving Bitcoin or blockchain. Rulings in areas like administrative law, securities law (even outside of crypto), and challenges to government agency actions (like the tariff case) can set precedents or offer insights into legal arguments that may eventually be applied to digital assets. 2. Understand the Principle of Judicial Review: Recognize that legal challenges are a legitimate and important part of shaping the Regulatory Environment . Support for organizations or efforts that advocate for clear, fair regulation and are willing to pursue legal avenues when necessary can be impactful. 3. Stay Informed on Government Policy Trends: The tariff case is an example of how broad Government Policy can be subject to legal challenge. Keep an eye on proposed legislation and regulatory rules related to crypto, understanding that these too can be challenged in court. 4. Advocate for Clarity: Engage with policymakers and regulators where possible, stressing the need for a clear and consistent Regulatory Environment for digital assets. Highlight how legal uncertainty hinders legitimate activity while potentially pushing bad actors underground. 5. Recognize the Long Game: Establishing a stable and predictable Regulatory Environment for crypto will likely be a multi-year process involving legislative efforts, regulatory rulemaking, and significant court battles. Developments like this US Court Ruling are reminders that the legal system moves deliberately, but its decisions have lasting effects. Conclusion: Why Legal Watchfulness is Key While a US Court Ruling referencing a Trade Court Ruling on tariffs might not generate the same buzz as a Bitcoin price surge or a major exchange listing, it’s a critical reminder of the foundational legal principles that govern government action and shape the Regulatory Environment . The principle of Judicial Review , the power of legal precedent, and the constant negotiation between Government Policy and judicial oversight are all highly relevant to the ongoing development and regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Staying informed about legal developments, even those outside the immediate crypto bubble, provides valuable context and helps anticipate potential challenges and pathways towards regulatory clarity. The reference by the Washington D.C. court serves as a small but significant signal that the legal principles tested in cases like the original Trade Court Ruling continue to resonate throughout the U.S. judicial system, influencing the legal landscape that industries like crypto must navigate.

Training and running cutting-edge AI models typically requires massive clusters of high-end GPUs, making advanced AI development and deployment expensive and resource-intensive. However, a significant development from DeepSeek is changing this narrative, particularly for those interested in accessible and **Efficient AI Models**. While their larger R1 model garnered attention, a smaller, ‘distilled’ version, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, is proving that powerful AI doesn’t always need a data center. What is DeepSeek’s New Single GPU AI Model? DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is a compact iteration of DeepSeek’s latest R1 reasoning AI model. It’s specifically designed to be significantly more efficient than its larger sibling, making it capable of running on much less hardware – potentially even a **Single GPU AI Model** setup. This is a crucial point, as it drastically lowers the barrier to entry for developers, researchers, and even smaller companies looking to experiment with or deploy advanced reasoning capabilities. The model is built upon the foundation of Alibaba’s Qwen3-8B model, released in May. DeepSeek then applied a technique known as ‘distillation.’ In essence, they used the output and capabilities of the larger, more powerful **DeepSeek R1 AI** model to train and fine-tune the smaller Qwen3-8B base model. This process allows the smaller model to inherit some of the reasoning and performance characteristics of the larger model, but in a much more compact and efficient package. How Does This Distilled AI Model Perform on Benchmarks? One of the most exciting aspects of the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is its performance relative to its size.

US Democratic lawmakers are raising significant concerns and demanding transparency regarding who is involved with this particular digital asset, specifically targeting attendees of a recent dinner hosted by Donald Trump for memecoin holders. What are Democratic Lawmakers Demanding? According to a report by The Guardian, lawmakers from the Democratic Party are calling on the project team behind the TRUMP memecoin to reveal the list of individuals who attended a private dinner event held by Donald Trump. This demand stems from worries about potential foreign influence and the opaque nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Congressman Jamie Raskin is a key figure driving this demand. He has voiced concerns that foreign governments or entities could be using purchases of the memecoin as a way to secretly funnel money to the former U.S. president, bypassing traditional campaign finance regulations. Why the Concern Over Political Donations Crypto ? The core issue highlighted by lawmakers is the potential for cryptocurrencies, particularly memecoins which can be volatile and tied to specific personalities, to be used for political financing without public scrutiny. Traditional political donations have disclosure requirements aimed at preventing illegal foreign contributions and ensuring transparency. The concern is that large purchases of a memecoin like TRUMP, especially by foreign nationals or entities, could serve as an indirect form of political support or donation that falls outside the current regulatory framework, potentially influencing U.S. politics. The Justin Sun Connection: A Case Study Congressman Raskin specifically pointed to Tron (TRX) founder, Justin Sun, as an example fueling these concerns. Sun reportedly purchased $20 million worth of TRUMP tokens. Furthermore, Sun has also invested a substantial $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another cryptocurrency project linked to the Trump family. Sun’s involvement is particularly noteworthy given his legal history in the U.S. He was indicted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on charges of fraud last year. Although the case was stayed in February of this year, his significant investments connected to Trump-related crypto projects raise questions for lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest or influence. Navigating Memecoin Disclosure and Transparency Challenges Demanding disclosure for attendees of a private dinner linked to a memecoin project presents unique challenges. While the intention is transparency in political finance, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the lack of clear regulatory guidelines around memecoins complicate such demands. The project team’s legal obligation or ability to disclose attendee lists, especially if attendees are merely token holders and not direct political donors through traditional channels, is unclear. Key challenges include: Identifying attendees who might have purchased tokens for speculative reasons versus political influence. Distinguishing between genuine retail investors and large-scale purchasers potentially linked to foreign entities. The lack of a clear legal framework classifying memecoin purchases as political donations requiring disclosure. Balancing demands for transparency with individual privacy concerns in the crypto space. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community This situation underscores the increasing intersection of cryptocurrency and politics. For crypto holders and enthusiasts, it’s important to: Stay informed about regulatory discussions surrounding crypto and political finance. Understand the potential scrutiny that projects linked to political figures may face. Recognize that the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins, is still evolving. The demand for memecoin disclosure highlights the ongoing debate about how to apply existing financial transparency rules to the novel world of digital assets. Conclusion The demand by Democratic lawmakers for the disclosure of attendees at a Trump memecoin dinner signals a growing intent in Washington to understand and potentially regulate the flow of value between political figures and the cryptocurrency market. Fueled by examples like the significant investments made by figures such as Justin Sun , these concerns about potential foreign influence and lack of transparency in political donations crypto are unlikely to subside soon. This development adds another layer of complexity to the relationship between digital assets and the political arena, emphasizing the need for clarity and potentially new regulations in the future.

Leaving large sums of money idle means missing out on potential growth and facing the erosive power of inflation. This is especially relevant in today’s dynamic financial landscape, where traditional savings yield little and alternative assets like cryptocurrencies offer different opportunities. So, what exactly should you do when you have excess cash beyond your immediate needs? Why Having Excess Cash Can Be a Problem While having cash provides liquidity and security, keeping too much of it sitting idle comes with downsides: Inflation Risk: The purchasing power of cash decreases over time due to inflation. Your dollars buy less in the future than they do today. Opportunity Cost: That cash could be working for you, generating returns through various investments. Security Concerns: Holding large physical amounts of cash can be risky due to theft or loss. Low Yield: Traditional savings accounts or money market funds often offer minimal interest rates, barely keeping pace with, or falling behind, inflation. Understanding these points is the first step in deciding what to do with dollars that aren’t needed for daily expenses or short-term goals. First Steps: Assess Your Financial Situation and Goals Before you start investing cash or making any major decisions, take a step back and evaluate your overall financial picture. This crucial assessment will guide your choices. Build an Emergency Fund: Ensure you have 3-6 months (or more) of living expenses readily accessible in a savings account for unexpected events like job loss or medical emergencies. This cash is not excess; it’s essential security. Identify Short-Term Goals: Are you saving for a down payment on a house, a car, or a vacation within the next 1-3 years? Cash or highly liquid, low-risk options are suitable for these goals. Define Long-Term Goals: What about retirement, your children’s education, or building long-term wealth? This is where strategies for managing cash for growth become important. Evaluate Debt: High-interest debt (like credit cards) often has an interest rate higher than potential investment returns. Paying down such debt can be a very effective use of cash. Once you have a clear picture of your needs and goals, you can explore options for your true too many US dollars . Traditional Avenues for Investing Cash For those looking for established ways to grow their money, traditional markets offer several options. Stocks and Bonds Investing in the stock market means buying ownership in companies. This offers potential for significant growth over the long term, but also comes with volatility and risk. Bonds represent lending money to governments or corporations in exchange for interest payments and the return of principal. Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks but offer lower potential returns. Benefits: Potential for capital appreciation (stocks), regular income (bonds), diversification, liquidity (for publicly traded assets). Challenges: Market volatility, potential loss of principal, requires research or professional advice, taxes on gains and income. Actionable Insight: Consider diversified index funds or ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) for broad market exposure with lower risk than individual stocks. For bonds, consider bond funds that match your risk tolerance and time horizon. Real Estate Investing in physical property (rental properties, REITs) can provide rental income and potential appreciation. It’s a less liquid investment than stocks or bonds. Benefits: Potential for passive income, appreciation, hedge against inflation (sometimes), tax advantages. Challenges: High upfront cost, ongoing expenses (maintenance, taxes, insurance), illiquidity, requires management (for physical property), market downturns. Actionable Insight: For smaller amounts of excess cash , consider investing in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which trade like stocks and own income-producing real estate. High-Yield Savings Accounts & CDs While not strictly investing for growth, these options offer slightly better returns than standard savings accounts and are very low risk and liquid (savings) or offer fixed returns for a set period (CDs). Benefits: Safety of principal (usually FDIC insured), predictable income (CDs), high liquidity (savings). Challenges: Returns may not keep pace with inflation, lower returns compared to riskier assets. Actionable Insight: Use these for funds you might need in the short to medium term (1-5 years) where capital preservation is key. Exploring Alternatives: What to Do with Dollars in New Markets Beyond traditional finance, alternative investments offer different risk/reward profiles. This is where many people with too many US dollars are starting to look. Cryptocurrency Investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum involves buying digital assets that operate on decentralized networks. The crypto market is known for its high volatility but also its potential for significant returns. Benefits: High potential for returns, decentralization, innovation, diversification away from traditional assets. Challenges: Extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainty, security risks (hacking, scams), complexity, requires significant research. Actionable Insight: Approach crypto with caution. Start with a small percentage of your excess cash that you can afford to lose. Focus on understanding the technology and the specific assets you’re interested in. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility risk. Gold and Precious Metals Often seen as a store of value, gold and other precious metals can be held physically or via funds (ETFs). They are sometimes considered a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Benefits: Store of value, hedge against inflation/economic instability, tangible asset. Challenges: Does not generate income (unless through funds), storage costs (physical), price volatility, performance can lag other assets during growth periods. Actionable Insight: Consider adding a small allocation (e.g., 5-10%) to your portfolio for diversification and potential hedging benefits. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Lending money directly to individuals or businesses through online platforms can offer higher interest rates than traditional savings. Benefits: Higher potential returns than savings, diversification. Challenges: Credit risk (borrower default), platform risk, illiquidity, requires careful vetting of loans. Actionable Insight: Diversify across many loans to mitigate default risk. Understand the platform’s risk assessment process. Strategic Uses for Managing Cash Beyond Investing Not all too many US dollars need to be invested for financial returns. Sometimes, the best return is on your own financial well-being. Paying Down Debt As mentioned earlier, paying off high-interest debt provides a guaranteed return equivalent to the interest rate you were paying. This is often a financially sound move before aggressive investing. Benefits: Guaranteed return (saving on interest), reduces financial stress, improves credit score. Challenges: Cash is no longer available for other uses, may not feel as exciting as investing. Actionable Insight: Prioritize paying off debt with interest rates higher than what you reasonably expect to earn from investments (e.g., credit cards, some personal loans). Funding Education or Skills Development Investing in yourself or your family’s education can yield significant long-term returns in earning potential. Benefits: Increased earning capacity, personal growth, non-taxable use of funds (in some cases). Challenges: Can be expensive, no guaranteed financial return, requires time commitment. Actionable Insight: Use excess cash to pay for courses, certifications, or degrees that can enhance career prospects. Home Improvement Using cash to improve your home can increase its value and your quality of life. It’s a different kind of investment. Benefits: Increased property value, improved living environment, can be more cost-effective than financing. Challenges: No direct financial return until sale, requires managing contractors, potential for cost overruns. Actionable Insight: Focus on improvements that add significant value or address necessary repairs rather than purely cosmetic changes if maximizing financial return is a goal. Strategic Spending or Enjoyment Sometimes, having too many US dollars means you can afford to spend some on experiences, travel, or items that genuinely improve your life or bring you joy. This isn’t about frivolous spending but intentional use of funds beyond necessities and investments. Benefits: Improved quality of life, creating memories, immediate gratification. Challenges: Reduces funds available for investment or debt repayment, doesn’t provide financial return. Actionable Insight: Allocate a specific portion of your excess cash for spending after ensuring your financial bases (emergency fund, debt, basic investments) are covered. Getting Professional Help for Managing Cash Navigating these options can be complex. If you have substantial too many US dollars , consulting a fee-only financial advisor can be beneficial. They can help you create a personalized plan based on your specific situation, risk tolerance, and goals. Conclusion: Make Your Dollars Work for You Having too many US dollars in cash is a signal to take action. Leaving it idle is a missed opportunity. By assessing your financial health, understanding your goals, and exploring the various avenues available – from traditional investments like stocks and real estate to alternatives like cryptocurrency, and even strategic uses like debt repayment or self-improvement – you can make informed decisions about what to do with dollars . The key is to create a plan that aligns with your objectives and risk comfort level, ensuring your excess cash is not just sitting there, but actively working towards building your financial future. Don’t let inflation erode your wealth; take control and put those dollars to work.

The cryptocurrency has recently been in a short-term pullback, moving slightly lower after previous gains. This type of movement is common in crypto markets, especially since XRP often mirrors Bitcoin’s price action. Current Price Movement At the moment, XRP has dropped below a key support level between $2.30 and $2.34. This breakdown means the price could fall further towards the next major support zone around $2.10 to $2.15. If selling pressure increases, XRP might test even lower areas — but holding above these support levels would be a positive sign for the bulls. XRP has important support between $2.10 and $2.15. A drop below this could push the price down to $1.79, which is a very important level to hold. If it falls under $1.79, bigger losses could follow. On the other hand, XRP faces resistance between $2.30 and $2.34. If the price moves above this, the next hurdles are at $2.44, and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Possible Bullish Pattern Forming There’s a chance that XRP might be forming a classic chart pattern called an “inverse head and shoulders.” This is a bullish (positive) sign that often hints at a price rise. But right now, this pattern isn’t confirmed yet. For this pattern to become official, XRP’s price would need to bounce from its current levels, move up towards the $2.62 mark, and break through it. If that happens in the next couple of weeks, it could spark a strong upward move — maybe even towards new all-time highs. What Could Happen Next? In the short term (next few days to a week), experts expect XRP’s price to continue cooling off while Bitcoin remains quiet. The key is whether XRP can hold above $2.10 or especially $1.79, as dropping below these levels might bring more selling pressure. If bulls (buyers) step in soon, it might see a bounce back before XRP hits those lower levels. On the flip side, if sellers stay in control, the price could dip a little more before finding strong support.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-30 01:42:14

Among the most talked-about recent phenomena are meme coins – cryptocurrencies often born from internet jokes, cultural trends, or community enthusiasm, rather than traditional business models or clear utility. Their explosive growth and unique characteristics have presented a significant challenge for existing financial regulations worldwide. This challenge was front and center at the recent Bitcoin 2025 Conference , where U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce offered some intriguing insights and a potential path forward for navigating the complex landscape of SEC Meme Coin Regulation . Hester Peirce Crypto Insights: A Call for Clarity Known affectionately in the crypto community as “Crypto Mom” for her often more accommodating stance towards digital assets compared to some of her peers, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has consistently advocated for clearer regulatory frameworks that foster innovation rather than stifle it. Her comments at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference underscored this perspective, specifically addressing the unique nature of meme coins. Peirce noted that meme coins, in many ways, resemble collectibles. Think of digital baseball cards, unique digital art pieces, or other items whose value is primarily driven by cultural significance, community sentiment, and scarcity rather than an underlying business venture or expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others (a key component of the Howey Test used to define a security in the U.S.). Her crucial point was that these assets, due to their nature, currently appear to fall outside the conventional protections offered by securities laws. This creates a significant gap, leaving investors potentially exposed without the disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions typically applied to securities. Why a Crypto Regulatory Committee for Meme Coins? The core of Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion is the establishment of a dedicated Crypto Regulatory Committee specifically focused on meme coins. But why is such a specialized body needed? Here are some reasons: Unique Characteristics: Meme coins often lack whitepapers, clear roadmaps, or identifiable development teams in the traditional sense. Their value is heavily reliant on community hype and social media trends. Investor Protection: Without securities law protections, investors are more vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes, market manipulation, and misleading promotions. Regulatory Ambiguity: Applying existing securities frameworks, designed for traditional stocks and bonds, to assets like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu is challenging and can lead to uncertainty. Rapid Evolution: The meme coin space moves incredibly fast, with new tokens emerging daily. Regulators need a focused approach to keep pace. Global Nature: Meme coins trade on global platforms, requiring a coordinated or at least well-considered domestic approach that considers international implications. A dedicated committee could bring together experts to study these unique assets, understand their market dynamics, and propose tailored regulatory approaches that don’t necessarily fit the mold of traditional securities regulation. Navigating the Challenges of Meme Coin Regulation Regulating meme coins is no simple task. The proposed Meme Coin Regulation committee would face numerous hurdles: Defining ‘Meme Coin’: How do you legally define a meme coin versus other cryptocurrencies or digital assets? The line can be blurry. Decentralization: Many meme coins claim a degree of decentralization, making it hard to identify responsible parties for regulatory compliance. Valuation Challenges: Traditional valuation metrics don’t apply. Value is highly speculative and sentiment-driven. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Overly strict regulation could stifle the organic, community-driven innovation that characterizes this space, while insufficient rules leave investors exposed. Jurisdictional Issues: Trading is global, while regulation is typically national. The committee would need to grapple with these fundamental questions to develop effective and fair rules. Potential Structure and Focus of a Meme Coin Regulatory Committee While Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion was high-level, one can envision the potential structure and focus areas for such a committee. It might include representatives from: The SEC Other relevant financial regulatory bodies (CFTC, FinCEN) Academic experts in digital assets and economics Potentially, representatives from the crypto industry (though this could be controversial) Their work could involve: Area of Focus Potential Activities Classification Developing criteria to distinguish meme coins from securities or other asset classes. Disclosure Exploring alternative disclosure requirements suitable for assets without traditional financials. Market Integrity Studying mechanisms to detect and prevent manipulation specific to meme coin markets. Investor Education Developing resources to help potential investors understand the unique risks of meme coins. Enforcement Identifying clear triggers and methods for enforcement actions against fraudulent activities. The goal would be to create a framework that provides necessary investor protections without trying to fit a square peg into the round hole of existing securities law designed for different types of assets. The Broader Context: Crypto Regulation in the US Commissioner Peirce’s proposal comes at a time when the U.S. is actively debating the future of crypto regulation. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has largely pursued an enforcement-first approach, classifying many cryptocurrencies as securities and taking action against platforms and projects they deem non-compliant. This approach has drawn criticism from many in the industry, including Commissioner Peirce, who argue it lacks clarity and hinders innovation. The suggestion for a specific committee for meme coins highlights the difficulty in applying a one-size-fits-all approach to the diverse crypto ecosystem. It acknowledges that assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, utility tokens, stablecoins, and meme coins may require different regulatory considerations. The discussions at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference , a major gathering for the crypto community, provide a crucial platform for these ideas to be debated and potentially influence future policy directions. Peirce’s willingness to engage with the community and propose specific solutions like a Crypto Regulatory Committee is seen by many as a positive step towards finding pragmatic regulatory solutions. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Market? For investors, the prospect of clearer Meme Coin Regulation could bring both pros and cons. On the one hand, increased regulatory clarity and potential protections against fraud could boost confidence and potentially attract a wider range of participants to the market. On the other hand, any form of regulation could be seen by some as interfering with the free-wheeling, speculative nature that attracts many to meme coins in the first place. For the market as a whole, a dedicated committee could signal a more nuanced and thoughtful approach from regulators towards specific crypto asset classes. It could potentially pave the way for tailored rules that acknowledge the unique characteristics of meme coins rather than forcing them into unsuitable existing categories. Looking Ahead: The Future of Meme Coin Regulation Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion is just that – a suggestion. Whether a dedicated Crypto Regulatory Committee for meme coins is ultimately established remains to be seen. However, her comments at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference serve as a vital acknowledgment from within the SEC that meme coins present a unique regulatory challenge that needs a specific, thoughtful approach. Addressing the regulatory gap is essential for fostering a mature and safe digital asset market. Whether through a dedicated committee or other means, clearer guidance on how assets like meme coins are viewed and regulated in the U.S. is crucial for investors, developers, and the industry’s future growth. The conversation has been started, and the path towards effective SEC Meme Coin Regulation is likely to be a long and complex one. Summary At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce highlighted that meme coins resemble collectibles and currently lack securities law protections. She proposed creating a dedicated Meme Coin Regulatory Committee to address this gap, acknowledging the unique challenges these assets pose. This suggestion signals a potential shift towards more tailored regulatory approaches for specific crypto categories, aiming to enhance investor protection and market clarity while navigating the complexities of these community-driven, often speculative assets. The path to effective meme coin regulation is challenging but necessary for the evolving digital asset landscape.

The Texas-based company now expects about $9.40 per share for the fiscal year ending January 2026. That’s higher than its earlier estimate and more than what analysts predicted. Dell is making a stunning bet on the future of computing, throwing a mountain of cash at the future of artificial intelligence and big tech collaborations. And that sharp reversal is driving, in part, a surging AI market. In the past quarter alone, the tech firm posted $12.1 billion in orders for AI servers. That is more than it shipped in all of the previous fiscal year. According to Dell COO Jeff Clarke, the demand isn’t showing much sign of slowing. The company is sitting on a $14.4 billion AI backlog, indicating more revenue will come to fruition in subsequent quarters. Clarke described it as an “unprecedented demand” from customers building large and complex AI systems. He added that some delays in delivering systems are simply waiting for new data centers, power, and cooling to go online. Sales grow as Dell taps into AI gold rush For the three months ended May 2, Dell reported $23.4 billion in revenue, a 5% increase from the comparable period a year earlier. That was more than the $23.1 billion average estimate of Wall Street analysts. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to $1.55 per share, which fell short of the $1.69 per share analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Researc h ex pected. The company said it was pleased with its performance and bullish that future quarters would be even better. Dell’s earnings per share and revenue for the current quarter, $2.25 and $29 billion, surpass average market estimates. The increase in AI server orders has been driven by leading customers such as Elon Musk’s xAI and CoreWeave, who use Dell’s high-end servers in growing data centers. The tech firm has been buying back many shares as part of a share repurchase program to add to shareholder value. This reduces the number of shares in circulation, effectively increasing earnings per share. Dell builds flagship supercomputer with Nvidia In a separate huge victory, Dell has partnered with the chipmaker Nvidia to construct a next-generation supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy. Based at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the system will fulfill the most advanced research requirements, from fusion energy to biomolecular modeling, materials design, and even fundamental physics. This move further cements Dell as a key AI and high-performance computing player. Still, challenges remain. AI server sales, which show much promise, are what Clarke referred to as “lumpy.” Outside AI, the consumer PC market continues to woes. In the three months until the end of June, Dell’s consumer PC revenues dropped 19%. Its operating income in that unit — consumer and business machines — fell 16%. Economic uncertainty and persistent tariffs from the United States also hamper parts of the tech industry. On Thursday, HP Inc., a Dell competitor, had its stock drop 8.3% after reducing its profit forecast because of tariffs and slow demand. Curiously, that same day, a United States court panel concluded that most tariffs during the Trump administration ran afoul of the law, despite which they remain in place while the legal process continues. Dell noted that its updated full-year guidance takes into account everything currently known about these tariffs.

In a heart-felt keynote speech closing out Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Thursday, Ulbricht, addressing the public in-person for the first time since being released from prison in January, shared a story to illustrate his three guiding principles — freedom, decentralization and unity. Ulbricht explained that, in the early days of the Silk Road, he wanted to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms to stock the darknet marketplace with, so he rented a remote cabin. The cabin, he said, was infested with wasps. He set out to deal with the wasps, using a trick his father had taught him that involved trapping the wasps’ nests under a towel. “My heart was pounding,” Ulbricht said. “I selected the nest that was furthest from the others, because I didn’t know if the other nests would come and sting me, spread out the towel, got as close as I could — ready to flee if I had to — but when I wrapped up the nest, nothing happened. It was as if the other wasps didn’t even notice.” Ulbricht said that the wasps were strong because they were free: “It was impossible to keep track of so many individual wasps, a sting could come from any direction. They were strong because they were decentralized, across seven nests."" But, Ulbricht said, the wasps were ultimately weak because they were not unified, and did not react when their fellow wasps were taken down. “Had a single wasp dared to come sting me when I reached for that first nest, I would have fled … but they didn’t. Thank god you are not wasps,” Ulbricht said. Before being pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump in January — the result of a promise Trump made on the campaign trail in 2024 — Ulbricht spent 12 years behind bars. His speech on Thursday marked the 10-year anniversary, to the day, of a New York judge sentencing the then-31-year-old Ulbricht to two life sentences, plus 40 years, for owning and operating the dark net marketplace. During his keynote speech, Ulbricht, who has been free for four months, still seemed buoyant with his newfound freedom. In a video montage ahead of his appearance on stage, clips of Ulbricht experiencing life outside prison — traveling, surfing, spending time with his wife — played on screen, each showing a beaming Ulbricht. “Winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful,” Ulbricht said, crediting the crypto community for advocating for his release. “I’m free, and it’s because of you. You made this moment possible…Thank you, thank you, thank you.” After more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht likened himself to Rip van Winkle, admitting that he was overwhelmed with all the technological advancements since he went to prison. “There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right, and thousands more I'll never have time to learn about. There's DeFi and Web3 and AI to help me navigate it all. It's nuts,” Ulbricht said. “I mean, just a few months ago, when I walked out of prison, I'd never seen a drone … It's all hitting me at once, freedom, the new technology, the fact that I have a future again.” Ulbricht closed by telling the audience about gangs and factions in prison, saying that he quickly came to understand that the prison wardens like inmates to be divided. “The only times I saw the wardens show respect to the prisoners was when we were united,” Ulbricht said. “Those that oppose decentralization and freedom love it when we’re divided, I promise you, so stay united. So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom, and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united…stay true to these principles and the future is ours.”",Policy|Ross Ulbricht|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 01:53:34
45268937,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164250,1748570113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45268937.jpeg,Exclusive: Cantor Fitzgerald Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Fund with Gold Shield,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cantor-fitzgerald-bitcoin-fund/,"BitcoinWorld Exclusive: Cantor Fitzgerald Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Fund with Gold Shield Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management, a major player in global financial services, is making a significant move with the planned launch of its first Bitcoin fund . This isn’t just any fund; it comes with a unique feature designed to appeal to cautious investors: downside protection linked to the price of gold. What Makes This Bitcoin Fund Unique? Cantor Fitzgerald’s approach stands out. While many funds offer direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, this new five-year fund incorporates a protective mechanism. Here are the key features: Gold-Backed Protection: The fund offers 1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold. This means that for every dollar Bitcoin’s price might fall, the fund aims to offset that loss with a corresponding gain (or reduced loss) tied to gold’s performance. It’s important to note this isn’t physically backed by gold held by the fund, but rather uses financial instruments to achieve a correlation-based hedge. Upside Exposure: Investors still get exposure to the potential upside of Bitcoin’s price appreciation. No Cap on Gains: Unlike some structured products, the fund does not cap the potential profits from Bitcoin’s rise. Five-Year Term: It is structured as a five-year investment vehicle. Targeting Institutions: The fund is primarily aimed at institutional investors, reflecting the growing demand from this segment. This structure attempts to address one of the primary concerns investors have about Bitcoin: its volatility. By linking protection to gold, an asset traditionally seen as a safe haven and store of value, Cantor Fitzgerald is positioning this fund as a potentially less volatile way for institutions to gain crypto exposure. Expanding Institutional Access to Institutional Bitcoin Beyond the new fund, Cantor Fitzgerald is also significantly expanding its Bitcoin financing business. The firm reportedly has up to $2 billion available for institutional clients looking for financing solutions related to Bitcoin. This includes services like: Lending against Bitcoin holdings. Providing capital for Bitcoin-related businesses. Offering prime brokerage services for large crypto trades. This expansion signals Cantor Fitzgerald’s increasing commitment to the digital asset space and its belief in the long-term potential of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Providing robust financing options is crucial for institutions, as it allows them to manage liquidity, leverage positions, and execute complex strategies within the crypto market. Why the Interest in Gold-Backed Bitcoin ? The concept of pairing Bitcoin with gold might seem counterintuitive to some crypto enthusiasts who see Bitcoin as ‘digital gold.’ However, for traditional institutional investors, gold represents stability and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty – qualities they are often seeking when diversifying portfolios. The inclusion of gold-backed Bitcoin protection in this fund is a strategic move by Cantor Fitzgerald to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the nascent crypto world. It offers a familiar concept (gold as a hedge) applied to a new, volatile asset (Bitcoin), potentially making it more palatable for risk-averse institutions or those bound by specific investment mandates. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold prices is not always consistent, and the effectiveness of this protection mechanism will depend on various market factors and the specific instruments used by the fund. However, the intent is clear: to mitigate the sharp downside risks associated with direct Bitcoin investment. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment ? Cantor Fitzgerald’s move is another strong indicator of the maturing crypto investment landscape. As more reputable financial institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald enter the space with tailored products and services, it adds legitimacy and infrastructure necessary for broader institutional adoption. The availability of sophisticated financial products, like funds with built-in protection mechanisms and large-scale financing, lowers the barriers to entry for large firms previously hesitant due to volatility, regulatory uncertainty, or lack of infrastructure. This development could pave the way for other institutions to explore similar hybrid or protected crypto investment products. It highlights the demand for solutions that offer exposure to Bitcoin’s growth potential while addressing the inherent risks in ways that align with traditional finance risk management practices. While the fund is initially focused on institutions, the trend of established financial firms creating diverse crypto products ultimately benefits the entire ecosystem by increasing liquidity, improving market efficiency, and potentially leading to more accessible products for retail investors in the future. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Crypto The actions of firms like Cantor Fitzgerald underscore a significant shift. We are moving beyond just buying and holding Bitcoin to building a comprehensive financial ecosystem around it. The availability of $2 billion in financing demonstrates the scale of capital now being directed towards the sector by major financial players. This infrastructure is vital for the next phase of growth, enabling everything from complex trading strategies to funding for innovation within the blockchain space. Challenges remain, including regulatory clarity and operational complexities. However, the commitment shown by firms like Cantor Fitzgerald suggests that institutions are actively working through these challenges to participate in what they see as a significant opportunity. The blend of traditional assets (like the gold link) with digital assets (Bitcoin) in new financial products is likely a trend we will see continue as the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) continue to blur. Cantor Fitzgerald’s new fund and expanded financing are important steps in making crypto more accessible and manageable for large investors, potentially driving further capital into the market and solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a recognized asset class within the global financial system.

Wave 3 Says Double-Digits Is Coming In June,https://bitcoinist.com/sui-price-set-for-10/,"The SUI price is seeing renewed interest as analysts predict that a major price move is underway. According to an Elliott Wave analysis, SUI is entering Wave 3 and could be gearing up for an explosive surge to $10 by June. Wave 3 Breakout To Push SUI Price Above $10 The SUI price action since April 2025 has followed a textbook Elliott Wave pattern, suggesting that the altcoin may be entering a powerful uptrend. A technical analysis shared by Crypto Bullet on X (formerly Twitter) forecasts that SUI may be preparing for a parabolic run to or above $10 by June. The analyst’s chart shows that SUI has completed a five-wave impulse from April’s bottom, which formed a Wave 1 structure. This was followed by a healthy price correction , now labeled as Wave 2, which appears to be either complete or very close to its end. The next leg in SUI’s Elliott Wave structure is Wave 3, historically the strongest wave and often delivering gains in the shortest period. Based on the analysis, the SUI price is presently respecting the wave count . The initial Wave 1 rally saw strong momentum, clear sub-waves, and a defined structure. Despite recent market uncertainty and the aftermath of the Cetus hack , the analyst noted that the correction phase in Wave 2 was expected and necessary to prepare for the next rally . Based on Crypto Bullet’s analysis, SUI’s price action aligns almost perfectly with the classical Elliott Wave Theory . The altcoin is also poised to enter Wave 3 and potentially catapult to bullish targets of $10 and beyond. As of now, SUI is trading at $3.64, but if the wave count plays out as expected, the analyst predicts that the altcoin could soon break resistance levels near $4.70 and $5.20 on its way to a double-digit target. The chart’s technical roadmap also suggests a potential climb toward the $13 – $14 range during Wave 3, with a further push toward $16 – $18 likely as Wave 5 unfolds later in the cycle. SUI Prints Bullish MACD Cross According to a technical chart analysis presented by Funkii.sui, a market analyst on X, the SUI price has just printed a bullish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crossover — a momentum shift that previously led to a rally of over 723.15%. This new crossover suggests that the altcoin may be entering a fresh macro uptrend after months of consolidation and corrective movement . Currently, SUI technical indicators point to a strong setup. On the weekly timeframe, the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, indicating a potential for a long-term trend reversal. The last time this signal flashed, SUI surged from under $0.6 to nearly $5. As a result, Funkii.sui predicts a potential move to $16 or higher, representing a gain of over 593% if the same pattern repeats. The analyst’s chart shows that SUI recently rebounded from a key support zone around the $1.8 – $2.00 range. This bounce, combined with a clean break above the 0.5 Fibonacci level, signals the possible end of SUI’s downtrend and the beginning of a new impulsive wave.",Altcoins|Altcoin|Cetus Hack|Crypto Bullet|Elliot Wave Theory|Funkii.sui|MACD|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|SUI|SUI Price|SUIUSD|SUIUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-30 02:00:08

While the market capitalization of Ethereum (ETH) has seen an uptick, the bank’s findings suggest this hasn’t translated into a meaningful boost in core network usage or significant inflows into potential spot ETH ETF products. What Did JPMorgan’s Analysis Reveal About Ethereum? According to details reported by The Block, the core of JPMorgan ‘s assessment revolves around a perceived disconnect between market valuation and on-chain activity. Here’s a breakdown of their key observations: Market Cap vs. Activity: The report acknowledges an increase in Ethereum ‘s market cap, suggesting positive market sentiment or anticipation. However, it notes a lack of corresponding significant growth in fundamental network activity metrics. CME Futures vs. Spot ETFs: A noticeable increase in long positions within the CME ETH futures market was highlighted. This contrasts sharply with the absence of significant inflows into spot ETH ETF s, which are still awaiting approval or broader availability in many key markets. Individual Investor Interest: The divergence between institutional-leaning futures activity and the lack of spot ETF inflows (often seen as a proxy for broader retail/individual interest) led analysts to conclude that individual investor enthusiasm for Ethereum currently remains subdued. This analysis provides a snapshot of how a major financial institution views the current dynamics within the Ethereum ecosystem, focusing on tangible market and on-chain data rather than just price movements. Understanding Ethereum Network Activity and the Pectra Upgrade When analysts like those at JPMorgan talk about Ethereum Network Activity , they are referring to a range of on-chain metrics that indicate how much the network is actually being used. These can include: Transaction Count: The number of successful transactions processed on the network. Active Addresses: The daily or monthly count of unique wallet addresses sending or receiving ETH or interacting with smart contracts. Gas Usage: The total amount of ‘gas’ (the unit of computation on Ethereum) consumed by transactions, reflecting the complexity and volume of operations like DeFi interactions or NFT transfers. Smart Contract Interactions: The number of times users interact with decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or NFT platforms built on Ethereum. A major network upgrade, such as the Pectra Upgrade (referencing the proposed Prague/Electra combination or potentially a recent one like Dencun, depending on the report’s specific timing and terminology), is typically expected to improve the network’s efficiency, scalability, or functionality. These improvements are often anticipated to lead to increased usage, lower costs, and thus, a boost in Ethereum Network Activity . JPMorgan’s report highlights that, in their view, this expected activity surge hasn’t materialized despite the upgrade’s rollout. The Puzzle: Why Low Spot ETH ETF Inflows Despite Futures Interest? The distinction made by JPMorgan between CME ETH futures and spot ETH ETF s is significant. CME futures are primarily utilized by institutional traders and sophisticated investors for hedging or speculating on price movements without holding the underlying asset. Spot ETH ETF s, on the other hand, would hold actual ETH and are often seen as a more accessible investment vehicle for retail investors and traditional financial advisors, offering exposure to the asset class through regulated brokerage accounts. The observed increase in CME futures activity suggests continued institutional interest in having exposure to Ethereum ‘s price. However, the lack of substantial inflows into available or anticipated spot ETH ETF products points to potential hurdles for broader adoption. These hurdles could include regulatory uncertainty (especially in jurisdictions where spot ETH ETFs are not yet approved), lingering caution among traditional investors regarding direct crypto exposure, or simply a lack of strong conviction among individual investors at the current price levels. This divergence supports JPMorgan ‘s conclusion that while institutional players might be engaging with ETH derivatives, the enthusiasm from the wider individual investor base, often targeted by spot ETFs, appears muted. Implications for the Ethereum Network and Investor Sentiment What does JPMorgan ‘s analysis suggest about the current state of the Ethereum Network Activity and investor sentiment? It implies that: Upgrades Alone May Not Drive Adoption: While technical improvements from the Pectra Upgrade are valuable, they might not be sufficient on their own to immediately translate into significantly increased user activity or attract widespread new investment via easily accessible products like spot ETFs. Retail Adoption Remains a Challenge: The path to bringing millions of new individual users and investors onto the Ethereum Network or into ETH investment vehicles still faces considerable obstacles, whether they are related to complexity, perceived risk, or lack of accessible investment products. Institutional vs. Retail Divergence: There appears to be a notable difference in how institutional and retail investors are currently engaging with Ethereum , with institutions seemingly more comfortable with derivatives like futures than individuals are with potential spot investment products. This perspective from a major financial institution serves as a reminder that despite positive developments like network upgrades and increasing market cap, the growth and adoption of the Ethereum Network are complex processes influenced by technology, market structure, regulation, and investor psychology. Looking Ahead: What to Watch For Given JPMorgan ‘s assessment, what should market participants and Ethereum enthusiasts monitor in the coming months? Key indicators will include: Ethereum Network Activity Metrics: Keep an eye on transaction counts, active addresses, and gas usage. A sustained upward trend in these metrics would contradict the report’s findings and signal organic growth. Spot ETH ETF Developments: Regulatory decisions and the actual performance and inflows of spot ETH ETF s in jurisdictions where they are approved will be crucial gauges of individual investor demand. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall health and direction of the crypto market significantly influence activity and investment in individual assets like Ethereum . Impact of Future Upgrades: While the report focused on the period after the referenced upgrade, the long-term effects of Pectra Upgrade features (or subsequent developments) on network usability and cost could still drive activity over time. While JPMorgan ‘s report offers a cautious view, it provides valuable data points for understanding the current landscape. The lack of immediate widespread individual investor enthusiasm via spot ETFs and network activity doesn’t negate Ethereum’s long-term potential but highlights the challenges in translating technical advancements and institutional interest into broad-based adoption. Summary: JPMorgan’s Sobering Take on Ethereum Post-Upgrade In conclusion, JPMorgan ‘s recent report presents a somewhat sobering perspective on Ethereum ‘s performance following the cited Pectra Upgrade . Despite an increase in market valuation and institutional engagement via futures, the bank found little evidence of a significant surge in fundamental Ethereum Network Activity or strong individual investor demand as reflected in spot ETH ETF inflows. This analysis underscores the ongoing journey for Ethereum to translate its technical prowess and market presence into widespread, tangible usage and broad retail investment.

Here’s what could happen next, according to historical trends. Toncoin Open Interest Has Hit Its Highest Since February In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Toncoin. The “Open Interest” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to TON (in USD) that are currently open on all derivatives platforms. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up more positions related to the asset on the market. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when new positions appear, so this kind of trend can lead to higher volatility for the cryptocurrency’s price.

On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests that investors are closing their own positions voluntarily or being forcibly liquidated by their exchange. Either way, the asset can behave in a more stable manner following such a trend due to the drop in leverage. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Toncoin Open Interest over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Toncoin Open Interest has just seen a very sharp spike, a sign that traders have opened up a large number of futures positions. More specifically, the metric’s value has gone up from $143 million to $190 million over the last 24 hours. From the chart, it’s visible that this quick 33% jump initially came as the coin’s price witnessed a rapid increase, but interestingly, it maintained its upward trajectory even as the asset saw a pullback. “Past spikes like this have often preceded corrections – worth watching closely,” notes Glassnode. The last time the Toncoin Open Interest formed this pattern was at the end of March/start of April. What followed back then was a price drawdown of about 32%. Related Reading: Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns TON isn’t the only digital asset that has seen an uptick in speculation recently. As the analytics firm has pointed out in its latest weekly report, Bitcoin has also been observing a major rise in its Open Interest. As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin Open Interest fell to a low of $36.8 billion in April as the cryptocurrency’s price itself went down. Since then, however, the indicator has shot up by 51% alongside the bull rally, reaching the $55.6 billion mark. The report explains that this suggests “a build up of leverage is underway.” TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.34, up more than 11% in the last 24 hours.

Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, is making waves with its investment strategy. The company’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, recently shared compelling details about how Tether is utilizing its substantial profits, and it involves a major focus on the leading cryptocurrency: Bitcoin . Tether’s Profitable Strategy: Reinvesting in Bitcoin Speaking at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dropped a notable statistic: Tether has generated approximately $20 billion in profits over the past three years. This figure alone underscores the immense scale and success of Tether’s operations within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What’s even more interesting is where these profits are going. According to reports from Odaily covering Ardoino’s comments, a surprisingly small portion—less than 5%—has been allocated to shareholder dividends. This indicates a strong preference for reinvestment back into the business and strategic assets rather than immediate payouts. The vast majority of these profits, the remaining 95%, are being channeled into two primary areas: Expanding Tether’s global distribution network Significant reinvestment in Bitcoin This clear emphasis on acquiring more Bitcoin with company profits signals a bullish stance from one of the most influential entities in the crypto market. It highlights Tether’s confidence not only in its own business model but also in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. Why is Tether Investing Heavily in Bitcoin ? Tether’s decision to allocate a large percentage of its profits towards Bitcoin isn’t entirely new, but the sheer scale revealed by Paolo Ardoino is noteworthy. Tether first publicly disclosed its Bitcoin holdings as part of its reserves in May 2023. At the time, they stated they would regularly allocate up to 15% of their net operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin. This latest announcement suggests that the actual percentage of *total* profits (which would include operating profits, interest income from reserves, etc.) being directed into Bitcoin and growth initiatives is substantially higher than the previously stated 15% of *operating* profits. The $20 billion figure represents the total financial gain over three years. Several factors likely drive this strategy: Diversification: While Tether’s primary reserves back USDT and are largely held in safe, liquid assets like U.S. Treasury bills, allocating a portion of profits to Bitcoin adds a growth-oriented asset to their balance sheet. Potential Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically been a high-performing asset. Investing profits into BTC allows Tether to potentially grow its non-reserve holdings significantly if Bitcoin’s value increases. Alignment with the Crypto Ecosystem: As a cornerstone of the crypto market, holding Bitcoin aligns Tether with the broader digital asset landscape and demonstrates confidence in the technology it serves. Strategic Positioning: Large Bitcoin holdings can enhance Tether’s financial strength and strategic flexibility, separate from the assets specifically backing USDT redemptions. This approach allows Tether to benefit from Bitcoin’s potential upside while maintaining the stability and liquidity required to back the circulating supply of its stablecoin, USDT . Understanding Tether’s Profitability How does Tether generate such massive profits? The primary source of income for Tether comes from the interest earned on the reserves it holds to back the value of USDT . As the circulating supply of USDT has exploded, reaching tens of billions, the reserves have grown proportionally. A significant portion of these reserves is held in interest-bearing instruments, particularly short-term U.S. Treasury bills. With rising interest rates globally over the past few years, the income generated from these reserves has become substantial. This interest income forms a large part of the profits that Paolo Ardoino referenced. Additional revenue streams can include fees from minting/redeeming USDT, although interest income is typically the dominant factor. Here’s a simplified look at the profit allocation based on Ardoino’s statement: Profit Allocation (Past 3 Years) Approximate Amount (Based on $20B Total Profit) Percentage of Total Profit Shareholder Dividends Less than $1 billion Less than 5% Reinvestment (Global Distribution & Bitcoin ) More than $19 billion More than 95% This table clearly illustrates the strong bias towards reinvestment over immediate shareholder returns, a strategy that aligns with long-term growth objectives, including significant Crypto Investment . What Does This Mean for the Market and USDT Holders? Tether’s massive reinvestment strategy has several implications for the broader crypto market and for users of USDT : Potential Bitcoin Price Impact: Consistent, large-scale buying by an entity like Tether adds significant buying pressure to the Bitcoin market. While it’s difficult to isolate Tether’s exact impact, their accumulation is undoubtedly a bullish factor. Signal of Confidence: Tether’s willingness to hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet sends a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and its role as a store of value. Tether’s Financial Strength: By reinvesting profits into potentially appreciating assets like Bitcoin, Tether can further strengthen its overall financial position, separate from the specific assets backing USDT . This could be seen as a positive for the long-term stability of the company, though it doesn’t directly impact the 1:1 peg of USDT, which is backed by specific reserve assets. Increased Scrutiny: Large holdings of volatile assets like Bitcoin, even if held separately from core reserves, may attract increased scrutiny from regulators, who are already focused on stablecoin reserves and operations. For holders of USDT , it’s crucial to remember that the assets backing the stablecoin’s peg are kept separate from Tether’s corporate profits and investments. The value of USDT remains tied to the stability and liquidity of its stated reserves, which are primarily in cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and U.S. Treasury bills. The Bitcoin acquired with profits is part of Tether’s corporate treasury, not the direct backing for every USDT token. Challenges and Considerations While Tether’s aggressive Crypto Investment strategy, particularly into Bitcoin, highlights strong profitability and a bullish outlook, it’s not without potential challenges or points of consideration: Market Volatility: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin exposes Tether’s corporate treasury to the inherent volatility of the crypto market. While this doesn’t directly impact the USDT peg (as BTC is not a primary reserve asset for the peg), significant downturns could affect Tether’s overall financial statements and profitability in future periods. Transparency: While Tether has improved its reporting over the years, the exact timing and scale of their Bitcoin purchases from profits are not always immediately clear, which can lead to speculation. More detailed breakdowns of profit utilization could enhance transparency. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins and crypto companies is constantly evolving. Tether’s significant market position and investment strategies are likely to remain under the microscope of regulators worldwide. Despite these points, the announcement from Paolo Ardoino underscores Tether’s position as a major financial force within the crypto space, capable of generating substantial profits and making significant strategic investments like buying billions in Bitcoin . Actionable Insights from Tether’s Crypto Investment What can investors take away from this news? Watch the Whales: Large entities like Tether making significant, consistent purchases of an asset like Bitcoin is often seen as a bullish indicator. Paying attention to the actions of major holders can provide insights into market sentiment and potential demand. Profitability in Crypto Infrastructure: Tether’s $20 billion profit figure over three years demonstrates the immense financial success achievable by companies providing essential infrastructure within the crypto market, like stablecoins. Diversification as a Strategy: Tether’s approach of diversifying a portion of its *profits* (separate from reserve assets) into growth assets like Bitcoin is a strategy employed by many corporations. While the specific assets differ, the principle of using excess capital for potential long-term growth is common. The Enduring Appeal of Bitcoin: Tether, an entity deeply embedded in the plumbing of crypto finance, continues to see Bitcoin as a valuable asset for its own balance sheet, reinforcing its perceived status as digital gold or a long-term store of value. This move solidifies Tether’s position not just as a stablecoin issuer but also as a significant corporate holder and accumulator of Bitcoin , actively using its financial success to strengthen its position and bet on the future of the leading cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Tether’s Big Bet on Bitcoin’s Future The revelation from Paolo Ardoino at Bitcoin 2025 that the bulk of Tether’s impressive $20 billion profits over the last three years is being plowed back into global expansion and, critically, into Bitcoin , is a major development. It signifies a deliberate and large-scale strategy by the world’s largest stablecoin issuer to deepen its holdings in the premier cryptocurrency. With only a small fraction going to dividends, the overwhelming focus is on growth and strategic asset accumulation. This substantial Crypto Investment by a key market player like Tether serves as a powerful signal, potentially influencing market sentiment and adding considerable buying pressure to Bitcoin. It underscores Tether’s robust profitability and its long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value, positioning them as a significant corporate whale in the BTC ocean.

It means that a lot of people that look at Bitcoin are going to be afraid of it. They'll never touch it. They'll never benefit from it. They'll be left behind. Then others will just juggle it. They will juggle the fire. They will make fireworks with the fire. They will create trinkets with the fire. They will create magic tricks with the fire. But those that truly understand it will feed the fire. How do you feed the fire? You feed the fire by buying Bitcoin. “ Saylor — who has taken on a near-mythic status in the bitcoin community for his leadership of Strategy, a publicly-traded technology company-turned-bitcoin treasury company, which holds approximately 3% of the total bitcoin supply — said that people should trade their other, inferior assets for bitcoin. “Take your fiat currency, trade it for bitcoin. Take your long term capital, trade it for bitcoin. Sell your bonds, trade [them] for Bitcoin. Sell your inferior equity, sell your inferior real estate property, buy bitcoin,” Saylor said. “Feed the fire, and what will come of that? An extraordinary explosion in the network and [in] the power of the network, and you will have bought your ticket to prosperity.” Thus was Saylor’s third way to wealth — courage — which he said meant that wealth “favors those who embrace intelligent monetary risk.” Bitcoin, like other assets, rises in price if more people buy it, though Saylor did not mention this effect during his speech. In addition to courage, Saylor advised the audience to have conviction in bitcoin’s potential, to stay committed to one cause, to cooperate with their families and children, to embrace artificial intelligence, to consider civility when engaging with the “natural power structures of the world,” and to remember to be generous. “When you are successful — and you will be successful — get up every morning and spread happiness, share security, and deliver hope to those less fortunate than you,” Saylor said. “You found the path first, you found the way first. You should spread good karma.”",Markets|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy|Strategy|News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-30 02:16:57

Possible Reasons Behind The Dip Today Macroeconomic Factors: On the macro side, the market sentiment was hit after a second US court blocked President Trump’s proposed tariffs. In addition, Treasury Secretary Bessent confirmed that trade talks with China have stalled — adding uncertainty to global markets, including crypto. Fear & Greed Index Signals ‘Greed’ at 61: The crypto Fear & Greed Index remains at 61 (Greed). Historically, markets tend to cool down after extended periods of greed-driven rallies, and today’s decline fits that pattern. Bitcoin’s Short-Term Weakness: Bitcoin, the market leader, has dipped to a nine-day low of $105,730. Analysts said that Bitcoin is currently flashing short-term warning signals as it liquidates long positions. The market is cooling off after weeks of upward momentum, and technical indicators like the Super Trend remain green but are starting to slow in bullish momentum. Ethereum Rejected at Resistance: Ethereum faced rejection from a major resistance zone once again, pulling its price down by over 3.6% in the past 24 hours to trade around $2,609. A slowing MACD on the 3-day timeframe also hints at weakening bullish momentum, raising concerns of a possible bearish crossover in the coming weeks.

The MoU outlined a framework for collaboration to assess if companies could list their securities on AIX and offer a tokenized listing on Interbix powered by the Solana blockchain and Jupiter. According to Astana International Exchange (AIX) CEO Assel Mukazhanova, the partnership will unlock new efficiencies, increase access to capital markets, and give companies and investors the best traditional and digital asset ecosystems. The MoU aims to explore dual listing mechanisms and blockchain integration The parties involved in the MoU committed to work together to explore the technical and commercial aspects of the mechanism. The parties demonstrated a shared vision to create a robust, transparent, secure dual listing framework. “This agreement marks a significant step toward the convergence of conventional capital markets and next generation blockchain based platforms. By joining forces, we are shaping an environment where innovation and trust go hand in hand.” – Assel Mukazhanova , CEO of AIX Jupiter said implementing the dual listing mechanism would begin a better approach to IPOs. Companies would be set to go public on AIX, Kazakhstan’s stock exchange platform while issuing tokenized versions of their assets through Interbix. The assets would be managed by Solana’s blockchain technology and Jupiter’s robust decentralized set of financial tools. Solana Foundation revealed that the MoU blended the credibility and reach of regulated public markets with the transparency and efficiency of blockchain networks. According to the company, the hybrid model would attract a wide range of investors, align capital markets operations, and create better access to liquidity, all with a secure and compliant framework. Talgat Dossanov, CEO of Interbix, commented that the MoU marked a transformative step for Kazakhstan and global markets. He added that the company is committed to bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. He continued to say that enabling tokenized listing alongside conventional IPOs lays the foundation for a new era of capital formation. Solana Foundation reveals a hybrid model with AIX, Jupiter, and Interbex at the Solana Economic Zone event The event , which was hosted by Forma, took place yesterday at the Solana Economic Zone. It aimed to showcase Kazakhstan’s growing status as a hub for blockchain innovation. Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), which has over 3,800 registered global companies, reiterated the partnership’s role as a bridge between traditional finance and the emerging world of blockchain-enabled capital markets. “ Capital markets are moving online beyond the borders of any country or exchange. We’re proud to collaborate with AIX to create a regulatory framework that supports next generation IPO paths, including dual listings and other internet native methods.” -Akshay BD, non-CMO of Solana Foundation Kash Dhanda, Jupiter’s COO, noted that Kazakhstan’s leadership signaled a future of capital formation with on-chain transparency and interoperability. He added that Jupiter is committed to collaborating closely to define compliant and scalable frameworks for decentralized finance. Solana token SOL is currently trading at $163.64, down by 5.24% today, while Jupiter token JUP is trading at $0.5715, down by 5.33% today. Jupiter, the leading decentralized exchange aggregator on the Solana blockchain, recently revealed a new lending protocol at the Solana Accelerate conference. According to Jupiter, the feature will be powered by partnering with Fluid, an Ethereum liquidity layer. The Jupiter project distributed 700 million tokens worth about $580 million to users, stakers, and contributors based on trading activities after airdropping nearly 1 billion JUP tokens in 2023. Solana Foundation recently announced another MoU with Superstate technology company, focusing on modernizing capital markets via blockchain infrastructure. Superstate was set to act as the primary agent for SOL strategies by providing the platform and infrastructure to issue tokens that represent Solana’s common stock.

The Act proposes comprehensive registration regimes to allow digital asset firms to operate legally within the U.S. market. Lawmakers emphasize the bill’s focus on consumer protection, innovation, and institutional clarity for investors and entrepreneurs. A long-awaited effort to bring order to the murky world of U.S. crypto regulation advanced on Thursday as Representative French Hill introduced the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, also known as the CLARITY Act. The bill arrives with bipartisan support, including three Democratic co-sponsors, and seeks to finally resolve the jurisdictional tug-of-war between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The New Bipartisan Crypto Bill Seeks to End SEC-CFTC Turf War The 236-page bill is a successor to last year’s FIT21 legislation. While stablecoin regulation still leads the race to become the first comprehensive crypto law in the U.S., the CLARITY Act represents a major step forward in shaping broader crypto market structure rules. At its core, the bill gives the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over digital commodity spot markets. These would be governed by new entities registered with the agency. Source: US Congress Crypto platforms would have the option to register with either the CFTC or the SEC, depending on whether they handle digital commodities like Bitcoin or securities, or both. “Our bill brings long-overdue clarity to the digital asset ecosystem and prioritizes consumer protection and American innovation,” said Representative Hill. “It builds off our work in the 118th Congress.” The legislation introduces comprehensive registration regimes, allowing crypto firms to legally operate in the U.S. It also lays out disclosure and compliance requirements for developers and intermediaries. These include detailed project disclosures, segregation of customer funds, and conflict-of-interest mitigation. “The CLARITY Act will deliver clear rules of the road that entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers deserve,” said Representative Ritchie Torres, one of the bill’s backers. Representative Dusty Johnson, who leads the agriculture subcommittee on digital assets, added: “America should be the global leader in the digital assets marketplace, but we can’t do that without establishing a clear regulatory framework.” U.S. Lawmakers Push Crypto Reform Bill Clarifying Custody, Stablecoin, and DeFi Oversight The bill covers long-disputed areas, including the regulation of custodians and decentralized finance (DeFi). It rejects the SEC’s prior attempt to require custody firms to hold customer assets on their own balance sheets. Instead, it sets a standard for “qualified digital asset custodians,” which would be defined by the CFTC based on federal, state, or foreign oversight. NEW: Chairman @RepFrenchHill today introduced the CLARITY Act, a bipartisan bill which would establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US.

The legislation tasks the SEC, CFTC, and the Treasury Department with studying these sectors and reporting back within a year. The Government Accountability Office is also directed to prepare reports on DeFi and NFTs. The bill explicitly exempts some decentralized wallet providers and DeFi platforms from SEC oversight. It also clarifies that payment stablecoins are not securities, placing regulatory authority with whichever agency already oversees the firm engaged in the activity. All told, the CLARITY Act sets a tight one-year timeline for regulators to write and implement the rules if the bill becomes law. That schedule is viewed by some as ambitious, especially given the complexities of financial regulation. Some provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, are still not finalized. NEW: US Digital Asset Market Structure bill, the CLARITY Act: 1. Clarifies CFTC vs. SEC (defining commodities & securities). 2. Unified federal licensing and registration regime. 3. Stablecoin and DeFI carve-outs. https://t.co/ZTosDCUudA pic.twitter.com/OTShEAebrn — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) May 29, 2025 Whether the House and Senate will align on crypto regulation is still unclear. The Senate is expected to resume debate next week on its stablecoin bill , which has made procedural progress but faces partisan concerns . Some lawmakers have floated the idea of combining the stablecoin and market structure bills , though such a move could complicate passage. President Donald Trump has pushed for both bills to reach his desk by the August congressional recess, but crypto insiders in Washington view that timeline as unlikely. For now, the bipartisan CLARITY Act gives lawmakers and regulators a new framework to work with and puts renewed pressure on Congress to end the longstanding confusion over crypto regulation in the United States.

XXRP uses swaps to provide leveraged XRP exposure, but carries heightened risk and volatility compared to spot products. XRP is already more volatile than other digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. So XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. Long-term investors should use the futures ETF or wait for spot XRP ETFs rather than holding leveraged products like XXRP. In my recent coverage of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( OTC:BITW ) for Seeking Alpha, I made note of how it was becoming increasingly possible to mimic the top holdings of that fund but through allocating to various ETFs and closed-end funds in a traditional a self-directed IRA. At 90% combined allocation between Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), spot ETFs are useful tools for self-directing asset weightings. Allocating the 3% exposure to Solana ( SOL-USD ) is also quite easy given the OTC market offers two different closed-end funds as well as a futures-based ETF. 5% of BITW assets are in XRP ( XRP-USD ). Despite the US market lacking spot ETFs or OTC market CEF shares, traders can get exposed to XRP through the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF ( XXRP ). In this article, we'll look at Teucrium's fund details, how it allocates XRP exposure, and why speculators with longer term time horizons should wait for spot ETFs rather than sitting in XXRP shares. Fund Details & Objective The objective of the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF is very simple; XXRP aims to double the return of XRP on a daily basis. To its credit, Teucrium is very overt about the fact that the fund will ultimately lag the performance of XRP over time. We'll detail that a bit more in the risks section later in this article. Believe it or not, XXRP is not the only 2x leveraged XRP ETF in the market today. In the time since my May 21st BITW article , we have seen a second 2x leveraged XRP fund begin trading, with the Volatility Shares 2x XRP ETF ( XRPT ) launching on May 22nd. Here's a straightforward comparison between the funds: Fund Comparison XXRP XRPT Issuer Teucrium Volatility Shares LLC Inception 04/07/2025 05/22/2025 Expense Ratio 1.89% 0.94% AUM $100.24M $1.70M Source: Seeking Alpha With respect to being first to market, the only real advantage XXRP has over XRPT at this point in time is liquidity. With just over $100 million in AUM against less than $2 million for XRPT, traders will likely have a far easier time executing orders at desirable prices through XXRP if they want to go the leveraged fund route. Since these funds are not to be held for longer than a few days or weeks (at most), the expense ratio likely doesn't matter as much as the liquidity difference. But it is worth pointing out that XXRP is roughly double the price of XRPT, purely by the fees associated with holding the funds. XRP Swaps Since there isn't a spot ETF for XRP yet in the US market, XXRP utilizes swap agreements with global financial institutions that allow Teucrium and its counter-parties to make payments based on XRP reference assets or benchmarks. Those could include the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, the CME CF XRP-Dollar Real-Time Index, or a handful of European XRP ETPs that are listed below: 21Shares XRP ETP Bitwise Physical XRP ETP Virtune XRP ETP WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP CoinShares Physical XRP ETP In addition to these 'XRP Swaps,' Teucrium may also hold XRP futures contracts and/or XRP options. But the point is, XXRP doesn't actually provide speculators with direct exposure to XRP. Which is definitely a consideration that US buyers should keep in mind if they want to minimize third-party risk to the degree that they can. That said, for this type of product, that concern is likely minimal. The larger concern is long term decay. 2x Leveraged ETF Risks As is generally the case with every leveraged ETF product in the market today, funds like XXRP are designed for short-term holding rather than long-term investment. For those seeking a tactical trading tool, 2x funds like XXRP can be great. The advantage they have over taking positions with margin is the leveraged funds limit downside. Trading with margin can result in a call to pledge more collateral. However, with leveraged ETFs, a trader can only lose what is put into the position. Furthermore, unlike something like 0DTE options, there is no expiration on leveraged ETF positions. So holding time can be as long as the idea is winning, or the trader has an ability to endure pain. On the latter, Teucrium's prospectus makes it very clear that XXRP is not designed for long-term holding and will ultimately lag the return of XRP if held for too long: The return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of its return for each day compounded over the period. The Fund’s returns for periods longer than a single day will very likely differ in amount, and possibly even direction, from the Fund’s stated multiple (2x) times the return of daily changes in the price of XRP for the same period. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if XRP’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the price of XRP increases. As I've said in my numerous articles covering at least a dozen leveraged ETFs prior to this one, it is imperative that entries and exits in these types of products are timed properly. Sustained periods of chop or sideways action will not help XXRP holders. While the trading history for XXRP is admittedly small since inception in early-April, we can already see how sideways action is bad for the fund: Data by YCharts The chart above shows the price performances of XRP and XXRP since April 28th. The price or XRP is roughly flat at 0.79% over the last month, yet XXRP is down nearly 10%. Some of this is due to the added volatility that comes with a 2x leveraged ETF - that volatility is entirely by design. But the volatility is compounded because XRP itself is also highly volatile. XRP Volatility I've covered XRP based on network fundamentals a handful of times for SA and recently updated that view back in April: For me, the chain usage data is actually pretty encouraging. We see transactions up over time, DAAs making highs, and even fees have noticeably increased in recent months. Still, price is well ahead of all of this action. However, even if one holds the view that XRP is a buy based on their own fundamental framework, it's important to keep in mind that any position in XXRP should likely be expressing more of a technical bull setup than a fundamental one. Crypto is already a highly volatile sector of the market, and when you get into the altcoins that volatility can get more intense. Such is the case with XRP. Volatility XRP BTC ETH 30D 0.61 0.35 0.92 90D 1.08 0.54 0.94 1Yr 0.98 0.49 0.73 Source: Messari The table above shows the volatility metrics for XRP, BTC, and ETH over 30 Day, 90 day, and 1 year time frames. In all but one time frame, XRP is more volatile than ETH and XRP is more volatile than BTC in all three time frames shared. Closing Takeaways Essentially, XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. XRP is already a very volatile asset over just about any time frame that you look at. Factor in leverage from a fund like XXRP, and we're talking about a financial product that must be actively managed by the trader who holds it. This is not a product that should be held for longer than a few days, in my view. Thus, timing the buy properly is imperative. For investors who want exposure to XRP without leverage, they can consider the Volatility Shares XRP ETF ( XRPI ) as an alternative. That fund utilizes futures contracts without the leverage to mimic XRP returns and was launched the same day as XRPT.",XRP-USD|XXRP,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-30 03:04:29
