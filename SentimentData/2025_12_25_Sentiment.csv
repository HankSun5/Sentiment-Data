When you look at the Pippin chart, something feels off. It does not feel organic, which is something to be suspicious about. Why? According to Bubblemaps, 93 wallets now hold 80% of the supply. Source: Pippin Bubblemaps The fact is, neither the project owner nor the official Pippin accounts on X have mentioned the project in the past few months. Yet, the PIPPIN coin was listed on Robinhood just recently. So do they know something we do not? This is mainly why people keep shorting it, and the coin keeps going up and liquidating them. The leverage shown on CoinMarketCap , around $3 to $4 billion, is leading many to believe a violent move in either direction is coming soon. Pippin Price Prediction: Can PIPPIN Reach $0.8 This Christmas? Since nothing feels organic, there is one belief: if there is more liquidity in longs, the coin will nuke, and if there is more liquidity in shorts, the candle will go straight up. Source: PIPPINUSD / TradingView The coin is up 30% over the last 7 days. It just broke its previous all time high at $0.528 with a large candle before slipping back below it. Last time it hit this level, price dropped around 40%. If it manages to break and hold above it this time, there is a good chance it could rally toward $0.80. With around $4B in open futures interest, it could really move either way. The RSI is sitting near 60, confirming bullish momentum, but given the history of this chart, that signal alone does not mean much. If It Is All Speculation, It Is Better to Be a Memecoin Maxi Doge is not running on mystery pumps, hidden wallets, or liquidation games. It is doing the opposite. The project is building momentum the slow, dangerous way: real demand, visible inflows, and a growing base of holders who are not just flipping candles. The presale has already raised over $4.36M, even while the broader memecoin market is shaky. That kind of capital does not show up unless buyers are positioning early, not chasing hype after the move is done. What really separates Maxi Doge is the 71% APY staking. Instead of forcing holders to trade every spike, it gives them a reason to sit tight and let pressure build. That is usually how the biggest memecoin runs start, quietly, before everyone else notices. While PIPPIN feels like a leverage trap waiting to spring in either direction, Maxi Doge looks like a clean setup forming under the radar. No forced narratives, no weird wallet concentration drama, just steady accumulation and patience. If memecoin volatility is about to explode again, the projects with real liquidity, locked-in holders, and early conviction tend to outperform when it matters most.

56312080,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93220,1766611835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Too Late on Stellar Winners? Apeing Could Be the Next 1000x Crypto Still Flying Under Radar,https://timestabloid.com/too-late-on-stellar-winners-apeing-could-be-the-next-1000x-crypto/,"Apeing ($APEING) is increasingly appearing in conversations about the next 1000x crypto, particularly among investors who missed early opportunities. Designed around controlled access and staged pricing, Apeing introduces a structure that prioritizes timing, scarcity, and early conviction rather than open-market chaos. For many market participants, the regret of missing early-stage blockchains still lingers. Apeing positions itself as a second-chance style setup, not by copying past giants, but by applying lessons learned from how early momentum actually forms. Understanding its access model, pricing stages, and psychology-driven design is essential for anyone evaluating a potential next 1000x crypto . How Apeing Is Building a Next 1000x Crypto Narrative Through Early Access Apeing blends meme-driven energy with deliberate mechanics aimed at early participation. Instead of launching directly into open trading, the project uses a whitelist-only entry system that restricts initial supply and creates a measurable advantage for early adopters. Key elements shaping Apeing’s next 1000x crypto narrative include: Stage-based pricing that increases with each phase Whitelist-gated access to the earliest allocation Limited early supply, encouraging long-term positioning over instant flipping This design rewards those who act before attention peaks, rather than those chasing momentum afterward. Early pricing combined with scarcity often amplifies perception-driven value once a token lists publicly. Why Whitelist Access Matters When Targeting the Next 1000x Crypto In modern crypto cycles, whitelist access has become a strategic edge rather than a marketing gimmick. For investors researching the next 1000x crypto, controlled entry often defines who captures the largest asymmetry. With Apeing , whitelist access unlocks Stage 1 participation, the lowest price tier available. Apeing Stage 1 Snapshot Stage 1 price: $0.0001 Expected listing price: $0.001 Implied upside at listing: 10× before broader market trading This structure allows early participants to enter before volatility, influencer narratives, and exchange-driven price discovery reshape valuation. In high-risk, high-reward setups, this early positioning frequently separates leaders from latecomers. How to Join Apeing Early and Avoid Common Risks Securing early access to the next 1000x crypto requires caution and discipline. Apeing’s team emphasizes using official channels only to reduce exposure to impersonation and phishing attempts. Visit the official Apeing website Submit an email address in the whitelist section Confirm registration via email Monitor official updates to track stage announcements Following verified instructions ensures access remains legitimate while protecting participants from common presale risks. Stellar as a Benchmark: Why Investors Compare Emerging Tokens to It Stellar is often used as a benchmark because it shows how a low-visibility crypto project can grow into globally recognized infrastructure over time. In its early years, Stellar attracted limited attention and traded at modest valuations, yet it steadily built relevance through real-world applications such as cross-border payments, stablecoin issuance, and financial inclusion initiatives. For investors, this long and quiet growth phase reinforces the idea that the most meaningful opportunities often appear before mainstream awareness takes hold. Investors also compare emerging tokens to Stellar because of its fundamentals-first trajectory. Rather than relying on short-term hype cycles, Stellar focused on utility, network reliability, and adoption across multiple market cycles. This durability highlights an important lesson: early positioning in structurally sound projects can deliver asymmetric outcomes when patience aligns with long-term vision. As a result, Stellar functions as a reference point for evaluating whether new tokens have the design, timing, and discipline required to mature beyond speculation. Final Outlook: Timing, Structure, and the Next 1000x Crypto Mindset The search for the next 1000x crypto is less about chasing headlines and more about understanding access mechanics. Apeing introduces a framework built around staged entry, controlled supply, and early participation, a combination that has historically driven outsized outcomes. Research referenced by Best Crypto to Buy Now , along with comparisons to Solana cycles, shows that this structure often forms before major breakouts. For those who missed Stellar’s earliest chapters, Apeing represents a chance to engage before attention peaks rather than after narratives harden. Risk remains unavoidable, but informed timing frequently outperforms hesitation in asymmetric setups. By understanding whitelist mechanics, stage pricing, and broader market psychology, participants can approach Apeing not as blind speculation, but as a structured early-stage strategy aligned with how major crypto stories often begin. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About the Next 1000x Crypto Why is Apeing discussed as the next 1000x crypto? Apeing attracts attention as the next 1000x crypto due to its whitelist-only Stage 1 access, low initial pricing, and scarcity-driven distribution model that favors early participants. How does early access improve upside potential? Early access allows participants to enter at the lowest valuation before public trading, reducing exposure to volatility and increasing potential upside if demand accelerates. Is targeting the next 1000x crypto risky? Yes. All early-stage crypto investments carry significant risk. Structured access improves positioning but does not guarantee returns. Summary Apeing is emerging as a strong candidate in discussions around the next 1000x crypto, driven by early whitelist access, staged pricing, and scarcity-focused design. By replacing open-market launches with controlled entry, the project emphasizes timing and psychology. With Stellar serving as a long-term benchmark, Apeing highlights how early positioning can shape outsized outcomes for those willing to act early and responsibly.

This expansion represents a significant development in the crypto trading platform landscape, particularly for Korean market participants seeking lower-cost alternatives to major exchanges like Binance, Upbit, and OKX.

Pros Cons Proprietary xStation platform Limited 20x leverage Strong European regulation No MetaTrader platforms Extensive education programs Geographic restrictions Competitive spreads Smaller crypto selection Market analysis included Inactivity fees after period The Regulated Crypto CFD Advantage Regulated crypto CFDs through platforms like Moneta Markets provide compelling alternatives to direct exchange trading for multiple strategic reasons. Regulatory oversight ensures proper fund segregation, transparent pricing, and adherence to conduct standards protecting trader interests. Licensed brokers maintain capital buffers and insurance mechanisms that safeguard client funds even during platform financial stress. This protection framework contrasts sharply with cryptocurrency exchanges where regulatory oversight remains inconsistent and customer fund protection often proves inadequate during crisis situations. The recent history of exchange failures demonstrates the material risks of holding significant capital on unregulated platforms without proper segregation or insurance mechanisms. Cryptocurrency trading costs through regulated CFD brokers frequently total less than equivalent exchange-based positions when accounting for all fees. Exchanges charge maker/taker fees typically ranging 0.02-0.10% per trade plus funding rates averaging 0.01-0.03% every 8 hours on leveraged positions. These funding rates compound to potentially 1-3% monthly on larger positions, significantly impacting profitability for swing traders and position holders. Moneta Markets eliminates funding rate volatility through fixed swap rates while offering tighter spreads than many exchanges during normal conditions. The total cost advantage becomes more pronounced with higher trading frequency and larger position sizes where basis points translate to substantial dollar amounts. Additional exchange costs including withdrawal fees, network transfer costs, and conversion spreads further erode profitability compared to regulated CFD structures. Execution quality and infrastructure reliability separate professional-grade platforms from exchange trading environments that sometimes suffer degradation during peak volatility. Regulated brokers invest heavily in server infrastructure, redundancy systems, and technology partnerships ensuring consistent execution even during extreme market conditions. Platform downtime during critical trading moments can prove catastrophic for leveraged positions, making reliability a crucial consideration beyond just pricing. The mobile-first approach adopted by Moneta Markets recognizes modern trading patterns while delivering full functionality through optimized mobile applications. Professional risk management tools including guaranteed stops, trailing orders, and advanced position monitoring provide sophisticated control over leveraged exposures that exchange interfaces often lack or implement poorly. Market Impact and Future Outlook The expansion of regulated crypto CFD offerings like Moneta Markets’ 500x leverage products represents a significant market evolution with implications for cryptocurrency trading structure. As retail and institutional traders increasingly recognize the advantages of regulated environments over direct exchange trading, volume migration toward licensed CFD providers will likely accelerate. This trend benefits traders through intensifying competition among providers, driving continuous improvement in pricing, execution quality, and platform functionality. The bifurcation between regulated and offshore trading environments will become more pronounced as regulatory frameworks mature and enforcement mechanisms strengthen across major jurisdictions. Leverage availability through regulated channels addresses a critical market need for capital efficiency without exposing traders to unregulated counterparty risk. The ability to deploy 500x leverage on cryptocurrency CFDs through properly capitalized and supervised brokers democratizes access to professional trading tools previously available only through offshore platforms or institutional relationships. This democratization empowers skilled traders to maximize returns on capital while maintaining protections against platform insolvency or operational failures. As leverage products gain mainstream acceptance, educational resources and risk management tools will continue improving to support sustainable trading practices. The future cryptocurrency trading landscape will likely see continued convergence between traditional financial infrastructure and digital asset markets. Platforms combining the best aspects of both worlds through regulated operations, institutional-grade execution, and crypto-native product innovation will capture disproportionate market share. Geographic specialization, such as Moneta Markets’ focus on Korean traders with tailored products, demonstrates how successful platforms will differentiate beyond just pricing and leverage availability. The integration of additional cryptocurrency pairs, options products, and sophisticated hedging tools will further enhance the value proposition of regulated CFD trading as the market matures. Comparing Regulated Crypto CFD Providers Provider Max Leverage Regulation Platforms Crypto Selection Key Advantage Moneta Markets 500x Multi-jurisdiction MT4/MT5/ProTrader/Mobile BTC, ETH, XRP Lowest total costs Plus500 30x FCA/ASIC/CySEC Proprietary 15+ cryptos Guaranteed stops IG Markets 20x FCA/ASIC Proprietary 10+ cryptos 45+ year track record CMC Markets 30x FCA/ASIC Next Generation 12+ cryptos Advanced charting City Index 25x FCA Web/Mobile 8+ cryptos Market commentary Saxo Bank 20x Danish FSA SaxoTrader 10+ cryptos Multi-asset integration IBKR Futures SEC/FCA TWS BTC futures Institutional quality XTB 20x EU licenses xStation 20+ cryptos Educational content Key Advantages of High Leverage Trading High leverage availability through regulated platforms like Moneta Markets enables sophisticated trading strategies that would otherwise require prohibitive capital commitments. Traders can maintain diversified positions across multiple cryptocurrency pairs while preserving capital for opportunistic deployments when favorable setups emerge. The capital efficiency gained through 500x leverage allows a $2,000 account to control a $1,000,000 position, generating meaningful returns from smaller account sizes when managed properly. This accessibility democratizes professional trading strategies previously restricted to well-capitalized institutional participants or individuals willing to accept offshore platform risks. Proper leverage utilization enables aggressive position scaling during high-conviction trades while maintaining appropriate risk controls through position sizing mathematics. A trader risking 1% of account balance per trade can deploy larger absolute position sizes with higher leverage, potentially capturing greater profits from correct market calls. The key lies in understanding that leverage itself doesn’t increase risk, but rather inappropriate position sizing relative to account size and stop-loss placement. Traders using 500x leverage with proper risk management can actually maintain lower overall account risk than those using 10x leverage with oversized positions lacking appropriate stop-loss protection. The psychological aspects of leverage trading require careful consideration alongside mathematical risk calculations. Higher leverage availability demands greater discipline in execution, position sizing, and emotional control during adverse price movements. Successful high-leverage traders develop systematic approaches to trade selection, entry timing, and position management that remove emotional decision-making from the process. The availability of demo accounts and educational resources helps traders develop necessary skills before deploying significant capital with high leverage multiples. Platforms like Moneta Markets that combine high leverage with comprehensive risk management tools and trader education create environments supporting sustainable high-leverage trading rather than encouraging reckless speculation. Frequently Asked Questions Why choose regulated crypto CFDs over exchange trading? — Regulated CFDs provide lower total costs, higher leverage, better execution, regulatory protections, and professional risk management tools that exchanges typically lack, making them superior for active cryptocurrency trading and capital preservation. What makes 500x leverage safe with proper management? — Leverage doesn’t inherently increase risk when combined with appropriate position sizing and stop-losses. 500x leverage with 1% account risk per trade is safer than 10x leverage with 10% risk per trade, demonstrating that position sizing matters more than leverage multiple. How does Moneta Markets keep costs lower than exchanges? — Moneta Markets eliminates volatile funding rates, offers tighter spreads, charges minimal commissions, and has no withdrawal fees or network costs, resulting in 30-40% lower total trading costs compared to major exchanges for equivalent positions. Can I trade crypto CFDs on mobile devices? — Yes, Moneta Markets prioritizes mobile-first execution with full-featured applications for iOS and Android, recognizing that over 65% of modern trading occurs through mobile devices requiring seamless functionality without compromise. What regulatory protections apply to crypto CFD trading? — Regulated brokers must segregate client funds, maintain capital buffers, provide transparent pricing, offer negative balance protection, and submit to regular audits and oversight ensuring trader protections unavailable on unregulated exchanges. Conclusion Moneta Markets’ expansion of regulated crypto CFD offerings with 500x leverage represents a significant development in the crypto trading platform landscape, providing traders with compelling alternatives to traditional exchange-based cryptocurrency trading. The combination of high leverage availability, substantially lower total trading costs, mobile-first execution, and comprehensive regulatory protections addresses the core needs of active traders seeking institutional-grade infrastructure. As the market continues evolving toward regulated environments offering superior trader protections and cost structures, platforms like Moneta Markets that successfully bridge traditional financial infrastructure with crypto-native innovation will capture increasing market share from exchanges struggling to compete on both execution quality and total cost efficiency.

This week, Gnosis confirmed that the assets are now out of the attacker’s control and urged remaining operators to update their nodes to avoid penalties. It has not yet specified the exact total amount of funds recovered. Validator-Approved Hard Fork In a post on X, the network said the decision was taken by operators following weeks of discussion after the November hack of decentralized exchange and automated market maker, Balancer, which resulted in the loss of almost $120 million in digital assets across multiple chains. The hard fork follows an earlier emergency soft fork adopted by a majority of validators in November that restricted bridge movements and froze stolen funds on Gnosis Chain. According to Gnosis, the hard fork was required to move those frozen assets and enable their recovery. The Balancer exploit was later traced to a vulnerability in Balancer V2 Composable Stable Pools, despite the protocol having undergone 11 audits by four different security firms. On-chain data revealed that the attacker had moved large amounts of staked Ether to new wallets shortly after the breach. Balancer later said that white hat hackers were able to recover about $28 million, though most of the stolen assets initially remained inaccessible. Gnosis Chain was among the networks affected, and roughly $9.4 million in stolen funds were frozen on-chain through the soft fork. Mixed Responses From the Community Philippe Schommers, Gnosis’s head of infrastructure, had said earlier this month that a hard fork would be necessary to return those funds to users, while adding that node operators who failed to follow the majority chain would face penalties. He also said the team’s priority was to enable recovery before the end of December. The move sparked debate within the community. Supporters argued that coordinated intervention showed accountability and a commitment to user protection, while critics warned that such actions could undermine the principle of immutability and called for clearer rules governing future interventions. Some community members said that the soft fork had already altered the chain’s history, which makes the hard fork a continuation of that decision, while others pushed for a formal framework to define when similar actions would be justified.

In 2027, it will range between $9.26 and $11.49, with an average price of $9.60. In 2030, it will range between $28.31 and $34.81, with an average price of $29.16. TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. The native token for the TON ecosystem is called Toncoin. “Will TON ever go up? Can TON reach the $10 mark? Where will TON be in five years?” These are the questions traders and investors ask. Let’s answer them and more in our Toncoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Toncoin Ticker TON Current price $1.48 Market cap $3.65B Trading volume $105.99M Circulating supply 2.44B All-time high $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024 All-time low $0.3906 on Sep 20, 2021 24-hour high $1.50 24-hour low $1.45 TON price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 3.89% 50-day SMA $1.69 200-day SMA $2.72 Sentiment Bearish Green days 17/30 (57%) Fear and Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) TON price analysis: TON’s drop slows On December 24, TON’s price rose by 0.83% in 24 hours but is down 5.15% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 18.47% to $93.26M, showing renewed trading interest. TON/USD 1-day chart price analysis TONUSD chart by TradingView Toncoin dropped this month after failing to break resistance at the 23.60% Fibonacci level ($1.77). The drop and its volatility decelerated this week, as shown by the William Alligator trendlines. The relative strength index (38.48) shows TON is in neutral territory; it is oversold below 30. TON/USD 4-hour chart price analysis TONUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights TON’s run this month, showing a gradual descent, broken by steep reversals. The latest candle formation suggests a recovery. The MACD histograms (0.005) show positive market momentum as trading volumes dropped. Toncoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2.00 SELL SMA 5 1.78 SELL SMA 10 1.68 SELL SMA 21 1.65 SELL SMA 50 1.69 SELL SMA 100 2.09 SELL SMA 200 2.72 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 1.58 SELL EMA 5 1.71 SELL EMA 10 2.02 SELL EMA 21 2.45 SELL EMA 50 2.84 SELL EMA 100 3.02 SELL EMA 200 3.34 SELL What to expect from the TON price analysis next? Our technical analysis indicates that Toncoin is bearish. The coin’s momentum and volatility are dropping over the shorter timeframes, with positive momentum fueling the recent recovery. Why is TON down? Toncoin’s decline reflects structural risks stemming from whale dominance and fading momentum surrounding ecosystem updates, compounded by bearish technical indicators. Recent news Over 68% of TON’s supply is held by whale wallets, per CoinMarketCap data. Long-term holders ( Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

TON historic price sentiment TON price history by CoinGecko Ton network launched in 2018 as the Telegram Open Network (TON) but was later renamed “The Open Network” and taken over by the TON Foundation. In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event. On September 20, 2021, TON registered its all-time low price at $0.3906. Its first significant break came in November 2021. In days, the coin slid from $0.8 to $4.5. It corrected in 2022, reaching a low of $0.9. In 2023, it ranged between $1.1 and $2.5. In 2024, it registered another bull run, rising from $2.11 to its all-time high of $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024. It corrected later and traded at the $5.2 mark in October and $4.98 in November when it started recovering. The recovery saw the coin rise above $6.5 in December. It then crossed into 2025, trading at $5.5. From there, it assumed a bear run as it fell below $3.8 in February and $3.0 in May. It crossed into June, trading at $3.20, and it maintained the level into August. In October, it fell below $3.00, and $2.50 in November. In December, it traded at $1.60 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Toncoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TON|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-24 21:55:00

Many large altcoins that once delivered explosive gains are now facing slower price action, higher liquidity demands, and weaker momentum. Investors are still active, but capital is becoming more selective. In these moments, attention often shifts away from saturated assets and toward new crypto projects that show early growth signals without carrying heavy market caps. This is where comparisons to early Shiba Inu and Dogecoin begin to surface. A new DeFi crypto called Mutuum Finance, selling at $0.035 in its current stage, is increasingly mentioned in discussions about where the next structural upside could form. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu became one of the most well known meme coins during its early run. At the time, SHIB traded at extremely low prices and benefited from strong community momentum. Early investors were drawn in by the possibility of large % gains from a small starting valuation. Today, SHIB is a very different asset. It carries a massive market cap and requires significant liquidity to move its price in a meaningful way. This creates a structural challenge. Even with strong trading volume, upside becomes harder to sustain once size grows too large. Price charts also reflect this shift. Breakout attempts tend to stall, and price movement has slowed compared to its early phase. This does not make SHIB irrelevant, but it limits the type of growth it can realistically deliver going forward. For investors looking for asymmetric upside, liquidity weight becomes a real constraint. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin followed a different path, but it now faces a similar ceiling. DOGE rose from a joke asset into one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. Early hype, social momentum, and celebrity attention helped push its price far beyond what fundamentals alone would suggest. Over time, that narrative weakened. Community excitement faded, and DOGE struggled to find new catalysts that could support another sustained rally. Adoption stalled, and price trends became less convincing. From a market perspective, Dogecoin now sits in a zone where expectations are capped. Without clear protocol development or new use cases, its price outlook remains limited. This creates a narrative gap that investors often try to fill by rotating into assets with clearer growth paths. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance enters this picture from a very different angle. Instead of relying on hype or viral demand, MUTM is designed as an Ethereum based DeFi crypto focused on lending and borrowing. The protocol uses a dual market structure where users supply assets to earn yield and borrowers access liquidity by locking collateral. Lending rules are defined, interest flows are predictable, and collateral requirements are clear. This creates a framework where value is generated through usage rather than attention. Unlike SHIB or DOGE, MUTM does not require massive liquidity to move. Its current scale allows price to respond more directly to changes in participation. Growth is also not tied to social cycles. It is tied to protocol activity. In its current presale Phase 6, MUTM is priced at $0.035. Since Phase 1, the token has surged 2.5x. More than $19.4M has been raised, and the holder count has grown past 18,600 wallets. Out of the 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to 1.82B tokens, with a large portion already distributed. These figures reflect steady accumulation rather than sudden spikes. Core Mechanics That Support Long-Term Value Several mechanics help explain why MUTM is being compared to early growth assets, but with a different foundation. mtTokens play a central role. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens that increase in value as interest accrues. This encourages holding and participation rather than fast trading. The buy and distribute model adds another layer. Protocol revenue can be used to buy MUTM from the market and distribute it to mtToken holders. This links token demand directly to protocol usage. Oracle systems support accurate pricing and risk management, which is critical for lending markets. Together, these elements connect price performance to real activity. This is something SHIB and DOGE were never designed to do. From a price analysis perspective, some analysts outline a long term scenario where MUTM could reach a 10X increase if usage scales after launch. This is not framed as a guarantee, but as a structural comparison. Smaller supply, active revenue flow, and growing participation create conditions where larger % moves are mathematically possible. Roadmap Catalysts and Why Timing Matters Several upcoming milestones add context to this analysis. The V1 testnet is targeted for Q4 , marking the transition from development into live usage. This is often a key moment for DeFi crypto repricing. Security is another major factor. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 score, is undergoing a Halborn review , and launched a $50k bug bounty. These steps reduce protocol risk and tend to attract more serious capital. Beyond V1, the roadmap includes a protocol backed stablecoin and Layer 2 expansion. These features aim to lower fees, increase speed, and expand the addressable user base. Phase 6 is now over 99%, and allocation is tightening. Whale inflows have already appeared, and the 24 hour leaderboard continues to reward consistent engagement rather than one time activity. Card payment access further lowers entry barriers. A Different Kind of Comparison The comparison to early SHIB or DOGE is not about copying their hype driven spikes. It is about recognizing how early stage assets behave before size becomes a limitation. Shiba Inu faced a liquidity problem as it grew too large. Dogecoin faced a narrative problem as attention faded. Mutuum Finance positions itself as a structural alternative. Its growth path is tied to lending demand, yield participation, and predictable mechanics. For investors watching top crypto opportunities and new cryptocurrency trends, MUTM represents a different type of setup. One where upside potential is not driven by viral cycles, but by usage scaling over time.

Top Stock Exchanges Ready To Launch Crypto Trading On Tuesday, local news reported that the leading stock exchanges in Russia, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and SPB Exchange, expressed their support of the Central Bank of Russia’s proposed regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The exchanges affirmed they are prepared to launch crypto trading services under the recently unveiled framework as soon as it is enacted. In a statement, The Moscow Exchange, which is the largest exchange in Russia, backed the Central Bank’s proposals. The platform asserted that the Russian financial market’s reliable and effective solutions will be “highly applicable” under the new framework, noting that they are “actively working on solutions to serve the cryptocurrency market and plans to launch their circulation as soon as the relevant regulations are in place.” “In our opinion, the regulatory concept draws on the accumulated experience of conducting operations in the currency market, where the Moscow Exchange Group has accumulated expertise in trading, clearing, and settlement technologies that is unique in the international context,” the exchange reportedly said. Meanwhile, the SPB Exchange also stated its support to the Central Bank’s efforts to create “transparent and secure conditions” for crypto trading, noting that it is prepared to participate in joint efforts to develop the relevant infrastructure within the regulated market. “We are ready to start trading cryptocurrencies after the relevant changes are made to the legal regulation. The SPB Exchange has the appropriate technological infrastructure for trading and settlements,” the exchange’s statement read. Russia’s New Regulatory Framework As reported by Bitcoinist, the central bank unveiled new regulatory proposals this week that will allow retail and qualified investors to buy crypto assets through already licensed platforms in Russia. The proposed rules, expected to take effect by July 2026, will permit non-qualified investors to purchase up to 300,000 rubles, worth around $3,800, annually in the most liquid digital assets after passing a knowledge test. Meanwhile, qualified investors will be able to purchase unlimited amounts of any cryptocurrency after passing a risk-awareness test. The framework would also require that transactions are conducted through already licensed platforms, including exchanges, brokers, and trust managers, with additional requirements applied to custodians and exchange services. In addition, residents will be allowed to buy crypto assets abroad and transfer their holdings through Russian licensed intermediaries, while subject to the necessary tax reporting. Recently, Vladimir Chistyukhin, First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, affirmed that the local financial market has all the necessary infrastructure to work with crypto assets. The Deputy chairman explained that Russian financial authorities consider it “fundamentally important” to legitimize the digital assets sector and ensure that it is compliant with the law. However, he noted that the country needs to adopt regulations quickly due to “international attention” and this process will require amendments to multiple laws, including digital financial assets, the securities market, and banking legislation.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Central Bank of Russia|crypto framework|crypto investors|Crypto legislation|Crypto Trading|Moscow Exchange|Russia Crypto legislation|Russia stock exchange|SPB Exchange,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 22:00:03

The market’s leading cryptocurrency, currently trading at approximately $87,370, has experienced a decline of over 30% from its all-time high of more than $126,000, drawing comparisons to past market behaviors, particularly those witnessed in December 2021. Fractal Patterns Resurface Notably, on December 24, 2021, Bitcoin was valued at around $51,700, marking a local peak before it plummeted to $34,000 by January 24, 2022. This decline represented a significant 34% drop within just one month. Related Reading: This Friday’s Bitcoin Options Expiry Could Shake Up The Market: What To Look Out For An expert analyzing the current market dynamics has applied a fractal model derived from that previous sell-off to Bitcoin’s present price. According to this analysis, there is a potential trajectory that could see the cryptocurrency move toward the $70,000 mark in the coming days. The expert argues that given the current price action and current market conditions, this scenario is plausible and suggests an additional decline of about 20% for the Bitcoin price if a similar pattern unfolds. However, without clear direction, the question remains whether this situation will unfold into a recovery above key price levels or into an extended bear market heading into the first quarter of 2026. As such, perspectives among analysts vary widely. Expert Predicts ‘Bitcoin Supercycle’ Ahead CryptoKaleo, another figure on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), posits that the current market mirrors conditions seen in the fall of 2020. Both scenarios involved Bitcoin losing a critical support level that had been established in the wake of significant market corrections, leading to a “mini-bart” scenario where the price retraced nearly all of its previous gains, eventually finding a new base. During the recovery phase after the COVID-19 crash in 2020, traditional stocks, particularly in the tech sector, significantly outperformed Bitcoin, leading many to claim that the leading cryptocurrency was fading into irrelevance. Related Reading: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst Today, as equities frequently reach new all-time highs, a similar narrative is emerging, with some asserting that Bitcoin has become stagnant and altcoins are lacking momentum. Despite this, CryptoKaleo remains optimistic, suggesting that the present situation does not conform to the typical four-year market cycle for the cryptocurrency. Instead of a prolonged bearish phase, he predicts that when Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs in 2026, it will usher in an exciting “supercycle,” characterized by prolonged upward trends, robust altcoin seasons, and a resurgence of retail interest in mainstream cryptocurrencies.

This is Nvidia’s biggest deal ever, beating its 2019 Mellanox purchase by nearly triple. That one was worth around $7 billion. This one comes in cash, straight from Nvidia’s growing $60.6 billion pile of cash and short-term investments. That pile was just $13.3 billion in early 2023. Now they’re spending it. Groq builds high-performance chips to run large language models faster. Their hardware helps these models complete inference tasks quickly. The company was not even up for sale when Nvidia reached out, but the deal came together fast. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, the lead investor in Groq’s most recent round, said things moved quickly. Disruptive has put over $500 million into Groq since its founding in 2016. Groq raised billions before selling and left its cloud unit behind Three months ago, Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation. That round had big names like Blackrock, Neuberger Berman, Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. And now Nvidia is buying the entire company for nearly three times that valuation. Groq is expected to inform its investors later today. But Davis said not everything is included. Nvidia is buying all of Groq’s assets, except for one thing; Groq Cloud, the company’s new cloud division. That’s staying behind and isn’t part of the purchase. The rest, though, is going under Nvidia’s belt. Groq is aiming to hit $500 million in revenue this year, thanks to insane global demand for chips that power AI is real and growing. Groq’s technology has apparently been helping companies speed up how fast AI models answer prompts and make decisions. That kind of tech is hot right now, and Nvidia clearly wanted in. Founders came from Google, and Musk had something to say Groq was founded by engineers who left Google, including CEO Jonathan Ross. He helped build Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), custom chips used by some companies instead of Nvidia’s chips. Ross and Douglas Wightman, another ex-Google engineer, were listed in Groq’s first SEC filing in 2016 when they raised $10.3 million. Wightman worked at Google’s experimental lab, Google X. Nvidia has been throwing money at the whole AI ecosystem lately. It invested in Cohere, a company building AI models, and Crusoe, which mixes AI with energy infrastructure. Nvidia also put more into CoreWeave, a cloud platform focused on AI that’s preparing for an IPO. Back in September, Nvidia also said it wanted to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI, in return, would have to use at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia’s hardware. That deal still hasn’t been finalized. In the same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel under a separate agreement. Other chip startups have been moving too. Cerebras Systems, another company in the AI space, had planned to go public this year. But in October, it backed out after raising over $1 billion in private funding. Meanwhile, Mr. Elon Musk, who owns AI startup xAI, posted on X that, “xAI will have more AI compute than everyone else combined in Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This announcement, shared by President Sadyr Japarov, signals a bold step by a sovereign nation into the mainstream crypto economy. The listing follows Kyrgyzstan’s previous advisory appointment of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, highlighting a strategic partnership aimed at fostering cryptocurrency innovation. This development is not just a listing; it’s a potential blueprint for how countries can leverage blockchain technology. What Does the KGST Listing Mean for Kyrgyzstan? The listing of the KGST, a digital token pegged 1:1 to the Kyrgyz som, provides immediate global liquidity and accessibility. For Kyrgyzstan, this move serves multiple strategic purposes. First, it modernizes the national payment infrastructure. Second, it potentially reduces the cost and time of cross-border remittances, a crucial factor for its economy. Finally, it positions the country as an innovative player in the digital asset space. Binance’s Changpeng Zhao reinforced this vision by stating he expects more state-led stablecoins to follow suit on the exchange. How Does a Fiat-Pegged Stablecoin Work? Understanding this news requires grasping the concept of a fiat-pegged stablecoin . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a stablecoin’s value is fixed to a stable asset. In KGST’s case, that asset is the Kyrgyz som. For every KGST token in circulation, the issuing authority holds an equivalent amount of som in reserve. This mechanism ensures stability. The core benefits include: Price Stability: Users are shielded from the wild price swings common in crypto. Efficient Transfers: Enables fast, low-cost digital transactions globally. Financial Inclusion: Provides digital currency access to those with internet connectivity but limited banking services. Kyrgyzstan’s Broader Crypto Strategy: Beyond the KGST The KGST listing is not an isolated event. It is part of a calculated digital asset strategy by the Kyrgyz government. Previously, the country launched USDKG, a gold-backed stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This two-pronged approach—a fiat-pegged stablecoin for domestic use and a commodity-backed one for international trade—shows sophisticated planning. Furthermore, appointing CZ as an advisor provided the technical expertise needed to navigate this complex landscape. These steps collectively demonstrate a commitment to integrating blockchain solutions at a national level. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While promising, this pioneering path comes with hurdles. Regulatory clarity, both domestically and internationally, remains a key challenge. Ensuring robust reserve audits for the KGST is critical to maintain trust. Moreover, widespread public adoption within Kyrgyzstan will require significant education and infrastructure development. However, the opportunities are transformative. If successful, Kyrgyzstan could create a more efficient financial system, attract crypto-related businesses, and set a precedent for other developing nations. The world is watching to see if this model of a national fiat-pegged stablecoin can deliver on its potential. Conclusion: A Pioneering Step in the Digital Age The listing of Kyrgyzstan’s KGST on Binance is a watershed moment. It transcends a simple cryptocurrency listing, representing a sovereign nation’s deliberate embrace of digital finance. This move could enhance financial efficiency, foster inclusion, and position Kyrgyzstan as a forward-thinking economy. As CZ predicted, more countries may now explore launching their own fiat-pegged stablecoins . The success of the KGST will depend on execution, trust, and adoption, but its launch has undoubtedly opened a new chapter in the story of money. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the KGST stablecoin? The KGST is a cryptocurrency issued by Kyrgyzstan that is pegged 1:1 to the value of the national currency, the Kyrgyz som. It is a fiat-pegged stablecoin designed for digital transactions. Where can I buy the KGST stablecoin? The KGST is now available for trading on the global cryptocurrency exchange Binance, following its official listing announced by the Kyrgyz president. How is the KGST different from USDKG? KGST is pegged to the Kyrgyz som, making it a domestic-focused fiat-pegged stablecoin . USDKG is a separate Kyrgyz stablecoin backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar, aimed at international stability. Why is Binance involved with Kyrgyzstan? Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was appointed as a cryptocurrency advisor to the Kyrgyz government. This partnership provides the country with technical expertise for its digital asset initiatives. Are state-issued stablecoins safe? Their safety depends on transparency and proper reserve management. Users must trust that the issuing authority holds sufficient fiat currency reserves to back every token in circulation. Could other countries launch similar stablecoins? Yes. Binance’s CZ has stated he expects more state-led stablecoins to list on the exchange, suggesting this could become a growing trend among nations exploring digital currency.

For cryptocurrency and tech investors watching the intersection of AI and blockchain, this deal signals where the real computational power is heading. Why Nvidia’s Groq Acquisition Changes Everything The $20 billion price tag isn’t just a number—it’s a statement. Nvidia, already the dominant force in AI chips with its GPUs becoming the industry standard, has chosen to acquire rather than compete with one of its most promising challengers. Groq’s unique technology represents a different approach to AI computation that could have threatened Nvidia’s market position. Instead, Nvidia now controls both the present and future of AI hardware. The LPU Technology That Made Groq Worth $20 Billion What makes Groq so valuable? The answer lies in their Language Processing Unit (LPU) technology. While Nvidia’s GPUs excel at parallel processing for graphics and AI training, Groq’s LPUs are specifically designed for running large language models. The company claims these chips can operate LLMs at 10 times the speed while using only one-tenth the energy of traditional solutions. Technology Primary Use Key Advantage Energy Efficiency Nvidia GPU General AI/Graphics Parallel Processing Standard Groq LPU Language Models Specialized Speed 10x Better Google TPU Tensor Operations Custom AI Acceleration How This Acquisition Reshapes the AI Chip Market The semiconductor industry has been experiencing intense competition as companies race to develop specialized AI hardware. With this acquisition, Nvidia eliminates a significant competitor while gaining access to technology that complements its existing offerings. The AI chip market now faces a more dominant Nvidia that controls multiple approaches to AI computation. Consider these immediate impacts: Market Consolidation: Nvidia strengthens its position as the undisputed leader in AI hardware Technology Integration: Potential combination of GPU and LPU technologies Developer Ecosystem: Groq’s 2 million developers now potentially within Nvidia’s ecosystem Competitive Response: How will AMD, Intel, and Google respond? The Strategic Genius Behind Nvidia’s Move Nvidia’s acquisition strategy reveals several layers of strategic thinking. First, they’re neutralizing a potential threat before it becomes too significant. Groq had already raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September and was growing rapidly. Second, they’re acquiring not just technology but talent—Groq CEO Jonathan Ross previously helped invent Google’s TPU. Third, they’re positioning themselves for the next generation of AI applications that require specialized hardware. What This Means for AI Development and Cryptocurrency For the cryptocurrency community, this acquisition has significant implications. AI and blockchain increasingly intersect in areas like decentralized AI, AI-powered trading algorithms, and computational resource markets. Nvidia’s strengthened position in AI hardware could influence: Cost and availability of AI computation for blockchain projects Development of AI-crypto hybrid applications Investment patterns in tech infrastructure supporting both sectors Regulatory attention on concentrated tech power Challenges and Integration Questions While the acquisition appears strategically brilliant, integration presents challenges. Merging different corporate cultures, technology stacks, and development philosophies requires careful management. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny is likely given the size of the deal and Nvidia’s already dominant market position. The success of this $20 billion bet depends on how well Nvidia can integrate Groq’s technology and talent while maintaining innovation momentum. Looking Ahead: The Future of Semiconductor Industry This acquisition signals a new phase in the semiconductor industry where specialization and vertical integration become increasingly important. As AI applications become more diverse and demanding, companies need hardware optimized for specific tasks. Nvidia’s move suggests they believe controlling multiple specialized approaches is better than relying on a single general-purpose architecture. The $20 billion Nvidia-Groq deal represents more than just another corporate acquisition—it’s a strategic reconfiguration of the AI hardware landscape. By bringing Groq’s LPU technology into its portfolio, Nvidia not only eliminates a competitor but gains a complementary technology that could define the next generation of AI computation. For investors and technologists watching both AI and cryptocurrency spaces, this move signals where computational power and innovation are heading.

Market expert CyrilXBT has taken to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to unravel the factors contributing to this downturn and explore the potential for a recovery rally in 2026. Altcoin Struggles CyrilXBT began his analysis by addressing the role of Bitcoin (BTC) dominance in the market. When Bitcoin’s dominance increases, capital tends to concentrate within the asset rather than exiting the broader cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Expert Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $70,000, Drawing Parallels To December 2021 Crash This indicates that Bitcoin becomes a refuge for investors seeking safety, while altcoins transform into sources of liquidity. As a result, risk compresses prior to any expansion, a pattern consistently observed in previous cycles before altcoins regain strength. Another contributing factor to the current turmoil is tax-loss harvesting. Cryptocurrencies are one of the few major asset classes that have seen declines compared to January 1st, with equities and gold demonstrating gains. To lock in losses before year-end, funds are actively selling off unprofitable altcoin positions, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other high-risk assets. CyrilXBT noted that this pressure would likely dissipate as the calendar turns to the new year. Liquidity Lag And Exhausted Demand The expert further highlighted that liquidity tends to work on a lagging basis. Although the Federal Reserve (Fed) has started to inject liquidity back into the system, markets typically do not react immediately. Historically, improvements in liquidity occur first, followed by Bitcoin stabilizing, with altcoins lagging behind. Currently, the market remains in the lag phase, not yet experiencing the anticipated breakout. With low volatility, stagnant Bitcoin prices, and declining altcoins, CyrilXBT asserts that it evokes memories of previous cycles, such as the early 2019 and early 2023 recoveries. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Structure Meets Bullish Supply Signal – What Happens Next Overall, the drop in the altcoin market can be attributed to several interconnected factors: rising Bitcoin dominance, peak tax-loss selling, thin liquidity, exhausted demand, and the delayed effects of macro liquidity. Instead of a capitulation scenario, the expert suggests that this moment appears to represent compression—a phase that frequently precedes significant recoveries.

According to S&P Global, the combined market cap of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley now stands at $2.37 trillion, up from $1.77 trillion at the end of 2024. That’s a jump of more than a third, just in under 12 months. Meanwhile, Europe’s top six banks are worth just $1 trillion together. That gap didn’t just show up out of nowhere. It’s the result of years of uneven rules. But now, with Trump rolling back post-crisis regulation, US banks are finally shaking off the chains put on after 2008. And they’re sprinting past the broader S&P 500 for the second straight year. Trump loosens rules while banks load up on excess capital Back in 2008, the financial crisis brought rules that cut deep into profits.More capital, tighter lending, and stress tests made banks boring for investors. Not anymore. Trump’s regulators have already started to allow higher leverage for the largest lenders. They’ve changed the annual stress test system that decides how much capital banks must hold. They’ve also scrapped guidance that limited risky lending. “You cannot underestimate how important this regulatory change has been to the stock prices,” said Gerard Cassidy, banking analyst at RBC. “The profitability of the industry was severely reduced because of the financial crisis because the banks had to bring on much more capital, deservedly so.” But with those rules now being scaled back, things are shifting. And the biggest players are ready. They already piled up cash expecting tougher rules under the Biden plan from 2023. Those rules, called the Basel III Endgame, are now expected to land much softer than first feared. “They’re all sitting on excess capital because they already built it up based on the other proposal,” Cassidy added. That capital is more than just safety net. It can now be used for buybacks, dividends, and growth. Banks don’t just want to hold capital anymore. They want to use it. Shares explode as investment banking and trading surge back Citigroup’s stock is up nearly 70% in 2025, the best performer of the six. The reason? A massive internal restructuring, with years of cost-cutting and simplification finally working. For the first time since 2018, Citi is now trading above the sum of its parts. Goldman Sachs isn’t far behind, with a 60% stock gain this year. The return of big investment banking deals is helping. So is a massive trading boom. Goldman hit record highs in 2025. And many expect things to speed up in 2026. Data from Crisil Coalition Greenwich shows banks are pulling in serious revenue. Equities trading is forecast to hit $92 billion, while fixed income trading could reach $163 billion, both numbers smashing past previous records. Still, not everyone is sold on the current wave of deregulation. Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised concerns about how far the changes go and what risks banks may take on next. But investors aren’t showing fear. “It’s a risk that may come up down the line,” said Saul Martinez, head of US financials equity research at HSBC. “But given how little bank balance sheets have grown, there’s the sense that there is room to take more risk.” Martinez also added, “It almost feels a little too good to be true right now. The fundamental backdrop is good. I think the question is how much of it is priced in.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

After Gnosis Chain’s controversial hard fork to recover $9.4 million from the Balancer hack Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the belief that “bugs are inevitable, you can’t make bug-free code” will stop being true in the 2030s. What did Vitalik Buterin say about coding? Vitalik Buterin has made a prediction that bug-free code will become a thing in the 2030s through an interaction on the social media platform, X. The discussion began when Gnosis Chain announced that it executed a hard fork on December 22, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The hard fork recovered $9.4 million stolen during the November 2024 Balancer exploit, which drained over $128 million across multiple blockchains. The recovery required most validators to adopt new software, and those who failed to update are facing penalties. This, of course, was met with some resistance from blockchain supporters who criticized the move because it goes against the principle of immutability. An X user with the moniker ‘colluding node’ said the real problem is how blockchain applications are built. They argued that using smart contracts in programmable virtual machines is the wrong approach. “There are only 7 contracts worth writing, and they should just be enshrined in the base layer and get security from client diversity,” the user wrote. Buterin then responded by clarifying that formally verified does not equal provably bug-free. He went further to suggest that provably bug-free code may not even be possible. “I’d even go so far as to say that ‘provably bug free’ is not possible, because ‘bug-free’ means ‘no gap between intention and code execution’, and our intention is an extremely complex object we have only limited access to.” Formal verification uses mathematical methods to check whether safety-critical systems perform correctly. The technique has been used since the 1960s in fields like aerospace engineering. When used in smart contracts, formal verification can prove that a contract’s business logic meets a predefined specification; however, despite the fact that Balancer contracts were audited 11 times, conducted by four separate security firms, a critical flaw still slipped through. Is a bug-free code future possible? Buterin proposed that the solution is multiple layers of redundancy to filter out gaps between intention and execution. He pointed to type systems as one form of redundancy, and formally verifying specific claims about code as another layer. Formal verification can detect issues such as integer underflows and overflow, re-entrancy, and poor gas optimizations that may slip past auditors and testers. Meanwhile, traditional testing can only check for the presence of errors rather than their absence. Buterin noted that some software will continue having bugs because functionality gains matter more than perfection in certain cases. But developers who prioritize security will have the tools to achieve truly bug-free code.

Leading venture capitalists have just peered into their crystal balls, naming the definitive crypto winners for 2025 and the projects that stumbled. Their insights, drawn from a recent industry podcast, provide a crucial roadmap for investors navigating the next phase of digital assets. Let’s dive into their predictions and uncover the key trends you need to watch. Who Are the Top Crypto Winners for 2025? According to experts from Pantera Capital, Hash3, and Variant, three sectors stand out as the dominant crypto winners for 2025 . Their success stems from clear regulatory paths, massive adoption, and innovative utility. First, the brokerage platform Robinhood is praised for aggressively capturing market share once regulatory uncertainty faded. Second, stablecoins are highlighted for their explosive trade volume and remarkable profitability for issuers. Finally, prediction markets are identified as the year’s fastest-growing category, attracting monumental institutional investment. Why is Robinhood a Major Winner? Regulatory clarity acted as a launchpad for Robinhood’s crypto division. The VCs noted that once the rules of the game became clearer, the user-friendly platform was perfectly positioned to onboard a wave of new retail investors. Its simple interface and trusted brand name allowed it to rapidly eat into the market share of more complex, crypto-native exchanges. This case shows how traditional finance bridges can become powerful gateways into the crypto ecosystem when legal hurdles are lowered. The Unstoppable Rise of Stablecoins If one asset class defines practical crypto adoption, it’s stablecoins. The VCs pointed to their surging trade volumes as evidence they have become the lifeblood of crypto markets. More strikingly, they highlighted the incredible efficiency of issuers like Tether, which boasts one of the highest productivity rates per employee globally. This isn’t just about trading; it’s about building a new, efficient financial infrastructure. The profitability and utility of stablecoins solidify their place among the top crypto winners for 2025 . Massive Trade Volumes: They facilitate most on-chain transactions and trading pairs. Issuer Profitability: Companies like Tether operate with stunning efficiency. Real-World Utility: They are used for payments, remittances, and as a safe haven during volatility. Prediction Markets: The Dark Horse Perhaps the most surprising entry among the crypto winners for 2025 is prediction markets. Platforms like Polymarket saw explosive growth, capped by a staggering $2 billion investment from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the NYSE. This move signals serious institutional belief in using blockchain for event-based forecasting. A year prior, Polymarket and its competitor Kalshi were valued under $1 billion, demonstrating the category’s meteoric rise. Who Were the Biggest Losers? For every winner, there is a lesson in what went wrong. The VCs were blunt in their assessment of the year’s negative impacts. Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, was named a central figure for his role in the $40 billion Terra-Luna collapse, culminating in a 15-year U.S. prison sentence. Furthermore, the previous U.S. SEC administration was criticized for its “hostile enforcement actions.” The VCs argued this politically motivated approach drove innovation and founders overseas, stifling domestic growth in the sector. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors The VC analysis offers clear signals. Success in the next cycle will favor projects with regulatory compliance, clear real-world use cases like stablecoins, and categories attracting traditional finance giants. Conversely, fraudulent schemes and adversarial regulation pose the greatest risks. The landscape is maturing, moving from pure speculation to utility and infrastructure. In conclusion, the vision from top venture capitalists paints a picture of a maturing market. The definitive crypto winners for 2025 are not just speculative tokens but foundational platforms and utilities that bridge traditional and digital finance. Robinhood’s growth, the dominance of stablecoins, and the institutional embrace of prediction markets mark a new era of pragmatic adoption. Meanwhile, the losers serve as stark reminders of the consequences of fraud and regulatory overreach. The message is clear: the future belongs to compliant, useful, and scalable innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why do VCs think Robinhood is a top crypto winner for 2025? VCs credit Robinhood’s success to its ability to capture massive market share once regulatory clarity emerged. Its user-friendly platform became a primary gateway for mainstream retail investors entering the crypto space. What makes stablecoins such a profitable sector? Stablecoins generate high profitability through transaction fees and the management of their reserve assets. Their critical role in trading, payments, and as an on-ramp creates consistent, high-volume demand. What was the major investment in prediction markets? The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the NYSE, invested $2 billion into Polymarket. This massive bet from a traditional finance giant validates the entire prediction market category. Who was named the biggest loser and why? Do Kwon was identified as a major loser due to his central role in the $40 billion Terra-Luna ecosystem collapse. He was recently sentenced to 15 years in prison in the United States. How did regulation impact the crypto winners and losers? Clear regulation helped winners like Robinhood thrive, while the VCs criticized the previous SEC administration’s “hostile” approach as politically motivated, arguing it pushed founders and innovation out of the U.S. Are these VC predictions guaranteed to happen? No, these are informed forecasts based on current trends. The crypto market is volatile, and unexpected technological, regulatory, or macroeconomic shifts can always change the trajectory.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the Bitcoin price surge has propelled BTC above the $88,000 mark, currently trading at $88,014.99 on the Binance USDT market. This breakthrough is a significant psychological milestone for investors and signals robust bullish momentum. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Surge? Several key factors are converging to fuel this impressive rally. First, increasing institutional adoption is providing a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are integrating Bitcoin into their investment products, bringing fresh capital into the ecosystem. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, continue to highlight Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. Furthermore, positive regulatory developments in major economies are reducing uncertainty and building investor confidence. The recent Bitcoin price surge is not an isolated event but appears to be supported by these fundamental shifts. Why Does Breaking $88,000 Matter? Crossing major round-number thresholds like $88,000 is crucial for market psychology. It often acts as a trigger for several market behaviors: Media Attention: Headlines generate mainstream interest, attracting new investors. Technical Breakout: It confirms the strength of the current uptrend, suggesting higher targets may be next. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): Retail investors may enter the market, adding further buying pressure. This specific Bitcoin price surge above a key level can reset market sentiment from cautious to optimistic, potentially setting the stage for the next leg up. What Should Investors Consider Now? While the momentum is undeniable, a prudent approach is essential. Volatility is inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Therefore, investors should assess their risk tolerance and avoid making decisions based solely on emotion. Consider these points: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount regularly, smoothing out entry prices. Portfolio Diversification: Avoid over-concentration in a single asset, even one as prominent as Bitcoin. Secure Storage: Ensure your BTC is held in a secure wallet, not just on an exchange. Understanding the drivers behind the Bitcoin price surge helps in forming a rational strategy rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin The breach of $88,000 opens the door to test even higher resistance levels. Market analysts will now watch to see if Bitcoin can consolidate above this new support zone. A successful hold could build a base for attempts toward the next psychological barrier at $90,000 and beyond. However, it’s wise to remember that pullbacks are a normal part of any healthy bull market. The long-term narrative for Bitcoin, centered around digital scarcity and its evolving role in the global financial system, remains the primary story for most holders. In summary, the current Bitcoin price surge past $88,000 is a powerful demonstration of the asset’s growing strength and adoption. It reflects a combination of institutional confidence, favorable macro trends, and positive market sentiment. For savvy investors, this move reinforces the importance of staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals amidst short-term price excitement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price reported in this surge? A1: According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC was trading at $88,014.99 on the Binance USDT market when it rose above $88,000. Q2: Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin after this surge? A2: Investment timing is personal and depends on your strategy. While the trend is positive, Bitcoin remains volatile. Many investors use dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to invest consistently over time, regardless of price peaks or valleys. Q3: Could the price drop back below $88,000? A3: Yes, cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. It is common for assets to test and retest new support levels after a breakout. A dip below $88,000 would not necessarily invalidate the overall bullish trend. Q4: What’s the next major price target for Bitcoin? A4: Following a break above $88,000, traders often look toward round numbers like $90,000 as the next immediate psychological target. However, targets are based on technical analysis and market sentiment, which can change rapidly. Q5: How does this surge compare to previous Bitcoin bull runs? A5> Every market cycle has unique drivers. This rally is notably characterized by significant institutional participation and ETF approvals, which were less prominent in earlier cycles, potentially providing a more stable foundation. Q6: Where can I safely track the Bitcoin price? A6> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price information.

After failing to sustain upside momentum, price action has turned increasingly fragile, with bulls struggling to defend key support levels. The structure now reflects growing weakness, reinforcing concerns that the broader market may be transitioning into a bearish phase that leaves altcoins exposed to deeper drawdowns. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details Despite the softening price action, on-chain data is sending a more nuanced signal. A recent CryptoQuant report by CryptoOnchain highlights a sharp decline in XRP exchange reserves on Binance, even as price has continued to correct. Historically, falling exchange balances suggest that fewer tokens are being held on platforms where they can be readily sold, often pointing to reduced sell-side pressure rather than aggressive distribution. This divergence between price behavior and on-chain supply dynamics is particularly notable at current levels. While XRP’s chart suggests that buyers are losing control in the short term, the contraction in exchange reserves raises questions about how much selling pressure remains if price continues to slide. In past market cycles, similar conditions have preceded periods of stabilization or relief rallies, especially when broader sentiment becomes excessively pessimistic. As XRP hovers below $1.90, the coming sessions will be decisive. Whether shrinking exchange supply can offset weakening technicals will determine if XRP finds a base or extends its decline alongside the wider altcoin market. Exchange Reserves Hit Multi-Month Low as XRP Tests Key Demand Zone On-chain data is highlighting a notable shift in XRP’s supply dynamics at a critical moment for price action. According to the XRP Ledger Exchange Reserve chart, XRP balances held on Binance have dropped sharply to around 2.66 billion XRP. This represents the lowest exchange balance recorded since July 2024, signaling a meaningful contraction in the amount of XRP readily available for sale on the market. Historically, such declines in exchange reserves are interpreted as a constructive signal. They indicate that investors and larger holders are moving tokens off exchanges into self-custody, reducing immediate sell-side liquidity. When the supply available for trading shrinks, even modest demand can have a disproportionate impact on price, creating the conditions for a potential supply-driven move. This on-chain development is unfolding as XRP trades at a technically sensitive level. Price is currently testing the major demand zone between $1.80 and $1.90, an area that has previously acted as a foundation for broader bullish structure. Momentum indicators add context, with the RSI sitting in the lower range, suggesting bearish pressure is fading, though a confirmed reversal has yet to materialize. The alignment of declining exchange supply and strong technical support strengthens the case for a potential stabilization or rebound. If buyers successfully defend the $1.80 level, reduced liquid supply could fuel a sharp recovery. However, a decisive breakdown below this zone would undermine the bullish on-chain thesis and reopen downside risk. Related Reading: Gold & Silver Break Out While Bitcoin Chops: Why Capital Is Flowing Into Precious Metals XRP Tests Long-Term Demand as Weekly Structure Weakens XRP is trading near the $1.87 level on the weekly chart, extending a prolonged corrective move that has eroded much of the bullish momentum built earlier in the cycle. After topping above the $3.40–$3.60 region, price has consistently printed lower highs and lower lows, confirming a clear shift toward a bearish medium- to long-term structure. The latest weekly candles show sustained selling pressure with limited downside wicks, suggesting weak dip-buying interest at current levels. From a trend perspective, XRP has lost its key weekly moving averages. Price is now firmly below the faster weekly average, which has rolled over and turned into resistance around the $2.40–$2.60 zone. The longer-term moving averages remain well below the current price, indicating that while the macro uptrend from prior years is technically intact, momentum has deteriorated sharply.

This region has acted as structural support in the past and now represents the last meaningful level bulls must defend to avoid a deeper breakdown. A sustained weekly close below $1.80 would significantly weaken the broader structure and expose XRP to a move toward the $1.50 area or lower. Selling activity increased during the breakdown from $2.50, while recent weeks have shown declining volume, pointing to exhaustion rather than accumulation. For XRP to regain strength, price would need to reclaim the $2.20–$2.40 region and establish acceptance above former support-turned-resistance.

After repeated failed recovery attempts, ETH remains locked in a fragile structure that reflects broader uncertainty across the crypto market. While analyst opinions remain divided on the near-term outlook, a growing majority are increasingly vocal about the risk of a broader bear market emerging in 2026, citing weakening momentum, deteriorating sentiment, and fading liquidity as key warning signs. Against this uneasy backdrop, on-chain activity has drawn renewed attention. Data tracked by Arkham shows that a high-profile Bitcoin OG — known for correctly shorting the market during the sharp sell-off on October 10 — has made a significant move involving a substantial Ethereum position. The scale and timing of this activity have not gone unnoticed, particularly given the trader’s track record and influence on market sentiment. The transaction has fueled speculation about intent. Some market participants interpret the move as a defensive repositioning amid rising downside risk, while others view it as a calculated adjustment ahead of heightened volatility. Regardless of interpretation, large transfers from well-known entities tend to carry signaling value, especially when they occur during periods of technical fragility. As Ethereum remains pinned below key resistance levels, the market is now watching closely to see whether this on-chain development foreshadows renewed selling pressure or signals a more complex shift in positioning. With sentiment already strained, the coming sessions may prove pivotal for Ethereum’s medium-term direction. Ethereum Whale Transfer Sparks Positioning Speculation On-chain data shared by Lookonchain has flagged a significant move by the so-called Bitcoin OG, a trader known for managing a massive $717 million long exposure across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The wallet associated with this entity has deposited 100,000 ETH, worth roughly $292 million, into Binance, immediately drawing attention from both investors and analysts. Given the size of the transfer and the trader’s prior market influence, the transaction is widely viewed as a potential signal rather than a routine activity. Several scenarios stand out as the most plausible explanations. The most straightforward is risk management. Moving ETH onto an exchange allows the holder to reduce exposure, either by selling spot ETH or by opening hedges through derivatives to protect an existing long portfolio amid heightened volatility. Another possibility is collateral management. Large traders often transfer assets to exchanges to support margin requirements or rebalance leverage, especially during periods of declining prices. Less bearish interpretations also remain on the table. The deposit could be part of a short-term tactical trade, enabling rapid execution without signaling an intention to fully unwind the position. In some cases, large holders move assets between custodians or exchanges for operational reasons, though the timing makes this less likely. Ultimately, the deposit does not confirm outright selling. However, it does suggest that the trader is actively managing risk. As Ethereum remains under technical pressure, markets will be watching closely to see whether this ETH transfer precedes further distribution or proves to be a temporary adjustment within a broader long-term strategy. Price Holds Long-Term Support Ethereum is trading near the $2,930 level on the weekly chart, consolidating after a sharp pullback from the $4,800–$5,000 highs set earlier in the cycle. While price remains well above long-term macro support, the recent structure reflects a clear loss of momentum. ETH has transitioned from a strong impulsive advance into a corrective phase, marked by lower highs and increasing selling pressure at key resistance zones. From a trend perspective, Ethereum is now hovering around its medium- and long-term moving averages. The loss of the faster weekly moving average signaled the start of the correction, while the price is currently testing the zone around the 200-week average, which has historically acted as a critical inflection point during major market transitions. This area is now functioning as a battleground between longer-term buyers and sellers defending prior gains. Price behavior over recent weeks suggests indecision rather than capitulation. Large downside candles have been followed by smaller-bodied candles, indicating that aggressive selling has slowed, but buyers have yet to regain control. Volume supports this interpretation, with elevated activity during the initial sell-off and more muted participation during the consolidation. Structurally, the $2,800–$3,000 range is pivotal. Holding this zone preserves Ethereum’s broader bullish market structure. A sustained breakdown below it would likely confirm a deeper corrective move, while stabilization could allow ETH to build a base before attempting to challenge higher resistance levels near $3,400 and $3,800.

Today’s Boundless price prediction suggests this sudden rally represents more of a Christmas gift than a pump-and-dump setup. Currently trading at a $27 million circulating market cap with over $90 million in trading volume, ZKC is demonstrating strong recovery signals after losing over 80% following its post-TGE decline . Boundless (ZKC) against the downtrend $ZKC popped over 15% in the last 24 hours, even after a tough 60-day stretch with a ~61% drop. The move comes as exchange issues get resolved and liquidity picks up. Price sits around $0.118–$0.13 with a market cap of 26M and volume… pic.twitter.com/qi4dFNHXBq — Web3 Parrot (@Web3_ParrotLabs) December 24, 2025 Boundless Rides the Universal Zero-Knowledge Compute Wave With the privacy meta gaining traction and numerous large investors and corporate entities seeking to integrate crypto and blockchain technology while keeping transactions shielded yet maintaining DLT transparency, Boundless ZKC is becoming increasingly attractive. Boundless (ZKC) operates as a universal zero-knowledge (ZK) compute protocol that delivers scalable, verifiable computation to any blockchain by delegating heavy computational tasks to a decentralized prover network. The project secured approximately $52-54 million in funding from prominent investors, including Blockchain Capital, Bain Capital Crypto, and Delphi Ventures. Strategic partners include the Ethereum Foundation, Wormhole, and EigenLayer. With a circulating market cap substantially below the $500 million valuation typical for projects of this caliber, the recent dip presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking utility tokens. Boundless Price Prediction: ZKC Targets $0.15 Breakout ZKC is attempting to stabilize following a prolonged downtrend, with price currently rebounding from recent lows near the $0.11 area and trading around $0.12. The broader structure still reflects bearish market conditions, but short-term price action reveals early indications of a relief move as selling pressure diminishes. The 4-hour candles suggest a minor trend shift, with higher lows forming after the latest breakdown attempt failed to extend lower. Immediate resistance sits just above the current price, while the psychologically significant $0.15 zone remains the first major barrier overhead. This level has repeatedly capped upside attempts and will likely attract sellers again. Source: TradingView A more meaningful transformation in market structure would only materialize if ZKC reclaims and maintains above the $0.20 region, which marks the prior range high and a clear bull-market reversal zone. A successful breakout there would unlock pathways toward the $0.28 area initially, with potential to extend toward the $0.33 region if momentum accumulates. RSI has rebounded sharply from oversold territory and now hovers in mid-range, indicating improving momentum without yet entering overbought conditions. This suggests capacity for further upside in the short term, but the move remains corrective unless confirmed by a break above key resistance. Overall, ZKC appears positioned for a continued bounce toward $0.15, with upside acceleration dependent on whether buyers can reclaim $0.20. Failure at resistance would likely keep price range-bound or invite another retest of the $0.11 support. Pepenode Raises $2.3M To Position for Privacy Meta Liquidity If Boundless (ZKC) explodes past $0.20 and continues its bullish rally, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) would benefit from the liquidity surge that often follows these types of pumps. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite challenging market conditions. It’s a game where you can “mine” coins without needing expensive computer equipment. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining nodes, and upgrade your facilities to earn more tokens. The project is replicating PEPE’s success strategy, which surged over 1,000x during the first privacy meta rally in 2023-24. Now that more people have started buying Pepenode’s mining rigs, the token price is expected to rise quickly. To join the presale before the price increases, go to the official Pepenode website and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet.

Michel shared his views during a recent appearance on the German financial broadcast DER AKTIONÄR TV. XRP has faced sustained selling pressure in recent weeks. At the time of Michel’s remarks, the token was trading at approximately $1.85, reflecting a decline of about 10% over the past month. While acknowledging this downturn, Michel emphasized that price action alone does not provide a complete picture of Ripple’s position. Divergence Between Market Price and Corporate Activity According to Michel, Ripple continues to advance its strategic objectives despite XRP’s subdued performance. He pointed to the company’s ongoing expansion efforts, including acquisitions , progress toward operating within regulated financial frameworks, and the development of new financial products such as stablecoins. Michel argued that Ripple’s operational momentum remains intact and that the company is strengthening its role within the digital payments and blockchain services sector. From his perspective, XRP’s current valuation does not adequately reflect these developments. He further noted that such discrepancies are common in financial markets. Asset prices, he explained, often respond to short-term sentiment, liquidity conditions, or broader macroeconomic factors, while corporate execution and adoption trends tend to unfold over longer periods. In XRP’s case, he believes market participants are currently placing insufficient weight on Ripple’s business performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Investment Highlights the Imbalance Michel also addressed the role of institutional investors, highlighting continued capital inflows into newly launched spot XRP exchange-traded products. Since November, five such ETFs have entered the market and collectively attracted approximately $1.13 billion in net inflows. Their combined assets under management now total around $1.25 billion. Despite this sustained institutional participation, XRP’s market price has not shown a corresponding upward response. Michel described this divergence as unusual but not unprecedented, suggesting that investment activity at the institutional level often precedes price adjustments rather than occurring simultaneously. In closing, Michel stated that he views XRP’s present weakness as a temporary phase rather than a structural issue. He believes the gap between Ripple’s operational progress and XRP’s market valuation may eventually narrow as investors reassess the token’s fundamentals. Although he did not provide a specific timeframe, Michel maintained that XRP’s recent decline should not be interpreted as an indication of declining business performance at Ripple, but rather as a delay in market recognition of ongoing developments.

The announcement, which used authentic Circle branding and fabricated quotes from company executives, has been confirmed as fake by the company. The platform called itself CircleMetals, a name that could confuse users into assuming it was Circle, and its offerings, which were tokenized precious metals , made it an elaborate scam arrangement, as Circle has danced around the idea of bringing metals to the market. The fraudulent release discussed a service that enabled round-the-clock swaps between USDC and purported gold tokens called GLDC and silver tokens dubbed SILC, which was backed by COMEX-linked liquidity. Users were encouraged to swap on the platform to receive rewards in a token called CIRM, which does not appear to be listed on major cryptocurrency data aggregators. Did Circle launch a tokenized gold product? The announcement used Circle’s official branding and included what appeared to be quotes from CEO Jeremy Allaire. The website, which has since been taken down, asked users to connect their digital wallets to enable swapping for the supposed precious metals tokens, something security experts widely consider a significant risk, as malicious actors can exploit this access to drain user funds. As of the time of writing, Cryptopolitan did not find any evidence to confirm that GLDC or SILC tokens exist or that any legitimate financial institution is involved with the supposed platform. Following reports of the scam, Circle warned users on X to remain vigilant, stating, “Please be alert and vigilant—verify the legitimacy of requests before taking action, especially when asked to connect your wallet. When in doubt, double-check.” It added that all major announcements about Circle products will always be posted to Circle’s main X handles and on their official website, which wasn’t the case in this controversial post. Fake Circle press release is taken down The press release was distributed via several crypto-focused public relations platforms and some reputable news outlets, which have now taken the story down, initially reported on the announcement, thinking it was actually from Circle . According to reports, a PR agency called FinaCash reached out to Chainwire to distribute the story; however, the post was removed immediately after further compliance checks, according to a Chainwire spokesperson. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning last year in December, stating that scammers were getting more sophisticated as they now use artificial intelligence in their operations to create fake profiles and employ pressure tactics to defraud Americans during the holiday period. Cryptocurrency security experts say that users should never connect wallets to unverified websites and should always verify announcements through official company channels. Get seen where it counts.

56316949,648500,1766619912,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56316949.jpeg,China’s Impact On Bitcoin Prices: Top Expert Reveals The Real Reasons Behind The Drop,https://bitcoinist.com/chinas-impact-on-bitcoin-prices-top-expert-reveals/,"Market expert Mr. Crypto Whale on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) has attributed the recent Bitcoin price drop—falling below the $90,000 mark—to key developments in China. According to this analyst, the situation has been set in motion by renewed restrictions on domestic Bitcoin mining. China’s Crackdown On Bitcoin Mining Specifically, it was reported that China has intensified its crackdown on mining activities, particularly in the Xinjiang region, where a large segment of operations was halted in December. The expert noted that this abrupt closure led to around 400,000 miners being taken offline in a very short time, reflecting a significant shake-up in the network’s mining capacity. The ramifications of this disappearance of miners are already evident in the data; the Bitcoin network’s hashrate has dropped by approximately 8%. Notably, when miners are suddenly forced offline, the immediate consequences can be severe. Revenue comes to a halt, and the costs associated with relocating operations can result in cash flow pressures. As a result, some miners are compelled to liquidate BTC holdings, contributing to sell pressure in the market. Despite these current challenges, Mr. Crypto Whale suggests that this should not be viewed as a long-term bearish signal for Bitcoin. The expert believes that this is temporary supply shock driven by policy changes rather than a decrease in demand for the cryptocurrency. Potential 60% Drop Ahead Historical patterns indicate a cyclical nature to these events: after China enacts mining crackdowns, miners are forced to shut down, the hashrate takes a hit, and Bitcoin’s price experiences volatility. However, the network typically adjusts, allowing Bitcoin to recover. In the short term, increased volatility can be anticipated. However, Mr. Crypto Whale asserts that in the long term, the fundamentals for the Bitcoin price remain intact. Technical analysis conducted by noted analyst Ali Martinez underscores the immediate focus for investors, particularly regarding the critical price level of $86,738, deemed essential to prevent a new crash. Martinez notes that historically, each time Bitcoin has fallen below the 50-week simple moving average (SMA), it has dropped, on average, by 60%. Currently, Bitcoin is trading just above that crucial threshold at $87,930. If this level is breached, Martinez’s analysis warns that the price could plummet to as low as $40,000.

This news was made public after Japarov shared an X post dated Wednesday, December 24, noting that Kyrgyzstan’s KGST stablecoin, which is linked to the som, will enable the country to enhance cross-border payments and boost its relationship with the crypto industry. CZ claims that several more stablecoins are anticipated to be listed on the exchange Following Japarov’s statement , the crypto community sparked excitement as the move marked a significant milestone in the industry. Responding to this enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, popularly known as “CZ”, commented on a social media platform that several more stablecoins backed by governments are anticipated to be listed on the exchange. Regarding Kyrgyzstan’s KGST stablecoin, sources close to the situation noted that Zhao initially began offering advice to Kyrgyzstan in April of this year. Notably, this move was part of a deal for technical backing and consulting services. After careful consideration, the Asian country decided to adopt CZ’s advice. This response indicated that Kyrgyzstan, with a population of approximately seven million individuals, is gradually shifting its attitude towards cryptocurrency, adopting a positive outlook on digital assets. To demonstrate its heightened interest in the industry, reports dated September mentioned that Kyrgyzstan developed regulations aimed at establishing a state cryptocurrency reserve. Additionally, the nation expanded its digital asset sector. Meanwhile, apart from Kyrgyzstan’s KGST stablecoin, it was confirmed that the nation also launched USDKG, a 1:1 USD-pegged, gold-backed stablecoin. Reports indicate that this token was made available on the Tron network, with an initial supply of approximately 50 million units. This upgrade drew the attention of several reports that sought an interview with officials from Kyrgyzstan. Respondingly, they hinted at their intentions to expand the stablecoin’s presence to the Ethereum blockchain. Several analysts also weighed in on the topic of discussion. They highlighted that although USD‑denominated stablecoins such as USDT , Tether’s stablecoin, and USDC, Circle’s stablecoin, contribute the highest market’s total value, several countries and economic teams have either introduced their stablecoins backed by their currencies or intend to do so. To support this claim, sources noted that JPYC, a Japanese fintech firm, reportedly launched Japan’s first legally recognized stablecoin, pegged to the yen, in October. Moreover, it introduced a platform meant to provide this token. This stablecoin, widely known as the JPYC stablecoin, is backed by bank deposits and Japanese government bonds. Its goal is to maintain a value equivalent to that of the yen. Several companies demonstrate a commitment to establishing stablecoins SBI Holdings and the Startale Group signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in December of this year, aiming to establish a regulated stablecoin pegged to the yen. Sources close to the situation mentioned that this stablecoin will be provided and redeemed by Shinsei Trust & Banking. Notably, it is set to be launched in the second quarter of 2026. Interestingly, another group of ten European banks emerged the same month and announced their plans to develop a euro-pegged stablecoin in the second half of 2026 via Qivalis, an Amsterdam-based firm. BNP Paribas alleged that this stablecoin would receive approval from the Dutch Central Bank and be created to comply with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations. In addition, the UAE telecom group e& signed a memorandum of understanding with Al Maryah Community Bank to explore the use of a dirham-pegged stablecoin specifically for consumer payments. This move was part of the UAE’s focus on regulated digital finance.

Kim, who claims to have the highest recorded IQ, shared his views on X and emphasized that people shouldn’t take his remarks as financial advice. According to Kim, XRP reaching the four-digit level would not be a near-term outcome. Instead, he described a gradual process spanning approximately ten years, placing the potential timeframe around 2035. He stressed that the projection depends on a convergence of macroeconomic and structural developments rather than conventional market cycles. Assumptions Behind the 10-Year Outlook Kim stated that several large-scale conditions would need to materialize for such a valuation to be plausible. These include a significant reallocation of global capital into digital assets, persistent inflationary pressure, and a long-term weakening of the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power. Under this scenario, he argued that nominal asset prices across multiple sectors could rise substantially, including cryptocurrencies. Update: In my view, #XRP could potentially approach $1,000 over the next 10 years. (NFA / DYOR) pic.twitter.com/fZaxmZaF1Q — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 22, 2025 His comments followed an earlier post in which he suggested XRP could reach $100 within five years. The newer projection assumes an additional tenfold increase in the five years that follow, forming the basis of the $1,000 estimate. At the time of his statements, XRP was trading near $1.87, with a circulating supply of roughly 60.57 billion tokens. At a $1,000 price level, XRP’s implied valuation would exceed $60 trillion, a figure that immediately raised concerns among market participants. Criticism Focused on Market Capitalization Several analysts and commentators questioned the feasibility of such a valuation. One prominent critic argued that a $1,000 XRP price would imply a market capitalization surpassing that of gold, calling the projection implausible under current economic realities. Kim responded to skepticism, asserting that people often misunderstand his reasoning, which requires advanced analytical thinking. His reply further fueled debate rather than easing concerns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other voices within the community pressed for clarification. Crypto commentator Zach Humphries requested a detailed explanation of how XRP could sustain a valuation of that magnitude, noting that while he remains optimistic about the asset’s future, a $100 target over the next decade would already be a significant achievement. Additional critics rejected the forecast outright, stating that long-term cryptocurrency value depends on adoption, liquidity, and real-world use cases rather than speculative timelines or extreme price targets. Similar Views Within the XRP Community Despite widespread skepticism, Kim’s outlook is not isolated. Earlier this year, Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer of CryptoCharged, stated that XRP reaching a range between $100 and $1,000 over a ten-year horizon is achievable. He disclosed that XRP represents roughly half of his personal holdings and cited its utility in global payments as a core reason for his confidence. Investor Armando Pantoja has also expressed willingness to wait a decade for a $1,000 XRP valuation. He attributes XRP’s muted performance to years of regulatory uncertainty and believes long-term adoption could eventually support higher prices. Nonetheless, critics continue to argue that a valuation of this scale raises unresolved questions about the relative positioning of XRP alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and traditional stores of value.

The latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report from CoinShares shows that the pullback was not evenly distributed. Capital rotated away from Bitcoin and Ethereum, while select altcoins like XRP and Solana continued to attract interest and inflows among institutional investors. US-Led Outflows As Regulatory Delays Weigh On Sentiment The report shows that digital asset investment products recorded $952 million in net outflows last week, which is the first negative week of trading after three weeks of consecutive inflows. CoinShares attributed the shift largely to delays surrounding the US Clarity Act . Therefore, the outflows were overwhelmingly concentrated geographically in the United States, which accounted for $990 million in withdrawals during the week. As it stands, these products are on track to end 2025 with lower net inflows compared to 2024, with total assets under management standing at $46.7 billion compared with $48.7 billion in 2024. Investor sentiment outside the US was much more resilient than expected. However, the heavy US selling was only partially offset by inflows from other regions, most notably Canada and Germany. Particularly, Canadian-listed products saw inflows of $15.6 million for the week, while crypto products based in Germany added about $46.2 million during the week. Capital Rotates From Bitcoin And Ethereum To XRP And Solana At the asset level, Ethereum experienced the largest outflows, with $555 million leaving ETH-based investment products. This deviates from the trend of Bitcoin leading inflows and outflows every week. Most of the Ethereum fund outflows were from US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs, which witnessed net outflows every day of the week last week. CoinShares noted that the Ethereum outflows are because it is currently sensitive to regulatory developments, given it has the most to gain or lose if the Clarity Act is passed into law. Even so, Ethereum’s year-to-date inflows are at $12.7 billion, well above the $5.3 billion recorded throughout last year. Bitcoin followed closely behind, posting $460 million in weekly outflows. Although Bitcoin is still leading the market in cumulative inflows for the year at roughly $27.2 billion, this figure is significantly below the $41.6 billion seen in 2024. Despite the broader risk-off tone set by Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana and XRP attracted notable inflows last week, and this supports the idea of ongoing selective institutional support. In terms of numbers Solana recorded $48.5 million in inflows last week, while XRP led the altcoin pack with $62.9 million. Spot XRP ETFs, for one, are yet to register a day of net outflows since their launch in the United States Taken together, the data from CoinShares’ latest report points to a market that is not abandoning crypto entirely but reevaluating allocations while waiting for clearer regulatory signals, particularly from the United States.",XRP|Altcoin|bitcoin|CLARITY Act|CoinShares|Ethereum|ripple|solana|spot Ethereum ETFs|Spot XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|SOL|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-25 00:00:43

History Points To October 2026, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bottom-history-october-2026-analyst/,"An analyst has explained when Bitcoin could possibly reach a bottom, based on the historical pattern followed by its price across cycles. Bitcoin Has Tended To Take 364 Days From Major Tops To Bottoms In a new thread on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about what history could hint about when Bitcoin might reach a bottom in the current cycle. “Bitcoin $BTC major cycles have followed a surprisingly consistent rhythm, both in timing and depth,” noted Martinez. Related Reading: XRP Retail Turns Fearful Again—A Classic Contrarian Setup? Below is a chart shared by the analyst that highlights some of the similarities that the last few BTC cycles have shared. As is visible in the graph, the quarterly price of Bitcoin has taken roughly 1,064 days to reach the top from the bottom of the previous bear market during the last three cycles. This is naturally assuming that the cryptocurrency’s high above $126,000 was the top for the current cycle. The distance from the top to the next bottom was also similar in the 2017 and 2021 cycles on the cryptocurrency’s quarterly chart, coming at about 364 days. “If this pattern holds, Bitcoin $BTC is now inside that 364-day correction window, which points to a potential bottom around October 2026,” explained Martinez. In the chart, the analyst has also highlighted a possible bottom target for Bitcoin, based on, once again, the pattern from the previous cycles. The 2018 bear market reached its low after a drawdown of 84.22% from the bull market top, while the 2022 bear involved a decline of 77.57%. Martinez has drawn a drawdown of 70% for the current cycle, which would put the price target at the $37,500 level. It now remains to be seen whether this cycle will follow a trajectory anything like the last cycles or if the asset will go a different direction this time around. The chart for the Bitcoin cycles is showcasing the long-term trend of the asset using its quarterly price, but what about the short-term direction? In another X post, the analyst has shared the 4-hour chart for BTC, highlighting a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming on a short scale. As displayed in the above chart, Bitcoin has potentially been following a Parallel Channel on its 4-hour price during the last few weeks. A Parallel Channel appears whenever an asset observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines, with the lower level acting as support and upper one as resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Perps Heat Up Again As Leveraged Longs Rise The cryptocurrency retested the lower line of this Parallel Channel last week, which led to a rebound as support held up. The asset has since returned to the middle zone of the pattern, suggesting there isn’t any clear bias in either direction right now. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $87,300, up 0.7% in the last seven days.

That commitment was made loud and clear when both sides reached a deal back in August. But since then, nothing about the numbers says that promise is being kept. From September through December, the EU actually spent 7% less on oil and gas from the U.S. compared to the same four-month stretch last year. This is despite the fact that the EU has taken in more U.S. liquefied natural gas during that time. This decline in spending is about prices. U.S. oil and gas prices fell, which pushed down the total value of imports. $29.6 billion. That’s how much the EU spent between September and December, based on numbers shared by Kpler, a consultancy that tracks energy shipments. And Kpler’s senior director Gillian Boccara had this explanation: “Commodity purchases were negotiated bilaterally and driven by economics, including freight costs and margins, rather than political pledges.” When asked if the $750 billion target was realistic, Gillian said, “We just can’t see the math working out.” Current levels of spending and infrastructure don’t match the deal For all of 2025 so far, EU energy imports from the U.S. are sitting at $73.7 billion. That’s not even a third of what’s needed each year to hit the $750 billion goal by 2028. Even if the EU swapped out every molecule of Russian gas with American LNG, it still wouldn’t get close. Argus Media, a firm that tracks global prices, said that would only boost annual imports to about $29 billion, or just 23% of what’s required. And to somehow reach the full target, gas prices would need to shoot up to $37.3 per mmbtu by 2028. That’s four times higher than where futures are trading now, which is around $8.2 per mmbtu, and nearly quadruple the current spot price of about $10. The last time prices hit $37.3 was in December 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered an energy crisis and forced the EU to scramble for alternatives. Even then, Gillian doesn’t think that level of value is within reach. “Even if the EU were to replace all Russian gas with U.S. supplies, it would still not be enough to triple the import value,” she said. The way she sees it, the deal looks like a way to score tariff relief, not an actual energy commitment. Long-term purchases and bottlenecks raise more questions Markets aren’t buying the dream either. With the U.S., Qatar, and Canada all expected to raise output, supply is likely to grow faster than demand. That means prices could keep dropping. There’s also growing talk about a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, which has helped cool the market even more. Martin Senior, an analyst at Argus, pointed to physical limitations as another barrier. He said the EU would need to boost its import capacity by more than 50% to handle more American energy. On the U.S. side, export infrastructure would have to more than double to keep up with that level of commitment. That means new regasification terminals, more tanks, and additional pipelines, none of which can be built overnight. So what’s the real story here? A former member of the EU Parliament who worked on energy issues said the entire agreement looked like a delay tactic. “The hour of reckoning must be postponed. And maybe the war [will be] over when the hour of reckoning comes,” said the ex-MEP. According to them, this might be less about gas and more about politics. Just stalling until Trump finishes his second term in January 2029. The European Commission claimed that it had spent €200 billion ($236 billion) on U.S. energy goods in the first 11 months of 2025. They said purchases of LNG and oil were growing, especially from the U.S., and expected total LNG imports from the U.S. to hit 70 billion cubic meters in 2025, up from 45bcm the year before. A Commission spokesperson said, “This trend will continue in the future, with at least nine new long-term contracts for U.S. LNG signed by EU buyers this year.” But no one’s quite sure how much of those future orders were already baked into the €200 billion figure. And the number also includes a separate deal with Poland, €42 billion to buy three nuclear reactors from Westinghouse for a new power plant. Nuclear fuel like uranium is technically part of the energy trade agreement, but it only makes up less than 1% of all EU imports from the U.S. Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|EU|USA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 00:22:00

The latest reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to a mere 23, solidifying a state of ‘extreme fear’ among investors. This critical gauge of market psychology has dropped another point, reflecting deepening anxiety. For anyone with skin in the crypto game, understanding this signal is not just academic—it’s essential for making informed decisions in a turbulent landscape. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional barometer. It quantifies the collective sentiment of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents paralyzing ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 signals euphoric ‘Extreme Greed.’ The current score of 23 sits deep in the red ‘Fear’ zone. This metric is not a guess; it’s a data-driven calculation from Alternative.me that analyzes multiple market factors to gauge the true mood of the crowd. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Ever wonder how this index translates chaos into a number? It synthesizes data from six key sources. This multi-factor approach prevents any single metric from skewing the result, offering a balanced view of market sentiment. Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Volume (25%): Trades and momentum. Unusual volume can signal panic or accumulation. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of crypto conversations online. Surveys (15%): Polls data from various platforms to sample investor outlook directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Monitors search interest for cryptocurrency-related terms. Therefore, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 23 is a composite signal of nervous trading, anxious chatter, and a flight to perceived safety. Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear? A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading is a double-edged sword. On one side, it highlights significant risk and potential for further downside as panic selling can fuel more decline. However, for seasoned investors, periods of extreme fear have historically presented strategic opportunities. When the crowd is fearful and selling, asset prices often disconnect from long-term fundamentals, creating potential entry points. The key is not to follow the emotion but to understand what it represents. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a market with a Crypto Fear & Greed Index this low requires a cool head and a clear plan. First, avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotion. Use this time for research and due diligence on projects with strong fundamentals. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) as a strategy to build positions gradually, reducing the impact of volatility. Finally, reassess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Ensure you are not overexposed and that your investments align with your long-term goals, not short-term market noise. Conclusion: Navigating the Storm with Clarity The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 23 is a stark reminder that markets are driven by human psychology as much as by technology. While ‘extreme fear’ dominates headlines, it also sets the stage for potential future shifts. By understanding what this index measures and the factors behind it, you can separate signal from noise. The most successful investors use tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index not as a crystal ball, but as a compass to maintain direction when the emotional seas get rough. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? A> Not by itself. It is a sentiment indicator, not a timing tool. It should be used alongside fundamental and technical analysis to inform decisions, not dictate them. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A> The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market sentiment. Q> Can the index stay in ‘extreme fear’ for a long time? A> Yes. Market sentiment can remain depressed for extended periods during bear markets or periods of high uncertainty. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is a major component (via its dominance metric), the index aims to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market through its other data sources. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A> The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me, which is its primary source. Q: Has the index been accurate in the past? A> It has been a useful contrarian indicator at major market tops (extreme greed) and bottoms (extreme fear), though past performance does not guarantee future results.

After eight years of complete inactivity, this mysterious holder deposited 400 BTC—worth a staggering $34.92 million—to the OKX exchange. This single transaction locked in a profit of over $30 million, sparking intense speculation about its motives and potential market impact. What does the awakening of such a patient giant signal for the broader cryptocurrency landscape? Who Is This Mysterious Bitcoin Whale? The transaction originated from a wallet address starting with ‘1N8x4’. Blockchain analytics platform Onchain-Lense identified this address as having been inactive since 2016. This means the Bitcoin whale acquired or mined these coins when Bitcoin was trading below $1,000. Their patience has been rewarded with an astronomical return on investment. The sheer scale of this move, from deep hibernation to a major exchange deposit, is a classic whale behavior that often precedes significant market activity. Why Would a Whale Move Funds After 8 Years? The motivations behind such a monumental move are the subject of much debate. However, several logical reasons exist for a Bitcoin whale to break dormancy: Profit-Taking: The primary reason appears to be realizing gains. With a $30.4 million profit, the holder may be seeking to cash out some holdings. Portfolio Rebalancing: The whale might be diversifying into other assets or cryptocurrencies. Estate Planning or Liquidity Needs: After nearly a decade, personal financial circumstances can change dramatically. Market Sentiment: It could be a strategic decision based on the current price level and future outlook. Depositing to an exchange like OKX is typically the first step toward selling or trading, making this a transaction worth watching closely. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market? Historically, large movements from dormant wallets can influence market sentiment. On one hand, the selling pressure from 400 BTC hitting an exchange could cause short-term price volatility. On the other hand, the story reinforces a powerful narrative: the life-changing wealth that early belief in Bitcoin has created. This event serves as a public case study in the value of long-term holding, or ‘HODLing.’ It also highlights the incredible transparency of blockchain technology, where anyone can track multi-million dollar movements in real-time. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This event is more than just a news headline; it offers actionable insights for every investor. Patience Pays: The most successful strategy for this Bitcoin whale was sheer patience over eight years. Whale Watching Matters: Monitoring large wallet movements can provide clues about potential market shifts. Secure Storage is Crucial: The ability to hold assets securely for a decade is foundational to long-term success. Have an Exit Strategy: Even the most committed holders eventually execute a plan to realize gains. In conclusion, the awakening of this Bitcoin whale is a captivating reminder of cryptocurrency’s potential. It showcases the monumental gains possible from early adoption and steadfast conviction. While the immediate market impact may be nuanced, the story powerfully underscores the transformative and transparent nature of the digital asset ecosystem. This single transaction writes a new chapter in the legend of Bitcoin’s wealth creation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘Bitcoin whale’? A: A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, enough that their transactions can potentially influence the market price. Q2: Why is a dormant wallet moving coins significant? A: It’s significant because it often signals a change in strategy by a major holder. After years of inactivity, a move to an exchange usually indicates an intent to sell, trade, or otherwise utilize the assets, which can affect supply and demand. Q3: How do we know this wallet was dormant for 8 years? A: Blockchain analysts use tools like Onchain-Lense to track the transaction history of public addresses. They can see the last time coins were moved from this specific ‘1N8x4’ address, which was in 2016. Q4: Should I be worried about Bitcoin’s price when a whale sells? A: Not necessarily. While large sell-offs can cause temporary dips, the Bitcoin market is vast and liquid. One transaction, even of this size, is often absorbed without causing a major long-term trend change. It’s one data point among many. Q5: What is OKX? A: OKX is one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, where users can trade a wide variety of digital assets, including Bitcoin. Q6: Can anyone track these whale transactions? A: Yes, that’s the power of blockchain transparency. While wallet addresses are pseudonymous (not directly linked to real-world identity), the movement of funds is public and can be tracked by anyone using a blockchain explorer.

The Altcoin Season Index, a vital gauge of market sentiment, has taken a notable dip to 17. This movement away from the critical 75 threshold suggests a powerful shift is underway. If you’re holding altcoins or considering new positions, understanding this index is crucial for navigating the coming weeks. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index, provided by CoinMarketCap, acts as a market thermometer. It measures the temperature of investor appetite for risk. Specifically, it calculates how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A score of 75 or above signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where investors are actively rotating capital into smaller, riskier assets. The current score of 17 tells a very different story. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Dropping Now? A falling Altcoin Season Index typically indicates that Bitcoin is strengthening its market dominance. This often happens during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or when investors seek the perceived safety and liquidity of the largest cryptocurrency. Several factors could be at play: Risk-Off Sentiment: Traders may be moving funds from volatile altcoins into Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETF Flows: Sustained institutional investment into Bitcoin ETFs can divert attention from altcoins. Market Cycle Position: The crypto market often moves in cycles where Bitcoin leads rallies before capital trickles down to altcoins. Therefore, monitoring the Altcoin Season Index provides a snapshot of this capital rotation in real-time. How Should Investors Interpret This Signal? An Altcoin Season Index of 17 is a clear warning sign for altcoin bulls, but it’s not a sell signal for everyone. Context is key. For long-term believers in specific altcoin projects, this may present a potential accumulation opportunity during a quieter phase. However, for short-term traders, the message is to exercise caution. The momentum currently favors Bitcoin. Chasing quick pumps in altcoins against this trend could be risky. The index suggests patience is required. Actionable Insights from the Current Altcoin Season Data So, what can you do with this information? First, review your portfolio’s balance between Bitcoin and altcoins. A low Altcoin Season Index might suggest a temporary overweight in Bitcoin is prudent. Second, use this time for research. Identify fundamentally strong altcoins that are weathering the Bitcoin-dominated phase well. These could lead the next rally when the Altcoin Season Index eventually turns. Finally, set alerts. Watch for the index to climb back above 50 as an early sign of shifting sentiment. In summary, the drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 17 is a significant data point highlighting Bitcoin’s current strength. It underscores a market phase where caution in the altcoin space is warranted. By understanding what this metric measures, investors can make more informed decisions, manage risk, and prepare for the next shift in the perpetual cycle between Bitcoin and altcoin seasons. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks whether the top 100 cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score above 75 indicates ‘altcoin season.’ Is a score of 17 bad for altcoins? A score of 17 suggests Bitcoin is significantly outperforming most altcoins. It indicates a ‘Bitcoin season,’ which can mean lower short-term returns for altcoin holders but is a normal part of market cycles. How often does the Altcoin Season Index change? The index is updated daily, reflecting the continuous 90-day performance comparison, making it a timely indicator of market momentum. Should I sell my altcoins if the index is low? Not necessarily. The index is a timing and sentiment tool. Long-term investors might see low index periods as accumulation opportunities, while traders might reduce altcoin exposure until the trend reverses. What causes the Altcoin Season Index to rise again? The index rises when a majority of altcoins begin to outperform Bitcoin again, often triggered by renewed risk appetite, positive altcoin-specific news, or Bitcoin entering a consolidation phase. Where can I check the Altcoin Season Index? You can find the Altcoin Season Index on the CoinMarketCap website under their market data or research sections.

When large assets slow down, capital does not leave the market. It moves sideways and then rotates. This pattern has repeated across many cycles. Bitcoin stalls, Ethereum consolidates, and attention begins drifting toward smaller assets with higher upside potential. That setup is forming again. Ethereum has struggled to move cleanly above the $3,000 zone. While long term conviction remains strong, short term momentum has faded. For many ETH holders, this creates a familiar question. Where does capital go next when upside feels capped? Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains one of the most important blockchains in crypto. Its market cap sits in the hundreds of billions, making it a core holding for institutions and long term investors. That scale also creates limits. To double from current levels, Ethereum would need massive new capital inflows. A 2x move would require hundreds of billions in fresh demand. For a 3x or 4x, the numbers become even larger. This does not mean ETH cannot rise, but it does mean growth is slower and more incremental. Resistance around $3,000 has become a psychological and technical barrier. Price has tested this area multiple times, yet follow through has been weak. Some analysts now model a modest upside scenario for ETH, often in the 1.3x to 1.6x range over the medium term. For investors seeking higher % returns, this pushes attention toward smaller crypto assets.. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is designed as a structured lending and borrowing protocol. Users can supply assets to earn yield, while borrowers lock collateral to access liquidity. Interest rates are defined. Collateral rules are clear. Liquidation logic is built around risk control. The protocol uses dual lending markets, allowing flexibility for different asset types. Borrowers interact with predictable loan terms. Lenders receive yield through protocol usage rather than inflation. According to official updates on X , Mutuum Finance is preparing its V1 launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. ETH and USDT are expected to be initial supported assets. For many ETH investors, this matters. It signals that MUTM is not a concept token. It is moving toward live usage. Presale Progress and Participation Trends Mutuum Finance has seen steady growth over time rather than sharp spikes. The presale began in early 2025. Since Phase 1, MUTM has surged 250%. The current Phase 6 price is $0.035. More than $19.4M has been raised, and the holder count has grown beyond 18,600 wallets. Out of the 4B total token supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to 1.82B tokens. A large share of this allocation has already been distributed. The 24 hour leaderboard highlights consistent activity instead of one time buys. This structure rewards ongoing participation and engagement. Card payments are also available, lowering friction for new entrants. These patterns often appeal to ETH investors who are used to protocols growing through usage rather than hype. Why mtTokens Matter for Long Term Holders One of the key mechanics inside Mutuum Finance is mtTokens. When users would supply assets, they would receive mtTokens that increase in value as interest accrues. These tokens are tied directly to protocol performance. mtTokens are not designed for fast flipping. They encourage longer holding periods. Yield grows through borrowing demand, not speculation. This creates a base of holders aligned with protocol health. Alongside mtTokens, Mutuum uses a buy and distribute model. A portion of protocol revenue can be used to buy MUTM from the market and distribute it to mtToken holders. This creates a feedback loop between usage and token demand. Stablecoin and Oracle Infrastructure Mutuum Finance also plans to introduce a protocol backed stablecoin. This stablecoin is designed to be supported by borrower interest rather than external minting alone. Stablecoins often increase daily usage and liquidity depth inside DeFi systems. Oracle infrastructure plays a critical role as well. Accurate price feeds are essential for lending protocols. Mutuum plans to rely on robust oracle systems, with Chainlink style data feeds and fallback mechanisms to reduce risk during volatile periods. These elements help reduce downside uncertainty, which is important for ETH investors rotating into smaller assets. Security remains one of the main concerns in DeFi crypto. Mutuum Finance has addressed this through multiple layers. A CertiK audit resulted in a 90/100 token scan score. An independent Halborn Security audit is in progress. A $50k bug bounty has also been launched to identify vulnerabilities. Risk controls inside the protocol include defined loan to value ratios, liquidation thresholds, and reserve factors based on asset volatility. These measures aim to protect lenders and maintain protocol solvency. Why ETH Investors Are Watching MUTM Ethereum holders are familiar with slow accumulation phases. Many remember ETH trading sideways for long periods before major repricing events. Similar behavior often appears in smaller protocols before broader discovery. MUTM’s current stage offers a different risk profile than ETH. It sits earlier in its lifecycle. Supply is still tightening. Usage has not gone live yet, but infrastructure is nearly ready. Some analysts outline long term scenarios where MUTM could see a 9x move if lending demand scales after V1. This is not framed as a promise. It reflects how smaller assets behave when moving from development into active usage. For ETH investors facing capped upside in the near term, Mutuum Finance represents a new crypto with asymmetric potential. As Ethereum consolidates, rotation into early stage DeFi may continue.

Bitcoin Whale Selling Has Returned To Neutral Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has talked about how the behavior of the Bitcoin whales has changed recently. “ Whales ” refer to the BTC investors who are carrying more than 1,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency in their wallet balance. At the current exchange rate, the cutoff for the cohort converts to $86.7 million, which is quite significant. The large size of their holdings can make these investors carry some degree of influence in the market. As such, the behavior of the whales can be worth keeping an eye on. There are many ways to track whale behavior, with one such being through the Realized Profit/Loss indicator. This metric measures, as its name implies, the net amount of profit or loss that the members of the group as a whole are realizing through their transactions. A positive value indicates profit-taking is dominant, while a negative one suggests realized losses outweigh profits. Whales can be divided into two subgroups, called the short-term holder (STH) or New Whales and long-term holder (LTH) or Old Whales. The former group includes the whale investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days, while the latter is made up of the whales who have been holding for longer than this period. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoQuant that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss for New and Old Whales over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss has mostly been inside the loss territory for the whales since the cryptocurrency’s price witnessed a bearish shift in October. New Whales in particular have been responsible for the majority of the loss realization, with one loss-taking spike even crossing the $600 million mark. “Realized losses from new whales significantly impacted the price drop from $124K to $84K,” noted the analytics firm. From the chart, it’s visible that loss realization from these humongous Bitcoin investors has seen a decline recently as BTC’s bearish momentum has subsided and its price has settled into a phase of consolidation. During the past week, the Realized Profit/Loss has even minimized to a neutral level for both New and Old Whales, implying the largest of hands in the market have only been shifting coins close to cost basis. Whether this suggests that the phase of whale capitulation is over only remains to be seen, but for now, these investors have indeed hit the pause button. BTC Price Bitcoin started the week with a recovery surge above $90,000, but the asset has quickly gone downhill as it’s back at $87,000.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Capitulation|Bitcoin Loss-Taking|Bitcoin New Whales|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-25 01:00:41

Some market observers have suggested that the flagship crypto will remain rangebound until next year, when its potential moment of truth will come. Related Reading: More Pain For Ethereum? Head And Shoulder Pattern Signals $2,400 Breakdown Bitcoin Takes Holiday Break On Christmas Eve Day, Bitcoin continued with its sideways trajectory, trading between the $86,000-$87,000 levels throughout the day. The cryptocurrency has been hovering within the $80,000-$94,000 levels since the late November correction, failing to break out of its one-month range despite earlier attempts. Notably, BTC’s price has been trading around the mid-zone of its range, moving between the $84,000-$90,000 levels for nearly two weeks. Analyst Ted Pillows noted that Bitcoin “is still in no trading zone,” arguing that if the price doesn’t reclaim the $90,000 resistance area, the price could risk another retest of the $84,000 support. However, if the support and resistance levels don’t break, it will continue to move within its range until the market’s momentum returns. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that December has been “a very boring month all things considered.” In an X post, he explained that there the broader crypto market had “no major narratives, no major moves. Just a lot of up days followed by down days. With alts bleeding lower in the end and BTC & ETH roughly stable.” The trader also asserted that it hasn’t been BTC’s best year despite reaching new highs this quarter. He pointed out that “this year was abysmal, especially looking at the risk adjusted returns.” Nonetheless, he noted that “during years like these, we are taking big steps towards distributing coins from OG large holders and get a more evenly spread supply. Regardless of price action in the short term, that’s always a good thing to see.” BTC To Breakout Or Breakdown In 2026? Daan affirmed that Q1 2026 will be the moment where Bitcoin can “try and prove itself” and when everyone will be closely watching the cryptocurrency’s performance to determine whether the cycle is over or not. Other market watchers have suggested two potential scenarios for BTC’s early 2026 performance. Ted Pillows highlighted that BTC appears to be mirroring its 2021-2022 fractal, which suggests that the flagship cryptocurrency is ultimately entering a bear market. Per the chart, Bitcoin saw a significant pullback after topping in late 2021. This was followed by brief recovery period at the start of 2022 before the price continued its descending trajectory. Based on this, the analyst forecasted a rally towards $100,000 at the start of 2026 before its next leg down, which could target the $60,000-$70,000 area. On the contrary, Eljaboom pointed out that BTC could be repeating its performance from the start of the year.

If history repeats, the cryptocurrency could retest the pattern’s lower boundary in the coming weeks before breaking out of the formation and potentially moving to new highs by Q2 2026. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $87,350, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) just shared a crucial insight that flips the script on conventional investing wisdom. In a recent social media post, he highlighted that successful Bitcoin buyers didn’t wait for perfect conditions or all-time highs. Instead, they made their moves when everyone else was paralyzed by fear. This counterintuitive strategy is the real secret behind building substantial crypto wealth. What Did Changpeng Zhao Actually Say About Bitcoin Buyers? CZ posed a simple yet profound question to his followers: “Have you ever regretted not buying Bitcoin before it reached its all-time high?” He didn’t leave them guessing. He provided the answer, noting that those who bought in early did so precisely when the market was drowning in Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). His message is clear: peaks are for spectators; real opportunities lie in the valleys of pessimism. This perspective challenges the emotional impulses that trap most investors. Why Do Successful Bitcoin Buyers Act Against the Crowd? The psychology of the market is a powerful force. When prices are high and news is positive, a sense of greed and urgency takes over. Conversely, when prices fall and bad news spreads, fear becomes dominant. CZ’s observation reveals that early and successful Bitcoin buyers mastered this emotional cycle. They developed the discipline to see long-term value where others saw only risk. This isn’t about luck; it’s about a calculated mindset that separates winners from the crowd. Consider these common scenarios that scare away average investors but attract savvy ones: Regulatory Crackdowns: Headlines scream about bans, causing panic selling. Market Crashes: A sharp drop of 20% or more triggers a “get out at any cost” mentality. Negative Media Narratives: Stories labeling Bitcoin as a bubble or scam create widespread doubt. How Can You Become a Smart Bitcoin Buyer Today? Understanding CZ’s lesson is one thing; applying it is another. The key is to build a strategy that operates independently of market emotions. First, focus on education, not hype. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition—its decentralized nature and finite supply. Second, adopt a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach. This means consistently investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. This method automates the process of “buying the dip” and removes emotional decision-making. Here are actionable steps to implement this mindset: Set a Plan: Define your investment goals and stick to a scheduled buying routine. Ignore the Noise: Mute sensationalist news during high volatility periods. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable wallets and exchanges to protect your purchases. The Ultimate Takeaway for Future Bitcoin Buyers Changpeng Zhao’s Christmas message was more than a greeting; it was a masterclass in investment psychology. The history of cryptocurrency shows that its greatest gains were captured by those who had the courage to be contrarian. The next time the market is gripped by FUD, remember that this very sentiment is what creates the most fertile ground for future growth. Your greatest regret may not be buying at a peak, but failing to act when fear was at its peak. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does FUD mean in cryptocurrency? FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. It describes the spread of negative, often misleading, information that causes investors to panic and sell their assets, usually driving prices down. Did CZ say to buy Bitcoin only when there’s FUD? Not exactly. He highlighted that successful early buyers often purchased during periods of FUD, not because of it, but because those periods presented lower prices amid negative sentiment. It’s a lesson in timing and psychology, not a strict buy signal. Is it too late to become a Bitcoin buyer? While Bitcoin is more established than in its early years, many analysts believe it is still in a relatively early adoption phase. The principles of buying during fear and holding for the long term remain valid for new investors. How do I avoid letting fear control my investment decisions? Create a pre-defined, written investment plan that includes your goals, entry points, and exit strategies. Automate your purchases with dollar-cost averaging. This removes emotion from the equation and enforces discipline. What’s the difference between buying during FUD and catching a falling knife? “Catching a falling knife” means trying to buy the exact bottom of a crash, which is extremely difficult. Buying during FUD is a broader strategy of accumulating assets when the overall market sentiment is negative and prices are depressed relative to their potential, without needing to pinpoint the absolute lowest price.

According to analysis from AmberCN, an address believed to be controlled by Multicoin Capital sent 30 million USDC to a known Worldcoin team address. Crucially, seven hours later, that same Multicoin-linked address received 60 million WLD tokens, valued at approximately $29.06 million. This sequence strongly points to a pre-arranged, over-the-counter transaction. OTC deals are common for large institutional players. They allow for the purchase of substantial token volumes without causing immediate price slippage on public exchanges. Therefore, this Worldcoin OTC deal suggests Multicoin sought a significant position without disrupting the open market. Why Would a Fund Like Multicoin Capital Make This Move? Multicoin Capital is known for its concentrated, thesis-driven investments in crypto. A purchase of this scale indicates a strong conviction in Worldcoin’s long-term vision, despite the project facing regulatory scrutiny and privacy debates globally. Key potential reasons for their interest include: Betting on Adoption: Belief in Worldcoin’s unique user onboarding via World ID and its potential to become a global digital identity standard. Valuation Play: Seeing current prices as an attractive entry point for a project with a high-profile backing (Tools for Humanity). Strategic Position: Acquiring a large, non-dilutive stake to potentially influence or benefit from the ecosystem’s growth. This Worldcoin OTC deal is more than a simple trade; it’s a strategic accumulation. What Are the Immediate Market Implications? While OTC trades don’t directly impact exchange order books, they send a strong signal to the market. The revelation of such a large purchase by a respected fund can influence retail and institutional sentiment. It often leads to increased scrutiny and discussion around the asset’s fundamentals. However, it’s vital to maintain perspective. Investors should consider: This is a single transaction, not a market-wide trend. The tokens may be subject to a vesting schedule, limiting immediate sell pressure. Regulatory challenges for Worldcoin remain a significant overhang. The true impact of this Worldcoin OTC deal will unfold over months, not days. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence Amidst Uncertainty Multicoin Capital’s alleged $30 million purchase is a striking development for Worldcoin. It demonstrates that sophisticated investors are willing to place major bets on the project’s future, looking beyond current controversies. This Worldcoin OTC deal highlights the growing maturity of crypto markets, where private, large-scale capital allocation plays a crucial role alongside public trading. For market watchers, it underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data for clues about institutional movement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an OTC deal in cryptocurrency? An Over-The-Counter (OTC) deal is a private transaction between two parties, executed directly without using a public exchange. This is often used for large trades to avoid affecting the market price. Why is Multicoin Capital’s purchase significant? Multicoin is a prominent crypto venture fund. A $30 million purchase signals strong institutional belief in Worldcoin’s long-term potential, which can influence broader market sentiment. Does this OTC deal guarantee a Worldcoin price increase? Not necessarily. While it is a positive signal, price depends on many factors like overall market conditions, project development, and regulatory news. OTC tokens may also be locked up for a period. How was this Worldcoin OTC deal discovered? Blockchain analysts at AmberCN tracked on-chain data, linking a transfer of 30M USDC from a suspected Multicoin address to a Worldcoin team address, followed by a receipt of 60M WLD hours later. What risks does Worldcoin still face? Worldcoin continues to navigate significant privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles regarding its biometric data collection in multiple countries, which could impact its adoption. Should I buy WLD because of this news? Investment decisions should never be based on a single piece of news. Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR), assess your risk tolerance, and understand the project’s fundamentals and challenges. Found this analysis of the major Worldcoin OTC deal insightful?

The strategy occurred after Pudgy Penguins surprised investors with a visit to the Las Vegas Sphere, a world-renowned venue for cultural events and entertainment. Some market watchers said it was an outlier in the broader sell-off. Despite investors abandoning cryptocurrencies, no-coiners came to PENGU due to branding momentum, rather than technical progress. PENGU gets noticed after the Vegas Sphere appearance At the time of publication , PENGU was trading on CoinMarketCap, with a 1.8% increase to $0.00906 over the last 24 hours. Those gains represented a marked improvement over the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other major cryptocurrencies, which saw their respective values decline over a similar period. Pudgy Penguins reported the activation of the brand in Las Vegas in its X post . The team announced in a subsequent post that the brand had gone live through the Exosphere of Sphere Vegas, the world’s largest digital exhibition space. Also, the penguin figure covered the giant dome at night. The Sphere is well-known for being one of the most advanced digital display venues in the world, visible to millions of people, whether in person or on screen, both within its walls and beyond. Crypto projects do not receive such exposure. Analysts said the show helped Pudgy Penguins break out of its niche crypto world and reach a wider audience. The heightened visibility has reignited interest in the PENGU token, despite the overall slow market. It is not the only token performing well under these conditions. Earlier, PENGU also gained during a market slowdown linked to a profile-picture trend on Coinbase , which boosted its popularity on social media. Recently, it has become one of the most popular memecoins on the Solana blockchain, thereby increasing its liquidity in that market. Brand-led campaigns lift tokens despite weak crypto markets Protocol upgrades, governance changes, or tokenomics updates did not drive the latest price move. Instead, analysts said brand exposure and social engagement were the main reasons behind the gains. Pudgy Penguins has always been about building its brand, not trying to gain clout overnight. The Las Vegas Sphere activation aligns with this tactic. The project has also evolved beyond collectibles and into products made for daily consumption. One of their initial successes was Pudgy Party, which garnered more than 750k downloads in its first week. That adoption has been so strong that some are eyeing the continued user growth of PENGU as a potential cost for pricing up in a few years. The moves came as the balance of power on the cryptocurrency exchange was beginning to shift, with the relatively low overall total market cap becoming less relevant for many — most cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap have seen a decline in their capitalizations. Other, much larger tokens — such as Solana and XRP — were also lower on the day. The CMC20 Index dropped 0.6%, a sign of the broader decline that has been endured. The Fear and Greed Index was at 27, signaling that there was little fear, meaning investors had a limited appetite for risk. However, in the present case, PENGU’s ascendant strength is integral to the rise of popular branding in crypto markets. Prices haven’t moved that much, but the Vegas glitz showed that cultural clout can trump bearish market fundamentals. Any further sustained rally would still rely on a significant market recovery and continued user engagement, analysts said. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Shiba Inu started as a low-cost experiment that many dismissed as noise. Those who entered early, however, witnessed exponential growth as community momentum, listings, and broader recognition transformed a tiny valuation into a global meme-coin powerhouse. The majority only noticed Shiba Inu after its most significant gains had already faded, turning hindsight into regret. That experience is shaping how investors now evaluate the next upcoming meme coin. Instead of chasing already-priced momentum, attention is shifting toward projects still in their earliest access phases. Apeing is emerging within this exact window, positioning itself before widespread exposure while participation remains controlled and pricing remains low. Apeing’s Rise as an Upcoming Meme Coin Before the Crowd Arrives Apeing is gaining traction as an upcoming meme coin by deliberately avoiding an open, chaotic launch. The project introduces a whitelist-only presale structure that limits early supply and prioritizes participants willing to act before attention spikes. This Apeing controlled-entry model is designed to reduce immediate selling pressure while reinforcing scarcity and long-term positioning. Rather than relying purely on hype, Apeing emphasizes staged pricing and transparent access mechanics. Presale Stage 1 is set at 0.0001, with an expected listing around 0.001. This pricing gap creates a clear early-entry advantage, allowing participants to secure exposure before public trading reshapes valuation. As awareness increases, later stages naturally become more competitive, reinforcing why Apeing is increasingly discussed as an upcoming meme coin with asymmetric potential. What Shiba Inu’s History Teaches About the Upcoming Meme Coin Cycle Shiba Inu’s ascent was not random. Its early phase was defined by low visibility, skepticism, and limited participation, conditions that historically precede the most significant upside. As adoption increased and narratives strengthened, valuation followed. Investors who entered late still saw volatility, but early participants already locked in the most dramatic gains. This pattern explains why Apeing is drawing attention as an upcoming meme coin today. The comparison is not about identical use cases or branding, but about structure and timing. Shiba Inu rewarded early conviction long before mainstream attention arrived. Apeing is attempting to recreate that early-stage environment by restricting access and emphasizing entry before exposure. Strategic Timing Over Emotion in an Upcoming Meme Coin Market Meme-coin success is rarely driven by emotion alone. The most consistent outcomes come from understanding market psychology and acting before narratives become crowded. Apeing’s design encourages that discipline by making its access rules and pricing trajectory transparent from the start. Investors assessing an upcoming meme coin like Apeing focus on presale structure, supply limitations, and listing dynamics rather than social-media noise. Early engagement reduces dependence on hype and aligns with first-mover sentiment. This strategic approach mirrors how early Shiba Inu participants positioned themselves long before headlines followed. Final Perspective: Apeing as the Next Opportunity After Shiba Inu Apeing’s emergence as an upcoming meme coin reflects a familiar cycle in crypto markets. Early access creates scarcity, scarcity fuels demand, and demand reshapes valuation once public trading begins. With presale Stage 1 priced at 0.0001 and a projected listing near 0.001, Apeing offers a structured early-entry window that many investors seek after missing prior meme-coin rallies. For those who arrived late to Shiba Inu’s rise, Apeing offers an opportunity to engage earlier rather than react later. While risk is inherent in all early-stage crypto opportunities, research aggregated by Best Crypto to Buy Now , alongside data covering Shiba Inu, and emerging meme assets, consistently shows that timing, structure, and conviction often matter more than perfect certainty. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About the Upcoming Meme Coin Apeing What was Shiba Inu’s early price like? Shiba Inu traded at extremely low valuations during its early phase, allowing early participants to capture outsized gains as adoption and visibility expanded. How can someone access Apeing early? Early access is available through the Apeing whitelist, which grants entry to presale Stage 1 at the lowest price tier. Why is Apeing considered an upcoming meme coin to watch? Apeing combines early-stage access, limited supply, and staged pricing, positioning it as an upcoming meme coin before broader market attention arrives. Why does early entry matter so much in meme coins? Early entry secures lower pricing, guaranteed allocation, and exposure before listing-driven volatility and demand expansion. Summary Apeing is gaining momentum as an upcoming meme coin by offering early whitelist access, presale Stage 1 pricing at 0.0001, and a projected listing near 0.001. Drawing structural lessons from Shiba Inu’s early rise, Apeing emphasizes timing, scarcity, and controlled participation. For investors seeking early-stage positioning rather than late-cycle hype, Apeing presents a calculated opportunity aligned with how major meme-coin stories often begin.

56321152,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254186,1766626811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Kraken’s Bold 2026 Prediction Market: A Game-Changer for Crypto Traders,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kraken-prediction-market-2026-launch/,"BitcoinWorld Kraken’s Bold 2026 Prediction Market: A Game-Changer for Crypto Traders Get ready for a seismic shift in how you interact with crypto exchanges. In a major strategic move, Kraken has announced plans to launch its own prediction market by 2026. This revelation, shared by Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s Head of Global Consumer, signals the exchange’s ambition to evolve far beyond a simple trading platform. But what exactly is a prediction market, and why is this news so pivotal for the crypto ecosystem? What is a Kraken Prediction Market and Why Does It Matter? A prediction market is a platform where users can buy and sell shares based on the outcome of future events. Think of it as trading on questions like “Will Team A win the championship?” or “Will a specific policy pass by year’s end?” The price of a share reflects the crowd’s collective probability of that event happening. By entering this arena, Kraken is not just following a trend; it’s tapping into a powerful mechanism for aggregating knowledge and hedging real-world risk. This move is part of a broader wave of institutional adoption and innovation. Therefore, Kraken is positioning itself at the forefront of a new financial frontier, aiming to provide its massive user base with tools for more sophisticated engagement. How Does Kraken’s Plan Compare to Coinbase and Gemini? Kraken is not venturing into uncharted territory alone. Its announcement follows similar reveals from giants like Coinbase and Gemini, highlighting a clear industry direction. However, each exchange will bring its unique strengths and user base to the concept. Kraken’s Reputation: Known for its robust security and wide range of altcoins, its prediction market might appeal to its existing, technically-savvy community. Market Differentiation: The specific event types, user interface, and integration with existing trading portfolios will be key areas where Kraken can distinguish its offering. Regulatory Navigation: All players, including Kraken, will face the significant challenge of operating these markets within complex global financial regulations. What Are the Potential Benefits for Crypto Users? The introduction of a prediction market by a major player like Kraken could unlock several advantages for the everyday trader and the broader market. New Utility for Crypto: It provides a compelling, real-world use case for holding cryptocurrency beyond mere speculation. Hedging and Insight: Traders can potentially hedge against personal or business risks (e.g., crypto regulation outcomes) and gain insights from the “wisdom of the crowd.” Enhanced Platform Stickiness: By offering diverse financial products, Kraken can become a one-stop-shop, increasing user engagement and loyalty. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Kraken’s 2026 Launch? Despite the exciting potential, the path to a successful 2026 launch is fraught with hurdles. Regulatory acceptance remains the most formidable obstacle. Prediction markets often brush against gambling laws in many jurisdictions. Furthermore, ensuring market integrity—preventing manipulation of real-world events for profit—will require sophisticated oversight and technology. Kraken’s ability to clearly communicate the value and legality of its new platform will be crucial for mainstream adoption. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap into the Future of Finance Kraken’s 2026 roadmap is a testament to the crypto industry’s rapid maturation. The planned prediction market is more than a new feature; it’s a strategic leap towards a more complex and integrated financial future. By leveraging blockchain’s transparency and its own established trust, Kraken has the potential to democratize access to sophisticated forecasting tools. While regulatory and technical challenges persist, this bold move underscores a transformative vision where crypto exchanges become central hubs for all forms of value-based agreement on the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What can I trade on a Kraken prediction market? A: While specific details aren’t released yet, typical prediction markets allow trading on events like sports outcomes, election results, economic indicators, and even niche pop culture events. Q2: Is this considered gambling? A: This is a key regulatory distinction. Proponents argue it’s a form of information aggregation and financial hedging. However, the legal classification will vary by country and will be a major focus for Kraken’s compliance team. Q3: How is this different from buying futures or options? A: Traditional derivatives are tied to the price of an underlying asset (like Bitcoin). A prediction market contract is tied directly to the binary outcome of a specific real-world event. Q4: Will I need KYC to use Kraken’s prediction market? A: Almost certainly. Given the regulatory scrutiny, Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures will be as strict, if not stricter, than for their standard exchange services. Q5: What cryptocurrencies will be supported? A: This is yet to be announced, but it’s logical to expect support for major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), and potentially Kraken’s own settlement layer. Q6: Why is the launch set for 2026 and not sooner? A: The timeline suggests the complexity involved. Two years allows for extensive platform development, legal review, regulatory engagement, and thorough testing to ensure a secure and compliant launch.

Analyst Predicts Further Downside Market analyst Ted Pillows pointed out on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that without a quick recovery above $3,000, Ethereum could face further downside pressures, possibly dropping toward the $2,800 range in the near term. This scenario would indicate an additional retracement of approximately 5% from its current trading price, which hovers just above $2,940. This ongoing struggle adds to the 16% decline recorded in the monthly time frame, highlighting the precarious situation for broader cryptocurrency prices. Related Reading: This Friday’s Bitcoin Options Expiry Could Shake Up The Market: What To Look Out For Another analyst, Columbus, sought to understand Ethereum’s lackluster performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC). He noted that Ethereum continues to trade below its Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), struggling to gain traction above this critical metric. The bounce observed from the $2,800 to $2,850 range appears more responsive than impulsive, in the analyst’s words, suggesting that while there are buying interests, conviction in the rally remains weak. Columbus further remarked that there is considerable liquidity layered overhead, particularly within the $3,050 to $3,250 zone. This liquidity has successfully capped any attempts to push prices higher. Unless Ethereum can reclaim this area and achieve consistent acceptance above it, upward movements are likely to be more about short-term rotations into supply rather than genuine trend continuation. On the downside, a failure to hold the $2,850 mark could expose Ethereum to deeper losses, potentially leading to a downturn toward lower liquidity levels between $2,400 and $2,700, where the bulk of liquidity is concentrated. Will Ethereum Drop To $1,300 In 2026? Looking further into the future, market expert CryptoBullet painted a more somber picture of Ethereum’s potential trajectory for 2026. He has introduced a new fractal model for Ethereum that suggests bearish outcomes for investors anticipating a bull run next year. In a social media post, CryptoBullet presented a daily chart of Ethereum, outlining key price targets and indicating that while a price recovery might occur in January and February, subsequent months could see a significant downturn. Related Reading: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst According to this analysis, Ethereum’s brief recovery could falter against existing resistance levels between $3,600 and $3,800, potentially culminating in a dramatic decline to a target price of $1,385. If this fractal model mimics Ethereum’s performance in 2022, it could signify a staggering 63% drop in value for the leading altcoin.

56322790,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254189,1766629510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tokenization Revolution: How Digital Assets Are Redefining Money Forever,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tokenization-redefines-money-kraken/,"BitcoinWorld Tokenization Revolution: How Digital Assets Are Redefining Money Forever Imagine a world where your house, your favorite stock, or even a piece of art can become as easy to send as an email. According to Kraken executive Mark Greenberg, this isn’t science fiction—it’s the imminent future of finance through tokenization . In a recent interview, he declared that the very concept of money is undergoing a radical transformation, moving beyond traditional fiat currencies. This shift promises to dismantle financial barriers that have stood for decades. What Exactly Is Tokenization and Why Does It Matter? At its core, tokenization is the process of converting rights to a real-world asset into a digital token on a blockchain. Think of it as creating a unique, secure digital certificate for ownership. Greenberg emphasizes that this technology allows nearly anything of value—from securities and real estate to intellectual property—to be stored and transferred instantly across platforms. This capability addresses a critical pain point in today’s financial systems: slow settlement times. For example, traditional stock trades can take days to fully settle. Tokenization enables immediate settlement, freeing up capital and reducing risk. Greenberg argues this will overhaul a securities infrastructure that has seen little innovation in over half a century. The implications are profound, moving us from an era of localized, slow-moving value to one of global, instant asset fluidity. How Will Tokenization Redefine Our Concept of Money? Money has historically been defined by government-issued currency. Greenberg’s vision challenges this directly. He suggests that tokenization allows any asset to function as money if it can be reliably stored and instantly transferred. This means value is no longer confined to paper bills or bank digits. Universal Liquidity: Illiquid assets like real estate can be broken into tokens, allowing fractional ownership and easier trading. Borderless Transactions: Tokens can move across global platforms without traditional banking intermediaries. Programmable Value: Smart contracts can automate complex financial agreements embedded within the tokens themselves. Therefore, the definition of money expands from ‘what a government issues’ to ‘any tokenized store of value that people trust and can exchange.’ This is the fundamental redefinition Kraken’s executive is pointing toward. What Are the Real-World Benefits and Challenges? The potential benefits of widespread tokenization are staggering. It promises greater financial inclusion, reduced costs, and unprecedented efficiency. However, the path forward isn’t without obstacles. Key Benefits: Instant Settlement: Eliminates the traditional T+2 settlement lag for securities. Fractional Ownership: Makes high-value assets accessible to more investors. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain provides a clear, immutable record of ownership and transaction history. Significant Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to classify and regulate tokenized assets. Technological Integration: Legacy financial systems need to interface with new blockchain networks. Market Adoption: Building trust and understanding among institutions and the public is crucial. Overcoming these hurdles is essential for tokenization to move from a promising concept to a foundational layer of global finance. What Does the Future Hold for Tokenized Assets? The momentum behind tokenization is building rapidly. Major financial institutions are exploring pilot projects for tokenizing bonds, funds, and private equity. Greenberg’s perspective from Kraken, a leading crypto exchange, highlights that this isn’t a niche trend but a mainstream financial evolution. Looking ahead, we can expect a hybrid financial system where tokenized versions of traditional assets coexist with native digital assets. The lines between different asset classes will blur, creating a more interconnected and efficient market. The ultimate promise is a financial ecosystem where value moves as freely as information does on the internet today. In conclusion, Mark Greenberg’s insights reveal a transformative truth: tokenization is more than a technical process—it’s a philosophical shift in what we consider money. By converting static assets into dynamic digital tokens, we are building a faster, more open, and inclusive financial future. The revolution isn’t coming; it’s already here, token by token. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a simple definition of tokenization? A: Tokenization is the process of creating a digital representation (a token) on a blockchain for a real-world asset, like real estate or a stock, enabling it to be traded and settled instantly. Q: How does tokenization differ from cryptocurrency? A: While both use blockchain, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are native digital assets. Tokenization involves creating digital tokens that are backed by and represent existing physical or financial assets. Q: Is tokenized money safe? A: Security depends on the underlying blockchain technology and custodial solutions. Blockchain offers strong cryptographic security, but users must practice safe key management and use reputable platforms. Q: Can tokenization work with current banking systems? A> Yes, but it requires integration. Many projects focus on creating bridges between traditional banking infrastructure and blockchain networks to facilitate the movement of tokenized assets. Q: What assets can be tokenized? A> Virtually any asset with clear ownership: real estate, company shares, bonds, commodities (like gold), intellectual property, and even fine art. Q: Will tokenization make banks obsolete? A> Not obsolete, but their role will evolve. Banks will likely become key players in custody, compliance, and as gateways between traditional finance and the new tokenized economy.

This BTC valuation model was created by Root using three on-chain metrics: Realized Cap, Liquid Supply, and Coin Days Destroyed. Related Reading: XRP Retail Turns Fearful Again—A Classic Contrarian Setup? First, the “Realized Cap” is a capitalization model that calculates the cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that the value of each token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In simple terms, what this indicator reflects is the amount of capital that the investors as a whole used to purchase the BTC supply. The second metric, the “Liquid Supply,” tracks the part of the BTC supply that’s held by investors who often move their coins. Basically, this is the supply that’s likely to return back into circulation, rather than being “HODL’d” Finally, the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD) measures the number of coin days being reset across the network. A “coin day” is a quantity that 1 BTC accumulates after 1 day of dormancy. When a token carrying some number of coin days is transacted, its coin days counter resets back to zero, and the coin days that it was holding are said to be “destroyed.” The CDD is useful for spotting periods where long-term holders are participating in distribution. These diamond hands hold for long spans, so they naturally accumulate a large amount of coin days, which, when destroyed, produce a spike in the CDD. Now, here is the chart for the On-chain Value Map shared by Root, which combines the data of all these Bitcoin indicators to define a few different valuation levels: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin spiked above the “overvalued” level as it set its all-time high (ATH) back in October. Since then, the cryptocurrency has notably declined, with its price returning to the level corresponding to “fair value” on the model. Related Reading: Bitcoin Perps Heat Up Again As Leveraged Longs Rise Thus, it would appear that, at least from the perspective of the On-chain Value Map, the asset is currently neither undervalued nor overvalued, but pretty much neutral. Given this trend, it remains to be seen which direction the coin will head from here. BTC Price Bitcoin has been in a phase of consolidation since its low in November, but its price hasn’t diverged much from the On-chain Value Map’s fair value during this period. Currently, it’s trading around $87,600.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.02. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $3.04 and $3.29, with an average value of $3.16. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.2649 Market Cap $513.43M Trading Volume $58.34M Circulating Supply 1.944B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2544 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2685 24-hour Low $0.2612 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.69% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3408 14-Day RSI 37.54 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.6489 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is weak but no longer accelerating downward. The coin’s critical support level lies at $0.26, while resistance is located at $0.27–$0.29. Traders can expect consolidation first, then expansion. Optimism 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for December 25, OP is trading around $0.265, firmly below the mid Bollinger band near $0.293, keeping the broader structure bearish. The coin’s price has been printing lower highs since the $0.33 rejection, and volatility has contracted, suggesting selling pressure is easing but not yet reversing. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI sits in the high-30s, slightly above oversold but still weak, while MACD remains negative and flat, indicating downside momentum has slowed rather than flipped. The lower Bollinger band around $0.247 is the key downside level. A daily close below it would likely open the door toward deeper continuation, while a reclaim of $0.29 would be the first real signal that bears are losing control. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP is ranging tightly between $0.262 and $0.27, with price capped by the Alligator’s lips and teeth around $0.267–$0.27. This alignment confirms short-term compression rather than trend expansion. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The OBV is still depressed, showing that buyers have not stepped in with conviction, and CMF remains negative, reinforcing the lack of meaningful capital inflow. While repeated defenses of the $0.26 zone reduce immediate breakdown risk, the structure still favors sellers unless price can reclaim and hold above $0.27–$0.275 with volume. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4191 SELL SMA 5 $0.3633 SELL SMA 10 $0.3392 SELL SMA 21 $0.3273 SELL SMA 50 $0.3408 SELL SMA 100 $0.4619 SELL SMA 200 $0.6489 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3103 SELL EMA 5 $0.3453 SELL EMA 10 $0.4303 SELL EMA 21 $0.5385 SELL EMA 50 $0.6242 SELL EMA 100 $0.6721 SELL EMA 200 $0.8215 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is at a decision point. A sustained break above $0.27 could trigger a relief move toward $0.29–$0.30, but failure to hold $0.26 would likely accelerate a drop toward $0.247 support. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60.

Additionally, it will impact the current method used to examine cryptocurrency activities across the EU. The EU report also highlighted that the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8), the new regulation, expands the existing EU system for partnering on tax issues to include crypto assets and related services. Under these regulations, firms responsible for offering crypto-related services, such as exchanges and brokers , are required to collect and report comprehensive data regarding all their users and transactions carried out to the national tax authorities. Afterwards, these authorities will share the data collected with other member countries of the EU. The crypto industry achieves another milestone with the announcement of DAC8 The EU’s latest tax transparency regulation has sparked heated debates in the crypto ecosystem. Following this controversy, sources noted that this change is essential in the industry because it fills a gap that earlier left some sectors of the crypto economy excluded from regular tax reporting. Therefore, with the introduction of DAC8, relevant authorities are expected to have a clearer grasp of digital assets, trades, and transfers, in the same way they have of bank accounts and stocks. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that DAC8 collaborates with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation but concentrates on various sectors. MiCA, which received approval in April 2023, establishes a unified regulatory framework for crypto-assets across the European Union, focusing on how crypto firms obtain licenses, safeguard their clients, and conduct their operations within the single market. For DAC8, it ensures tax compliance by submitting the necessary data to the authorities for examination and implementation of tax responsibilities. Additionally, while MiCA focuses on market behavior, DAC8 ensures that taxes are reported accurately. As the crypto industry awaits January 1, when this new regulation takes effect, sources familiar with the matter alluded to the transition of these crypto companies. According to the sources, these companies must update everything from their reporting systems to internal control procedures and customer checks by July 1 to comply with the new requirements. The relevant authorities have issued a warning against failing to adhere to the rules after this date. If a company fails to comply with these reporting requirements, penalties will be imposed in accordance with national laws. For individuals utilizing crypto, reports cautioned that this imposition would have severe repercussions. If, by any chance, tax authorities detect signs of tax avoidance or evasion, DAC8 permits local agencies to collaborate with counterparts in other EU member states. This partnership grants them the power to freeze or seize crypto assets related to unpaid taxes. This ability applies even if these cryptocurrencies are located outside one’s home country. Tax authorities implement strict measures to ensure tax compliance On 16 May 2023, the Council of the European Union, comprising ministers of finance from the EU’s 27 countries, gave its approval to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation. This EU Directive aims to integrate crypto asset service providers (CASPs) into the existing tax reporting system. It is worth noting that its intended purpose is to ensure that cryptocurrencies are subject to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and to enhance both the scope and quality of the information collected. The CRS is based on the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Through these guidelines, along with DAC8, the authorities have become aware that the increase in unregulated crypto assets could act as a barrier to tax transparency worldwide. Thus, the CARF and DAC8 necessitate that UK-based digital market intermediaries and other countries engaged in this area exercise robust scrutiny of their clients, gather information about transactions and transfers, and provide that information to the tax authorities. Additionally, as of the beginning of tax years starting in 2026, reports mentioned that DAC8 will need to complete filing reports. Nonetheless, Investors are not required to submit their initial report until January 31, 2027. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This dramatic event highlights the extreme volatility and high-risk nature of leveraged futures trading. If you’re active in this space, understanding what triggered this and how different assets reacted is crucial for navigating future turbulence. What Caused This Wave of Crypto Perpetuals Liquidations? Liquidations occur when a trader’s position is automatically closed by the exchange because they can no longer meet the margin requirements. This typically happens during sharp, unexpected price movements. The recent crypto perpetuals liquidations totaling $90.7 million suggest a significant market shift caught many leveraged positions off guard. While the exact catalyst can vary—from macroeconomic news to large whale movements—the result is a cascade of forced selling or buying that can amplify price swings. A Deep Dive into the $90.7M Liquidation Data Let’s break down where these massive crypto perpetuals liquidations occurred. The data reveals a fascinating and mixed picture across major tokens: Bitcoin (BTC): Saw $49.83 million in liquidations. Interestingly, the split was nearly even, with 50.98% of these being long positions (bets on the price rising). Ethereum (ETH): Recorded $30.32 million in liquidations. Here, the story was clearer, with a dominant 74.67% coming from liquidated long positions. PIPPIN: Presented a unique case with $10.59 million in liquidations. Contrary to BTC and ETH, a overwhelming 87.18% of these were short positions (bets on the price falling). This data shows that the market move was not one-directional. While BTC and ETH traders betting on price increases were hit hard, PIPPIN saw a sharp move upwards that wiped out those betting against it. How Can Traders Navigate Future Liquidation Risks? Witnessing $90.7 million vanish in crypto perpetuals liquidations is a stark reminder of the risks involved. However, you can take proactive steps to protect your capital. First, always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum risk on any trade. Second, avoid excessive leverage; while it amplifies gains, it also magnifies losses and brings liquidation closer. Third, stay informed about market sentiment and upcoming events that could trigger volatility. Managing risk is not about avoiding trades, but about surviving to trade another day. The Ripple Effect of Major Liquidations Large-scale crypto perpetuals liquidations don’t happen in a vacuum. They can create a feedback loop in the market. For example, a wave of long liquidations can lead to forced selling, which pushes the price down further, potentially triggering even more liquidations. This can lead to heightened volatility and unpredictable price action in the short term. Understanding this mechanism helps you see beyond the immediate numbers and anticipate potential market movements. Conclusion: Key Takeaways from the $90.7M Event The recent $90.7 million in crypto perpetuals liquidations serves as a powerful lesson for every market participant. It underscores the non-stop, high-stakes environment of leveraged crypto trading. The mixed data between assets like BTC/ETH and PIPPIN proves that market narratives can shift quickly and punish both bulls and bears. The ultimate takeaway is clear: rigorous risk management, continuous education, and emotional discipline are your best defenses against becoming just another statistic in the next liquidation report. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto perpetuals? Crypto perpetuals are a type of futures contract with no expiry date, allowing traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely, provided they can fund the ongoing funding rate. What does ‘liquidation’ mean in trading? Liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by the exchange when their margin balance falls below the maintenance requirement, resulting in a total loss of the margin used. Why were most ETH liquidations long positions? The high percentage of ETH long liquidations (74.67%) indicates the price of Ethereum likely fell sharply, wiping out traders who were using leverage to bet on a price increase. Why was PIPPIN different with mostly short liquidations? PIPPIN’s 87.18% short liquidations suggest its price experienced a strong upward move, surprising traders who had taken leveraged bets against it (short positions). How can I avoid being liquidated? To avoid liquidation, use conservative leverage, set stop-loss orders, constantly monitor your margin ratio, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Do liquidations affect the spot market price? Yes, large liquidations can create significant selling or buying pressure, which often spills over and increases volatility in the spot market for that cryptocurrency.

Following the meeting, lawmakers announced the finalization of one of the most active legislative sessions India has experienced in recent years. This move illustrates Modi’s commitment to introducing new measures that support the country’s rapidly expanding economy. His decision followed the parliament’s approval of plans to remove limitations on foreign direct investment in insurance and to permit private firms to gain access to the nuclear power sector. Moreover, reports noted that the government had earlier disclosed several amendments to the country’s customs duty system. Modi’s economic reforms stir up debates among individuals Modi’s government has recently implemented several measures for the country. An example included easing the complex goods and services tax system. The government also created new labor regulations. At this particular moment, the central bank encouraged banks based in India to expand their operations by issuing funding to promote mergers and acquisitions. Baijayant Panda, the national vice president and spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a political party led by Narendra Modi, decided to comment on the topic of discussion. He acknowledged that Modi frequently promotes crucial reforms during pivotal moments when the timing is perfect. Therefore, he argued that this is one of those key moments. On the other hand, analysts conducted research and discovered that India’s economy showed a firm growth trend, with an annual GDP surge of more than 8% in the latest quarter. Nonetheless, Modi pointed out that the country is facing some challenges, such as US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies , which add up to 50%. To address this issue, the prime minister announced that he would implement measures to attract the interest of international investors to India. Notably, the country is emerging as a leading manufacturing competitor to China . Modi’s statement triggered discussion among individuals. Rahul Verma, a Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi, attempted to explain the situation, mentioning that “Several factors have created a favorable environment for the government to push forward with certain economic reforms that had been on hold.” Reports from reliable sources also indicate that investors and economists have consistently urged New Delhi to reduce bureaucratic hurdles, loosen labor laws, and simplify taxes and regulations to encourage investment and promote growth in the country. Gopal Nadadur, senior vice-president at The Asia Group, agreed with this argument. He stated that tax and labor reforms, as well as the decision to make regulations easier for everyone, could reduce the overall charges and complexities faced by businesses and investors. In the meantime, reliable sources have highlighted that the overhaul of the GST, which consumed a significant amount of time to finalize, reduced the number of tax rates from four to two in an attempt to simplify India’s pricing and boost consumer spending. The reform of the labor code in India faces opposition In 2020, India introduced reforms to the labor code. However, the reform has not yet been implemented due to disapproval from trade unions and political parties. The reform’s goal was to bring the major informal sector into the formal economy, eliminate compliance burdens for some small businesses, and widen social security coverage. Pratik Gupta, chief executive of Kotak Institutional Equities, asserted that, “Moving forward, India needs to focus more on what I call ‘governance stimulus,’ which means making it easier to do business. That’s something the government has started working on in recent months.” Interestingly, India’s economic upswing has also supported Modi’s objectives, which aim to transform the country into a developed economy by 2047. With this plan in place, India will celebrate a century since attaining independence. Analysts have declared that once Modi succeeds in implementing his plans, he will secure a position among the most significant reformers in India since P.V. Narasimha Rao, widely recognized as the “Father of India’s Economic Reforms,” who successfully opened the economy to global investors. He also managed to eliminate the complicated system called the “Licence Raj” in 1991, easing government control over industries. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This wasn’t a market-wide collapse but a shocking Bitcoin flash crash on a specific trading pair that revealed hidden vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency markets. On Wednesday, Bitcoin temporarily crashed to $24,111 on Binance’s BTC/USD1 pair before miraculously recovering to $87,880, according to Wu Blockchain’s report. What Exactly Caused This Bitcoin Flash Crash? The dramatic Bitcoin flash crash occurred on Binance’s BTC/USD1 trading pair, not the more common BTC/USDT or BTC/USDC pairs. USD1 is a relatively obscure stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a firm reportedly associated with the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump. The limited liquidity of this trading pair created perfect conditions for extreme volatility. When large sell orders hit a thinly-traded market, they can trigger cascading liquidations and stop-loss orders. This creates a feedback loop where each sale pushes the price lower, forcing more automated selling. The recovery to $87,880 demonstrates this was an isolated incident rather than a fundamental shift in Bitcoin’s value. Why Should Every Crypto Investor Care? This event serves as a crucial reminder about market structure vulnerabilities. While mainstream Bitcoin pairs remained stable, this Bitcoin flash crash highlights several important lessons: Liquidity matters most : Thinly-traded pairs amplify price movements Exchange mechanics differ : Each trading pair operates independently Stablecoin variety introduces risk : Not all dollar-pegged tokens are equal Automated trading amplifies volatility : Bots can accelerate both crashes and recoveries How Do Flash Crashes Actually Happen? Understanding the mechanics behind a Bitcoin flash crash helps investors prepare for future volatility. These events typically follow a specific pattern: A large sell order enters a market with limited buy-side liquidity The initial price drop triggers stop-loss orders and liquidations Automated systems respond by selling more assets Arbitrage bots eventually recognize the price discrepancy Buying pressure returns as traders capitalize on the discount In this case, the recovery was remarkably swift because the fundamental value of Bitcoin hadn’t changed. The crash was confined to one trading pair on one exchange, allowing arbitrageurs to quickly correct the imbalance. What Can You Learn From This Market Event? Every Bitcoin flash crash teaches valuable lessons about risk management. First, diversify your trading across multiple exchanges and pairs. Second, understand that stop-loss orders can execute at unexpected prices during extreme volatility. Third, recognize that cryptocurrency markets remain fragmented, with prices sometimes varying significantly between platforms. Most importantly, this event demonstrates the resilience of Bitcoin’s broader market structure. While one pair experienced a dramatic Bitcoin flash crash , the overall ecosystem remained stable, with prices on major exchanges continuing to reflect genuine supply and demand dynamics. Protecting Yourself From Future Market Shocks After witnessing this Bitcoin flash crash , savvy investors should consider several protective measures. Avoid trading on pairs with obviously low volume. Use limit orders instead of market orders during periods of expected volatility. Monitor multiple exchanges to identify genuine price movements versus isolated incidents. Remember that while flash crashes create headlines, they often represent trading opportunities for prepared investors. The key is maintaining perspective—these events are usually technical anomalies rather than fundamental shifts in value. Frequently Asked Questions Did the Bitcoin flash crash affect all exchanges? No, this was isolated to Binance’s BTC/USD1 trading pair. Major Bitcoin pairs on other exchanges and even other pairs on Binance remained relatively stable during this event. What is USD1 stablecoin? USD1 is a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issued by World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a firm associated with the Trump family. It has significantly less adoption and liquidity compared to major stablecoins like USDT or USDC. Could this happen to other cryptocurrencies? Yes, any cryptocurrency trading pair with limited liquidity is vulnerable to flash crashes. However, major assets on high-volume pairs are less susceptible to such extreme movements. Should I avoid trading on Binance after this? Not necessarily. The issue was specific to one trading pair with particular characteristics. Major exchanges generally have robust systems, but investors should always be aware of liquidity risks on less popular pairs. How can I protect my portfolio from flash crashes? Use limit orders, avoid low-liquidity trading pairs, diversify across exchanges, and maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term volatility. Was this manipulation or a technical glitch? While the exact cause isn’t confirmed, such events typically result from large orders in illiquid markets rather than deliberate manipulation or technical failures. Share This Insight With Fellow Investors Understanding market mechanics helps everyone navigate cryptocurrency volatility more effectively. If you found this analysis of the Bitcoin flash crash helpful, share it with your network on social media. Educated investors make better decisions, and spreading knowledge strengthens the entire cryptocurrency community against unexpected market events.

Polymarket stated it is contacting the impacted users directly and explained that the flaw did not originate from its core infrastructure. Polymarket Confirms Security Breach Polymarket confirmed that a recent wave of user account breaches was caused by a vulnerability linked to a third-party authentication provider, following multiple reports of suspicious activity and drained balances across different social media platforms. Polymarket statement on Discord In a statement that was shared on its Discord channel on Tuesday, Polymarket said it identified and resolved a security issue that affected a “small number of users.” According to the platform, the flaw originated from a third-party login tool rather than Polymarket’s core infrastructure. The company said the issue has been fully remediated, there is no ongoing risk, and impacted users will be contacted directly. The disclosure came after users on Reddit and X reported unauthorized access to their accounts, with some claiming their balances were completely drained. Several users described seeing multiple failed or suspicious login attempts before their positions were closed and funds removed. One Reddit user said they noticed three login attempts overnight, despite their device and Google account showing no signs of compromise, only to later discover their Polymarket balance dropped to just $0.01. (Source: Reddit ) Speculation around the source of the vulnerability quickly spread online, with some users suggesting it may have been tied to Magic Labs, a wallet and authentication service integrated with Polymarket. One X user claimed their Polymarket wallet, which was created through Magic Labs, was drained despite never signing up via email or receiving phishing links. Polymarket did not publicly confirm which authentication provider was responsible. This is not the first time Polymarket users faced account security concerns. In late 2024, some users reported losing funds after logging into the platform through Google account authentication, which raised earlier questions about the risks associated with third-party login integrations. While Polymarket explained that the vulnerability has been fixed and that user funds are now safe, the incident renewed scrutiny of authentication methods used by crypto and prediction market platforms.",News|Security,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-25 05:00:00

Zhao joined as an advisor to Kyrgyzstan on crypto and blockchain-related developments in April. He offers infrastructural, technological support, technical expertise, and consulting services on crypto, alongside implementing educational initiatives. CZ has also “officially and unofficially” joined as an advisor to a few governments on their crypto regulatory frameworks. The Central Asian nation has a total of over 126 licensed crypto firms as of late 2025. These companies have collectively reached a total turnover of $4.2 billion, marking a new record for the industry.

Kyrgyzstan Launches USD-Pegged Stablecoin Backed by Gold Additionally, the country has also launched a US dollar–pegged stablecoin backed by physical gold. The token – USDKG – was first deployed on the Tron network with a reported initial issuance of 50 million units. The country has plans to expand the stablecoin to the Ethereum blockchain. In a separate announcement on Wednesday, Cabinet Chairman Adylbek Kasymaliev said at the Kyrgyz Parliament that the nation completed first issuance of the USDKG stablecoin. A total of 50 million tokens have been released in this initial issuance, per the Kyrgyz National News Agency Kabar . Kasymaliev also revealed that the development of KGST is underway. Besides, the government also confirmed plans to pilot a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and establish a national crypto reserve.

While Bitcoin has long been pitched as “digital gold,” 2025 tells a different story. Spot gold has surged roughly 70% year to date, while Bitcoin is down about 6%. That divergence matters. In an environment of elevated geopolitical risk, tariff uncertainty, and persistent fiscal deficits, investors clearly preferred physical hedges over crypto exposure. The narrative of Bitcoin as a reliable store of value has weakened, at least for now. Institutional Flows and Risk-Off Sentiment Macro conditions have turned decisively less supportive for Bitcoin since October. From its peak near $126,272, Bitcoin has fallen roughly 30–31% to current levels around $87,760, while gold has gained about 15–16% over the same period, rising from roughly $3,860 to near $4,480. The divergence highlights a clear rotation toward traditional hedges amid tightening liquidity and heightened macro uncertainty. Gold (XAU/USD) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The move unfolded during thin year-end liquidity and renewed trade and policy risks, amplifying volatility as leveraged crypto positions were reduced. Institutional flow data cited by Deutsche Bank shows sustained outflows from Bitcoin-linked investment products through November and December, while gold-backed ETFs continued to attract inflows. Elevated US real yields have further pressured non-yielding risk assets, reinforcing the shift. Importantly, on-chain data does not point to retail capitulation. Small-wallet distribution remains contained, suggesting the drawdown has been driven primarily by institutional rebalancing and derivatives positioning rather than panic selling. Taken together, the data signals a macro-driven repricing, leaving Bitcoin increasingly dependent on liquidity and policy shifts rather than speculative momentum. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Technical Picture From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as it’s holding in a descending channel on the 2-hour chart, capped since the rejection near $94,600. Price continues to respect the $86,500–$86,700 support zone, suggesting stabilization rather than panic selling. The 50-EMA ($87,750) is flattening, while the 100-EMA ($87,980) remains overhead resistance. This narrowing gap reflects balance rather than seller dominance. Candlestick structure shows spinning tops and small-bodied candles, reinforcing compression. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators support that view. The RSI near 52 has formed higher lows, creating a bullish divergence even as price remains range-bound. Structurally, the channel now resembles a falling wedge, a pattern that often resolves higher when selling pressure fades. Outlook and What Traders Are Watching A confirmed break above $88,800 would likely open a recovery toward $90,600, followed by $92,700. On the downside, a loss of $86,500 risks exposing $83,800, with deeper support near $81,600. Bitcoin may no longer be the market’s preferred hedge, but technical compression suggests the next move could be decisive rather than gradual. Whether that move marks renewed confidence or further repricing will shape early 2026 sentiment. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay.

In his latest X post, he stated, “When bitcoin was at its ATH, have you ever thought, ‘I wish I bought bitcoins early?’ Guess what, those who bought early did not buy at ATH, they bought when there was fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” CZ’s comments come as Bitcoin and broader crypto markets have experienced uneven sentiment in recent weeks. After lingering in “Extreme Fear ” territory for an extended period, sentiment indicators began to recover, reflecting a modest shift toward caution rather than outright optimism. The crypto community supported Zhao’s argument Several crypto community members appear to agree with CZ’s view , with one even suggesting that the same will be said about AI tokens. X user Lawrence Lanzilli also encouraged traders to buy BTC during this holiday period, stating that crypto institutions are preparing quietly for a 2026 bullish rally. He also reiterated CZ’s words, saying that “real stacks built in doubt, not euphoria.” Another X user also asserted that people are always looking for opportunities to generate revenue, adding that few are willing to deal with the nausea that comes with seizing the opportunity. He further commented, The price of being early isn’t just capital, it’s the stomach to click buy when the timeline is burning.” RWAlytics, a tokenisation insights provider based in Australia, also pointed out that most traders prefer the early, lower prices—not the fear that comes with them. Speaking in a similar vein to CZ, he stressed that conviction is born under FUD, not at record highs. In addition, another argued that the holiday lull at present will stack against 2018’s winter downturn, a quiet bear stage, which later laid the groundwork for the next big cycle. As of December 24, the cryptocurrency market remained under pressure, with a 1.1% decline in total capitalization to $3.02 trillion, despite a 24-hour trading volume of $98.49 billion. However, although cryptocurrency had seen mass losses throughout the marketplace, Bitcoin’s market cap was nearly $1.73 trillion, maintaining its dominance. Zhao had advocated for BTC traders to sell at greed and buy at maximum fear At November’s end, Zhao had sparked another debate after he shared what he thought was the key to profiting from Bitcoin’s volatile cycles. He had claimed traders should sell when optimism and greed are at their highest, and buy when fear is most intense. At the time, Bitcoin’s sentiment indicators were still fluctuating erratically between extremes. Then again, many other people supported the Binance founder’s opinion, advising investors to observe market conditions carefully rather than react emotionally. They also advocated that the strategy be used across all reliable cryptocurrencies to maximize returns. Normally, market optimism builds during upswings, whereas fear intensifies when prices fall. However, some criticised the Bitcoin enthusiast for his remarks, especially since BTC was experiencing turbulence at the time. Around the same time, Binance CEO Richard Teng had also sought to reassure BTC investors, noting that all asset classes experience cycles and volatility. He added that some risk-off behavior and deleveraging were affecting the cryptocurrency market at the time. In another X post in September, CZ had warned that most investors panic-sell BTC because they don’t fully grasp technology, finance, or global trends. He cautioned that relying on recommendations to buy Bitcoin won’t give investors the confidence to hold Bitcoin during turbulent periods. Thus, he urged traders to educate themselves more on technology, finance, and market trends, to gain enough confidence to resist selling during a downturn and hold onto Bitcoin for its long-term prospects.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use.

The 4-hour chart shows early accumulation and a relief bounce. FLOKI’s key support lies at $0.00000365. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the daily chart for December 25, FLOKI is trading around $0.00000406, holding just above the lower Bollinger band near $0.00000366 after a prolonged decline from the $0.0000050–$0.0000052 region. The price remains well below the mid-band around $0.00000437, confirming that the broader daily trend is still bearish. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView However, the recent candles show reduced downside follow-through. RSI is hovering around 38, slightly off oversold territory, signaling selling pressure is cooling rather than reversing. The MACD remains negative and flat, which supports the idea of stabilization rather than a trend shift. The key risk level is a daily close below $0.00000365, while a reclaim of $0.00000435–$0.00000440 would be the first sign of structural improvement. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4H timeframe, FLOKI has bounced from the $0.00000390–$0.00000395 zone and is now pressing into resistance around $0.00000405–$0.00000410, where the Alligator averages cluster. This move is supported by a rising OBV and a slightly positive CMF, suggesting early capital inflow and short-term accumulation. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView However, price is still capped below the longer-term moving average near $0.00000435, keeping the rally corrective for now. A close above $0.00000410 could extend the bounce toward $0.00000430–$0.00000440, while rejection here risks another rotation back toward $0.00000390.

Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

This persistent withdrawal pattern raises important questions about institutional sentiment and market stability during the holiday season. According to data from TraderT, not a single ETF managed to attract net inflows, indicating a broad-based shift in investor behavior that demands closer examination. What Do the Bitcoin Spot ETF Outflow Numbers Reveal? The December 24th data reveals a comprehensive withdrawal across major funds. BlackRock’s IBIT led the outflows with $91.4 million, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC at $24.6 million and Fidelity’s FBTC at $17.2 million. Other significant withdrawals included Bitwise’s BITB ($13.3M), Ark Invest’s ARKB ($9.9M), VanEck’s HODL ($8M), Grayscale’s Mini BTC ($5.8M), and Franklin’s EZBC ($5.1M). This widespread pattern suggests the outflows represent more than isolated profit-taking—they indicate a broader sentiment shift affecting the entire Bitcoin spot ETFs sector. Why Are Investors Pulling Money from Bitcoin Spot ETFs? Several factors could explain this sustained withdrawal pattern. First, year-end portfolio rebalancing often leads institutional investors to lock in profits or reduce exposure to volatile assets. Second, the holiday season typically sees reduced trading activity, which can amplify the impact of any withdrawals. Third, broader market conditions and Bitcoin’s price consolidation may have prompted some investors to temporarily reduce their positions in Bitcoin spot ETFs while awaiting clearer directional signals. Market analysts note that despite these outflows, the overall picture for Bitcoin spot ETFs remains relatively strong since their launch. However, five consecutive days of withdrawals represent the longest such streak since these products gained approval, making this development particularly noteworthy for market observers. How Do These Outflows Impact the Broader Bitcoin Market? The consistent outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs create several important implications: Price pressure : Sustained ETF selling can create downward pressure on Bitcoin prices as fund managers sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemption requests Sentiment indicator : Institutional flows often serve as a sentiment barometer, and prolonged outflows may signal caution among professional investors Liquidity considerations : While current outflows represent a small percentage of total assets under management, extended patterns could affect market liquidity Retail investor influence : As institutions pull back, retail investor behavior becomes increasingly important for price support It’s crucial to maintain perspective, however. The total assets under management for U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs remain substantial, and five days of outflows don’t necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal. Many analysts view this as a healthy consolidation after significant earlier inflows. What Should Investors Watch Next with Bitcoin Spot ETFs? Moving forward, market participants should monitor several key developments. First, watch whether the outflow pattern continues into the new year or reverses as institutional investors return from holiday breaks. Second, observe how Bitcoin’s price responds to these fund flows—sometimes markets anticipate such movements, while other times they react with a delay. Third, pay attention to any statements from major ETF providers about their investor base and redemption patterns. Historical context matters here. Previous periods of Bitcoin spot ETFs outflows have often preceded consolidation phases rather than major downturns. The fundamental case for Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles remains intact, and many analysts expect inflows to resume once short-term factors like year-end rebalancing conclude. Conclusion: Putting Bitcoin Spot ETF Flows in Perspective The fifth consecutive day of outflows from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs warrants attention but not alarm. While $175.3 million in withdrawals represents a meaningful shift in short-term sentiment, it occurs within the context of holiday-thinned trading and year-end portfolio adjustments. The broader adoption story for Bitcoin investment vehicles remains compelling, and these flows represent normal market dynamics rather than structural concerns. Investors should view this development as part of the natural ebb and flow of capital in emerging asset classes rather than a fundamental deterioration in the Bitcoin investment thesis. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly buying or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are Bitcoin spot ETFs experiencing outflows? The outflows likely result from year-end portfolio rebalancing, holiday season reduced activity, and some profit-taking after previous gains. This represents normal market behavior rather than a fundamental problem. Should I be worried about investing in Bitcoin spot ETFs? Not necessarily. Short-term outflows are common in all investment vehicles. The key is to focus on long-term adoption trends rather than daily or weekly flow data. Which Bitcoin spot ETF saw the largest outflow? On December 24th, BlackRock’s IBIT experienced the largest single outflow at $91.4 million, though as a percentage of assets, other funds saw similar relative withdrawals. Will these outflows continue into the new year? While impossible to predict with certainty, many analysts expect flows to normalize after the holiday season and year-end rebalancing concludes in early January. How do ETF outflows affect Bitcoin’s price? ETF outflows can create selling pressure as fund managers sell Bitcoin to meet redemptions. However, many other factors also influence Bitcoin’s price, including broader market sentiment and macroeconomic conditions. Found this analysis helpful?

This pattern suggests shifting institutional sentiment toward Ethereum investment vehicles during the holiday season. According to data from Farside Investors, this marks a significant reversal from earlier periods of steady inflows into these products. What’s Driving the US Ethereum Spot ETFs Exodus? The recent outflows from US Ethereum spot ETFs reveal specific patterns worth examining. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) led the withdrawals with $33.8 million flowing out, while BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) followed with $22.3 million in net outflows. The remaining Ethereum ETFs in the US market reported no significant activity for the day, indicating the movement is concentrated among the largest players. Several factors could explain this trend: Year-end portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors Profit-taking after recent Ethereum price movements Market uncertainty surrounding regulatory developments Liquidity needs during the holiday season How Do These US Ethereum Spot ETFs Outflows Compare Historically? When we examine the broader context, the two-day outflow pattern for US Ethereum spot ETFs represents a notable shift. These products had generally seen net positive inflows since their launch, making this reversal particularly significant. The timing during the holiday week adds another layer of complexity, as trading volumes typically decrease during this period. The concentration of outflows in just two major funds suggests this isn’t a broad-based rejection of Ethereum exposure. Instead, it may reflect specific strategies or needs of large institutional holders in those particular US Ethereum spot ETFs. Market analysts will be watching closely to see if this trend continues into the new year or represents temporary year-end adjustments. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? For individual Ethereum investors, the outflows from US Ethereum spot ETFs provide important signals about institutional sentiment. While two days don’t establish a long-term trend, they do indicate that some large players are reducing their Ethereum exposure through these regulated vehicles. This doesn’t necessarily reflect bearishness on Ethereum itself, but rather specific decisions about ETF holdings. Consider these implications: Price pressure could result if outflows continue Liquidity dynamics in the underlying market may change Future ETF approvals could be influenced by demand patterns Arbitrage opportunities might emerge between spot and futures markets Will US Ethereum Spot ETFs Rebound in 2024? The future trajectory of US Ethereum spot ETFs depends on multiple factors. Regulatory clarity, Ethereum network developments, and broader cryptocurrency market trends will all influence whether these products return to net inflows. The upcoming Ethereum network upgrades and potential spot Ethereum ETF approvals from additional providers could reignite institutional interest. Market participants should monitor several key indicators: Daily flow data from all US Ethereum spot ETFs Ethereum’s price action relative to Bitcoin Regulatory announcements from the SEC Institutional commentary on cryptocurrency allocation In conclusion, the recent outflows from US Ethereum spot ETFs serve as a reminder that institutional cryptocurrency investment remains dynamic and sometimes volatile. While two days of withdrawals don’t constitute a trend reversal, they warrant attention from both retail and institutional market participants. The coming weeks will reveal whether this represents temporary year-end positioning or a more sustained shift in sentiment toward these innovative investment vehicles. Frequently Asked Questions What are US Ethereum spot ETFs? US Ethereum spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH price movements without directly purchasing or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are investors pulling money from these ETFs? Possible reasons include year-end portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking after price gains, regulatory uncertainty, or specific liquidity needs during the holiday period. Which Ethereum ETF saw the largest outflows? Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) experienced the largest single-day outflow at $33.8 million on December 24th. Should I be concerned about my Ethereum investments? Two days of ETF outflows don’t necessarily indicate broader market problems. Monitor the trend over several weeks and consider your individual investment horizon and strategy. How can I track these ETF flows myself? Data providers like Farside Investors, Bloomberg, and various cryptocurrency analytics platforms regularly publish ETF flow information for free or through subscription services. Will this affect Ethereum’s price? Large ETF outflows can create selling pressure on the underlying asset, but many other factors also influence Ethereum’s price, including overall market sentiment, network activity, and macroeconomic conditions.

Here’s What Is Happening Behind the Scene,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-dont-panic-sell-xrp-under-2-heres-what-is-happening-behind-the-scene/,"At a time when uncertainty dominates sentiment across digital asset markets, Nick Anderson, founder of Bullrunners and Altcoin Pro, is urging observers to look beyond short-term price action in XRP. In his recent commentary , Anderson addresses the sharp decline that has taken XRP below the $2 level, a significant drop from the highs seen earlier in the year. According to him, fear has become widespread, with many holders questioning whether to exit their positions. Yet, he argues that while attention remains fixed on price weakness, several major institutional developments are unfolding that could reshape the asset’s outlook. DON'T Panic Sell #XRP Under $2 Here's What's Happening Behind The Scenes For Ripple XRP pic.twitter.com/dBY7wAgOWZ — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) December 22, 2025 ETF Growth Signals Institutional Demand A central point in Anderson’s analysis is the rapid expansion of XRP exchange-traded funds . He reports that these products have surpassed one billion dollars in assets under management, reaching the milestone faster than any crypto ETF outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Funds from firms such as Canary Capital, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton are accumulating XRP daily. Anderson emphasizes that these ETFs are physically backed, meaning actual XRP must be purchased to support each share issued. He interprets continued inflows during a period of declining prices as evidence that large institutions are positioning for the long term rather than reacting to short-term volatility. He also notes that additional ETF approvals are expected, which could further increase demand. At the same time, he points to data suggesting that more than a billion XRP have recently moved off exchanges, potentially tightening available supply. Banks Cleared to Facilitate XRP Access Anderson highlights a regulatory development involving the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which has cleared national banks to facilitate XRP trades as riskless principal transactions. In practical terms, this enables major banks to allow customers to buy and sell XRP directly through banking platforms without holding the asset themselves. He argues that this decision opens access to millions of potential users who may be reluctant to engage with crypto exchanges. From his perspective, banks would not invest in building such infrastructure without anticipating future demand from both retail and institutional clients. Ripple’s Strategy and Infrastructure Expansion Another pillar of Anderson’s commentary focuses on Ripple’s ongoing initiatives. He notes that the company has applied for a U.S. bank charter, a move that could integrate its operations more deeply into the regulated financial system. He also references recent billion-dollar acquisitions aimed at strengthening institutional trading and corporate payment capabilities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anderson further discusses Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, describing it as a product designed to meet institutional preferences for stability. In his view, while stablecoins may serve as the user-facing instrument, XRP remains essential as the bridge asset enabling efficient movement of value across currencies and regions, including emerging markets in Africa and the Middle East. A Cautious Outlook Amid Improving Fundamentals While Anderson stops short of offering guarantees, he frames the current environment as one where fear among retail participants contrasts sharply with infrastructure building and accumulation by institutions. He acknowledges that XRP could remain volatile or trend lower in the near term due to broader market conditions. However, he maintains that historically, periods marked by high fear alongside strong fundamental development have often preceded major shifts.

This colossal transaction, originating from an unknown wallet, is valued at approximately $300 million and immediately raises critical questions. What does such a significant movement of a major stablecoin signify for the broader market? Let’s dive into the implications of this major USDC transfer to Binance . What Does a 300 Million USDC Transfer to Binance Mean? When a sum this large moves, it’s rarely without purpose. A USDC transfer to Binance of this magnitude typically indicates one of several high-stakes strategies. The sender, often called a ‘whale’ in crypto parlance, could be preparing for a major trade, seeking to provide liquidity, or even moving funds for safekeeping. However, the ‘unknown wallet’ origin adds a layer of mystery and market suspense. This single transaction highlights the sheer scale at which institutional and large-scale players operate, often influencing market sentiment with their actions. Why Are Whale Movements So Important? Tracking whale wallets is a crucial part of crypto market analysis. Large transfers act as leading indicators. For instance, a major USDC transfer to Binance often precedes significant buying or selling pressure on other assets. Here’s why analysts watch these moves closely: Market Sentiment: A deposit to an exchange can signal an intent to trade, potentially moving prices. Liquidity Signals: It can indicate where large pools of capital are being positioned. Stablecoin Health: Massive movements of USDC demonstrate its active use and liquidity within the ecosystem. Exchange Dynamics: It shows Binance’s role as a primary liquidity hub for major players. Therefore, this isn’t just a transaction; it’s a data point with potential consequences for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin markets. Could This Impact USDC and Crypto Market Stability? Stablecoins like USDC are the lifeblood of the crypto trading ecosystem, acting as a digital dollar. A USDC transfer to Binance worth $300 million tests the infrastructure’s resilience but also confirms its strength. It seamlessly moved across the blockchain, showcasing the efficiency of modern finance. For market stability, such movements are a double-edged sword. On one hand, they prove deep liquidity exists. On the other, concentrated movements can cause temporary price slippage or spark speculation. The key takeaway is that the system handled a nine-figure transfer without a hitch, reinforcing confidence in the underlying technology. What Should Everyday Investors Take From This? For the average crypto enthusiast, this news is more about education than immediate action. It underscores several vital lessons: Transparency: Blockchain allows anyone to see these transactions, promoting a level of market transparency unheard of in traditional finance. Scale: The crypto market operates at an institutional scale, with real capital constantly in motion. Due Diligence: Major movements can create narratives. It’s essential to separate fact from speculation and not make impulsive decisions based on a single data point. While you may not be moving 300 million USDC, understanding why others do makes you a more informed participant. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The recent 300 million USDC transfer to Binance is a powerful reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s maturity and dynamism. It was a clean, efficient movement of significant value that highlights the operational scale of stablecoins and major exchanges. While its exact intent remains shrouded in the anonymity of an unknown wallet, its occurrence is a normal function of a deep and liquid market. Rather than a cause for alarm, it should be seen as a sign of a robust, functioning digital asset ecosystem where large players actively manage their portfolios. The true impact will unfold in the market’s subsequent price action and liquidity flows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Why would someone transfer 300 million USDC to an exchange? Primary reasons include preparing to purchase other cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), converting to fiat currency, providing liquidity for trading pairs, or simply moving funds between custodial solutions. Does a large USDC transfer mean the price of Bitcoin will change? Not necessarily. It indicates potential for action. The price impact depends on if and how the whale uses those funds to trade on the exchange. Is my USDC safe if whales are moving such large amounts? Yes. This transaction demonstrates the network’s capability. USDC’s stability is backed by reserves, and the transfer itself is just a change of wallet address on the blockchain, not a risk to the asset’s backing. How can I track large transactions like this? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based assets (like USDC) or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which posts major transactions in real-time. What is the difference between USDC and other stablecoins like USDT? Both are dollar-pegged stablecoins, but they are issued by different companies (Centre Consortium for USDC, Tether for USDT) and have differing transparency reports on their reserve holdings. Both are widely used for trading. Found this analysis of the major USDC transfer insightful?

The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across major exchanges reveals the ongoing tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces. This data, often a leading indicator, helps us gauge whether the crowd is leaning towards buying or selling pressure. Let’s dive into the numbers and uncover what they might mean for Bitcoin’s next move. What Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Tell Us? The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is a vital sentiment gauge. It shows the percentage of open positions betting on a price increase (longs) versus those betting on a decline (shorts) on perpetual futures contracts. Unlike traditional futures, these contracts have no expiry date. Therefore, a ratio above 50% indicates more traders are bullish, while below 50% suggests a bearish tilt. However, extreme readings can sometimes signal a contrarian opportunity, as overly crowded trades often reverse. Breaking Down the December 25th Data: Exchange by Exchange The aggregate data for December 25th shows a market in near-perfect equilibrium, but a closer look at individual exchanges reveals subtle differences in trader positioning. Overall Market: Long 50.19% / Short 49.81% Binance: Long 50.08% / Short 49.92% OKX: Long 50.29% / Short 49.71% Bybit: Long 51.01% / Short 48.99% This breakdown is essential because trader demographics can vary by platform. The slight bullish skew on Bybit is noteworthy, as it often caters to a different segment of the market compared to Binance. How to Interpret This Balanced BTC Perpetual Futures Ratio A nearly 50/50 split in the overall BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is a fascinating scenario. It typically indicates a period of consolidation or indecision. Traders are seemingly waiting for a catalyst to push the market in a definitive direction. This equilibrium can be a precursor to increased volatility. When one side eventually capitulates, it can fuel a strong directional move. Therefore, monitoring for a decisive break in this ratio is a key task for active traders. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors What can you do with this information? First, understand that this metric is one piece of a larger puzzle. Always combine it with other analyses like spot market volume, funding rates, and on-chain data. Second, a neutral BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio like this suggests caution against making large directional bets based on sentiment alone. It might be a time for range-bound strategies or waiting for a clearer signal. Finally, watch for divergence; if the price starts moving significantly while the ratio remains stuck near 50%, it could indicate strengthening underlying momentum. Conclusion: A Market Holding Its Breath The December 25th update on the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio paints a picture of a crypto market in a tense standoff. With bulls and bears almost perfectly balanced across major exchanges, the stage is set for a potential breakout. This data underscores the importance of tracking derivatives sentiment, not in isolation, but as a critical component of understanding market psychology. As we move beyond the holiday period, any shift in this delicate balance could provide early clues for the next major Bitcoin trend. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a perpetual futures contract? A perpetual futures contract is a derivative tool that allows traders to speculate on an asset’s price without an expiry date. It uses a funding rate mechanism to keep its price tethered to the underlying spot market. Why is the long/short ratio important? It serves as a real-time gauge of market sentiment. A high long ratio can indicate excessive optimism (a potential sell signal), while a high short ratio can indicate extreme pessimism (a potential buy signal). Which exchange’s ratio is most important? No single exchange is definitive. Analyzing the aggregate data and noting differences between major platforms like Binance, OKX, and Bybit provides a more holistic view of global trader sentiment. Can the ratio predict Bitcoin’s price? It is not a crystal ball, but an indicator. Extreme readings often precede market reversals, while neutral readings like the current one suggest indecision and potential for increased volatility. How often does this data update? The long/short ratio is typically calculated based on 24-hour open interest data and updates continuously, providing a near real-time pulse on trader positioning. Should retail traders follow this metric? Yes, but with context. It’s a valuable tool for understanding the market’s emotional temperature, which can help in risk management and timing entries/exits, especially when combined with other technical and fundamental analysis.

In a groundbreaking move, Russia’s two premier financial hubs—the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and the Saint Petersburg Exchange (SPB)—have reportedly completed all technical preparations to launch crypto trading . This isn’t just speculation; it’s a concrete step awaiting the final green light from regulators. For investors worldwide, this signals a major step towards the institutional embrace of digital assets in a major economy. What Does This Mean for Crypto Trading in Russia? According to a report from Wu Blockchain, the exchanges are fully prepared. Their systems are tested and ready to go live the moment the Russian government establishes a formal legal framework for crypto trading . This development follows earlier signals from the government, including a Bloomberg report, that legislation was being advanced to allow public cryptocurrency investment. The move aims to bring a vast, new pool of capital into the digital asset space through trusted, established institutions. Who Can Participate and What Are the Rules? The proposed regulatory model creates a clear path for two main groups of investors. This structured approach aims to open the market while managing risk. Retail Investors: Everyday Russians will be allowed to participate, but with an annual cap. Reports suggest a limit of 300,000 rubles (roughly $4,000) per year. This protects novice investors from overexposure. Institutional Investors: Banks, funds, and professional firms are expected to have no specific trading limits. However, one notable exception is privacy coins like Monero, which will likely be prohibited due to regulatory concerns over transparency. Why Is This Launch So Significant? This isn’t just another crypto exchange opening its doors. The entry of MOEX and SPB is a powerful legitimization of the entire asset class. These are not niche platforms; they are the backbone of Russia’s traditional financial system. Their involvement brings unparalleled trust, security, and regulatory oversight to crypto trading for millions. It bridges the gap between the conventional stock market and the dynamic world of digital currencies, potentially setting a precedent for other national exchanges. What Challenges Lie Ahead? However, the path forward isn’t without hurdles. The most immediate challenge is the finalization of that all-important legal framework. Global sanctions and financial isolation also pose complex questions about how these regulated crypto trading services will interact with the international financial system. Furthermore, the success of this initiative will depend heavily on public adoption and whether investors trust these new, regulated channels over existing, less formal options. The Bottom Line: A New Era for Digital Finance The preparation of Russia’s top exchanges marks a pivotal moment. It represents a strategic move to formalize and control the cryptocurrency market within its borders. For global observers, it’s a clear indicator of digital assets’ irreversible march into the mainstream financial infrastructure. While questions remain, the readiness of MOEX and SPB for crypto trading is a definitive step toward a future where traditional and digital finance are seamlessly integrated. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When will crypto trading actually start on these exchanges? A: Trading will begin only after the Russian government passes and enacts the necessary legislation to create a legal framework. The exchanges are technically ready but waiting for this legal green light. Q: Can foreigners invest in crypto through the Moscow or Saint Petersburg exchanges? A: The report focuses on regulations for Russian investors. Access for foreign participants will depend on the final laws and any international sanctions compliance measures the exchanges must implement. Q: What cryptocurrencies will be available for trading? A: Specific lists haven’t been released, but reports indicate that “privacy coins” (e.g., Monero, Zcash) will be excluded. Major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most likely to be offered initially. Q: How does this differ from using a regular crypto exchange like Binance? A: Trading on MOEX or SPB would occur under strict Russian regulatory oversight, potentially offering greater investor protection, integration with traditional banking, and a familiar interface for local stock traders. Q: What is the purpose of the 300,000 ruble limit for retail investors? A: This is a common consumer protection measure in finance. It aims to limit the risk for non-professional investors who may not fully understand the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. Q: Will this make cryptocurrency legal in Russia? A: This move is part of a broader effort to create a regulated environment for digital assets. It moves crypto from a legal gray area into a formally recognized and supervised financial activity.

Key Takeaways: Elon Musk’s US growth forecast has reignited Bitcoin optimism as traders look for signs of improving liquidity and risk appetite. Fed rate cuts have put macroeconomic conditions back at the center of Bitcoin’s price outlook after its recent pullback. Despite bullish reactions, several analysts remain cautious, warning Bitcoin could face renewed downside in 2026. In a post on X this week , Musk predicted “double-digit growth” within the next 12 to 18 months, adding that US GDP could even see “triple-digit” expansion over the next five years if advances in applied artificial intelligence translate into real economic output. While the comments were not tied directly to crypto, they were quickly picked up by Bitcoin traders searching for signs of improving liquidity and risk appetite. Fed Rate Cuts Put Macro Focus Back on Bitcoin’s Next Move Macro expectations have long played a role in Bitcoin price action. Investors often track growth forecasts, inflation trends and US Federal Reserve policy to gauge whether conditions favor risk assets. Rate cuts by the Fed earlier this year have already fueled debate over whether easier financial conditions could support a recovery in Bitcoin after its recent pullback. Several prominent figures in the crypto space backed Musk’s outlook. Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano noted that the world’s richest man is openly forecasting double-digit GDP growth, framing it as a potentially powerful backdrop for scarce assets like Bitcoin. Meanwhile, real-world asset yield platform Oryon Finance said Musk’s projections tend to be “not random noise,” even if they are controversial. Skepticism, however, remains. Some market watchers questioned Musk’s track record on long-term forecasts. Elon, predictions that come true are not your strongest suit. — Artem Russakovskii (@ArtemR) December 24, 2025 Analyst Artem Russakovskii said economic predictions are not Musk’s strongest area, urging caution in extrapolating the comments into market expectations. Bearish views on Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook also persist. Market commentator Bariksis said that despite Musk’s optimism, he expects a Bitcoin bear market in 2026. Veteran trader Peter Brandt and Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer have similarly suggested Bitcoin could revisit the $60,000 range next year. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at $87,709, down nearly 30% from its Oct. 5 peak of $125,100, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Remains Tied to Fed Policy as Inflation Eases Slowly, Analyst Says According to Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy expectations rather than headline economic data. While US inflation has eased from last year’s highs, the latest consumer price index reading of 2.7% suggests that the disinflation process remains slow and uneven, forcing “the Fed to maintain a cautious stance, making it difficult to pivot quickly toward an aggressive easing cycle,” Tran said in a note shared with Cryptonews.com. Last week, K33 also said Bitcoin’s prolonged sell-side pressure from long-term holders may be approaching its limits after years of steady distribution.

Rather than focusing on short-term price weakness, Anderson points to a series of institutional developments that, in his view, suggest strategic accumulation is underway. At the same time, retail investors remain focused on losses. Anderson notes that XRP has declined significantly from recent highs, trading below the two-dollar level after being near $3.65 only months ago. He describes rising fear across social platforms and private messages, with many holders questioning whether to exit their positions. Against this backdrop, he argues that major financial players are moving in the opposite direction. Ripple #XRP WARNING! Why Smart Money is Scaling NOW Breaking Crypto News? pic.twitter.com/WARf7rHPou — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) December 23, 2025 XRP ETFs Pass a Major Milestone Central to his analysis is the rapid growth of XRP exchange-traded funds . According to Anderson, XRP-focused ETFs have surpassed one billion dollars in total assets under management. Products launched by firms such as Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Canary Capital are reportedly reaching this level faster than any other digital asset ETF, except Bitcoin and Ethereum. He emphasizes that these funds are physically backed, meaning real XRP must be purchased to support new shares. Despite declining prices, Anderson reports that institutions continue to buy millions of dollars’ worth of XRP daily. He adds that further momentum is expected, with additional issuers, including 21Shares, receiving approval to bring new XRP ETF products to market. For him, the combination of falling prices and steady inflows points to long-term positioning rather than short-term speculation. Exchange Supply Tightens as Buying Continues Another data point highlighted is the reduction of XRP held on exchanges . Anderson states that more than one billion XRP have been left on trading platforms over the past two months. In his assessment, this trend suggests decreasing available supply at the same time ETFs require continuous purchases to back new shares. He contrasts this activity with what he describes as retail panic selling, arguing that professional fund managers and large institutions are accumulating while individual investors react emotionally to price movements. The imbalance between shrinking exchange supply and rising institutional demand, he says, creates conditions that often precede market recoveries. Banks pen the Door to Broader Access Anderson also points to regulatory developments in the United States. He explains that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has cleared national banks to facilitate XRP transactions for customers as riskless principal trades. This would allow major banks to offer XRP buying and selling directly through standard banking apps, without holding the asset on their balance sheets. In his view, this approval could expose XRP to millions of users who are unlikely to engage with cryptocurrency exchanges. He argues that banks do not invest in such infrastructure without anticipating future demand, suggesting that institutional clients are already signaling interest. Ripple’s Strategy and Long-Term Positioning Turning to Ripple’s corporate actions, Anderson highlights the company’s application for a U.S. bank charter , which would grant access to the Federal Reserve system. He frames this as a step toward embedding XRP into regulated financial infrastructure rather than treating it purely as a speculative asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He also references Ripple’s recent billion-dollar acquisitions, including firms focused on institutional trading and corporate payments, as well as the rollout of its RLUSD stablecoin. According to Anderson, while institutions may prefer stable instruments for balance sheet management, XRP remains essential as the bridge asset enabling cross-currency movement within this framework. Fear, Fundamentals, and Market Timing Anderson concludes that current conditions reflect a familiar pattern in financial markets. While sentiment remains pessimistic and price action weak, he believes the underlying fundamentals are strengthening through ETF growth, banking access, and Ripple’s expansion. He cautions that further downside or sideways movement is still possible in the near term, but maintains that periods of elevated fear often coincide with strategic accumulation by large players.

In a recent post, the former Binance CEO argued that such attacks are solvable through better wallet-level protections. Combating Address Poisoning Attacks CZ said wallets should automatically check whether a receiving address is associated with known poisoning activity and block users from sending funds to it. He noted that this is feasible through on-chain queries and also urged the creation of real-time security alliances that maintain shared blacklists of malicious addresses. This will allow wallets to flag risks before transactions are signed. The crypto exchange founder added that Binance Wallet already issues warnings when users attempt to send funds to poison addresses and suggested that spam micro-transactions used to pollute transaction histories should be filtered out entirely from wallet interfaces. “We can completely eradicate this type of poison address attacks.” Trader Loses $50M in USDT His reaction comes days after a high-profile incident in which a crypto trader lost nearly $50 million in USDT after falling victim to an address poisoning attack, according to on-chain investigators. Data shared by Lookonchain revealed that on December 20, the victim mistakenly transferred 49,999,950 USDT to a scammer-controlled address shortly after withdrawing the funds from Binance. As is common practice, the trader first sent a 50 USDT test transaction to what they believed was their own wallet. An attacker, using an automated script, then generated a spoofed address that closely resembled the legitimate one. The spoofed address matched the first five and last four characters while differing in the middle, precisely the section many wallets shorten with ellipses. The scammer sent small transactions from this lookalike address to poison the victim’s transaction history. Roughly 26 minutes after the test transfer, the victim appears to have copied the spoofed address from their history and sent the full $50 million sum. According to SlowMist, the attacker rapidly laundered the funds by swapping USDT to DAI, then converting it into around 16,690 ETH before depositing most of it into Tornado Cash, in a bid to complicate recovery efforts. The victim later posted an on-chain message offering a $1 million whitehat bounty for the return of the funds. Last May, a crypto investor lost roughly $68 million worth of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) after falling victim to the scam. Blockchain data showed the victim mistakenly sent more than 1,150 WBTC to a hacker-controlled wallet after copying an address from their transaction history.

Gox Hacker Unloads 1,300 Bitcoin As $360 Million Still Remains",https://bitcoinist.com/mt-gox-hacker-unloads-1300-bitcoin/,"Mt. Gox-linked bitcoin tied to Aleksey Bilyuchenko is continuing to filter onto exchanges, extending a slow, closely watched stream of legacy supply that on-chain analysts have been flagging since the fall. Mt. Gox Hacker Unloads More Bitcoin Arkham analyst Emmett Gallic said entities related to Aleksey Bilyuchenko deposited another 1,300 BTC, about $114 million, into unknown exchanges over the past seven days. The wallets still hold roughly 4,100 BTC (around $360 million), and have sold a total of 2,300 BTC. Gallic wrote via X on Dec. 23: “The entity related to Aleksey Bilyuchenko has deposited another 1.3K BTC ($114M) to the unknown exchanges in the past 7 days. They still hold 4.1K BTC ($360M). They have sold a total of 2.3K BTC.” Bilyuchenko has been charged by the US Department of Justice in connection with the Mt. Gox hack . The Dec. 23 deposits build on earlier posts in which Gallic described a methodical unwind rather than a one-off dump. On Nov. 9, he said bitcoins “once belonging to BTC-E cofounder Aleksey Bilyuchenko are slowly being sold off through unknown exchanges,” citing 110 BTC deposited over two days. That Nov. 9 note also emphasized uncertainty around who is actually controlling the funds. “Unclear if he’s still jailed in Russia or in control of these funds, but Moscow courts have seized most of his other assets,” Gallic wrote. The repeated use of “unknown exchanges” suggests the destination clusters are not cleanly attributable to major, labeled venues in the datasets Gallic is using. For market participants, that makes the flow harder to handicap: deposits can signal intent to sell, but the execution path is less transparent than transfers into well-known exchange wallets. In an Oct. 17 post, Gallic went further, alleging that “almost 8K BTC … related to the WEX/BTCE case are controlled by Russian authorities,” including “the 6.5K BTC that moved earlier today.” He attributed that control to a specific unit—“3rd department of the 2nd service of the CSS of the FSB”—and linked to a Russian-language investigative article. Who Is Bilyuchenko? In Russia , Bilyuchenko has faced a separate WEX-related criminal case that has already produced a conviction. On March 18, 2024, the Moscow City Court upheld an earlier guilty verdict against Alexey Bilyuchenko, described in local reporting as a system administrator of the WEX exchange. Bilyuchenko was accused of embezzling 3.1 billion rubles in WEX assets; the Meshchansky District Court sentenced him in September 2023 to 3.5 years in prison and a 500,000-ruble fine, and the appeal court left that decision in place, bringing the verdict into legal force. In the United States, the posture is different: prosecutors have unsealed charges . The case is still ongoing. In June 2023, the Department of Justice announced the unsealing of charges against Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner in the Southern District of New York, accusing them of conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoin tied to the 2011 Mt. Gox hack. The SDNY indictment charges both men with conspiracy to commit money laundering, carrying a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison. Separately, Bilyuchenko is charged in the Northern District of California with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money services business, tied to allegations that he worked with Alexander Vinnik and others to operate BTC-e from 2011 until it was shut down in July 2017. DOJ listed a maximum potential penalty of 25 years on those NDCA charges.

Upbit has announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals for a scheduled maintenance period around New Year’s Day. This planned pause is a standard operational procedure, but knowing the exact timeline is crucial to avoid any trading disruptions. Let’s break down what you need to know about this Upbit maintenance window. When is the Upbit Maintenance Happening? The Upbit maintenance will affect different services at specific times. The exchange has provided a clear schedule to help users plan accordingly. Digital Asset Transactions: Suspended from 11:00 a.m. UTC to 11:00 p.m. UTC on December 31st. Korean Won (KRW) Transactions: Suspended from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. UTC on December 31st. Therefore, the core maintenance window for all services is from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. UTC on the last day of the year. It’s important to note that trading on the exchange’s order books will typically remain operational during such audits. Why Do Exchanges Like Upbit Perform Maintenance? You might wonder why a major platform needs to halt deposits and withdrawals. This temporary suspension is not a cause for alarm but a sign of robust operational health. The primary reason for this Upbit maintenance is to conduct a thorough audit of user assets and deposits. Regular audits are a critical compliance and security measure. They ensure that the digital assets held by the exchange perfectly match the balances recorded in user accounts. This process, often called proof-of-reserves verification, enhances transparency and builds trust with the user community. In essence, it’s a financial health check-up for the platform. How Should You Prepare for the Maintenance Window? A little preparation can ensure this maintenance doesn’t impact your end-of-year crypto activities. Here are actionable steps to take: Plan Your Transfers: Complete any necessary deposits or withdrawals well before the scheduled suspension times. Check Time Zones: Confirm the UTC times in your local time zone to avoid missing the deadline. Secure Your Assets: While funds are safe on the exchange, use this as a reminder to ensure your account has two-factor authentication enabled. Monitor Official Channels: For the latest updates, always refer to the official Upbit announcement page or social media accounts. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? Scheduled maintenance by a top-tier exchange like Upbit highlights the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry. Proactive audits and transparent communication about service pauses demonstrate a commitment to security and regulatory compliance that rivals traditional finance. This approach benefits everyone. It protects users, ensures market integrity, and helps legitimize digital assets for broader adoption. When exchanges prioritize these operational safeguards, it creates a more stable and trustworthy environment for all participants. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Assurance The upcoming Upbit maintenance is a short, planned interruption designed to provide long-term security and verification. By understanding the schedule and preparing your transactions in advance, you can navigate this period smoothly. This routine audit ultimately reinforces the safety of your assets on one of Asia’s most prominent cryptocurrency platforms, allowing you to step into the new year with greater confidence in your exchange’s operational integrity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade cryptocurrencies on Upbit during the maintenance? A1: Typically, yes. Scheduled maintenance for audits usually only suspends deposit and withdrawal functions. Trading on the spot order books often remains active, but it’s always best to check the official announcement for any specific restrictions. Q2: Are my funds safe during the Upbit maintenance? A2: Yes. Your assets remain secure in Upbit’s wallets. The maintenance is an audit to verify that all user funds are accounted for, which is a safety measure, not a risk. Q3: What happens if I initiate a transfer right before the suspension time? A3: Transactions initiated before the cut-off time will be processed. However, any deposit or withdrawal request started after the suspension begins will be queued and will only be processed once the maintenance is complete and services resume. Q4: How often does Upbit perform this type of maintenance? A4: Major exchanges conduct regular asset audits, often quarterly or semi-annually. This end-of-year schedule is common as exchanges reconcile their annual financial positions. Q5: Will the maintenance affect the price of cryptocurrencies on Upbit? A5: It is highly unlikely. Short, planned maintenance windows for deposits/withdrawals rarely cause significant price movement, as the market is aware and prepared. Major price volatility is usually driven by larger macroeconomic or industry-specific news. Found this guide to the Upbit maintenance helpful?

Key Takeaways: Crypto dealmaking hit a record $8.6 billion in 2025 as regulatory easing in the US revived investor and institutional interest. Mega-acquisitions led by Coinbase, Kraken and Ripple drove a sharp rise in mergers and acquisitions. Crypto IPO activity also rebounded strongly, with $14.6 billion raised globally. According to a report by the Financial Times , 267 crypto-related deals were completed by Tuesday this year, marking an 18% increase from 2024. Total deal value surged nearly 300% compared with last year’s $2.17 billion. Market participants expect momentum to carry into 2026 as regulatory clarity improves across major jurisdictions. Coinbase’s $2.9B Deribit Deal Leads Record Year for Crypto M&A The largest transaction of the year came from Coinbase, which agreed to acquire crypto options exchange Deribit for $2.9 billion , making it the biggest acquisition ever recorded in the digital asset sector. Other notable deals included Kraken’s $1.5 billion purchase of futures trading platform NinjaTrader and Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of crypto-friendly prime broker Hidden Road. Industry executives have attributed the resurgence in dealmaking to policy shifts under President Donald Trump, whose administration rolled back enforcement actions and signaled a more permissive approach to digital assets. The change in tone has reassured traditional finance firms that had previously stayed on the sidelines, opening the door for strategic investments and consolidation. Crypto deals running at record pace with more expected in 2026 https://t.co/GelwXyhxlf — Financial Times (@FT) December 24, 2025 Beyond mergers and acquisitions, 2025 also marked a strong year for crypto initial public offerings. The Financial Times reported that 11 crypto IPOs raised a combined $14.6 billion globally, a dramatic increase from the $310 million raised through four listings in 2024. Among the most closely watched debuts were Bullish , the exchange and parent company of CoinDesk, which raised $1.1 billion, stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group with more than $1 billion , and crypto exchange Gemini, which raised $425 million. Regulatory Clarity and MiCA Compliance Fuel Crypto Dealmaking Legal experts say regulatory alignment is a key driver behind many of these deals. Diego Ballon Ossio, a partner at Clifford Chance, noted that both crypto-native firms and traditional finance players are actively acquiring companies for their licenses, particularly those compliant with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. He added that demand for stablecoin-related businesses is likely to persist into 2026 as new rules take shape in the US and UK. Charles Kerrigan, a partner at CMS, told the Financial Times that firms are prepared to spend heavily to remain compliant, often using acquisitions to secure regulatory approvals more quickly. He also expects forthcoming US crypto legislation to further draw in traditional financial institutions, reinforcing the current wave of consolidation. The surge in corporate activity comes even as market prices cooled late in the year. Bitcoin has fallen more than 30% from its early October peak above $126,000 and was trading just below $88,000 at the time of publication, according to market data.

Per the exchange data, the move appeared isolated to USD1, the stablecoin launched by Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial. Source: Binance This type of “flash wicks” occurs when liquidity thins and order books lose depth. The BTC/USDT trading pair has remained stable after resuming. Bitcoin Flash Wicks and Quick Reversal During non-peak trading hours, when market makers often pull back, large buy/sell orders could sweep through multiple empty levels. This scenario creates a dramatic spike that looks like a market breakout. Further, the instant reversal of the wick shows that no broader market move supported the spike. “Many spot investors find themselves in a similar position to where they were before the flash crash,” Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, told Cryptonews. “This is certainly an argument against excessive leverage in a market with fluctuating liquidity in such an uncertain geopolitical climate.” Additionally, temporary pricing issues can also trigger such dislocations. These price fluctuations are often created by faulty quotes or reactions from trading bots. Experts often emphasize that real rallies require sustained buying pressure and rising volume. In this case, trading volume remained low, and the price quickly returned to its previous level. BTC Price Remains Bearish – What is the Next Directional Move? Bitcoin rose 0.89% to $87,693.65 over the past 24 hours, outpacing the broader crypto market (+0.83%). The crypto is down sharply from its October peakabove $126,000. The largest digital asset is trading at $87,773 at press time, per CoinMarketCap data . According to analysts , Bitcoin is currently consolidating within a descending “triangle pattern,” trading below the 21MA, which serves as a resistance barrier.

At the same time, however, the U.S. economy also saw a 4.3% growth in the third quarter of this year, making people feel a bit better about putting funds into other cryptocurrencies. Many people searching for the best crypto to buy are keeping a close eye on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Solana Accumulation Despite the fluctuations in the value of Solana, large investment firms are seeing these as opportunities to accumulate even more. The reason is that Solana is actually making a tremendous amount of money as a platform. In 2025, it has generated a total of $1.4 billion, which is exponentially higher than the $522 million generated by its rival, Ethereum, within the same period. It is a massive event within the crypto market because it shows that more individuals are using the platform offered by Solana to make their transactions. At the moment, SOL prices are ranging between $120 and $130. Although technical analysis indicates investors should exercise caution, having such a large amount of money pumped into the system is a clear indicator of a promising future. Professional investors have termed Solana the best cryptocurrency to invest in because of the sheer value it generates in the industry. Provided the levels of trading continue to remain high, experts are confident the prices are set to touch $140 in the near future. Mutuum Finance (Mutm) Is Close To Selling Out While large currencies such as Solana are finding their place, another new cryptocurrency called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rising at an incredible pace. This new cryptocurrency has managed to raise $19.5 million from individuals eager to join the new market. The figures of individuals holding this new form of cryptocurrency has risen to above 18,580. Currently, the new cryptocurrency’s presale phase, phase 6, is 99% full. This means that there is very little time left to purchase the cryptocurrency at the current price of $0.035. Otherwise, the price will automatically increase to $0.040 in phase 7. The early investors have already seen an increase in the value of their tokens by 250% from the very first level. Since the token is expected to launch at the cost of $0.06, many investors believe that it is the best cryptocurrency to buy if you’re looking to see growth quickly. The platform is also very safe. It has been rated at 90 out of 100 by blockchain security company CertiK. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to launch its first functional version, V1 protocol, on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 . With this, users will be able to borrow and lend funds with ETH and USDT. To add some fun, they have a daily leaderboard in which the top buyer can win a $500 prize every 24 hours. In fact, they have an enormous prize giveaway of up to $100,000, with ten people set to receive $10,000 each. All these make this particular project the best crypto to purchase before the end of the year, according to many investors. Big companies’ huge interest in Solana and the fast sellout in presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prove that people are moving towards projects that provide something actually useful. Playing around with your finances? This is actually the best time to bulk up your digital asset portfolio before prices increase. Being part of projects at this point can definitely increase your finances much faster next year.

However, that level also gave in yesterday, and the asset closed below it, currently sitting at $1.87, even after rebounding from the intraday low of $1.83. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined the significance of this support once again. He noted that with $1.90 gone, XRP could be on the verge of a massive price slump to $1.10. Support is gone for $XRP . $1.10 comes into focus. pic.twitter.com/RGBqV52vf6 — Ali Charts (@alicharts) December 24, 2025 Analysts have been adamant that XRP needs to maintain above $1.90 to remain in a bullish structure, but a breakdown below that level could invalidate it. Recall that the asset jumped to $1.95 earlier this week after surging by double digits in the previous few days. However, that triggered a sell signal from the TD Sequential, a sign that typically leads to an immediate retracement. Given XRP’s overall correction since July, losing over 40% of its value in months, the crowd has turned mostly bearish on the asset, with the negative social media commentary skyrocketing . Santiment, though, noted that this could be a blessing in disguise for XRP, claiming that such instances have led to price recoveries in the past. Another possible reversal sign for Ripple’s cross-border token could be the behavior of whales. According to data from CW, such large market participants have been “quietly accumulating XRP” as the spot taker CVD shows buying is more dominant than selling. This would be an interesting change of heart by Ripple whales, which were on a massive selling spree since early October, disposing of billions of tokens since then. The price of $XRP is falling, but spot taker CVD shows buying is dominant. Despite the price decline, whales are quietly accumulating $XRP . https://t.co/zFhhj7p7we pic.twitter.com/G0kyL3lIVH — CW (@CW8900) December 24, 2025 The post XRP Loses Crucial Support: Is $1.1 Inevitable? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-12-25 08:21:52

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.865214. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.41 with an average trading price of $1.35. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

The cryptocurrency lost 1.55% of its value. The DOGE coin has support around the $0.121 level. As of December 25, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a downward trend. The memecoin’s price decreased to $0.127 today, representing a significant 1.55% loss since it closed at the $0.129 level yesterday. This downtrend indicates a comparatively negative market sentiment, as the memecoin is shedding again; however, the coin may find support around the $0.121 zone as it continues to move toward that level. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day chart for Dogecoin indicates a bearish trend with selling pressure continuing for the coin. The cryptocurrency’s price decreased to $0.127 today. Red candlesticks on the chart signify selling momentum. Negative sentiment is currently rising, as the token’s price is decreasing once again. DOGE/USD 1-day price chart.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.147, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.121. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 39 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a sell indication as it moves downwards, as the overall market sentiment is negative as of now. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis Selling pressure remains present below the SMA, which is evident from a red candlestick, as bears are continuing their lead. The DOGE/USD pair is facing increasing volatility as it approaches the $0.127 level. This increased volatility signals more volatile price movements in the coming hours. Selling momentum is currently pushing the DOGE price toward the local support of $0.125. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart.

The RSI indicator is trending in the neutral area on the 4-hour chart. Over the last four hours, its value has decreased to 41.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding current market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.127 in the past 24 hours. If sellers keep dominating the market, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and retest the $0.121 support. Conversely, if the bullish trend revives, the meme coin may jump toward the $0.133 resistance zone in the current trading session. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.396556–$0.504708 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.127 over the last 24 hours as sellers successfully forced buyers to exit. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.270379 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2029. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 3,642 DOGE in December; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.41 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142.

According to local reports , the exchanges’ announcements came following the Bank of Russia’s December 23 release of a regulatory concept that sets July 1, 2026, as the deadline for developing comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation. Moscow Exchange stated it is “ actively working on solutions to service the cryptocurrency market ,” while St. Petersburg Exchange emphasized it already possesses “ the necessary technological infrastructure for trading and settlements. “ From Resistance to Regulated Markets Russia’s path toward crypto regulation began gaining momentum in mid-2024 , when the Ministry of Finance first proposed allowing qualified investors to trade digital currencies on licensed exchanges. Anatoly Aksakov, head of the State Duma Financial Market Committee, said at the time that major exchanges were “ already actively involved in developing the cryptocurrency market and organizing the necessary infrastructure. “ The regulatory framework divides market access between qualified and non-qualified investors under sharply different conditions. Non-qualified investors will be limited to purchasing liquid cryptocurrencies from a defined list after passing mandatory knowledge tests, with annual purchases capped at 300,000 rubles (approximately $3,800) through a single intermediary. Qualified investors face no volume restrictions but must demonstrate understanding of crypto risks through testing, though they will be barred from purchasing anonymous tokens that conceal transaction data. Despite the forthcoming trading infrastructure, Russian authorities maintain their ban on using cryptocurrencies for domestic payments. Russian lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov said that payments in Russia must only be conducted in rubles, dismissing crypto becoming legal tender. #RussiaCrypto #CryptoPayments #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/BLk0c4qHcQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 State Duma Committee Chairman Anatoly Aksakov reinforced this position on December 17, declaring that cryptocurrencies “ will never become money within our country ” and can only function as investment instruments, with all domestic payments required in rubles. The Bank of Russia originally called for a total ban on crypto exchanges and token trading, but Western sanctions prompted a policy shift. Mining Boom Drives Economic Integration Russia’s crypto ecosystem has expanded dramatically beyond trading speculation. The country recorded $376.3 billion in received crypto transactions between July 2024 and June 2025, surpassing the United Kingdom’s $273.2 billion and making Russia Europe’s largest crypto market by transaction volume , according to Chainalysis data. Source: Chainalysis Large-scale transfers exceeding $10 million grew 86% in Russia during this period, nearly double the 44% growth seen across the rest of Europe, while DeFi activity surged eightfold in early 2025 before stabilizing at three and a half times the mid-2023 baseline. Much of this growth has been tied to A7A5, a ruble-pegged stablecoin that reached $500 million in market capitalization despite Western sanctions, becoming the world’s largest non-dollar stablecoin. The mining sector has also become particularly significant for Russia’s economy. Senior Kremlin official Maxim Oreshkin recently argued that crypto mining should be classified as export activity since mined assets effectively flow abroad even without crossing physical borders. Industry estimates suggest Russia produces tens of thousands of Bitcoins annually, generating approximately 1 billion rubles in daily mining revenue, and that the country accounted for over 16% of global hashrate during the summer months. In fact, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina also recently acknowledged that crypto mining contributes to the ruble’s strength. Russia's Central Bank confirms crypto mining strengthens the ruble as Kremlin officials push for formal export classification amid persistent underground operations. #Russia #Crypto #Mining https://t.co/P0JGyFTYfp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 However, she noted that quantifying its exact impact remains difficult, as much of the industry operates in gray areas, with illegal mining costing Russia billions of dollars annually through stolen electricity and unpaid taxes. Russia legalized crypto mining on November 1, 2024, requiring legal entities to register with the Federal Tax Service. Banks Enter Digital Assets Market Russia’s largest lender, Sberbank, has begun offering regulated crypto-linked investments totaling 1.5 billion rubles in structured bonds and digital financial assets tied to Bitcoin , Ethereum , and broader crypto portfolios. Deputy Chairman Anatoly Popov confirmed “ active dialogue ” with the Bank of Russia on integrating crypto services within regulated frameworks while building proprietary blockchain infrastructure. As it stands now, the regulatory timeline calls for legislative frameworks to be completed by July 1, 2026, with liability for illegal crypto intermediary activities taking effect from July 1, 2027.

Bitcoin Selling Pressure Is Fading For Now CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost wrote on Dec. 24 that “the latest data shows a clear decline in Bitcoin inflows to Binance coming from whales over the month of December.” He said monthly whale inflows dropped from roughly $7.88 billion to $3.86 billion, “effectively being halved within just a few weeks,” calling it “a significant slowdown in BTC deposits to Binance by the largest holders.” The bullish read is mostly mechanical. Exchange inflows are not the same thing as selling, but they are a prerequisite for selling at scale, and Binance remains the dominant exchange in exchange-related flows in CryptoQuant’s framing. Darkfost put it plainly: “In the current environment, the observed trend remains constructive. Binance continues to capture the largest share of exchange-related flows. When inflows from influential participants such as whales decline on this platform, it generally suggests a reduction in their selling pressure.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trading Near ‘Fair Value,’ Says On-Chain Model He also cautioned that a downtrend in aggregate deposits does not eliminate the risk of sudden, market-moving transfers. “That said, this broader trend does not rule out the occurrence of occasional significant movements,” Darkfost wrote. “Some inflows can still impact the market, even if they remain relatively isolated.” As an example, he pointed to a recent $466 million spike across the 100 BTC to 10,000 BTC cohorts, alongside more than $435 million in inflows coming specifically from the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC range. Related Reading: The Macro Conditions For Bitcoin In 2026: Analyst Breaks Them Down Those bursts matter because they can reintroduce volatility even if the baseline is calmer. “These sudden movements are a reminder that whales retain the ability to influence volatility at any time, even within a broader slowdown,” Darkfost said, adding that when large holders “move thousands of BTC in single transactions,” they can trigger sharp moves “whether through sudden volatility spikes or deeper corrections, depending on the volumes deposited and potentially sold.” BTC Whale Capitulation On Pause A separate CryptoQuant update on Dec. 23 echoed the idea that the most acute stress may have eased. “Whale Capitulation on Pause,” the firm wrote, saying realized losses from “new whales” “significantly impacted the price drop from $124K to $84K.” Since the recent low, CryptoQuant said, those realized losses “have declined and are now flat.” Put together, the message is that one key source of near-term supply pressure,large deposits onto Binance,has cooled, while the realized-loss impulse tied to “new whales” is no longer intensifying. The caveat is the same one Darkfost emphasized: the market can look quiet in aggregate and still get rattled by a handful of large deposits if whales decide to move size again. At press time, BTC traded at $87,792.

Amonyx (@amonyx), a well-known crypto pundit on X, is indicating recent guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) that could benefit XRP and the broader crypto market. He revealed that the U.S. federal banking regulator now allows banks to buy, sell, and custody crypto. He noted that this is bullish for XRP. HUGE NEWS: U.S. federal banking regulator says banks can buy, sell, and custody crypto Bullish #XRP pic.twitter.com/RFCTtWcQOJ — Amonyx (@amonyx) December 22, 2025 The New OCC Guideline The OCC published Interpretive Letter #1186 in response to a request from an unnamed bank. The letter confirms that national banks may hold crypto assets as principal in limited circumstances. The regulator focused on stablecoin-related activities permitted under the Genius Act. It concluded that banks may hold crypto on their own balance sheets in amounts reasonable to pay blockchain network fees. Earlier in the year, the OCC gave banks approval to offer cryptocurrency custody and execution services to their customers . This move is another major step forward. In the new letter, the OCC stated that paying network gas fees is “incidental to the business of banking.” Without holding native tokens, banks cannot settle transactions, operate nodes, execute smart contract activity, or provide crypto custody services. The letter further allows banks to hold crypto to test custody platforms, settlement flows, trading rails, cybersecurity controls, and AML systems. At the same time, the OCC kept firm limits in place. Holdings must remain de minimis relative to capital. Banks may only use them for foreseeable operational needs. The guidance does not authorize speculative trading or large balance sheet exposure. What Does this Development Mean for XRP? XRP often sits at the center of discussions about institutional crypto use . The token was designed for payments and liquidity between financial institutions. Banks exploring blockchain settlement need assets that move quickly, settle cheaply, and integrate with compliance systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If banks expand crypto custody, testing, or settlement services, XRP stands to benefit from that interest. Institutions already familiar with payment rails may view XRP as aligned with their needs . As more banks test blockchain-based payments, demand for tokens tied to that use case could rise. The OCC guidance does not guarantee adoption, but signals a notable shift. This move comes shortly after Ripple received conditional approval from the OCC to launch the Ripple National Trust Bank. Regulators are easing up on crypto use in the banking system. For XRP supporters like Amonyx, this acceptance could lead to bigger opportunities down the line. XRP is an institution-focused asset, and over time, sustained bank engagement could support liquidity, visibility, and long-term price growth.

Key Takeaways: AI-focused crypto tokens have lost about 75% of their value year over year, erasing roughly $53 billion from the market. The selloff accelerated into year-end, with December alone accounting for nearly $10 billion in losses. Fading hype, thinner liquidity and broader market pullbacks pushed AI tokens into a deep correction in 2025. A new report shows the sector has entered a deep correction, erasing tens of billions of dollars in value as investor appetite cooled and market conditions tightened. Data compiled by CryptoPresales.com shows AI tokens have lost roughly 75% of their combined value year over year, wiping out an estimated $53 billion from the market. AI Token Selloff Accelerates as Year-End Losses Mount The decline marks a reversal from the explosive gains seen during the height of the AI trade, when enthusiasm around machine learning, data infrastructure and blockchain-based compute solutions drove rapid inflows. The selloff intensified toward the end of the year . December alone accounted for nearly $10 billion in losses, capping a volatile period that saw sentiment deteriorate just weeks before year-end. At the time of writing, the combined market capitalization of AI and big data tokens stood at $16.8 billion, down sharply from levels seen a year earlier. The sector’s rise and fall over the past two years has been dramatic. After reaching an all-time high of $44.9 billion in early 2024, AI tokens saw their market cap cut nearly in half by mid-August. That decline coincided with expanded US export restrictions on AI chips to China, rising geopolitical tensions and widespread profit-taking. in classic crypto fashion the market went nuts on vaporware AI tokens only to go bearish right as the real tech comes online onchain economy = agentic economy https://t.co/jdoZXJ58za — Stephen (@meta_hess) December 18, 2025 A rebound followed in the second half of 2024, driven by renewed interest in AI-powered blockchain applications and utility-focused projects. By the end of last year, the sector’s market cap had surged 157% to $55.5 billion, following a staggering 1,873% jump in 2023. That momentum did not carry into 2025. As the hype faded, traders began rotating out of smaller and higher-risk tokens. Thinner liquidity and a steady stream of new token launches added to selling pressure, leaving AI and big data projects particularly vulnerable during broader market pullbacks. CoinMarketCap data shows the sector lost 63% of its value, or about $44 billion, by April. While the second and third quarters brought a modest recovery, prices never returned to prior highs. AI Token Losses Deepen in Q4 with $14B Wiped Out Losses accelerated again in the fourth quarter amid a wider crypto market downturn. The AI token market shed roughly $4 billion in November, followed by a much steeper $10 billion drop in December. The damage was widespread among leading projects. Eight of the ten largest AI and big data tokens by market capitalization posted losses exceeding 70% over the past year. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance fell 84%, while Render and The Graph each dropped 82%. Even last year’s standout performer, Virtuals Protocol, which surged more than 3,500% in 2024, has since given back 73%, alongside sharp declines in Injective, Filecoin, Internet Computer and NEAR Protocol.

At the moment, the ADA currency is under immense pressure as whales have been disposing of their coins. This has led people to believe that the price will drop to as low as $0.27 by the end of the year. While old coins like ADA are struggling, smart investors have started looking for other investment avenues. One of the trending projects at the moment is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Many are saying it is the best crypto to buy at the current time because of its rapid growth. This project has been making many headlines in the crypto community because it has a vision for the future and has many new individuals joining who are looking for a new crypto coin that has the potential to become worth much more in the future. Downtrend Indicators for ADA As of lately, the environment surrounding Cardano has been quite grim. Cardano’s price index has fallen by 2% in recent times to approximately $0.36. Analysts studying community trading behavior report that whales, or individuals holding 100,000 to 100 million units of tokens, sold 90 million ADA units within only a couple of days. When that many tokens are sold simultaneously, there is a lot of selling pressure on the market that prevents it from rising. Other statistics also suggest that Cardano finds itself in a tough spot. In the trading world, more people are placing their bets on a drop in price than on an increase. Also, the price is currently lodged below the 50-day moving average. This is no more than trading jargon for it’s currently lower than it has been, on average, for the last month and a half. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.64. This indicates to traders that while the price is plummeting, it has not yet reached the lowest point. Should it not remain above $0.36, it could plummet quickly to $0.27. Because of this, many people in pursuit of the best crypto to buy now are relocating funds from Cardano to new crypto projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Almost Sold Out Although Cardano is facing some difficulties, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going the other way. The project is currently undergoing a presale, a unique occasion that allows users to purchase the tokens before they go live. The project is at Phase 6, and it is 99% full. This indicates that only a little time is left to purchase the tokens at the prevailing rate of $0.035. After Phase 6, the rate will increase to $0.040 during Phase 7. It has already raised more than $19,500,000 with over 18,580 users owning the coin. This brand-new crypto coin has already increased by 250% since it launched, and the people who invest in it are hoping it will go even higher, by as much as 450% after it launches. However, they are also very concerned about their security. MUTM is being reviewed by a very well-known security firm named Halborn Security to ensure that everything is secure. Also, the team recently announced that their V1 protocol, which means it’s the first version of their app, will launch on testnet in late 2025. The app will allow users to easily borrow and lend money, which is why so many people believe this one to be the best crypto to buy right now. Mutuum Finance is making headlines in the crypto world by offering prizes to its communities in bulk. Currently, they are conducting a massive giveaway of $100,000, where ten lucky individuals will take home a prize of $10,000. The team also has a leaderboard of people who participate on a daily basis. The one at the top receives a daily bonus of $500 MUTM. These prizes are enticing more people to join before Phase 6 runs out. Investors realize that once the new crypto coin is finally released at the price of $0.06, it will cost so much more to invest in it. With this project offering great features soon and great incentives, most people think this is the best crypto to invest in at this point if they want to enhance their portfolio before the year 2026. It is difficult to overlook the difference between Cardano’s plummeting price and the steep growth of Mutuum Finance. Currently, there is a brief window of opportunity that allows one to invest in Mutuum Finance while the price is lower and before it surges in the next phase. It is an excellent investment opportunity for an enthusiast looking to include the project in their portfolio.

56337039,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=883995,1766655023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56337039.jpeg,Aave governance vote could reshape DeFi in 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/this-aave-vote-may-change-defi-2026/,"Aave protocol, the most liquid lending hub in decentralized finance, is on the verge of a contentious vote. The voting period, ending December 26, will determine the ownership of the protocol’s brand, as well as the manner of fee distribution. Aave may affect decentralized finance in 2026, as a key vote may change its ownership model. Aave is currently poised to shift ownership of its brands to a single entity, to be defined later. The proposal suggests that the Aave brand resources should belong to AAVE token holders. The Aave vote puts three sides in conflict. On the one hand, Aave Labs has guided the protocol progress. Aave DAO, on the other hand, is trying to recoup access to trading fees. The third side of the conflict are side contributors, which sometimes use the Aave brand to promote and give legitimacy to their DeFi products. Aave locks in more than $33B , and is one of the key hubs for liquidity, as well as third-party builders based on Aave V3 technology. The resolution on the ownership of the protocol brand may affect the protocol’s reputation and the willingness of contributors to build side products. The conflict of Aave ecosystem stakeholders may hurt the protocol’s influence in 2026, just as DeFi had recovered to a relatively sustainable level. Is Aave moving toward the interest of AAVE token holders? The one problem with the proposal is that it may run counter to the interests of AAVE token holders. Right after the proposal, AAVE tokens sank to a three-month low, trading as low as $146. Later, AAVE stabilized again above $150. AAVE traded at a three-month low, after the rushed introduction of a proposal to shift the ownership of Aave brand assets to benefit token holders, instead of Aave Labs. | Source: CoinGecko. The other problem is that big AAVE holders are pushing the vote away from retail owners. Just around the time of the vote, the protocol’s founder Stani Kulechov bought more AAVE on some of his known wallets . The current trend of the vote toward a ‘No’ suggests token holders will not benefit from the project’s future growth, while Aave Labs may retain outsized control on the brand and storefront assets. The proposal aims to be neutral, and only discuss brand ownership structure. As a result, Kulechov is one of the most influential voters , supporting the full transfer of brands to a new entity. However, the proposal is not directed at Aave Labs explicitly, but at all contributors and entities that have attempted to use the brand, or abstained from calling themselves a part of Aave. As of December 25, the proposal was 18 hours from ending, with 52% of votes against the transfer of brand ownership, 43% abstaining, and only 4% in favor. The overall consensus was that the vote was rushed, and should have gone through a temp check process first. Who owns the Aave assets? Aave DAO holders have relied on the implicit split and good faith in the ownership of Aave assets. Currently, the assets, brand, landing pages, and GitHub resources are split between Aave Labs, as well as external contributors like BG Labs. However, at any moment, brand ownership may be revoked or challenged, curbing contributors and token owners from self-representation. The proposal raises the issue of this implicit ownership, and asks for explicit transfer of all assets. The circle of Aave contributors is also growing, meaning some entities and app builders have been using the brand for self-promotion and monetization. As a result, the proposal asked to define the ownership more clearly: “Private entities clearly separated from the DAO should not be allowed to unilaterally attribute to themselves, implicitly or explicitly, the name “Aave” or the status of “being Aave”. With a plural organization like the DAO and the lack of a direct mechanism of self-representation, another entity doing so outside a service agreement or other model (e.g., franchising) weakens the DAO’s ability to control its own representation.” The DAO also claims that failing to resolve the issue may be a threat to the decentralized model. The biggest problem is the idealistic view of third-party service providers, who are contributing to Aave DAO and expect compensation. The proposal’s main point is that the token owners should have explicit control over all brand assets, controlling them through a governance process. The decision, however, is at a gridlock, given the ability of whales to oppose the brand transfer. For now, Aave remains in its usual uncertain state, allowing Aave Labs to still claim ownership of brand assets.

He signaled that a major Ripple announcement is coming, and made it clear that many skeptics are not prepared for it. SMQKE shared a report showing Ripple is in late-stage talks for a 2026 IPO. This report is confirmation that Ripple is moving forward after years of delay. His message targeted long-time doubters who believed Ripple would never pursue a public listing. The announcement will shock all the non-believers. I’m ready. https://t.co/pDZCsNXeBP — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 22, 2025 Why This Timing Matters Ripple has avoided an IPO for years. That decision was strategic, as the company focused on regulatory battles, infrastructure growth, and enterprise adoption. Now that those hurdles have eased, the company may be taking another major step. An IPO at this stage suggests confidence in its balance sheet, revenue stability, and long-term XRP-backed business model . Ripple becoming a publicly traded company would subject it to stricter disclosure standards, increasing institutional confidence in its systems . It would also expose Ripple to a much larger pool of capital from these institutions. Now that XRP has regulatory clarity, nothing is holding back the adoption of Ripple’s payment systems. How This Phase Supports XRP Ripple’s business relies on XRP as a liquidity tool within its payment ecosystem. As Ripple expands its enterprise footprint, transaction activity becomes more relevant. Increased adoption of Ripple’s services can translate into higher on-chain usage. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A public listing can also change how traditional investors view XRP. Some institutions still cautiously engage with cryptocurrencies, but the remarkable performance of spot XRP ETFs shows that most institutions are eager to trade with the asset. SMQKE suggested that Ripple has reached a point where public markets make sense. That context matters for long-term holders who focus on fundamentals rather than short-term price movement. 2026 could bring big things for XRP if Ripple decides to go public. Why Non-believers May Be Caught Off Guard Many critics built their view of XRP around uncertainty. Delays fed skepticism, and regulatory pressure reinforced doubt. A confirmed move toward an IPO in 2026 challenges that narrative. Ripple stepping into public markets positions the company as a long-term player within traditional finance. That shift can influence sentiment around XRP over time. SMQKE’s message to holders was simple. If Ripple completes this transition, it could significantly change XRP’s trajectory . Investors who refuse to prepare for this new reality could miss out on life-changing wealth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to analyst Alek , the sustained selling pressure stems primarily from tax loss harvesting. He claimed it is a temporary phenomenon expected to conclude within the coming week, alongside de-risking ahead of Bitcoin’s quarterly options expiry. Institutions have been selling $BTC for 8 straight days now. Most of the selling is due to tax loss harvesting, which means it'll be over in a week. Also, Bitcoin quarterly options expiry is set to happen this week, so a bit of de-risking is happening too. This is temporary… pic.twitter.com/h6FO3UEGST — Alek (@Alek_Carter) December 24, 2025 On December 24 alone, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed net outflows of $175 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the exodus at $91.37 million. Ethereum spot ETFs recorded $52.70 million in outflows, while newer products showed resilience, with Solana ETFs attracting $1.48 million and XRP ETFs drawing $11.93 million in fresh capital. Source: SosoValue Regional Shift Creates New Market Dynamic A notable geographic rotation has emerged in Bitcoin markets, with the United States becoming the dominant seller while Asian buyers step in as the primary accumulation force, as noted by analyst Ted Pillows. Source: X/@TedPillows This is quite notable as it is a reversal that’s quite different from traditional capital flow patterns that have historically characterized crypto trading. Meanwhile, whale activity on Binance has contracted sharply, with large holder deposits plummeting nearly 50% from $7.9 billion to $3.9 billion. CryptoQuant data reveals that monthly whale inflows dropped from approximately $7.88 billion to $3.86 billion in December, effectively halving in just weeks. Source: CryptoQuant Despite this broader slowdown, isolated spikes persist, with recent movements including $466 million across the 100 BTC to 10,000 BTC cohorts and over $435 million from the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC range. The reduced whale deposit activity suggests diminished selling pressure, as fewer Bitcoin transfers to exchanges mechanically translate to less immediate liquidation risk. However, Binance continues to capture the largest share of exchange flows. Bitcoin Correlation Breakdown Signals Independence Bitcoin’s market behavior has decoupled from traditional assets, with correlation to the Nasdaq approaching zero and turning negative against gold. CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn noted that Bitcoin no longer trades like a tech stock or safe haven, instead “ carving out its own market regime .” Low Correlation Signal Bitcoin is moving independently: • Nasdaq correlation is near 0 • Gold correlation is negative BTC is no longer trading like a tech stock or a safe haven. It’s carving out its own market regime. pic.twitter.com/VLibiQWYIb — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) December 25, 2025 This independence comes as gold and silver continue climbing while Bitcoin remains range-bound. CryptoQuant analysis attributes the divergence to increased demand for traditional safe assets amid geopolitical uncertainty, expectations of lower real interest rates , and easier institutional allocation pathways to precious metals. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin is treated primarily as a high-beta risk asset rather than a pure safe haven, making it secondary during risk-off environments when capital first flows into gold and government bonds. Bitcoin’s apparent demand recently turned negative, indicating stagnant new capital inflows despite elevated prices. Short-Term Holder SOPR has also spent extended periods below 1, suggesting recent buyers are exiting at losses or breakeven, creating selling pressure on rebounds. Gold trades above $4,500 per ounce while Bitcoin still struggles to break $90,000. Source: CryptoQuant Bear Market Scenario Gains Credibility Notably, CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Cycle Momentum Indicator (BCMI) has also fallen below equilibrium but remains above historical bottom zones of 0.25–0.35 seen during 2019 and 2023 cycle lows. The current reading, according to analysts, suggests markets may be transitioning into a bear phase rather than experiencing a simple pullback. Source: CryptoQuant However, they emphasize this remains a scenario rather than a forecast that requires further confirmation. Adding to the waning demand, Polymarket odds for Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by year-end have collapsed to just 3%, which shows the perfect near-term sentiment. Despite current weakness, analyst Plan C maintains conviction that “ Bitcoin will have its moment in the spotlight ” in 2026, predicting mean reversion against gold and silver’s outperformance in the relatively near term. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $87,838, down nearly 30% from its October peak above $126,000.

During his Wednesday appearance on Squawk Box, he was asked which blockchain would rise like Facebook or decline like MySpace, to which he answered, “They are both Facebook.” He added that with tokenization growing and more economic activity moving on-chain, multiple blockchains can coexist successfully in the same space, commenting, “You can’t just have one blockchain.” Each blockchain will have distinct use cases Hadick recognized that ETH has more stablecoins and greater on-chain activity than Solana, but argued that the latter also handles higher trading volumes, thus enhancing trading efficiency. He explained, however, that no single blockchain is likely to dominate the market completely, due to scaling limitations. He noted , “I think we’re going to see different use cases on different blockchains,” recognizing the potential for new entrants to gain market share. So far, Ethereum’s market, including stablecoins, stands at $183.7 billion, dwarfing Solana’s $15.9 billion, as per RWA.XYZ analysis. Additionally, more institutions have recently adopted the Ethereum network, including JPMorgan , which could drive mass adoption and increase the network’s advantage over Solana. Wall Street’s BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Fidelity’s Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), and now, JPMorgan’s OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY), have now launched tokenized MMFs on Ethereum. Nonetheless, both Ethereum and Solana must contend with competition from private networks, although many tokenization projects are currently opting to remain blockchain-agnostic. Ctrl Alt CEO Matt Ong commented on the current market preferences, “We’re seeing a lot of interest in the private networks from the big banks. But I think outside of that, there is still a massive push towards public [blockchains].” Crypto platforms transition from Ethereum to Solana Some crypto platforms have also been shifting between Ethereum and Solana. In October, the Fantasy sports platform Sorare transitioned from Ethereum to Solana, aiming for better scalability, lower fees, and a more open ecosystem. It moved more than 10 sports games and their associated cards. Nevertheless, Sorare CEO Nicolas Julia noted that he still trusts Ethereum, even as he referred to the change as an “upgrade.” Additionally, in 2023, the Render Foundation reported that it had migrated its core infrastructure from Ethereum to Solana, allocating up to 1.14 million RNDR tokens for the transition. Earlier this year, Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital also exchanged $100 million worth of ether for Solana’s SOL. At the time, analysts speculated, the company made the move due to Ethereum’s “structural decline.” Then, in September, the company bought over $700 million in Solana in just two days for its SOL treasury investment in Forward Industries. At the time, the firm even described Solana as “uniquely positioned to power the next generation of capital markets.” Novogratz even commented, “You’ve got a blockchain that’s now fast enough, tailor-made to be the blockchain for financial markets.” Coinbase Asset Management president Anthony Bassili, in November, noted that with Bitcoin and Ether dominating crypto portfolios, Solana could take third place after them.

BTC Halted at $88K The graph below will clearly demonstrate BTC’s choppy market moves as of late. The cryptocurrency went through a volatile period last week as it dumped from $90,000 to $85,500, bounced back to $90,000 before it slumped to a local low of $84,400, even though the US CPI numbers for November were much better than anticipated. The bull finally stepped up at this point and prevented another setback. Bitcoin went on the offensive in the following hours, but was stopped at $89,000. It spent most of the weekend trading sideways around $88,000, but initiated another leg up on Monday. This time, it peaked above $90,400, but that was another failed attempt at reclaiming that level. It quickly lost some traction and slipped to $86,400 yesterday. The subsequent rebound drove BTC to $88,000 earlier this morning, but it couldn’t continue further and now sits $500 away from that target.

Analysts tracking long-term trends in investing in crypto are increasingly focused on platforms that combine real utility, disciplined token economics, and a clear growth roadmap. Among the names gaining momentum is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage protocol that is positioning itself as a serious contender among top crypto opportunities for the coming cycle. Early Participants Enjoys Advantage Currently valued at $0.035, the MUTM token is moving through its Phase 6 presale with visible traction. From its starting price of $0.01, the token has already recorded a 250% increase, reflecting steady demand rather than speculative spikes. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens, with 45.5% or 1.82 billion allocated to the presale. This structure is designed to support appreciation as access tightens over time, a factor analysts closely monitor when identifying high-conviction crypto investments. What adds urgency is the staggered pricing model. Each presale phase raises the token price by nearly 20%, rewarding early participation while steadily increasing the entry point for new buyers. With Phase 6 nearing completion and the next phase set to lift the price to $0.040, investors are closely watching the remaining allocation. Independent Audit & Daily Reward Confidence around the protocol has also been reinforced by a recent announcement shared on X regarding an independent audit by Halborn Security. With the codebase already finalized, Halborn is now conducting a thorough review of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing smart contracts. This process involves testing for vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and exploit risks under real-world conditions. Independent audits of this depth are widely regarded as a benchmark for professional DeFi projects, and this step strengthens trust by reducing security risks before launch and validating that the system operates exactly as designed. Engagement incentives are also being refined ahead of launch. The platform’s 24-hour leaderboard has been upgraded to reward active participation. Each day, the top-ranked user receives a $500 MUTM reward, provided at least one transaction is completed within that period. The automatic daily reset at 00:00 UTC encourages consistent interaction and keeps activity levels high as the ecosystem develops. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Utility-Driven Design That Builds Demand At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a dual lending model that directly ties platform usage to token demand. The protocol will support both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending, allowing users to lend, borrow, and stake assets within designated pools. Every major activity inside the ecosystem is structured to drive demand for MUTM, aligning user growth with token value. In the Peer-to-Contract model, users will pool assets such as stablecoins and well-known cryptocurrencies into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access this liquidity by providing overcollateralized positions. Interest rates will adjust dynamically based on pool utilization, rising as demand increases and encouraging new deposits while discouraging excessive borrowing. This feedback mechanism is designed to maintain solvency and efficient capital use. Depositors in this model will receive mtTokens, which represent both their share of the pool and accrued interest. These mtTokens will also serve as collateral for borrowing other assets, creating layered utility within the system. Over time, lenders will be able to withdraw their principal alongside earned interest, subject to liquidity conditions, while borrowers will choose between variable or stable rates depending on their risk preferences. For assets that carry higher volatility or lower liquidity, Mutuum Finance will introduce a separate Peer-to-Peer lending environment. Tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and other meme-based assets will be isolated from the core liquidity pools. In this structure, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, including interest rates and loan durations. While lenders assume more risk, they also gain access to higher returns, all without exposing the main protocol to unnecessary volatility. This separation preserves overall platform stability while expanding earning opportunities. All loans across both models will require overcollateralization and will be monitored using a Stability Factor. When collateral values fall below required thresholds, liquidations will be triggered. Liquidators will repurchase outstanding debt at a discount, ensuring that the system remains solvent and that losses do not cascade across users. Why Analysts See 2026 Upside As part of its beta rollout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing its V1 protocol for deployment on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This version will include core components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot, with ETH and USDT serving as the initial supported assets. Launching on a testnet allows early community participation, transparency, and direct feedback, all of which strengthen long-term confidence in the ecosystem. Releasing V1 on the testnet gives the community an early opportunity to interact with the protocol before the mainnet debut. This rollout strategy enhances openness, supports early user involvement, and allows the team to gather actionable feedback for further improvements. As participation and exposure increase during the testnet phase, confidence in the project may strengthen, contributing to lasting interest and long-term demand for the MUTM token. The protocol’s approach to managing market volatility and liquidity further differentiates it from many early-stage projects. Adequate on-chain liquidity is essential for efficient liquidations, minimizing slippage during distressed events. Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation thresholds are calibrated based on asset volatility, with lower-risk assets supporting higher LTVs and more volatile tokens constrained by stricter parameters. Reserve factors are also adjusted by risk profile, balancing protocol security with broad participation. These mechanics demonstrate a level of foresight that analysts value when evaluating candidates for top crypto status. Rather than relying on hype, Mutuum Finance is building infrastructure designed to function across varying market conditions, a critical trait for sustained adoption. Finally, as Phase 6 reaches 98% sold out, momentum is accelerating. The upcoming phase will raise the token price by approximately 15%, moving MUTM from $0.035 to $0.040. For those focused on investing in crypto with a 2026 horizon, this marks the final window to access Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at its current discounted level. With strong fundamentals, growing engagement, and a clear path toward utility-driven demand, analysts are watching this cheap token closely as one of the standout opportunities heading into the next cycle.

With a market capitalization of $1.74 tn and daily trading volume near $21.7 bn, Bitcoin remains firmly positioned as the market’s dominant digital asset. While price has pulled back from December’s $94,600 high, the current pause looks more like consolidation than weakness. Markets appear increasingly sensitive to signals of asset debasement and rising global debt levels. That narrative has helped sustain demand for hard assets and, by extension, reinforced Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge rather than a speculative outlier. Gold and Silver Break Records Gold and silver have surged to fresh highs, reshaping cross-market sentiment. February gold futures settled near $4,506, after touching a record $4,530, while spot prices traded around $4,491. Gold (XAU/USD) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Silver delivered an even sharper move, with futures rising more than 4% and spot prices holding above $71, a level not seen before. Key drivers behind the metals rally include: Concerns over an AI-driven equity bubble Uncertainty around future US monetary leadership Growing fears of long-term currency debasement Veteran investors argue the rally may not be finished. Some analysts see gold extending well beyond current levels if global debt trends continue unchecked, a backdrop that historically supports alternative stores of value, including Bitcoin. Bitcoin Technical Picture Remains Constructive On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC continues to trade within a descending channel, reflecting controlled profit-taking rather than panic selling. Price is hovering near the $87,800 pivot zone, a level that has repeatedly acted as both support and resistance. Although BTC remains below the 50-EMA ($87,980) and 100-EMA ($88,610), downside momentum has clearly slowed. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick structure shows spinning tops and doji formations, signalling indecision rather than continuation lower. The RSI near 46 is stabilising above oversold territory, hinting that bearish momentum is fading. Structurally, the pattern resembles a falling flag, a formation that often precedes a directional breakout. Bitcoin Outlook: Consolidation Before Expansion A sustained break above $88,600 would expose $90,500, followed by $92,650 and a potential retest of $94,600. Conversely, failure to reclaim key averages could see a retest of $86,300, with stronger demand expected near $83,800. As long as Bitcoin holds above the lower channel boundary, the broader setup favors continuation rather than breakdown. If gold and silver continue to attract defensive capital, Bitcoin could be next in line as investors rotate toward scarce assets. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.36 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year. The project mixes bold branding with real engagement features, from ROI contests to nonstop community events, giving it more personality and momentum than typical dog coins. Its shredded, leverage-obsessed mascot has already turned Maxi Doge into a recognizable culture coin. Holders can also stake $MAXI for daily smart-contract rewards and unlock access to exclusive competitions and partner events. The staking utility adds a passive-earning layer that keeps users active and invested in the ecosystem. With $MAXI priced at $0.0002750 and the next increase approaching, the presale continues to gain speed. If you’re looking for a meme coin built on hype, personality, and real community energy, Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one worth watching.

The investors are searching for the high-growth-potential and massive-ROI token in a short period of time, rather than investing in existing Cryptocurrencies. Ozak AI is an early-stage AI-based token that has raised approximately $5.1 million in presale Funding so far. The Ozak AI token is unique from other AI-based tokens due to its advanced AI technology. Analyst Predicts that the Token is to be listed at $1 in the major exchanges and is likely to reach $5 by 2026 and $10 by 2027. Ozak AI Presale Accelerates Toward an Early Sellout Ozak AI is currently in its 7th presale phase, priced at $0.014. Each Presale Phase is sold out rapidly, showing the massive interest and adoption for the Ozak AI tokens. The Low entry price of Ozak AI pulls both retail and institutional investors across the globe to enter the Presale Phase. Right now, Ozak AI is in its early stages and has the possibility to explode. Over 1.05 billion OZ tokens have been sold so far. The presale has raised $5.1 million in a short period of time, showing how the token has high growth potential in the current bearish market. Analysts predict that the token is to be listed at the price of $1, showing the 71x growth from the current price, and this makes the investors enter the current phase to secure the token. Once the token is listed in the exchange, analysts predict that the Token will soon explode, reaching the milestone of $5 in 2026 and $10 in 2027. Analysts Map Ozak AI’s Path: $1 Launch, $5 in 2026, and a $10 Peak as AI Dominance Grows. Assuming the $500 invested in Ozak AI at the current presale price of $0.014 would secure 35,714 OZ tokens. If the token has been listed at $1, then the secured token's worth would be $35,714 with 71x growth and a 7,042% increase. Once the token is listed at the exchange, it gets more exposure, and many investors start to invest in the token. And if the token price reaches $5 by the end of 2026, as per the analyst prediction, then the secured tokens' worth would be $178,570 with 350x growth and a 35,614% increase. If the Token reaches the $10 milestone by 2027, if the token maintains the same momentum, and if the market favors it, then the secured token's worth would be $357,140 with 714x growth and a 71,328% increase. With the AI crypto sector increasing rapidly, this type of upside is why analysts call Ozak AI one of the highest ROI opportunities heading towards 2025 - 2027. Technology Behind Ozak AI’s Future Growth Ozak AI is not just the hyped token. Its core technology merges AI and blockchain to produce the AI predictive tools that can analyze real-time blockchain data. While most of the AI tokens run on centralized servers. Ozai AI’s Advanced AI technology has the Decentralized Infrastructure (DePIN), which is a 3-layer decentralized network consisting of the AI layer, Data Layer, and OSN Layer. The Data Layer is an IPFG-based encrypted storage for secure financial data and OSN layer nodes that bring in real-time on-chain and off-chain data. The AI layer runs AI calculations on GPUs for predicting prices. This makes the Ozak AI censorship resistant, faster during heavy loads, more secure, and fully decentralized. Strategic Partnerships Fuel Expansion Collaborating with Gremory AI and IQ Wiki , Ozak AI proves that it is making its ecosystem stronger. Partnering with IQ Wiki, which is one of the biggest blockchain encyclopedias, brings every project detail from the auditing to its technology and tokenomics details. Partnering with Gremory AI, which is a Solana liquidity engine, helps to relocate liquidity across DLMM pools like Metera before the market prediction is done by the Ozak AI. Conclusion: Ozak AI Is Entering Its Breakout Phase Ozak AI’s high presale momentum and AI utility make the token more unique and acquire exposure from both retail and institutional investors. As the AI sector is booming, Ozak AI is attracting tremendous attention in the Crypto market, and analysts expect that with the $1 listing, followed by the projections of $5 in 2026 and $10 in 2027, Ozak AI is at the center of the fast-increasing AI-crypto industry. Analysts estimate that the Token is nearing the listing phase, and if the token achieves the projected price, then the smallest investment in the Ozak AI might be a tremendous ROI and the biggest launch of an AI token listing ever.

56338250,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254242,1766657412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Bybit’s Impressive December Reserve Ratios Prove Unwavering Security Commitment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-december-reserve-ratios-security/,"BitcoinWorld Revealed: Bybit’s Impressive December Reserve Ratios Prove Unwavering Security Commitment In the often turbulent world of cryptocurrency, trust is the most valuable asset. Bybit, a leading global crypto exchange, has just reinforced that trust by publicly announcing its December reserve ratios. The latest data reveals a powerful story of security and stability, showing the platform maintains significant over-collateralization across dozens of major cryptocurrencies. For users concerned about the safety of their digital assets, this transparency is not just reassuring—it’s essential. What Do Bybit’s Reserve Ratios Actually Mean? Simply put, a reserve ratio shows how much cryptocurrency an exchange holds in its reserves compared to what its users have deposited. A ratio of 100% means the exchange holds one unit of an asset for every unit its users own. Therefore, when Bybit announces reserve ratios ranging from 100% to 160%, it confirms the platform holds all user funds, plus an extra safety buffer in many cases. This practice, known as over-collateralization, is a cornerstone of financial security in the crypto space. Breaking Down Bybit’s Key Reserve Figures The data snapshot from December 17th provides clear evidence of Bybit’s robust financial health. Let’s examine the reserve ratios for some of the most prominent assets: Bitcoin (BTC): 105% Ethereum (ETH): 101% XRP: 101% Solana (SOL): 103% Tether (USDT): 102% USD Coin (USDC): 112% These figures are not just numbers on a page. They represent a tangible commitment. For instance, the 105% Bybit reserve ratio for Bitcoin means that for every 1 BTC a user holds on the platform, Bybit safeguards 1.05 BTC in its reserves. This extra 5% acts as a critical financial cushion. Why Should Crypto Traders Care About Over-Collateralization? Transparency around Bybit reserve ratios directly addresses one of the central anxieties in cryptocurrency: counterparty risk. History has shown that exchanges operating without sufficient reserves can face catastrophic failures, potentially locking users out of their funds. Bybit’s consistent publication of these ratios, verified through Merkle Tree proofs, allows users to independently verify the platform’s solvency. This builds a foundation of trust that is vital for a healthy trading environment. Furthermore, this practice demonstrates responsible financial management. Maintaining reserves above 100%, especially for stablecoins like USDC at 112%, shows proactive risk management. It prepares the exchange to handle potential market volatility or sudden withdrawal requests without compromising user assets. How Do Bybit’s Reserve Ratios Compare to Industry Standards? Following the collapse of several major platforms, the industry has moved toward a new standard of proof-of-reserves and transparency. Bybit is positioning itself at the forefront of this movement. While many exchanges now provide some form of attestation, the consistent publication of detailed, asset-specific Bybit reserve ratios sets a high bar. It goes beyond a simple “yes, we have the funds” to show exactly how much extra protection exists for each cryptocurrency. The Bigger Picture: Security Beyond Just Reserves It’s important to remember that strong Bybit reserve ratios are one part of a comprehensive security framework. Users should also consider an exchange’s track record, regulatory compliance, and technological safeguards like cold storage and insurance. However, transparent reserve data is arguably the most direct indicator of an exchange’s financial integrity and its commitment to protecting user capital above all else. Conclusion: A Benchmark for Trust and Transparency Bybit’s December reserve report does more than just share statistics. It sends a powerful message about the exchange’s operational philosophy. In a sector where trust must be earned daily, this level of transparency is a significant competitive advantage. For traders and investors, it provides peace of mind, knowing their assets are not only present but protected by a substantial financial buffer. As the crypto industry matures, this practice of regular, detailed reserve disclosure will likely become the non-negotiable standard that all legitimate platforms must meet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a reserve ratio in cryptocurrency? A reserve ratio is the percentage of user deposits that an exchange holds in its secure reserves. A ratio of 100% or higher means the exchange holds all user funds (and possibly more), ensuring it can fulfill all withdrawal requests. How often does Bybit publish its reserve ratios? Bybit publishes updated reserve ratio data regularly. The latest announcement covers the snapshot from December 17th, continuing their commitment to periodic transparency updates. Why is USDC’s reserve ratio (112%) higher than others? A higher ratio for a stablecoin like USDC may indicate a more conservative approach to managing that specific, high-volume asset. It provides an additional safety net to manage liquidity and redemption requests smoothly. Can users verify Bybit’s reserve claims? Yes. Bybit uses Merkle Tree proofs, a cryptographic method that allows users to independently verify that their funds are included in the total reserves published by the exchange. Does a 100% reserve ratio guarantee complete safety? While a 100% or higher ratio is a critical indicator of solvency, overall platform safety also depends on other factors like cybersecurity, operational controls, and regulatory standing. What happens if an exchange’s reserve ratio falls below 100%? A ratio below 100% would mean the exchange does not hold enough assets to cover all user deposits, posing a significant risk of insolvency and potential loss of user funds if many withdrawals occur.

This substantial achievement has been attributed to US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, which has improved investor confidence in the sector and promoted mergers and acquisitions centered on the crypto ecosystem. The news followed a financial analysis conducted by Pitchbook, revealing that a total of 267 deals had been struck in the crypto industry as of December 23. This record marked a considerable 18% rise from 2024. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:5e14dad6-31aa-4653-898e-b0e13a554d72-6"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-4"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> The total deal value of $8.6 billion demonstrated an increase of approximately 300% compared to 2024, when the total deal value was $2.17 billion. Analysts still expect this trend to continue in 2026. Crypto deals surge, reaching the highest levels this year Coinbase secured a leadership position with the major acquisition of Deribit for approximately $2.9 billion, marking the most significant acquisition in the crypto industry to date. Meanwhile, apart from the leading cryptocurrency exchange, other notable mergers included Kraken’s acquisition of futures trading platform NinjaTrader in a deal valued at around $1.5 billion. Ripple also struck a $1.25 billion agreement to acquire Hidden Road, a global credit network and institutional prime broker that supports the cryptocurrency industry. This great achievement in the crypto ecosystem has been attributed to US President Donald Trump’s move to pave the way for opportunities for the crypto community in the United States. Some of the efforts Trump implemented included imposing several deregulation measures and withdrawing regulatory lawsuits. This decision, in turn, prompted traditional financial institutions to make significant investments in the sector. Reports also confirmed that approximately $14.6 billion was collected from 11 initial public offerings (IPOs) linked to crypto worldwide. This finding illustrated a major surge from $310 million raised in 2024 via four IPOs. On the other hand, analysis regarding the highly anticipated IPOs this year was also drawn. It was discovered that Bullish , the digital asset platform, a major crypto exchange and tech firm popular for institutionally-focused crypto trading, was the most long-awaited IPO this year which collected $1.1 billion, followed by Circle Internet Group, a global financial technology firm known for issuing the popular USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin, that purchased over $1 billion; and lastly, Gemini, another significant crypto exchange that gathered $425 million. Diego Ballon Ossio, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance, weighed in on the situation. Ossio noted that traditional finance firms and crypto-related businesses are actively targeting companies for their licenses, particularly those recognized by authorities for strictly adhering to the EU’s MiCA regulations. He also acknowledged that there is a high possibility that this trend would continue in 2026. Analysts predict that demand for stablecoin firms will increase next year Reports indicate that several analysts predict that demand for stablecoin firms will continue to escalate in 2026, driven by the adoption of new crypto-friendly regulations in the US and the UK. This forecast was made after Charles Kerrigan, a partner at the CMS law firm, stated during an interview that firms will make considerable investments to remain compliant with the new licensing rules, mostly through acquisitions. Kerrigan also predicted that newly adopted crypto rules in the United States would prompt traditional finance companies to begin exploring the industry, resulting in an increasing number of mergers and acquisitions. Interestingly, this crucial year for crypto deals unfolds despite the crypto market’s downturn towards the end of the year, with BTC experiencing a drastic decrease of more than 30% from its all-time high of over $ 126,000, set in early October. Currently, analysts have observed that the cryptocurrency has remained relatively unchanged over the last 24 hours, with a level of just below $88,000. This level was attained after it recovered from an intraday low of almost $86,500. Get seen where it counts.

According to on-chain sleuths at Onchain-Lenz, a brand-new cryptocurrency address executed a jaw-dropping withdrawal: 50,000 ZEC, valued at a staggering $22.17 million, was pulled from the major exchange Binance. This colossal ZEC accumulation by a single entity is a classic ‘whale’ move that sends powerful signals through the market. Let’s dive into what this means for ZEC’s price, which is already surging nearly 10% to $446.56. What Does This $22 Million ZEC Accumulation Signal? When an anonymous player moves tens of millions in crypto off an exchange, it’s rarely a casual trade. This type of ZEC accumulation typically indicates a long-term holding strategy, often called ‘HODLing’ in crypto circles. The immediate effect is a reduction of readily sellable supply on the exchange, which can reduce selling pressure. Furthermore, this action coincides with a significant price pump for ZEC. Therefore, the timing suggests this whale might be positioning itself ahead of anticipated positive momentum, betting on further gains. ZEC Price Action: More Than Just a Coincidence? Data from CoinMarketCap shows ZEC trading at $446.56, marking a sharp 9.93% increase. While correlation doesn’t equal causation, large accumulations often precede or accompany bullish trends. Key factors to consider include: Reduced Exchange Supply: Moving coins to a private wallet locks them away from immediate market sales. Whale Confidence: A $22 million bet is a strong vote of confidence in ZEC’s future value. Market Sentiment: Such visible on-chain activity can attract other investors, creating a positive feedback loop. This ZEC accumulation event provides a tangible, on-chain reason behind the current price strength, offering more substance than mere speculation. Who Could Be Behind the Major ZEC Accumulation? The identity of the buyer remains a mystery, which is fitting for a privacy-focused coin like Zcash. However, we can explore likely candidates based on common patterns in crypto. Potential actors include: Institutional Investors: Hedge funds or family offices making a strategic entry into privacy assets. A Crypto Fund: Allocating a portion of its portfolio to alternative cryptocurrencies. A High-Net-Worth Individual (Whale): An existing large Bitcoin or Ethereum holder diversifying into ZEC. An Entity Preparing for a Product: A company needing a large ZEC reserve for a future service or payment rail. Regardless of who it is, the scale of this ZEC accumulation demands attention and suggests sophisticated capital is taking positions. What This Means for ZEC Investors and the Market For everyday ZEC holders and traders, this event is a crucial data point. It doesn’t guarantee endless price increases, but it does highlight underlying strength. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Flow: Watch if this pattern of exchange withdrawals continues, signaling broader accumulation. Assess Support Levels: Large holders often defend price levels near their accumulation zones. Balance Sentiment with Caution: While bullish, always pair on-chain signals with sound risk management. This monumental ZEC accumulation is a powerful narrative that could define the coin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Zcash In summary, the withdrawal of $22.17 million in ZEC from Binance is a landmark event. It demonstrates significant, conviction-based buying at a pivotal moment for the privacy coin. This ZEC accumulation by a new whale provides a fundamental pillar for the current bullish price action, suggesting that informed, deep-pocketed investors see substantial value ahead. For the crypto community, it’s a stark reminder that beneath the price charts, the silent movement of coins tells the real story. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is moving ZEC off an exchange considered bullish? A: It reduces the immediate sell-side supply on the market. Coins in a private wallet are less likely to be sold impulsively, indicating a long-term holding intent. Q2: Could this ZEC accumulation be an internal transfer by Binance? A: While possible, on-chain analysts like Onchain-Lenz typically filter out exchange-controlled wallets. The labeling of a ‘newly created address’ suggests it is an external, likely customer-controlled wallet. Q3: Does this mean ZEC’s price will keep rising? A: Not necessarily. While a strong positive signal, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by many factors including broader market trends, regulations, and technological developments. This accumulation is one significant bullish factor among many. Q4: What is ZEC (Zcash)? A: ZEC is the native cryptocurrency of the Zcash network, a blockchain that offers optional privacy for transactions using advanced cryptographic techniques called zk-SNARKs. Q5: How can I track large transactions like this? A: You can use blockchain explorers for Zcash or subscribe to services from on-chain analytics firms that flag large transfers and exchange movements. Q6: Is ZEC a good investment after this news? A: This article provides information, not financial advice. Any investment decision should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and understanding of the asset. This event highlights growing institutional interest, which is a factor to consider. Share Your Thoughts Was this deep dive into the major ZEC accumulation helpful?

LD Capital founder Jack Yi currently faces an unrealized loss of $143 million on his massive Ethereum holdings, according to on-chain intelligence. This situation raises crucial questions about institutional crypto strategies and market timing. What Does This Massive Unrealized Loss Actually Mean? On-chain analyst Ai Yi revealed that Jack Yi holds approximately 645,000 ETH with an average purchase price of $3,150. With Ethereum trading significantly below this level, the paper loss has accumulated to $143 million. However, this unrealized loss represents a theoretical decline in value rather than realized selling. The distinction matters because: The position remains intact and could recover if prices rise No actual cash loss occurs until ETH is sold Large holders often maintain positions through volatility How Will the $1 Billion Fund Impact This Situation? Analyst Ai Yi anticipates a strategic shift once LD Capital completes its planned $1 billion fund investment. The injection of fresh capital could potentially lower the average purchase price to around $3,050 per ETH. This dollar-cost averaging approach might: Reduce the overall cost basis of the position Provide better breakeven points for the portfolio Demonstrate institutional confidence despite current paper losses Therefore, while the current unrealized loss appears substantial, the planned fund deployment suggests a long-term perspective rather than panic selling. What Can Retail Investors Learn From This Revelation? This situation offers valuable insights for all market participants. First, even sophisticated institutional investors experience significant unrealized losses during market downturns. Second, portfolio management strategies often involve calculated averaging rather than emotional reactions. Third, transparency through on-chain analysis provides unprecedented visibility into major positions. Key takeaways include: Large positions require different risk management approaches Paper losses don’t necessarily indicate poor strategy Institutional moves often follow multi-year timelines Is This Unrealized Loss a Warning Sign or Normal Volatility? The cryptocurrency market naturally experiences extreme volatility, making substantial unrealized losses and gains common occurrences. For context: Many early Bitcoin investors experienced 80%+ drawdowns before historic rallies Institutional portfolios typically withstand temporary paper losses Market cycles often test investor conviction at both retail and institutional levels This particular unrealized loss becomes noteworthy primarily due to its scale and the visibility of the position through blockchain transparency. Conclusion: Perspective on Paper Losses in Crypto Markets The $143 million unrealized loss on LD Capital’s Ethereum position highlights several cryptocurrency market realities. Institutional investors face the same volatility as retail participants, albeit with different risk parameters and time horizons. The planned $1 billion fund deployment suggests strategic positioning rather than distress, emphasizing that paper losses represent temporary market conditions rather than permanent capital impairment. Ultimately, blockchain transparency continues to revolutionize how we understand major market movements and investor behavior. Frequently Asked Questions What is an unrealized loss? An unrealized loss represents a decrease in the value of an investment that hasn’t been sold yet. It’s a paper loss that only becomes real if the asset is sold at the lower price. How did analysts discover this Ethereum position? On-chain analysts use blockchain explorers and specialized tools to track wallet addresses associated with known entities. The transparency of public blockchains allows anyone to verify large holdings and transactions. Could this loss trigger forced selling? Typically not, unless the position was leveraged or collateralized. Most institutional holdings like this represent long-term investments rather than leveraged positions requiring liquidation. How common are such large unrealized losses? Quite common in cryptocurrency markets, especially among early investors and institutions who accumulated positions at various price points throughout market cycles. What happens if Ethereum price recovers? If Ethereum’s price rises above the average purchase price, the unrealized loss converts to an unrealized gain. The loss only becomes permanent if sold at lower prices. Why would someone publicize such a loss? The information comes from independent on-chain analysis, not from LD Capital itself. Blockchain transparency means major positions are often discovered and analyzed by third parties. Found this analysis of institutional crypto positions insightful?

This dominance underscores a significant shift in how major firms view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—not just as speculative assets, but as strategic components of their corporate treasuries. Which US Companies Hold the Largest Corporate Crypto Treasuries? The data paints a clear picture of American corporate leadership. Topping the list is the US-based firm Strategy, which holds an astonishing 671,268 BTC. This monumental position firmly establishes them as a titan in the space. They are followed by MARA Holdings with 53,250 BTC and Twenty-One Capital (XXI) with 43,514 BTC. The sheer scale of these holdings highlights a deep conviction in the long-term value proposition of digital assets. This trend goes beyond simple investment. For these companies, allocating a portion of their treasury to Bitcoin is a strategic decision. It acts as a hedge against inflation, a potential store of value distinct from traditional markets, and a forward-looking bet on the future of finance. The concentration of these corporate crypto treasuries in the US suggests a regulatory and business environment that, while evolving, is increasingly accommodating to such institutional moves. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Adoption? The growth of corporate crypto treasuries is a major milestone for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. When publicly traded companies allocate funds to Bitcoin, it provides a layer of legitimacy and stability that attracts further institutional interest. Moreover, it creates a new class of long-term, ‘diamond-handed’ holders who are less likely to sell during market volatility, potentially reducing overall price swings. Mainstream Validation: Large-scale corporate investment signals to other institutions that crypto is a viable asset class. Market Maturation: It moves the market beyond retail speculation towards foundational, balance-sheet assets. Regulatory Dialogue: This activity forces clearer conversations and frameworks between businesses and regulators. However, this path is not without its challenges. Companies managing large corporate crypto treasuries must navigate price volatility, complex custody solutions, accounting standards, and an uncertain regulatory landscape. Successfully overcoming these hurdles will be key for the trend to continue its explosive growth. How Can Other Businesses Learn from These Pioneers? For other corporations watching this trend, the actions of these top holders provide a blueprint. The key is not to blindly follow but to understand the strategic rationale. These leading firms typically: Conduct extensive internal research and risk assessment. Start with a small, allocated percentage of their total treasury. Partner with established, secure custodians to safeguard assets. View the allocation as a long-term strategic holding, not a short-term trade. The message is clear: building a corporate crypto treasury is a serious undertaking that requires planning and expertise. The dominance of US firms shows that those who prepare properly can secure a first-mover advantage in the digital asset economy. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Finance The analysis confirming US dominance in corporate crypto treasuries is more than just a ranking—it’s a snapshot of a financial revolution in progress. As these blue-chip companies continue to hold and potentially grow their positions, they pave the way for broader institutional adoption. This trend reinforces cryptocurrency’s journey from the fringe to the foundational, transforming it into a standard consideration for modern corporate treasury management. The future of finance is being written on the blockchain, and American corporations are holding the pen. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a corporate crypto treasury? A: A corporate crypto treasury refers to a company’s strategic allocation of its cash reserves or treasury funds into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, typically held as a long-term asset on its balance sheet. Q: Why are US firms leading in crypto treasury holdings? A> US firms benefit from a large capital markets ecosystem, early exposure to crypto innovation, and a growing, though complex, regulatory framework that allows certain corporations to explore these assets strategically. Q: What are the risks for companies holding large crypto treasuries? A> Key risks include high price volatility, cybersecurity and custody challenges, evolving accounting and tax regulations, and potential reputational risk if the market declines sharply. Q: Does this mean cryptocurrency is now a ‘safe’ investment for companies? A> Not at all. Cryptocurrency remains a high-risk, high-volatility asset class. Companies treat it as a strategic, non-core allocation after thorough risk assessment, not as a replacement for traditional safe assets. Q: How do companies actually store such large amounts of Bitcoin? A> They typically use institutional-grade custodial services that offer advanced security features like multi-signature wallets, cold storage (offline), and insurance, rather than holding assets on standard exchanges. Q: Will this trend of corporate crypto treasuries continue to grow? A> Most analysts believe so, especially if regulatory clarity improves and more traditional financial infrastructure (like ETFs and banking services) becomes available to support institutional involvement.

That question is at the center of a growing debate around XRP’s market value and is the basis of comments shared on X by Jesse of Apex Crypto. His argument challenges the idea that XRP can function as a worldwide liquidity instrument through Ripple’s framework while maintaining a relatively low valuation around $3, which he says doesn’t make sense. The Liquidity Argument Behind XRP’s Valuation Debate XRP’s price history shows a clear ceiling that it has struggled to overcome. Since launch, the token has never sustained a move above the $4 level, with its highest recorded peak sitting around $3.65 in mid-July. Recent weeks have been even more challenging, as XRP has been trading under $2 with the entire crypto market going through a weak phase. Related Reading: $130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong Despite this, some bullish analysts continue to speculate about scenarios where the price revisits the $3 region. That outlook, however, was directly challenged by Jesse of Apex Crypto, who asserted that even a $3 valuation fundamentally misses the point of what XRP is designed to become. Jesse’s position is built around XRP’s intended role in global finance. According to him, if XRP grows into a primary liquidity source for cross-border settlements like it was intended to be, then a valuation around $3 would not align with that responsibility. In his video commentary, he questioned what XRP would ultimately be backed by or pegged to, pointing to a structure tied to vast pools of global financial assets. These include fiat currencies, potential central bank digital currencies, and even commodities such as gold or silver. He noted that such a framework would imply that the total value represented by XRP tokens would correspond to the combined value of these underlying assets. In simple terms, if roughly 100 billion XRP were expected to support or represent liquidity linked to trillions of dollars in global assets, then a single-digit price per token would appear mathematically inconsistent. From this perspective, XRP’s valuation would need to reflect the scale of the assets it helps move. Institutional Adoption Versus Price Reality The valuation debate is much more complex when placed alongside Ripple’s growing institutional footprint. Ripple has continued to expand partnerships with banks, payment providers, and financial institutions across multiple regions, which strengthens the case that its technology is gaining traction within traditional finance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally If It Reclaims This Fibonacci Level At the corporate level, Ripple’s valuation and funding activity point to strong confidence from large investors, a factor Jesse of Apex Crypto believes should provide a valuation floor for XRP. However, XRP’s market price has not mirrored this institutioacnal momentum. Even with XRP-related investment products gaining attention and steady inflows, the price action is still limited, and the cryptocurrency might continue trading at low valuations in the near term.

The NFT market has plunged to its lowest point of 2025, with the much-anticipated year-end rally completely failing to appear. New data reveals a stark picture of declining sales, falling prices, and waning participation. What’s behind this dramatic downturn, and what does it signal for the future of digital collectibles? What Does the Data Say About the NFT Market Crash? According to reports from Cointelegraph citing CoinGecko, the numbers are sobering. The total market capitalization for NFTs stood at just $2.5 billion in December. This represents a staggering 72% collapse from the January peak of $9.2 billion. The weekly sales figures tell a similar story of contraction. Weekly NFT sales consistently remained below $70 million for the first three weeks of December. Data from CryptoSlam shows the number of unique buyers fell from the 180,000s to the 130,000s. The number of active sellers dropped below the 100,000 mark. This broad decline indicates a loss of momentum across the entire ecosystem, not just in niche segments. How Have Major NFT Collections Been Impacted? No project has been immune to the downturn. The so-called “blue-chip” collections, once considered bastions of value, have seen significant erosion. Over the past 30 days, the floor prices for iconic collections have tumbled. For instance, CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) experienced floor price declines ranging from 12% to 28%. This pullback in flagship projects often has a ripple effect, dampening sentiment and liquidity across the entire NFT market . Why Did the NFT Market Rally Fail to Materialize? Several converging factors likely contributed to the absent rally. First, broader macroeconomic uncertainty continues to pressure risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies and digital collectibles. Second, the initial frenzy of speculation has cooled, leading to a market that now prioritizes utility and proven projects over pure hype. Finally, the high volume of new projects has fragmented attention and capital, making it harder for any single trend to generate widespread momentum. The current state of the NFT market reflects a painful but necessary correction towards more sustainable foundations. What’s Next for the NFT Ecosystem? While the current data paints a bleak picture, it’s crucial to view this as a phase in a longer evolution. Previous cycles in crypto have shown that periods of consolidation often follow explosive growth. This downturn may weed out low-quality projects and shift focus toward NFTs with genuine utility, such as those for gaming, ticketing, or community access. The health of the NFT market in 2025 will likely depend less on speculative trading and more on building real-world applications and enduring communities. Conclusion: A Reality Check for Digital Assets The failure of the year-end rally and the subsequent drop to a 2025 low serves as a stark reality check. It underscores that the NFT market is maturing and is subject to the same boom-and-bust cycles as other asset classes. For creators and investors, the emphasis must now shift from short-term price speculation to long-term value creation. The market’s future vitality hinges on innovation, practical use cases, and rebuilding trust with a more discerning audience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the current total market cap of the NFT market? A: As of December, the total NFT market capitalization was approximately $2.5 billion, a 72% decrease from its peak earlier in the year. Q: Which major NFT collections were hit the hardest? A: Blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw their floor prices fall between 12% and 28% over a 30-day period. Q: Does this mean NFTs are dead? A: Not necessarily. This appears to be a market correction and consolidation phase. The focus is shifting from pure speculation to projects with demonstrable utility and strong communities. Q: What caused the year-end rally to fail? A: A combination of factors likely contributed, including broader economic uncertainty, a cooling of speculative hype, and market fragmentation due to an oversupply of new projects. Q: Where can I find reliable NFT market data? A> Reputable data aggregators like CoinGecko and CryptoSlam provide valuable insights into sales volume, unique traders, and collection floor prices.

In an exclusive perspective shared with The Daily Hodl, Le frames current volatility as temporary turbulence on a much longer journey. His confidence stems from viewing Bitcoin not merely as another asset, but as what he calls “a generational technological invention” that uniquely merges macroeconomics with capital market innovation. Why Is Bitcoin 2026 Still a Compelling Narrative? Market corrections often test investor resolve. However, Le’s outlook for Bitcoin 2026 is built on foundational pillars beyond daily price action. He acknowledges that Bitcoin can exhibit short-term volatility similar to other risk assets. The key distinction, according to Le, is its underlying technological and economic architecture. This fundamental strength provides the basis for his long-term optimism, separating Bitcoin from assets driven purely by speculation. Le’s analysis suggests that the path to Bitcoin 2026 will be shaped by several converging factors. He anticipates a more accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve in the coming years. Furthermore, the midterm election season typically creates a risk-on environment that could benefit alternative assets. Most importantly, he points to expanding institutional adoption as a critical driver for sustained growth. What Key Drivers Support the Bitcoin 2026 Forecast? Le identifies three primary catalysts that could accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption and value appreciation leading into 2026: Monetary Policy Shift: Expectations of a more accommodative Federal Reserve could reduce pressure on risk assets and create favorable conditions for Bitcoin’s growth. Political Cycle Dynamics: The midterm election season historically correlates with increased risk appetite among investors, potentially benefiting cryptocurrency markets. Institutional Adoption Wave: Broader acceptance by traditional banks and state governments would provide unprecedented legitimacy and liquidity. These factors collectively create what Le believes is a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s maturation. The integration with traditional finance represents a paradigm shift rather than a fleeting trend. This institutional embrace could fundamentally alter how Bitcoin is perceived, valued, and utilized in the global economy by 2026. How Does Recent Volatility Affect the Bitcoin 2026 Thesis? The recent correction serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. However, Le emphasizes that long-term investors should distinguish between price noise and value signal. Historical patterns show that significant corrections often precede major rallies, particularly when fundamental adoption metrics continue strengthening. For investors targeting Bitcoin 2026, current market conditions may present strategic opportunities. The key is maintaining perspective on the multi-year horizon rather than reacting to weekly fluctuations. Le’s position suggests that temporary price dislocations don’t invalidate the broader technological and economic thesis supporting Bitcoin’s long-term potential. What Makes Bitcoin Different From Other Assets? Le’s bullish stance on Bitcoin 2026 rests on what he identifies as Bitcoin’s unique characteristics. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin combines several revolutionary features: A decentralized network immune to single-point control A predictable monetary policy encoded in its protocol Global accessibility without traditional banking barriers Verifiable scarcity that cannot be altered by any authority This combination creates what Le describes as “a new asset class” rather than simply another investment vehicle. The convergence of these attributes positions Bitcoin uniquely for the evolving digital economy of 2026 and beyond. Conclusion: The Strategic Perspective on Bitcoin 2026 Phong Le’s confidence in Bitcoin 2026 represents more than corporate optimism—it reflects a strategic assessment of technological and economic trends. While short-term volatility may test investor patience, the fundamental case for Bitcoin’s long-term growth remains intact. The coming years will likely see increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological integration that could validate Le’s bullish outlook. For investors, the key takeaway is perspective. The journey to Bitcoin 2026 will include both breakthroughs and setbacks, but the directional trend toward broader acceptance appears established. As traditional finance increasingly intersects with digital assets, Bitcoin’s role as a foundational technology seems destined to expand rather than contract. Frequently Asked Questions Why is Strategy’s CEO specifically bullish on Bitcoin for 2026? Phong Le anticipates several converging factors by 2026, including potential Federal Reserve policy shifts, political cycles that favor risk assets, and significantly broader institutional adoption by banks and governments. Does the recent price correction change the long-term outlook for Bitcoin? According to Le, short-term volatility doesn’t alter Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. He views corrections as normal market behavior within a much longer growth trajectory leading to 2026. What makes Bitcoin different from other cryptocurrency investments? Le describes Bitcoin as a “generational technological invention” that uniquely combines innovations in macroeconomics and capital markets, creating what he considers a new asset class rather than just another cryptocurrency. How important is institutional adoption for Bitcoin’s 2026 prospects? Extremely important. Le identifies adoption by traditional banks and state governments as a critical driver that would provide legitimacy, liquidity, and stability to Bitcoin markets. Should investors be concerned about Bitcoin’s volatility? While volatility requires risk management, Le suggests that investors focused on the 2026 horizon should view short-term fluctuations as noise rather than signal, provided they maintain appropriate position sizing. What are the biggest risks to the Bitcoin 2026 bullish thesis? Potential risks include unexpected regulatory changes, technological challenges, prolonged unfavorable monetary policy, or slower-than-expected institutional adoption. However, Le believes the fundamental trends support continued growth. Found this analysis insightful?

While Bitcoin maintained relative strength throughout the year, alternative Layer 1 tokens experienced brutal sell-offs that exposed structural weaknesses in tokenomics and market positioning. The report reveals a decisive shift from speculation to fundamental value creation, with the market punishing protocols unable to show genuine economic activity. Source: OAK Research User Reallocation Masks Market Stagnation The year witnessed massive user redistribution rather than overall growth, with total Monthly Active Users declining 25.15% across major chains, according to the report’s blockchain metrics analysis. Solana suffered the steepest decline, losing nearly 94 million users (a drop of more than 60%), while BNB Chain almost tripled its user base by capturing fleeing participants. Layer 2 networks experienced similar divergence. Base demonstrated the strongest growth, with TVL rising 37.2% to $4.41 billion, according to the report, solidifying its position through Coinbase’s distribution advantage. Meanwhile, Optimism saw TVL contract 63%, dropping from nearly $2 billion to $786 million as capital rotated toward more aggressive competitors. Token Performance Reflects Brutal Reality Price action told an unforgiving story. Among major Layer 1 tokens monitored since January, only two finished positive: BNB gained 18.2%. TRX rose 9.8%. The remainder suffered catastrophic losses, with Solana dropping 35.9% and newer entrants like TON and AVAX falling over 67%. Layer 2 tokens fared even worse despite technical progress. Source: OAK Research The report documents that Optimism and zkSync Era both posted declines exceeding 84%, while Polygon and Arbitrum fell by more than 73%. Only Mantle managed a modest 8.3% gain, attributed to concentrated supply control rather than fundamental strength. The report identifies several converging forces behind the decline. They can be summed up into three main reasons: Overleveraged tokenomics with continuous unlock schedules. Lack of credible value-capture mechanisms linking network usage to token demand. Institutional preference for Bitcoin and Ethereum over smaller-cap alternatives. Developer Activity Diverges From Price Despite price carnage, developer activity remained robust across select ecosystems, according to data from Electric Capital cited in the report. The EVM Stack maintained the largest developer base, with 17,473 total contributors (updated), including 5,405 full-time developers, representing over 32% of activity. Bitcoin posted the strongest two-year growth in full-time developers among major ecosystems, rising 90.5% to 1,003 contributors. Solana and the broader SVM Stack grew 75.8% over two years to 4,578 full-time developers, demonstrating sustained technical ambition despite brutal token performance. Overall, the developer ecosystem is growing, but the disconnect between their activity and token prices revealed what the report terms as “ market maturation .” Teams continued building through down cycles, but speculative capital no longer rewarded infrastructure without clear paths to revenue generation. Revenue Meta Emerges as Criterion The fundamental lesson of 2025 became inescapable, according to the report’s economic analysis. The report asserts that protocols without credible revenue streams are at risk of extinction. The industry pivoted decisively toward the “ revenue meta ,” where actual cash flows mattered more than narrative. Stablecoin issuers dominated revenue generation, accounting for 76% of income among top protocols. Tether and Circle combined generated $9.8 billion annually, while derivatives platforms like Hyperliquid added $1.1 billion through sustainable fee-based models. The report also pointed out a harsh truth that generic Layer 1s and Layer 2s lacking differentiation could not compete. Networks required 10x improvements in speed, cost, or security to justify independent existence. Outlook Remains Challenging Looking toward 2026, infrastructure tokens face continued headwinds despite regulatory clarity in key markets, the report concludes. The combination of high inflation schedules, insufficient demand for governance rights, and concentration of value capture in base layers suggests further consolidation ahead. The overall sentiment in the altcoin market heading into 2026 remains cautious, particularly as they’re experiencing a steep decline never seen before. Protocols that generate meaningful revenue may stabilize, but they remain subject to Bitcoin’s volatility and persistent unlock pressure from early investors. For existing Layer 1 tokens, the report asserts that survival depends on Ethereum and Solana, and that renewed institutional adoption might restore hope. Without leadership from market majors, generic infrastructure tokens will continue to trend toward irrelevance as capital concentrates in protocols that show economic value rather than technological novelty alone.

But how would a hypothetical investment based on his publicly discussed crypto preferences have performed this year? Scaramucci has repeatedly stated that more than 50% of his net worth is now allocated to Bitcoin, a position that grew organically from a much smaller allocation as prices surged in previous cycles. He has also highlighted Solana, Ethereum, and Avalanche as core blockchain platforms he believes will dominate the sector over the long term. Speaking on December 18, Scaramucci discussed Solana’s role in a diversified crypto portfolio, arguing that the market is reaching a stage where only a handful of major blockchains will emerge as long-term winners. He reiterated that SOL is well positioned to be one of them, alongside Bitcoin and a small group of competitors. “My largest personal position, even greater than Bitcoin, is my position in Solana and I have it all staked,” Scaramucci said, adding that he also owns Avalanche and Bitcoin, while holding only a “very small position” in Ethereum. How a $1,000 portfolio would look today Assuming a hypothetical $1,000 investment split evenly across Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum ( ETH ) , and Avalanche ( AVAX ),) at the start of 2025, the results reflect the volatility that has defined the crypto market this year. Based on approximate prices from early January 2025 and current prices as of December 25, Bitcoin is down around 6–8% year to date. Bitcoin YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum has fallen roughly 12%, Solana is down approximately 36%, and Avalanche has declined by about 66%. Bitcoin YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Taken together, the evenly weighted portfolio would now be worth roughly $680–$710, implying a loss of around 29–32% over the year. Long-term conviction vs short-term volatility While the short-term performance may disappoint, Scaramucci has consistently stressed that his investment thesis is multi-year, not cyclical. He has argued that Bitcoin is evolving into a form of digital gold, while platforms such as Solana and Avalanche represent long-term infrastructure bets rather than short-term trades. Notably, a hypothetical $1,000 investment evenly split across his f our cryptocurrencies in 2024 that included Polkadot ( DOT ) instead of ETH was worth approximately $1,595, reflecting a robust 59% gain. The hypothetical portfolio highlights a familiar crypto lesson: concentrated bets on high-growth assets can deliver outsized gains in bull markets, but they also carry sharp drawdowns when sentiment turns risk-off.

From $2.1 to $3.2 we have the biggest concentration of… pic.twitter.com/d5MYXkMqz6 — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 22, 2025 What the Heatmap Shows Right Now The heatmap highlights a clear imbalance. Below the current XRP price, liquidation levels have largely been cleared. The October 10 flash crash flushed out a large amount of downside leverage. Since then, little meaningful liquidity has been rebuilt under the asset’s price. The lower half of the chart remains sparse. Conditions look very different above it. From roughly $2.1 up to $3.2, the heatmap shows dense bands of liquidity. These bands represent stacked short positions and overleveraged traders who would face liquidation if the price rises. Arthur described this area as the largest concentration of liquidation levels XRP has seen in months. Markets tend to move toward areas where forced orders sit. When liquidity pools cluster on one side, the price often compresses before expanding in that direction. That imbalance increases the probability of an upward move driven by forced liquidations rather than organic buying. Arthur views the current range as a compression phase rather than a breakdown.

If XRP begins to move into the $2.1 to $2.5 zone with momentum, liquidation cascades could follow. Each forced close adds market orders that push prices higher . That process can extend toward higher levels where liquidity remains thick, including the $3 to $3.2 range shown on the chart. Failure to move higher would require new downside leverage to build. The heatmap does not show that yet. With little incentive for XRP to move lower, downside momentum loses fuel. Until liquidity builds for the digital asset, Arthur sees limited downside . XRP may still look quiet on standard charts. According to Arthur’s reading of the data, that calmness masks a market positioned for expansion. The next major move is more likely to be driven by leverage than sentiment. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While short-term price action continues to dominate crypto discourse, policymakers are quietly adjusting tax frameworks and regulatory structures that favor long-term digital asset participation. This shift is not driven by hype cycles, but by growing confidence that certain blockchain networks are moving from speculation toward real economic function. XRP sits at the center of this transition. That broader context was recently underscored by crypto market commentator X Finance Bull, who pointed to the alignment between favorable tax jurisdictions, advancing market infrastructure, and the increasing institutionalization of XRP. The implications extend well beyond charts, touching policy, regulation, and cross-border finance. Governments are paving tax-free roads for $XRP holders UAE, Germany, Portugal, even U.S. lawmakers. Why now? Because ETFs are live. Infrastructure is in motion. The system is preparing for real utility. Patient capital is being rewarded. Are you positioned? https://t.co/rtdrgkMwjl — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 25, 2025 Tax Jurisdictions Aligning With Long-Term Crypto Capital Several countries have already established tax environments that significantly benefit XRP holders. The United Arab Emirates stands out as the most definitive example. With no personal income tax or capital gains tax, the UAE has become a strategic base for crypto firms, payment providers, and institutional investors. XRP’s role in cross-border settlement solutions aligns naturally with the region’s ambition to be a global financial and blockchain hub. Germany offers a different but equally compelling framework. Under German tax law, cryptocurrencies held for more than one year can be sold completely tax-free. This long-standing rule applies to XRP and incentivizes patient, long-term holding rather than short-term speculation within one of Europe’s largest economies. Portugal, despite introducing taxes on short-term crypto gains, continues to exempt long-term holdings under specific conditions. For investors who meet those criteria, XRP can still be realized without capital gains tax, preserving Portugal’s relevance in the global crypto landscape. The United States and a Shifting Regulatory Tone In the United States, XRP remains subject to capital gains tax, but the policy direction has evolved. Following the formal conclusion of the Ripple–SEC case in 2025, regulatory hostility has given way to legislative engagement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While tax exemptions are not yet on the table, lawmakers are increasingly focused on market structure, asset classification, and regulatory clarity rather than enforcement-first approaches. ETFs, ETPs, and Institutional Infrastructure Market infrastructure is another critical driver. XRP-linked exchange-traded products are already live in several international markets, providing regulated exposure for institutional capital. In the U.S., multiple XRP ETF launches and structured investment products have moved the asset deeper into traditional finance discussions. Beyond investment vehicles, XRP’s utility infrastructure continues to expand. Ripple’s payment and liquidity solutions are actively used in cross-border settlement, particularly in regions prioritizing faster and cheaper financial rails. Utility Over Speculation Governments rarely adjust tax policy for purely speculative assets. The growing alignment between favorable jurisdictions and XRP adoption suggests a recognition of functional value. As X Finance Bull noted, the system appears to be preparing for utility, not hype—rewarding capital willing to wait for that transition to fully materialize.

Across the ecosystem, there were deals involving crypto exchanges, payments firms, blockchain platforms and publicly-traded entities. Many of these pursued deals aimed at fostering traction, expansion and product growth. Overall, crypto companies struck $8.6 billion in deals in 2025, notching the industry’s busiest mergers and acquisitions year. 2025 marked the busiest year in crypto deals Data from PitchBook shows that the cryptocurrency sector saw 267 transactions in 2025, including mergers, acquisitions, and strategic investments. These accounted for an 18% increase over the prior year, while the aggregate value of $8.6 billion is a quadruple of the $2.17 billion recorded in 2024. Standout deals featured Coinbase’s $2.9 billion purchase of Deribit in May, the largest acquisition in crypto history, enhancing its position in derivatives trading. The industry also saw Kraken strike a $1.5 billion acquisition of NinjaTrader, completed in May after the platform reported strong revenue growth. Ripple contributed prominently by acquiring prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion in April to bolster institutional capabilities. It also purchased stablecoin-related assets like Rail for $200 million in August. Additionally, Australian platform Swyftx acquired brokerage Caleb and Brown to target affluent clients. Grayscale also highlighted that 2025 saw some of the biggest fundraising deals so far. The chart below shows the leading deals.

Improved regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions allowed established players to pursue growth via acquisitions, bypassing slow approval processes for new licenses. Analysts point to transformative policies under President Donald Trump’s administration, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoin oversight and initiatives like a national digital asset reserve.

With inflows rising, leading firms targeted niche players offering expertise, innovative tech, or existing approvals to align with future strategies. Growing institutional participation heightened needs for robust infrastructure in areas like settlement, custody, and risk management. This drove acquisitions of firms already serving traditional finance clients, fostering hybrid services blending fintech and blockchain. Looking ahead to 2026: What’s next? Analysts anticipate 2026 as a pivotal year for major public listings and the rise of integrated global platforms. Potential offerings from Kraken, Revolut, and possibly Ripple could release significant liquidity while affirming elevated valuations. Consolidation is expected to focus on acquiring regulated exchanges and custodians worldwide, as conventional banks and payment providers seek to launch full-suite crypto offerings amid favorable rules. Investment flows should concentrate on tokenizing real-world assets, decentralized AI systems, and stablecoin-based payments, with reduced funding for high-risk speculative projects. Venture activity and overall funding volumes are projected to surge further, assuming stable economic conditions. Ultimately, the sector is maturing into a foundational element of international finance.

Russia is on a definitive path to launch regulated crypto trading by 2026, with its two premier financial hubs—the Moscow Exchange and the St. Petersburg Exchange—leading the charge. This move signals a pivotal moment where a major global power begins to formally integrate digital assets into its mainstream financial system. What Does Russia’s Roadmap for Regulated Crypto Trading Look Like? The plan follows a clear roadmap from the Bank of Russia. The central bank has set a legislative deadline of July 1, 2026, to establish the legal framework. This structured approach aims to bring clarity and security to a market that has previously operated in a gray area. The goal is to create a safe environment for investors while maintaining state oversight. Both exchanges are not waiting for the final law to pass. They are proactively building the necessary infrastructure. The Moscow Exchange is currently developing a dedicated trading and settlement platform for cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the St. Petersburg Exchange has confidently stated it already possesses the required technical systems to begin regulated crypto trading once the green light is given. Who Can Trade and What Are the Limits? A key feature of Russia’s framework is the creation of a two-tier system for investors. This distinction aims to protect everyday users while giving experienced players more freedom. Retail Investors: Access will be limited to a pre-approved selection of cryptocurrencies. Authorities will likely curate a list of coins deemed sufficiently stable and compliant. Qualified Investors: This group, which typically includes institutional players and high-net-worth individuals, will face no trading limits on the exchange platform. However, Russian authorities draw a firm line at one critical use case. They will continue to prohibit the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for everyday payments within the country. This means you cannot legally buy a coffee with crypto, but you can invest in it through these regulated channels. Why is This Move Toward Regulated Crypto Trading Significant? This development is a strategic masterstroke for Russia. First, it brings a massive, tech-savvy population into the fold of formal regulated crypto trading . This can boost liquidity and legitimize the asset class domestically. Second, it allows the government to monitor and tax transactions that were previously off the books, creating a new revenue stream. For global observers, Russia’s embrace of a regulated model, while banning crypto payments, offers a fascinating blueprint. It shows how a nation can seek to harness the investment potential of digital assets while strictly controlling their use as currency to protect its national monetary system. What Challenges Lie Ahead Before 2026? The path to 2026 is not without hurdles. The government must finalize and pass complex legislation that defines everything from custody rules to anti-money laundering protocols. The exchanges must ensure their platforms are secure, scalable, and interoperable with existing financial systems. Furthermore, gaining public trust after years of regulatory uncertainty will be crucial for the success of this regulated crypto trading ecosystem. In conclusion, Russia’s 2026 target for regulated crypto trading marks a decisive turn from ambiguity to structure. By leveraging its established financial exchanges, the country is positioning itself to capture the economic benefits of cryptocurrencies while imposing its own rules. The world will be watching closely as this ambitious plan unfolds, potentially inspiring similar frameworks elsewhere. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When will regulated crypto trading officially start in Russia? A: The related legislation is scheduled to be in place by July 1, 2026, with trading expected to commence around that time. Q: Which Russian exchanges are involved? A: The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and the St. Petersburg Exchange are the two primary platforms preparing for the launch. Q: Can I use Bitcoin to pay for goods in Russia after 2026? A> No. Russian authorities explicitly state they will continue to prohibit the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for domestic goods and services. Q: What is the difference between a retail and a qualified investor in this context? A: Retail investors are the general public and will have limits on which coins they can trade. Qualified investors (like institutions) will have no trading limits on the approved exchange platform. Q: Why is Russia doing this now? A: The move aims to bring a large, informal crypto economy under regulatory oversight, allowing for taxation, investor protection, and the formal integration of digital assets into the financial system.

Due to the large transformation, people who research the markets believe that the next crypto to explode in the year 2026 will be Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This project has done a very good job and has raised a whopping $19.5 million from the inception of its special sale. At the moment, more than 18,580 people own these tokens, and the project is becoming a leading light for the new ways of lending or borrowing crypto. Since the market is seeking stability, people are rushing to identify the best crypto to buy now since they wish to join the growing team. Presale Demand Soars as Phase 6 Approaches Capacity The most significant piece of information for people who are interested in joining the project is that the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has almost been concluded for the ongoing phase. Currently, Phase 6 is 99% full. This indicates that the opportunity to acquire the tokens only for $0.035 will soon be over. After this phase gets over, the cost of the tokens will increase to $0.040 in the next phase. It is a substantial increase in the cost of the tokens. Therefore, it is a much better decision to acquire the tokens before the cost increases. The money of people who join the project early is likely to increase a lot since it will be trading at $0.06 at launch. Since Phase 6 tokens are selling out so fast, it is an indication that individuals trust that the next cryptocurrency to explode is MUTM. Additionally, the project has ensured that buying tokens becomes easy for everyone. Now you can use your bank card to buy the tokens with no restrictions whatsoever. The convenience of buying the tokens is the reason why many people trust that this is the best crypto to buy currently. Dual Lending Architecture and V1 Protocol Another reason why this project is unique is that it has a brand-new system for lending and borrowing money. The system relies on two different models that would facilitate people differently: one model for more stable cryptos such as ETH and USDT, and another model for riskier assets like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. This is because it caters to different people with different needs. The project team have stated that V1 protocol will be initiated at the Sepolia testnet during Q4 2025. The new platform it will provide will allow users to test features such as liquidity pools and bot. Community Incentives & $100,000 Giveaway But to add more thrill to it, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering plenty of prizes too. The most prominent prize is their $100,000 giveaway, with ten people receiving $10,000 each. In addition, they have an everyday board showing who is contributing the most. And the person at the top of the entire list receives an additional $500 in MUTM tokens if they’ve made at least one trade during the day. This is to ensure that more people participate in the excitement of this new cryptocurrency. With the presale coming to an end soon in the current phase, having a good plan for the future, and with huge prizes being offered, this is a good time to join. After Phase 6 is completed, this $0.035 price will never be seen again. If you are looking for the best crypto to buy, get in before prices go up.

He noted that while Bitcoin and Ethereum faced heavy outflows, XRP attracted $62.9 million in fresh capital. Xaif described the move as “XRP stealing the show,” pointing to the inflows as evidence of deliberate positioning despite market uncertainty. The image Xaif shared shows CoinShares data on digital asset flows. It shows weekly, month-to-date, and year-to-date positioning across major crypto products. The numbers track institutional and fund-level activity rather than retail noise. Xaif shared the data as evidence of intentional positioning, not random rotation. XRP STEALING THE SHOW While the market bleeds and uncertainty grows… $XRP attracts $62.9M in inflows $ETH & $BTC seeing heavy outflows, yet smart money rotates into $XRP This isn’t noise this is positioning before the move pic.twitter.com/2D8ub0kBEL — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 22, 2025 XRP Records Inflows While Leaders See Exits According to the data, XRP recorded $62.9 million in weekly inflows. Bitcoin saw $460 million in weekly outflows. Ethereum posted $555.1 million in outflows over the same period. These moves occurred while total weekly flows across crypto products fell to -$952 million. Xaif focused on this divergence. He described the XRP inflow as capital moving with purpose rather than chasing short-term price action. Bitcoin and Ethereum bled capital, and XRP absorbed it. Month-to-date figures strengthen that view. XRP shows $354.6 million in inflows. Bitcoin stands at $410 million month-to-date, but that figure masks the recent reversal. Ethereum remains negative at -$180.1 million for the month. Xaif emphasized that XRP attracted capital despite increasing uncertainty among investors. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the Rotation Means for XRP Xaif described the move as “positioning before the move.” Large investors often rotate early. XRP receiving inflows while other large assets see exits suggests selective investment rather than broad speculation. XRP has seen notable whale activity recently, and these large investors could be gearing up for a massive move. Year-to-date numbers add context. XRP products show $3.244 billion in inflows. That places XRP close to Solana at $3.505 billion despite a smaller product footprint. Assets under management (AUM) for XRP products stand at $2.946 billion. This remains modest relative to Bitcoin but large enough to reflect sustained demand . Bitcoin still dominates total AUM at $137.654 billion. Ethereum follows at $24.561 billion. Yet flows reveal where new capital goes, not where legacy capital sits. Xaif’s point rests on that distinction. Investors are confident in XRP’s future , and it does not need to lead in size to lead in demand. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Coinglass, the leading analytics platform, has released its definitive 2025 report, and the findings are staggering. Summarized by on-chain analyst AmberCN, the data reveals a sector that has matured at a breathtaking pace, dominated by institutional players and record-breaking volumes. If you trade crypto futures or options, this report is your essential guide to understanding the forces that moved the market last year. What Does the 2025 Crypto Derivatives Market Report Reveal? The headline number is impossible to ignore. In 2025, the total trading volume for the crypto derivatives market reached an astonishing $85.7 trillion. That translates to a daily average of $264.5 billion, showcasing relentless activity. However, this growth came with volatility. The report notes that the total notional value of liquidated long and short positions hit $150 billion for the year. Daily liquidations typically ranged between $400 million and $500 million, with intense concentration during October and November. This period likely coincided with major market moves, reminding traders of the high-stakes nature of derivatives trading. Who Dominated the Crypto Derivatives Landscape in 2025? The competition among exchanges remains fierce. According to the Coinglass report, the top five centralized platforms by activity were: Binance OKX Bitget Bybit Gate This ranking underscores the continued concentration of liquidity and user base in a handful of major venues. For traders, this means these platforms are critical for accessing deep order books and competitive pricing in the crypto derivatives market . How Did Institutional Players Like DATs Impact Bitcoin? Perhaps the most significant trend of 2025 was the monumental rise of Digital Asset Trusts (DATs). The report declares 2025 as “the year of DATs.” These institutional vehicles aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, increasing their holdings from 600,000 BTC at the start of the year to 1.05 million BTC by November. This means DATs now control approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply. Their massive, sustained buying represents a fundamental shift in market structure, providing a substantial layer of institutional demand beneath the price. This activity is a key driver analyzed within the broader crypto derivatives market context, as their spot holdings influence futures and options sentiment. What Are the Emerging Trends Beyond Traditional Derivatives? The Coinglass 2025 report looks beyond standard futures and options to identify explosive growth in adjacent sectors. Two areas stand out: Crypto Prediction Markets: These platforms, where users bet on real-world outcomes, are expected to surpass $52 billion in cumulative trading volume. Their growth signals a demand for novel, speculative financial instruments. On-Chain U.S. Stock Tokens (RWA): The Real-World Asset (RWA) sector saw a sharp spike in interest for tokenized versions of traditional stocks. This bridges the gap between crypto and conventional finance. Furthermore, the report makes a bold projection: decentralized derivatives (perpetuals, options on protocols like dYdX or GMX) are poised to move past the proof-of-concept stage. In 2026 and beyond, they are expected to actively compete with centralized exchanges for market share, driven by demands for transparency and self-custody. Key Takeaways from the 2025 Crypto Derivatives Analysis The Coinglass report paints a picture of a complex, multi-faceted crypto derivatives market . It is a market defined by colossal scale, increasing institutionalization, and rapid innovation. The dominance of DATs in Bitcoin accumulation creates a new price floor dynamic. Meanwhile, the rise of prediction markets and RWAs shows the ecosystem is expanding its scope. For the savvy participant, understanding these flows is no longer optional. The data provides a crucial map for navigating the opportunities and risks in one of finance’s most dynamic arenas. The evolution of the crypto derivatives market continues to be the main story for professional traders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was the total trading volume for the crypto derivatives market in 2025? According to the Coinglass report, the total trading volume reached approximately $85.7 trillion for the year 2025. How much Bitcoin do Digital Asset Trusts (DATs) hold now? DATs increased their Bitcoin holdings from 600,000 BTC at the start of 2025 to 1.05 million BTC by November, accounting for about 5% of the total Bitcoin supply. Which exchanges were the top five in the crypto derivatives market? The top five centralized exchanges ranked in the report were Binance, OKX, Bitget, Bybit, and Gate. What are the emerging trends highlighted in the report? The report highlights significant growth in crypto prediction markets (expected to exceed $52 billion in volume) and on-chain U.S. stock tokens in the RWA sector. It also projects decentralized derivatives will begin competing for market share. What was the average daily liquidation value in 2025? Daily liquidations in the crypto derivatives market averaged between $400 million and $500 million, with a total of $150 billion liquidated for the year.

Taxes, market timing, and long-term conviction often make selling Bitcoin or Ethereum the least attractive option. By 2026, instant crypto credit lines have become a practical alternative. Instead of locking yourself into a fixed loan, these products let you borrow against your crypto on demand, repay at your own pace, and keep exposure to potential upside. This review explains how crypto credit lines work, why Clapp stands out as a leading European crypto loan provider , and what risks to consider before using one. What Is a Crypto Credit Line? A crypto credit line is different from a traditional loan. Instead of receiving a lump sum with fixed repayment terms, you: Deposit crypto as collateral Receive a borrowing limit based on a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio Draw funds only when needed Pay interest only on the amount you actually use Think of it as a secured overdraft backed by Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other assets. This structure has become popular in Europe because it offers flexibility and cost control, especially during volatile markets. Why Credit Lines Are Replacing Fixed Crypto Loans Fixed-term crypto loans still exist, but they come with trade-offs: Interest starts accruing immediately on the full amount Repayment schedules are rigid Early repayment does not always reduce total cost Credit lines solve these issues by design. Key advantages: No interest on unused funds No forced borrowing Funds available instantly once collateral is deposited Easy partial repayments without penalties For users who need liquidity occasionally rather than continuously, this model is often more efficient. Leading Crypto Credit Line Providers in Europe (2026) Clapp — Credit Lines Built for Flexibility Clapp is one of the leading solutions in Europe for crypto holders seeking liquidity without relinquishing long-term exposure to their assets. Unlike traditional fixed-term loans, Clapp’s core offering is a revolving crypto credit line—an unsecured borrowing mechanism that gives users access to cash or stablecoins on demand, with interest charged only on the amount they actually use. How to get a credit line at Clapp Deposit crypto Receive a credit limit Borrow EUR or stablecoins on demand Interest applies only to drawn funds Why Clapp Credit Line stands out No fixed repayment schedule Clear cost structure Designed for European users, including euro payouts Suitable for both short-term and ongoing liquidity needs Who is Clapp Credit Line Best for? Long-term crypto holders Users who want optional access to cash without commitment Comparing Credit Line Models Feature Credit Line Fixed Crypto Loan Interest on unused funds No Yes Repayment schedule Flexible Fixed Liquidity access On demand One-time Cost control High Lower Risk management User-driven Platform-driven For most users seeking flexibility, credit lines are the more forgiving option. Risks You Should Not Ignore Instant access does not mean zero risk. Key points to consider: Market volatility: Falling prices can push your LTV toward liquidation Custodial risk: Centralized platforms hold your collateral Overborrowing: Easy access can lead to excessive leverage Policy changes: Platforms can adjust risk parameters during market stress The safest approach is maintaining low LTV usage and treating credit lines as a liquidity tool, not leverage. Final Thoughts By 2026, instant crypto credit lines in Europe have matured into practical financial tools rather than experimental products. The strongest platforms focus on clarity, flexibility, and predictable risk management, not aggressive leverage. Used conservatively, a crypto credit line can provide cash flow without forcing difficult decisions about selling assets. Used recklessly, it can amplify losses just as quickly.

While traders are betting on a move higher, Ethereum’s near-term price action remains uncertain. The outcome of this options expiry could help shape ETH’s next big move, either to the upside or down to lower levels—particularly as investors reassess their expectations following November’s volatility and choppy conditions. The price of Ethereum is currently sitting above $2,900 as a massive options expiration worth roughly $6 billion approaches. This event is expected to play a major role in shaping short-term price action and could influence investor sentiment heading into 2026. Ethereum Options Set To Expire This Friday Data from the derivatives platform Laevitas show that $6 billion in ETH options will expire on Friday, 26 December, with call positions outnumbering puts by more than 2.2 times. Despite this imbalance, bears still hold the edge unless Ethereum’s price moves decisively above $3,100. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Supply Just Crashed To New Lows, Why This Is Bullish For Price Earlier this year, many traders had positioned for Ethereum to surge significantly by year-end. However, those bullish expectations were undermined by a massive November decline, leaving ETH’s current options expiry vulnerable to further downside pressure. While call options still dominate Open Interest (OI), many of these positions would expire worthless if the Ethereum price fails to recover and push higher. This creates a fragile setup and leaves the market in a delicate position, where overly optimistic bets could quickly unwind if key price levels do not hold. Notably, the $3,100 price level has emerged as a critical pivot ahead of the options expiration set for this Friday. Traders have called this level “max pain,” as it represents the price at which the most options contracts would expire worthless. A close below this zone could give bears control and potentially open the door to further price declines. On the other hand, a clean break above $3,100 could flip momentum rapidly. Presently, around $3.8 billion in ETH options are expected to expire on Deribit, the world’s largest Bitcoin and Ethereum options exchange. In addition, more than $23.6 billion in Bitcoin options are scheduled to expire on Friday, potentially adding significant volatility to the already fragile market. Analyst Expect Further Volatility For Ethereum With the massive $6 billion Ethereum options expiry on the horizon, traders appear to be bracing for significant market volatility, as the event could trigger a sharp, decisive move in ETH’s price. Separately, crypto analyst Ted Pillows anticipates further volatility for ETH if its price moves in either of two key directions.

Any platform failing to do so this year will soon find itself operating outside the law in the Baltic state, which is now serious about enforcing European rules. Lithuania sets deadline for crypto companies’ compliance with MiCA All entities providing crypto-related services in Lithuania are obliged to have a license, and the monetary authority in Vilnius has urged them not to wait until the very last moment to apply for one. A transitional period, allowing businesses active in the space, such as cryptocurrency exchange and wallet operators, to secure the necessary authorization, expires at the end of 2025. The Central Bank of Lithuania (CBL) recently reminded participants in the market that this is not merely a recommendation, but a mandatory requirement, regional media noted this week. The licensing regime was introduced through legislation transposing the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation into national law. After the December 31 deadline, measures will be taken against those that continue to work unlicensed, including fines, blocking of websites and even criminal prosecution, the leading Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media detailed in a report on Wednesday. In a notice, Lietuvos Bankas called on platforms that do not intend to file license applications to take steps to ensure they terminate their activities smoothly. Dalia Juškevičienė, head of the CBL’s Investment Services and Undertakings Supervision Division suggested: “Participants of the crypto-asset services market that do not plan to continue their operations should not delay and launch active communication campaigns to ensure that all of their clients are properly and timely informed of the winding down.” She insisted users should be well-informed on the timeframe of the process and receive detailed instructions on how to transfer their fiat funds and cryptocurrency holdings elsewhere. The executive added that customers must also be offered an option to exchange their digital coins and have the money transferred to a custodian of their choice or self-hosted wallets. The press release emphasized: “Operators should take all possible steps to ensure that assets belonging to their clients are returned before they are no longer authorized to provide crypto-asset-related services.” Failure to comply with regulations may result in criminal liability Onboarding new users and accepting crypto assets as well as the continued provision of related services without a MiCA license will be deemed to constitute illegal financial activities from January 1, stressed the Central Bank of Lithuania. The regulator also warned that under the country’s criminal code, these are punishable by way of fines and even imprisonment for up to four years. Furthermore, Lietuvos Bankas remarked it’s empowered to restrict access to the websites of companies suspected of providing financial services outside the law. The monetary authority maintains a database of such entities and notifies relevant law enforcement agencies about any potentially criminal activities in the industry. Less than 10% of all Lithuanian crypto businesses have applied for license Only about 30 organizations have so far applied for a license to operate in the cryptocurrency sector from the CBL, the announcement revealed. That’s out of more than 370 entities officially registered as crypto service providers, although only about 120 of them are actually active and reporting revenues. The Bank of Lithuania highlighted it has issued a special guidance for all these operators on the upcoming changes to “protect the interests of investors and ensure the transparency and integrity of the crypto-asset market.” Lithuania has been trying to establish itself as one of the EU member states serving as MiCA gateways for crypto businesses from around the world. The Baltic nation was recently listed among the top three jurisdictions in the 2025 World Crypto Rankings report produced by crypto exchange Bybit. Its northern neighbor, Latvia, is another representative of the region with similar aspirations. Earlier in December, the country unveiled that the annual turnover in its fintech sector now reaches €400 million, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Borrowing EUR against crypto allows investors to access liquidity without selling assets, avoid taxable events in some jurisdictions, and maintain long-term exposure. How borrowing EUR against crypto works Crypto-backed lending follows a simple structure: You deposit crypto as collateral (BTC, ETH, or stablecoins). The platform assigns a loan-to-value ratio (LTV). You receive EUR via SEPA transfer or an internal EUR balance. You repay the loan plus interest to unlock your collateral. There is no credit check. The loan is secured entirely by crypto. If the value of your collateral falls below the required threshold, the platform may issue a margin call or liquidate part of the collateral. Centralized platforms remain the main EUR gateway In Europe, direct EUR borrowing still happens primarily through centralized lenders. They provide banking integrations, predictable withdrawals, and familiar user flows. In return, users place collateral under platform custody. Decentralized protocols offer alternatives through EUR-pegged stablecoins, but for users who need euros in a bank account, centralized platforms remain the practical option. Top European crypto lending platforms for EUR borrowing Clapp — Flexible credit line with pay-as-you-use interest Clapp takes a different approach to crypto-backed borrowing. Instead of issuing fixed loans, it provides a revolving credit line secured by crypto collateral. Users set a credit limit and pay interest only on the amount they actually draw, not on the full available line. Unused credit carries a 0% APR. When borrowed funds are repaid, the available credit is immediately restored. There is no fixed repayment schedule, and funds can be drawn or released at any time directly from the Clapp Wallet . Clapp supports multi-collateral borrowing, allowing users to combine up to 19 assets into a single credit line. This includes BTC, ETH, SOL, and major stablecoins. Collateral composition can be adjusted without closing the position. From a regulatory perspective, Clapp holds a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in the Czech Republic, confirming its status as a licensed crypto loan provider within the EU. The result is a borrowing framework built around flexibility. Liquidity remains available at all times, collateral is not locked into rigid terms, and interest accrues only when capital is in use. For users seeking EUR liquidity without forced selling or inflexible loan structures, Clapp offers a cost-efficient and controlled setup. Nexo Nexo is one of the most established crypto lending platforms available to European users. It offers revolving credit lines rather than fixed-term loans, allowing borrowers to draw and repay funds as needed. EUR withdrawals are supported via SEPA. Interest rates depend on collateral type, LTV, and account tier. The platform supports a wide range of crypto assets and stablecoins. Nexo suits users who want broad asset support and immediate EUR access within a mature lending environment. YouHodler YouHodler follows a more traditional loan structure. Loans are issued with fixed terms and predefined LTV thresholds, including higher ratios for stablecoin collateral. This model provides clarity around repayment and liquidation mechanics but limits flexibility. Loans must be managed within set durations, and early repayment conditions should be reviewed in advance. YouHodler works best for users who prefer clearly defined loan parameters and higher borrowing capacity against stable assets. Binance Loans Binance offers crypto-backed loans as part of its broader ecosystem. Rates are competitive, and collateral selection is extensive. EUR availability depends on regional regulation and account eligibility. For users already holding assets on Binance, loans can be accessed without moving funds externally. New users should confirm EUR withdrawal availability before committing collateral. DeFi option: borrowing EUR-pegged assets Protocols such as Aave allow users to lock crypto and borrow EUR-pegged stablecoins like EURC or agEUR. These assets can be converted to euros through exchanges. This route avoids custodial risk but introduces smart contract risk, variable rates, and additional conversion steps. It suits users comfortable with self-custody and on-chain mechanics. Risk considerations Liquidation risk remains the primary concern when borrowing against crypto. Higher LTV increases borrowing power but reduces tolerance for price volatility. Custodial risk applies to centralized platforms. Regulatory coverage and EUR withdrawal terms vary by country. A conservative LTV and clear understanding of liquidation thresholds reduce downside exposure. How to choose the right platform When comparing European crypto lenders, practical criteria matter more than headline rates: Direct SEPA EUR withdrawals Transparent liquidation rules Predictable interest calculation Clear EU regulatory standing Platforms that prioritize flexibility and transparency tend to suit long-term holders better than short-term leverage strategies. Final perspective Borrowing EUR against crypto has become a standard liquidity tool for European investors. The mechanics are well established, but outcomes depend on structure and discipline. Platforms like Clapp introduce a more flexible credit-line model that aligns borrowing costs with actual usage. More traditional lenders continue to serve users who prefer familiar loan formats.

After years of regulatory pressure, shifting narratives, and delayed infrastructure rollouts, XRP is once again drawing focused attention—not because of sudden price spikes, but due to a growing alignment of macro, regulatory, and market-cycle forces. As investors reassess which assets are best positioned to benefit from the next expansion phase, XRP has reemerged as a serious contender. That renewed focus intensified after YoungHoon Kim, the South Korean intellectual widely recognized online for holding the world’s highest recorded IQ , shared a forward-looking perspective on XRP’s market trajectory via X. Rather than offering speculative price targets, Kim anchored his outlook around timing—specifically when XRP could realistically reach a new all-time high based on broader systemic conditions. Many signals point toward a potential ATH for #XRP in Jan 2026. — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 24, 2025 Market Cycles and the January 2026 Window Historically, the cryptocurrency market has followed a well-documented rhythm driven by Bitcoin halving cycles. Major altcoins tend to peak 12 to 18 months after a halving event , as liquidity rotates outward from Bitcoin into assets with higher beta and stronger narratives. With Bitcoin’s most recent halving occurring in April 2024, this cycle naturally points toward late 2025 and early 2026 as a potential altcoin climax period. XRP’s structure fits this timing particularly well. Unlike many tokens that rally early on speculation, XRP has historically lagged until clarity and infrastructure catch up—then moved aggressively once those barriers are removed. January 2026 sits squarely within that historically significant window. Regulatory Clarity Changes the Equation A defining shift for XRP occurred in 2025 with the effective conclusion of the Ripple–SEC legal battle. With appeals withdrawn and no further litigation pending, XRP entered a new era of regulatory certainty in the U.S.—a development that fundamentally alters its risk profile for institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This resolution coincides with a broader global trend toward clearer digital asset regulation, particularly in regions prioritizing blockchain-based payment infrastructure. For XRP, regulatory clarity is not a narrative boost—it is a functional prerequisite for scale. Infrastructure Finally Aligns With Utility Beyond legal progress, XRP’s ecosystem has matured materially. The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin in December 2024, advances in tokenization, and expanding XRPL liquidity frameworks have strengthened XRP’s role as a settlement-focused asset rather than a purely speculative one. These developments provide the foundation required to sustain higher valuations during late-cycle market expansions. A Convergence, Not a Prediction Kim’s timeline does not present January 2026 as a guaranteed outcome, but as a convergence point—where market cycles, infrastructure readiness, and regulatory clarity may finally align. For XRP holders and observers, the significance lies less in the date itself and more in what the timeline represents: a shift from uncertainty to structural readiness. As history has shown, new all-time highs are rarely born from hype alone. They emerge when conditions quietly lock into place—and XRP may be closer to that moment than many realize.

In practice, it usually refers not to free borrowing, but to a standby credit structure where interest applies only when funds are actually used. Standby crypto credit lines change how borrowing works by separating access to capital from the cost of using it. This distinction explains how 0% interest is possible—and when it applies. What “0% Interest” Means in Crypto Lending In most cases, 0% interest does not mean that borrowed funds are free indefinitely. Instead, it means: No interest on unused credit Interest applies only after withdrawal Cost depends on how much capital is actually used This model contrasts with fixed crypto loans, where interest accrues on the full amount from the moment the loan is issued. Fixed Crypto Loans vs Standby Credit Lines A fixed crypto loan works in a simple but rigid way. You deposit collateral, receive a lump sum, and begin paying interest immediately on the full balance. A standby credit line works differently. You deposit collateral and receive a credit limit, not a loan. Borrowing is optional. If no funds are withdrawn, no interest accrues. This is where the 0% figure comes from: unused credit carries no cost. How Standby Crypto Credit Lines Work A standby crypto credit line follows a revolving structure: Crypto is deposited as collateral A credit limit is assigned based on LTV Funds can be withdrawn at any time Interest applies only to withdrawn amounts Repayment restores available credit The credit line remains open, even when unused. This structure suits users who want liquidity available without committing to interest payments in advance. Clapp’s Standby Credit Line Clapp offers a standby crypto credit line that reflects this model clearly. Users deposit crypto and receive a revolving credit limit. Withdrawals are optional. Any unused portion of the credit line carries a 0% APR. Interest applies only to the amount withdrawn, with annual rates starting as low as 2.9%, depending on LTV. Clapp also allows users to combine up to 19 cryptocurrencies into a single collateral pool, which improves capital efficiency for diversified portfolios. There are no fees on crypto or fiat deposits, and no fixed repayment schedule. Risks and Considerations A 0% interest structure does not remove risk. Key factors include: Market volatility affecting collateral value Loan-to-value thresholds Liquidation rules Managing LTV conservatively and avoiding unnecessary withdrawals helps reduce risk exposure. Final Thoughts 0% interest crypto loans are best understood as 0% interest access, not free borrowing. Standby credit lines separate availability from cost. Platforms like Clapp show how this model allows users to keep liquidity on hand while paying interest only when capital is actually used. For users who want flexibility and cost control rather than rigid loan terms, standby crypto credit lines offer a more practical approach to borrowing.

Investors are on the lookout, seeking where funds are gravitating instead. In this article, the spotlight falls on three cryptocurrencies poised for potential gains. Dive in to uncover the leading coins that could thrive in these uncertain times. Mantle (MNT) Shows Strong Potential with Recent Price Movement Source: tradingview Mantle is currently dancing between the price range of about $1.09 and $1.30. While it faced a bit of a setback this past week, dropping over ten percent, its long-term trajectory shows promise with a six-month increase over seventy-five percent. Positioned above its 10-day simple moving average, it hints at a possible continued upward trend. With its nearest resistance at $1.42, a push upwards could see MNT rising by more than fifteen percent. If momentum shifts further, the next target might be around $1.62, which would signify a growth of about twenty-five percent from its lower range. However, investors are keeping an eye on the support level around $1.01 for stability. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Holds Steady Amid Market Uncertainty Source: tradingview Hyperliquid (HYPE) is hovering between $21.52 and $28.86. This stability is observed despite a recent month's drop by over 27%. With its current price near the simple moving averages, HYPE faces resistance at $32.88, a checkpoint for bullish momentum. If it can clear this hurdle and reach the second resistance at $40.22, it would mean an impressive rise of roughly 40%. However, caution is warranted as it has already slid over 32% in the past six months. The RSI near mid-point suggests neither overbuying nor overselling, leaving room for potential upward movement if market conditions improve. Bitcoin Cash Eyes Potential Growth as Price Steadies Above $530 Source: tradingview Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading within the $530 to $640 range, showing stability. Its value has increased by almost 7% over the past week. If it breaks past its closest resistance at around $690, it could climb further to the next resistance of approximately $800, representing a potential gain of around 25% from the current price. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages almost align, indicating consistent support. Current indicators show strength, but the RSI level suggests it may be closer to being overbought. Investors are watching closely, eyeing the possible upward trend if market conditions remain favorable. Conclusion MNT, HYPE, and BCH stand out as significant players amidst the current market trends. Each of these coins has unique strengths and potential for growth. MNT shows promise with its innovative features. HYPE attracts attention with its community-focused approach. BCH remains a strong contender due to its established presence. These coins are worth watching closely for future opportunities. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Timing is everything in the crypto world, and history shows that early participation can turn modest investments into life-changing gains. From legendary tokens like Dogecoin to emerging altcoins like APEMARS ($APRZ), investors who act early are often the ones who capture the most significant upside. Dogecoin’s meteoric rise from a community-driven experiment to a household name is a perfect example of the power of early entry. Those who recognized its viral appeal and jumped in at fractions of a cent enjoyed astronomical returns, while latecomers missed the chance to benefit from this classic “missed ICO” moment. Today, APEMARS offers a similar best crypto opportunity, combining structured early access, a thriving community, and strategic growth potential. With the whitelist now live, early investors can position themselves for exponential growth before wider market adoption drives prices higher. Dogecoin: The Missed ICO That Turned Early Investors Into Millionaires Dogecoin started as a fun, community-driven experiment, but early adopters quickly discovered its massive potential. Those who got in at the very beginning, when DOGE was priced at fractions of a cent, witnessed astronomical gains as the coin surged to an all-time high of $0.73. Investors who recognized its viral appeal, community momentum, and growing mainstream interest were able to turn minimal investments into substantial returns, showcasing the power of early-stage crypto opportunities. Today, Dogecoin’s initial coin offering is widely regarded as a classic “missed ICO” moment. Many retail investors entered the market only after the coin had already gained significant attention and skyrocketed in price, missing out on the early-stage upside that could have yielded life-changing gains. This serves as a crucial lesson: timing is everything in crypto, and early access to projects like APEMARS ($APRZ) represents the kind of opportunity investors shouldn’t miss. The only question here is whether Dogecoin is still the best crypto to buy now or not. APEMARS Whitelist Live: Don’t Miss This First-Mover Opportunity Just like early Dogecoin investors reaped massive rewards, APEMARS ($APRZ) offers a rare opportunity to get in before the public market opens. With its whitelist now live, early participants can secure Stage 1 tokens at $0.00001699, positioning themselves for potential exponential growth before wider adoption drives prices higher.

Because each presale stage increases the price and tightens allocations, the whitelist being live now matters; it’s the simplest way to position early ahead of Stage 1 and avoid entering at higher prices in later stages.

As it hovers near a key price point, questions arise about its potential to climb back above $0.60 next quarter. This article delves into the factors influencing ADA's future, offering insights into whether this digital currency could stage a significant rebound. Cardano (ADA) Shows Potential Amidst Current Price Slump Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between 34 and 40 cents. Its recent performance shows a drop by over 17% this month, adding to a significant fall over the past six months. With the nearest resistance level not far at nearly 43.5 cents, ADA could climb about 10% if it breaks through. The second resistance suggests a potential rise to nearly 50 cents, marking a possible 25% gain. Recent indicators like the RSI and Stochastic scores hint that ADA might be oversold, which could lead to a positive shift. If ADA can find support at around 31 cents, it could set the stage for a rebound. Conclusion ADA has shown potential in recent weeks. Current trends and market signals suggest a gradual rise. If positive momentum continues, ADA could see a recovery above $0.60. Investors will need patience and close monitoring of market conditions.

Total cryptocurrency market capitalization has risen by around 0.7%, reaching approximately $3.04 trillion, while 24-hour trading volume stands at about $69.9 billion, according to market data. TLDR: The crypto market rose today, with total market capitalization up ~0.7% to $3.04T; AI-related tokens remain under heavy pressure, down about 75% year over year; Bitcoin optimism was briefly boosted by Elon Musk’s forecast of strong US economic growth in 2026; BTC continues to consolidate below key resistance, with support around $86K–$87K; ETH remains range-bound below $3,000, with muted volume and key support near $2,800–$2,700; Market sentiment stays cautious, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index at 28 (fear); US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $175.3M in net outflows; US spot Ether ETFs also lost $52.7M; Russia’s major exchanges confirmed readiness for regulated crypto trading. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, most major cryptocurrencies are trading in the green over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 0.7%, changing hands at $87,414, holding firm near recent highs. Ethereum (ETH) is flat on the day, trading at $2,924, but has gained 3.2% over the past week. BNB (BNB) has climbed 0.5% to $840, while XRP (XRP) is up 0.6%, trading at $1.87. Solana (SOL) added 0.3%, now priced at $121.76, though it remains down over the past seven days. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose 0.2% to $0.127, continuing its gradual recovery. Looking at stronger movers, Beefy (BIFI) led the market, surging 197% to $312.55, making it both the top gainer and one of the most actively trending assets. ZER0BASE followed with a 69.9% jump to $0.1533, while Minidoge gained 73.3%, trading at $0.878. On the downside, losses among large-cap assets were limited. Cardano (ADA) slipped 0.7% to $0.357, while WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) fell 0.3% to $56.51. TRON (TRX) was down 1.1%, trading at $0.2796, marking the weakest performance among the top 10. Meanwhile, after a breakout rally across 2023 and much of 2024, artificial intelligence–focused crypto tokens have swung sharply in the opposite direction. A new report shows the sector has entered a deep correction , erasing tens of billions of dollars in value as investor appetite cooled and market conditions tightened. AI-focused crypto tokens have lost about 75% of their value year over year, erasing roughly $53 billion from the market. #AI #Crypto https://t.co/5p2WxOJlvA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 25, 2025 Data compiled by CryptoPresales.com shows AI tokens have lost roughly 75% of their combined value year over year, wiping out an estimated $53 billion from the market. Elon Musk’s US Growth Call Sparks Bitcoin Optimism Bitcoin traders are again focusing on macro signals after Elon Musk said the US economy could enter a phase of rapid growth from late 2026, with “double-digit” GDP expansion possible in the near term. While Musk’s comments were not aimed at crypto, they were quickly picked up by investors searching for signs of improving liquidity and stronger risk appetite following Bitcoin’s recent pullback. The outlook comes as US Federal Reserve rate cuts have pushed macroeconomic conditions back to the center of Bitcoin’s price narrative. Supporters such as Anthony Pompliano argue that faster economic growth could provide a favorable backdrop for scarce assets, while others say Musk’s forecasts, though controversial, often point to real technological shifts driven by artificial intelligence. Double-digit growth is coming within 12 to 18 months. If applied intelligence is proxy for economic growth, which it should be, triple-digit is possible in ~5 years. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 24, 2025 According to Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy expectations rather than headline economic data. Last week, K33 also said Bitcoin’s prolonged sell-side pressure from long-term holders may be approaching its limits after years of steady distribution. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Wednesday, Bitcoin is trading around $87,366, slightly lower on the day after another choppy session. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has struggled to build momentum, repeatedly failing to hold above nearby resistance. On a broader view, Bitcoin continues to trade well below its recent highs. The past several weeks show a clear downtrend from the October peak near $125,000, followed by a steep November correction and a slower consolidation phase in December. Buyers are now defending the $86,000–$87,000 zone, which has acted as short-term support. If BTC manages to reclaim and hold above $88,000, it could open the door for a recovery toward $90,000 and potentially $92,000. On the downside, a clean break below $86,000 may expose the price to further weakness toward $84,000, with deeper support sitting closer to $82,000. Ethereum is currently changing hands at approximately $2,921, down modestly on the day. Similar to Bitcoin, ETH has experienced uneven price action, with sellers stepping in on each attempt to move higher. Over the past week, ETH has remained trapped in a relatively tight range, struggling to reclaim the psychologically important $3,000 level. Volume remains muted, suggesting traders are waiting for a clearer directional signal before committing to larger positions. A sustained move above $2,980–$3,000 could shift near-term momentum in favor of bulls, with upside targets around $3,150. If selling pressure resumes, ETH may revisit support near $2,800, followed by a deeper pullback toward $2,700. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains cautious, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index sitting at 28, firmly in the fear zone. The reading is largely unchanged from 27 yesterday , signaling that investor sentiment has stabilized at low levels rather than improving meaningfully. While the index has recovered from extreme fear levels seen last month (15), it still reflects hesitation across the market. US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another day of net outflows, with $175.29 million leaving the funds on Dec. 24, according to the latest data. Outflows were broad-based across the major products. BlackRock’s IBIT led the declines with $91.37 million in net outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC at $24.62 million and Fidelity’s FBTC, which saw $17.17 million leave the fund. Bitwise (BITB) and ARK 21Shares (ARKB) also posted smaller outflows. US spot Ether ETFs also posted a net outflow of $52.7 million on Dec. 24, ending a brief inflow streak, according to the latest data. Outflows were led by Grayscale’s ETHE, which saw $33.78 million exit the fund, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA with $22.25 million in net outflows. In contrast, Grayscale’s ETH trust (ETH) recorded a modest $3.33 million inflow, standing out as the only product to attract capital during the session. Overall trading activity across US ETH ETFs reached $689.44 million, while total net assets stood at $17.86 billion, equivalent to about 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Moscow Exchange and St. Petersburg Exchange have confirmed readiness to launch regulated crypto trading once Russia’s legislative framework takes effect by mid-2026. Russia's major stock exchanges confirm readiness for regulated crypto trading by mid-2026 as legislative framework approaches implementation deadline. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/rZhcnzIhjn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 25, 2025 According to local reports, the exchanges’ announcements came following the Bank of Russia’s December 23 release of a regulatory concept that sets July 1, 2026, as the deadline for developing comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation.

Technicals and On-Chain Data Turn Cautious",https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-headed-for-40000-technicals-and-on-chain-data-turn-cautious/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) attempt to push above $90,000 remained unsuccessful this week. The crypto asset is once again under technical pressure after slipping below an important long-term trend indicator, prompting fresh downside warnings from market analysts. 50% Drop Could Be Next? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez said that every time Bitcoin has lost its 50-week simple moving average (SMA) in past cycles, the asset has gone on to record an average decline of around 54%. Based on current price levels, Martinez observed that a similar historical move would mean a potential drop toward the $40,000 zone. The 50-week SMA is widely watched as a dividing line between bullish and bearish market phases, and steady trading below it has previously coincided with prolonged downturns rather than brief corrections. While Martinez did not predict an immediate crash, there is a growing downside risk if Bitcoin fails to reclaim this level in the coming weeks. Adding to the cautious outlook, CryptoQuant said Bitcoin appears to be in the later stage of its post-ATH correction. As such, weak demand continues to limit rebound attempts. Market sentiment remains in “Extreme Fear,” and risk appetite has yet to recover meaningfully. Despite ongoing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs during a record year for the broader ETF market, price action has remained muted. The Coinbase Premium Index has stayed negative, as US-based spot demand remained low, while whale inflows to major exchanges have slowed, which indicates limited large-scale accumulation. The analytics platform also observed increased activity from 7-10-year-old coins. Interestingly, this pattern is often seen near distribution phases or ahead of trend transitions. The possibility is a continued consolidation with a mild bearish bias unless demand indicators show an improvement. Isolated Trading Pair Glitch Instead of delivering a year-end Santa rally, Bitcoin experienced a brief but dramatic price anomaly. On Binance, Bitcoin momentarily plunged to $24,111 on the BTC/USD1 trading pair before rebounding above $87,500 within seconds, as per exchange data. The move was confined to the USD1 pair and did not appear across other major BTC markets. USD1 is a recently launched stablecoin tied to Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and the pair later stabilized.

What began as criticism of Elon Musk’s tax claims quickly spiraled into a broader argument about wealth, fairness, and ultimately, the mechanics behind XRP’s price behavior. The conversation took a decisive turn when Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz weighed in, initially challenging the logic of comparing net worth to taxable earnings. While his early remarks focused on economic reasoning, the exchange soon shifted toward Ripple’s XRP sales model, reopening years of debate around the escrow system introduced in 2017. How the Debate Shifted to Ripple Escrow Following Schwartz’s response, critics redirected their attention to Ripple itself, arguing that the company’s ability to sell up to one billion XRP monthly through escrow has suppressed XRP’s price. That seems like common sense, but the evidence doesn't really support that conclusion. And if you think about it, everything people know will happen and expect to happen should already be built into the current price. pic.twitter.com/EaZr339WHT — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 25, 2025 Schwartz responded by clarifying an often-misunderstood historical fact: before the escrow was implemented, Ripple had no formal limits on how much XRP it could sell in any given month. According to Schwartz, the escrow was not designed to enable sales but to introduce predictability and reduce market uncertainty. Notably, he revealed that he opposed the escrow’s implementation at the time, believing it gave up strategic flexibility without providing enough tangible benefit in return. Examining Claims of Price Suppression Critics countered by asserting that XRP’s price would be significantly higher today if Ripple had not sold XRP consistently since 2017. Schwartz pushed back on this assumption, arguing that while the claim may seem like common sense, available evidence does not support a direct causal relationship between escrow sales and long-term price suppression. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He stressed that XRP’s price history cannot be explained solely by supply releases, particularly when those releases are transparent, capped, and widely anticipated by the market. Market Expectations and Price Discovery At the core of Schwartz’s argument is a fundamental market principle: known and expected events are typically priced in. Ripple’s escrow structure, monthly release schedule, and the routine re-locking of unused XRP have been public knowledge for years. As a result, traders and institutional participants have long incorporated these dynamics into their valuation models. This perspective challenges the idea that escrow sales represent an ongoing surprise or hidden pressure on XRP’s price. Instead, Schwartz suggests that price movements are more likely driven by broader factors such as utility growth, liquidity conditions, regulatory clarity, and macroeconomic trends. Reframing the XRP Escrow Narrative By grounding the discussion in market mechanics rather than speculation, Schwartz’s clarification reframes a debate that has persisted for nearly a decade. His position does not deny that supply matters, but it rejects the notion that a transparent, predictable escrow system alone explains XRP’s historical price performance. Ultimately, the exchange highlights a critical distinction often lost in online discourse: markets respond less to emotion and more to expectations—and in the case of XRP, those expectations have long been out in the open.

YoungHoon Kim, whose X account is followed by more than 388,000 users, outlined the kind of scenario that must play out for this prediction to happen. Update: In my view, #XRP could potentially approach $1,000 over the next 10 years. (NFA / DYOR) pic.twitter.com/fZaxmZaF1Q — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 22, 2025 He said that a large scale accumulation, a decline in the value of the dollar, and high inflation could boost the price of this altcoin. Users on X argued that this would be almost impossible. The reason: Kim’s prediction would mean that XRP’s market capitalization would surpass that of gold. However, Kim emphasized that, if these pieces fall into place, “this scenario cannot be ruled out on a numerical basis”. At the time of writing, XRP’s 2025 losses sit at 20% as bears are still in control of the market. It has been a tough year for cryptocurrencies as a whole. However, Ripple has kept making progress in growing its ecosystem. XRP Price Prediction: This Is What Needs to Happen for XRP’s Bear Market to Be Over The token’s daily price chart shows that a falling wedge has formed since October as XRP. Since then, it progressively declined from $3 to its current level. This is typically a bullish price pattern, but it has not yet been confirmed. The price has entered a key area of liquidity from which it bounced in April and during the October 10 flash crash. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. Although $1,000 seems impossible in the near term, the project’s long-term prospects are promising enough to justify a bullish price prediction despite the latest downturn. Even though top altcoins have suffered significant losses this year, a promising crypto presale called Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has defied the market’s gravity as investors continue to pour millions into this meme coin. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Embraces Bull Market’s Natural Energy and Turn It Into a Meme Coin By leveraging the popularity of the Doge meme, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) plans to rally traders together by launching a token with which ‘degens’ can easily identify. Token holders can earn rewards and bragging rights by participating in fun competitions like Maxi Gains and Maxi Ripped. Moreover, they get exclusive access to an idea hub through which they can share their wildest and most potentially profitable YOLO trades with the community to build a collective trading “hive mind”. As the token’s popularity increases among retail traders, the price of $MAXI could explode.

However, the reaction might not be what you expect. CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young recently highlighted that Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money, has forecasted a Bitcoin bear market . This announcement has sparked significant discussion, not because traders are rushing to sell, but due to Cramer’s notorious reputation as a contrarian indicator. Why Is Jim Cramer’s Bitcoin Prediction So Controversial? Jim Cramer occupies a unique space in financial media. He offers clear, often dramatic market calls on his popular show. However, within the crypto and stock trading communities, his forecasts have become something of an inside joke. Many investors actively track his pronouncements to consider taking the opposite position. Ju Ki-young’s post on X directly pointed to this phenomenon. He noted that Cramer is “widely mocked” as a contrarian signal. This means when Cramer publicly predicts a market direction, a segment of traders interprets it as a sign that the opposite might occur. Therefore, his call for a Bitcoin bear market could be seen by some as a potential bullish signal. Understanding the Contrarian Indicator Phenomenon How did a mainstream financial expert become a reverse barometer for some traders? The pattern appears rooted in timing and market psychology. Cramer often voices strong opinions at market extremes—either peak optimism or deep pessimism. By the time these sentiments reach a broad television audience, savvy investors may have already positioned themselves differently. Consider these key aspects of the so-called “Cramer Effect”: Sentiment Gauge: His bullishness often coincides with market tops, while his bearishness can align with potential bottoms. Mainstream Attention: His commentary signals that a trend has captured widespread media focus, which some view as a classic contrarian signal. Performance Tracking: Online communities have documented numerous instances where his specific stock or crypto calls subsequently moved in the opposite direction. This doesn’t mean his analysis is always wrong. Rather, it highlights how public, emphatic predictions from influential figures can sometimes reflect a consensus view that is already priced into the market. What Does This Mean for the Current Bitcoin Market? CryptoQuant’s CEO sharing this prediction brings it directly to the core crypto audience. CryptoQuant is a leading on-chain analytics firm, making this mention particularly noteworthy. It serves as a reminder for investors to look beyond headlines and consider deeper market data. Instead of taking Cramer’s Bitcoin bear market call at face value, seasoned traders might: Check on-chain metrics like exchange flows and holder behavior. Assess broader macroeconomic conditions. Look for confirmation from other, more crypto-native analysts. The real insight here is about market sentiment. When extreme views become loud public pronouncements, it can be a useful moment for self-checking one’s own assumptions and research. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors How should you process this information? First, avoid making investment decisions based solely on any single person’s prediction, whether it’s from Jim Cramer or anyone else. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a complex mix of technology, adoption, regulation, and macroeconomics. Use contrarian signals as one piece of a much larger puzzle. If a famous pessimist turns wildly bullish, it might be time to review your risk management. Conversely, if a perennial optimist warns of a Bitcoin bear market , it could prompt a review of the long-term thesis. The key is independent analysis grounded in data, not personality-driven narratives. Conclusion: Navigating Noise in the Crypto Landscape The discussion sparked by CryptoQuant’s CEO underscores a critical skill for cryptocurrency investors: filtering signal from noise. Jim Cramer’s prediction of a Bitcoin bear market is less important as a direct forecast and more valuable as a sentiment indicator. It reminds us that when opinions become overwhelmingly one-sided, whether bullish or bearish, it pays to look in the other direction and conduct your own thorough research. In the volatile world of crypto, maintaining a disciplined, data-informed strategy will always outperform chasing the latest headline or celebrity opinion. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did CryptoQuant’s CEO say about Jim Cramer? A1: Ju Ki-young posted on X that Jim Cramer predicted a Bitcoin bear market. He highlighted Cramer’s reputation in investment communities as a contrarian indicator, meaning his public forecasts often precede the opposite market movement. Q2: Why is Jim Cramer considered a contrarian indicator? A2: Over time, traders have observed that Cramer’s most emphatic public market calls—especially at sentiment extremes—frequently precede a move in the opposite direction. This has led some to use his commentary as a reverse signal. Q3: Should I buy or sell Bitcoin based on this news? A3: No single person’s prediction should dictate your investment strategy. This news is best used as a prompt to check broader market data, on-chain analytics, and your own investment thesis, rather than as a direct trading signal. Q4: What is a bear market? A4: A bear market is a period of declining prices, typically a fall of 20% or more from recent highs, accompanied by widespread pessimism. The term is often used for a sustained downward trend. Q5: Is CryptoQuant endorsing Cramer’s view? A5: No. CryptoQuant’s CEO shared the prediction, likely to highlight its value as a sentiment gauge rather than to endorse the forecast. The firm’s analysis is typically based on on-chain data, not television commentary. Q6: Where can I find reliable Bitcoin analysis? A6: Reliable analysis often combines multiple sources: on-chain data from firms like CryptoQuant, macroeconomic context, technical analysis, and fundamental developments in blockchain technology and adoption.

In 2025 the total trading volume of the cryptocurrency derivatives market reached approximately $85.70 trillion with a daily average turnover of about $264.5 billion. Institutional Capital Reshapes Market Leadership One of the most important shifts in 2025 was the consolidation of institutional influence across derivatives venues. The end of year report states that demand for hedging, basis trading and risk-managed exposure has migrated toward regulated exchange-traded products, notes CoinGlass. This has strengthened the role of the Chicago-based futures market with CME Group securing its leadership in Bitcoin futures after overtaking Binance in open interest in 2024. By 2025 the CME also narrowed the gap with Binance in Ethereum derivatives showing growing institutional participation beyond Bitcoin. At the same time leading crypto-native exchanges such as OKX, Bybit, and Bitget retaining a substantial market share. Merry Christmas! CoinGlass 2025 Crypto Derivatives Market Annual Report https://t.co/WJ6wUNU8Hc — CoinGlass (@coinglass_com) December 25, 2025 Rising Complexity and Systemic Risk CoinGlass notes that extreme market events in 2025 also stress-tested margin frameworks, liquidation mechanisms and cross-platform risk transmission pathways at an unprecedented scale. Importantly these shocks no longer remained confined to individual assets or exchanges showing the growing interconnectedness of the derivatives ecosystem. Fragility has prompted renewed scrutiny of risk controls, particularly given the concentration of open interest and user assets among a small number of dominant platforms. Macro Liquidity and High-Beta Behavior From a macro perspective CoinGlass says Bitcoin continued to behave less like an inflation hedge and more like a high-beta risk asset. During the 2024–2025 easing cycle BTC surged from roughly $40,000 to $126,000, largely reflecting leveraged exposure to global liquidity expansion rather than independent value discovery. When liquidity expectations shifted in late 2025, the pullback reinforced Bitcoin’s sensitivity to central bank policy and geopolitical uncertainty. These dynamics created fertile ground for derivatives trading, as volatility linked to U.S.–China trade tensions shifting Federal Reserve policy, and Japan’s monetary normalization generated sustained opportunities for hedging and speculative strategies. On-Chain Derivatives and the Regulatory Backdrop Another defining theme of 2025 was the transition of decentralized derivatives from experimentation to genuine market competition. High-performance application chains and intent-centric architectures enabled on-chain platforms to rival centralized exchanges in specific niches, particularly censorship-resistant trading and composable strategies. Regulation evolved in parallel. The United States moved toward legislative clarity as the European Union reinforced consumer protection under MiCA and MiFID while jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE positioned themselves as compliant hubs. Together these developments point toward gradual convergence under the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulation.” A New Phase for Crypto Derivatives Taken together, 2025 marked the point at which crypto derivatives became a central pillar of global digital finance rather than a peripheral speculative market. Institutional dominance, regulatory integration and on-chain innovation are now reshaping how risk is priced, transferred and managed—setting the stage for an even more complex derivatives landscape ahead, reports CoinGlass.

Tech Firm Founder Thinks It’s Possible,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/could-xrp-make-trillionaires-tech-firm-founder-thinks-its-possible/,"According to reports, Joshua Dalton, founder of Triblu, has put forward a striking scenario: that XRP holders could become millionaires, billionaires, or even trillionaires if the token were used as part of a US strategic crypto reserve. Related Reading: JPMorgan Eyes Crypto Services As Institutional Demand Grows – A Boost For BTC Price? Dalton argued that XRP, because of its ties to a US-based company, is a safer fit for a national reserve than Bitcoin. The claim has energized some corners of the crypto community, but it also faces steep legal and market obstacles. Dalton’s Bold Claim And The Numbers Dalton’s case relies on hard math. Based on reports, the US national debt is about $38 trillion. Ripple’s escrow holds roughly 34.4 billion XRP. Using those figures, Dalton and others calculate that an XRP price near $883 would be needed to offset roughly 80% of that debt. Many people won’t like what I say below. “Bitcoin cannot be the official currency for the United States’ reserves because Satoshi Nakamoto is still unknown and it could be the currency operated by China. The government can 💯 trust XRP because it is operated by @Ripple and 💯… — Joshua Dalton (@J9Dalton) January 23, 2025 At present, XRP trades around $1.91. That would mean a rise of over 46,000% for the token. By comparison, Bitcoin is trading near $89,000 and would have to reach about $30 million per coin to meet a similar debt-offset goal if the plan focused on 1 million BTC, an idea once floated by US Senator Cynthia Lummis. That would be a gain of more than 33,000% from current levels. Legal And Market Limits US President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year creating a national Bitcoin reserve and a wider crypto stockpile framework. But policymakers appear to be focused mainly on Bitcoin for the reserve role, with other coins treated as seizure assets or general holdings. Importantly, Ripple’s escrow is privately controlled and governed by contracts. It cannot be commandeered by a government without legal action and likely long court fights. Even if US authorities somehow obtained large amounts of XRP, unloading such a position on global markets would likely push the price down, not up. Markets are not built to absorb trillions of dollars without heavy distortion. Holders And Wealth Scenarios Based on wallet data, some XRP addresses would see big nominal gains at an $880 price. For example, a holder of 10,000 XRP — currently worth about $19,100 — could see that stake climb to nearly $9 million on paper. Reports show 179,546 wallets hold between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. About 2,006 addresses sit between 500,000 and 1 million XRP. Yet most of the largest reserves are held by Ripple, its founders, or exchanges. Only 20 wallets contain between 500 million and 1 billion XRP, and six addresses hold more than 1 billion. 2026 is going to be epic! Locked in! XRP will be the star of 2026. — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) December 23, 2025 Market Reaction And Expert Views Matthew Sigel, lead researcher at VanEck, has argued in public that Bitcoin offers the best path to large-scale fiscal uses, and other analysts remain skeptical of any single token being used to “solve” national debt.

In this context, Finbold has identified 4 altcoins to buy under $0.10 for start of 2026. Midnight (NIGHT) Midnight (NIGHT), a privacy-focused token built on the Cardano ( ADA ) blockchain, has been one of the most successful launches in December, reaching a market cap of $1 billion in just a week. Now, debates over cross-chain privacy and a potential stablecoin partnership fuel renewed investor interest. Specifically, midnight developer Sebastien Guillemot has stated that the cryptographic groundwork for interoperability between Ethereum ( ETH ) and Cardano has been completed. This integration, he wrote on X, allows users to maintain high privacy standards no matter what wallet they are using. Further, a native stablecoin such as Tether ( USDT ) on Midnight could enhance liquidity for developers and lower slippage on NIGHT trading pairs. Should everything go according to plan, NIGHT could potentially hit some new records next year. At the time of writing, NIGHT was trading at $0.076, up nearly 18% on the weekly chart. NIGHT weekly price. Source: CoinMarketCap VeChain (VET) VeChain ( VET ) has been rallying over the past week due to a mix of technical recovery, some new developments with the Hayabusa upgrade that introduced new staking mechanics, and broader altcoin rotation. As a result, the price has bounced from the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0105, a level tested three times since December 20. These signals could indicate a buying opportunity, although the 24-hour trading volume is down 22% at the time of writing, indicating cautious optimism. In other words, VET could see solid performance in January, but it will depend on whether the broader altcoin market can sustain it. At press time, VET was changing hands at $0.015, having gained 4.5% on the week. VET weekly price. Source: CoinMarketCap ShibaInu (SHIB) While Shiba Inu’s ( SHIB ) week has been somewhat slow, the token is seeing a modest uptick on the 24-hour chart at the time of writing, as traders have been buying the dip near key technical support levels. More importantly, open interest in SHIB derivatives is also climbing (3.42% in the past 24 hours), with more than $80 million in active futures contracts. The increase suggests traders are positioning for short-term upside despite SHIB’s prevailing bearish macro trend. The narrative is thus primarily driven by derivatives-market optimism, which could lead to some potential gains in the coming weeks if it continues. At publication time, SHIB was priced at $0.000007, 2.32% in the red over the past seven days. SHIB weekly price. Source: CoinMarketCap Pepe (PEPE) As another well-known meme coin, Pepe (PEPE) has a reputation for high volatility. Currently, Pepe is up 3.05% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the broader cryptocurrency market’s 0.75% gain as speculative tokens rebounded across the board. Change in leadership in the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is a key catalyst. Namely, Michael Selig, known for his pro-crypto takes, took office as CFTC chair on December 24, 2025, which traders now see as beneficial for meme coins such as PEPE. Following the announcement, PEPE’s 24-hour trading volume rose about 18%, suggesting increased optimism in a more permissive regulatory climate. What’s more, PEPE is also showing early technical recovery signals, as its daily Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has moved out of oversold territory, allowing the token to reclaim its 7-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ). If regulatory optimism continues, propped by more positive technical charts, Pepe could see some new gains next month. Right now, though, it is trading at $0.000003, 3.59% in the green this week.

Source: CoinMarketCap Altcoins to buy under $0.10 for start of 2026 All in all, as the crypto market enters 2026, investors looking for low-priced altcoins with upside potential may find opportunities in NIGHT, VET, SHIB, and PEPE. While crypto assets of this rank inevitably come with risks ranging from market volatility to broader macro and regulatory factors, each of them has the potential to capitalize on some of the ongoing market trends, provided investors are willing to take more extensive risk.

To fund it, Takaichi said the government plans to raise ¥29.6 trillion by selling new bonds. Even with that figure, debt financing will slightly decrease, making up 24.2% of the budget compared to 24.9% in the current fiscal year. “I believe this budget strikes a balance between strengthening the economy and ensuring fiscal sustainability,” Takaichi-san said after meeting with ruling party officials and cabinet members. This is a big deal because Japan holds the heaviest debt burden on earth, so global investors are uneasy with the prime minister’s spending style. Longer-term bond yields have already been creeping up this year, and a blowout budget only adds to the pressure. Koji Takeuchi, a senior research fellow at Itochu Research Institute, said the size of the budget is a red flag. “The size of the initial budget is a record, which is negative for yields,” Koji said. “At the same time however, government bond issuance has been kept in check,” he added, pointing out that long-term bond supply won’t rise and mid- to long-range issuance may even shrink. Spending increase driven by inflation, social needs, and defense This record budget comes while costs continue rising across Japan, because inflation remains above 2% for more than three years. Prices on essentials are still surging, yet a big chunk of the increased budget is going toward social security, which will rise from ¥38.3 trillion to ¥39.1 trillion. That bump is tied directly to Japan’s aging population and the growing demand for elderly care and support services, according to the Takaichi cabinet. Takaichi is also prioritizing defense spending. With geopolitical tensions in the region and pressure on national security, those costs are going up too. Her team sees this as part of the same demographic and global reality fueling the rest of the budget increase. Last month, her administration launched what officials say is the largest economic package since COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, meant to ease the pressure from higher prices and help fund military upgrades. Despite pushing expansionary policies, Takaichi keeps repeating that she’s being responsible. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama admitted earlier this week that the plan could hurt fiscal health in the short term, but said it’s needed to push for future growth. Markets so far haven’t reacted much to the budget news. But the government’s borrowing costs are getting heavier. The Finance Ministry will use a 3% interest rate for debt servicing in FY26. That’s the highest level since 1997, based on what Bloomberg learned from officials. BOJ eyes more hikes as revenues and real rates move Takaichi expects to collect ¥83.7 trillion in tax revenue next year, which helps offset borrowing needs. Koji said this is one reason markets haven’t overreacted. “Tax revenues have been fairly solid, which likely helped Takaichi with addressing market concerns,” he said. But he warned the government needs to find better ways to secure cash if it plans to cut down bond sales in the future. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Ueda Kazuo gave his final speech of the year Thursday, saying there’s growing confidence the central bank will hit its 2% inflation goal. “The achievement of the 2% price stability target, accompanied by wage increases, is steadily approaching,” Ueda said at a Keidanren-hosted business event on Christmas. Ueda’s comments came just days after the BOJ raised borrowing costs to the highest level since 1995. Traders are already betting on more hikes. Ueda didn’t give a date but made it clear the bank will raise rates again if the economy stays on track. He pointed out that real interest rates are still low, and most watchers expect one hike every six months starting next year. “It is highly likely that the mechanism in which both wages and prices rise moderately will be maintained next year and beyond,” Ueda said. “As a result, it appears that the likelihood of realizing the bank’s baseline scenario has been rising.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This achievement, announced by the firm associated with the Trump family, signals a powerful entry into the competitive stablecoin arena and raises intriguing questions about the future of digital finance. What Does the USD1 Stablecoin’s $3B Milestone Mean? The announcement, made on social media platform X, frames this as a foundational victory. World Liberty Financial described it as a “significant milestone” for its team and community, emphasizing that its ultimate goal is to build “the financial network of the future.” According to real-time data from CoinMarketCap, the USD1 stablecoin now boasts a market cap of approximately $3.07 billion. This rapid ascent places it among the notable players in a market dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Why Is This Stablecoin Launch So Significant? The prominence of this launch stems from several key factors. First, the association with the Trump family brings immediate brand recognition and political intrigue into the crypto sphere. Second, reaching a $3 billion market cap so quickly demonstrates substantial initial trust and capital inflow. For users and investors, the core promise of any stablecoin like USD1 is simple: Price Stability: It is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, minimizing the volatility common in other cryptocurrencies. Utility: It acts as a reliable digital dollar for trading, transfers, and as a safe haven within crypto portfolios. Access: It provides a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the USD1 Stablecoin? However, this remarkable beginning is just that—a beginning. The path forward for the USD1 stablecoin is fraught with challenges that will test its resilience and long-term vision. Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins are under intense examination by regulators worldwide. WLFI must navigate this complex landscape flawlessly. Proving Reserves: Maintaining absolute transparency about the assets backing each USD1 token is non-negotiable for sustaining trust. Fierce Competition: It must carve out a unique value proposition to grow its user base against established competitors. Building Real-World Use: True success depends on integration into payment systems, DeFi protocols, and everyday commerce. Overcoming these hurdles will require more than just capital; it will demand unwavering operational excellence and clear communication. Actionable Insights from the USD1 Phenomenon For observers and participants in the crypto market, the rise of the USD1 stablecoin offers clear lessons. It underscores that new entrants with strong branding and clear messaging can still capture significant market share rapidly. Furthermore, it highlights the growing institutional and political interest in shaping the infrastructure of digital money. For investors, it reinforces the importance of conducting deep due diligence on a stablecoin’s governance, transparency, and regulatory standing before adoption. The Final Verdict on This $3B Crypto Milestone The surge of World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin past a $3 billion market cap is undeniably a landmark event. It injects a new, politically-connected player into the core infrastructure of cryptocurrency. While the achievement is impressive, the long-term story remains unwritten. The coming months will be critical as the project transitions from a successful launch to proving its durability, utility, and trustworthiness in a demanding market. This milestone is less of a finish line and more of a powerful starting gun for the next phase of stablecoin evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the USD1 stablecoin?

AI Makes Bold PI Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/will-pi-network-have-a-better-christmas-in-2026-ai-makes-bold-pi-predictions/,"It was an interesting year in the cryptocurrency space. The expectations were high, with numerous calls for new peaks for almost all assets. And while that turned out to be true for BTC, XRP, ETH, and BNB, many others couldn’t come anywhere near their previous heights. Moreover, even those who managed to set new record slumped in the following months and are on the verge of closing the year in the red, despite (almost) all other assets painting impressive gains. 2025 also saw the launch of the much-anticipated Pi Network and its native token, which quickly took the crypto market by storm and neared the top 10 alts by market cap. Its price charted an all-time high of almost $3.00 in late February, and the speculations about a $314 price tag (the number π) were rampant. However, the reality was entirely different as the token plunged by over 94% by early October when it plummeted to a new all-time low of $0.172 (CoinGecko data) despite the countless updates by the Core Team behind the project. By Christmas 2025, PI managed to recover a modest portion of its losses and stands above $0.20, but that’s still 93% away from the February peak. With 2026 just around the corner, we asked ChatGPT about its opinion on whether PI can have a happier Christmas next year. How Will 2026 Be for PI? Well, the simple and fast answer is – not really. The AI solution claimed that PI would have to stay above the first major support at $0.20 to reignite a potential rally to $0.24 and beyond. However, the current trend is “short-term bearish,” while the trading volumes are low and continue to decline – a certified warning sign. To have a better year, PI would need a strong bounce from the current support, while the network behind it would require a boost in several areas, continued ChatGPT. First, the token would need more utility, which should result in “stronger demand.” “PI needs more real-world use cases beyond trading. The success of Pi-powered commerce, DeFi, experiments, and merchant adoption could meaningfully shift long-term sentiment.” The AI platform added that the market conditions matter immensely, and they can also determine PI’s next move. If BTC and the larger-cap alts continue to struggle as they have been for the past couple of months, PI could challenge the October all-time low of $0.172. In contrast: “If crypto as a whole enters a new bullish cycle in 2026, smaller-cap assets like PI historically tend to outperform – but they also carry higher risk.” Conclusion In terms of actual price predictions, ChatGPT believes the most likely scenario for PI next year would be a solid stabilization above $0.22 and a top of $0.35. However, it also outlined a possible bull case in which the asset skyrockets all the way up to $0.65 if the Core Team “launches major app integrations, improves migration rates, and expands real-world utility.” “2025 was rough for PI – but not unusual for early-phase ecosystem tokens. The foundations built this year (KYC, App Studio, DEX experiments, commerce tools) set the stage for a potentially stronger 2026. If the ecosystem grows and real utility expands, PI could finally move away from bottoming structures,” concluded OpenAI’s solution. The post Will Pi Network Have a Better Christmas in 2026?

Analyst Woominkyu from CryptoQuant has shared insights suggesting that the current market dynamics indicate a transition rather than just a temporary pullback. Could Bitcoin Be Shifting Into A Bear Phase? In a report released recently, Woominkyu examined the Bitcoin Cycle Momentum Indicator (BCMI), noting that its return to the 0.5 zone on October 21 was interpreted as a cooling phase, rather than indicative of a market peak. In the weeks following this observation, Bitcoin’s price has seen a noticeable decline alongside a similar drop in BCMI, suggesting that the market is not only experiencing a cooling period but has also reset in terms of price and on-chain momentum. Historically, significant cycle bottoms for Bitcoin in 2019 and 2023 occurred when BCMI levels fell between the 0.25 and 0.35 range. These levels are often associated with full sentiment compression and a structural reset within the market. Currently, while BCMI remains below equilibrium as seen in the chart above, and it is still above the historical bottom zones. This data suggests that Bitcoin may be shifting into a bear phase rather than recovering from a simple pullback. According to Woominkyu, a more stable bottom may only materialize if BCMI revisits levels seen during the previous cycles from 2019 to 2023. Bear Market Conditions In a separate analysis , CryptoQuant indicated that demand for Bitcoin has sharply declined, reinforcing the idea of a bear market. The report pointed to the significant drop in Bitcoin demand growth that has occurred since early October 2025. Moreover, the report highlights that institutional and large-holder demand is contracting instead of expanding. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have converted into net sellers during the fourth quarter of 2025, offloading approximately 24,000 BTC. Additionally, the number of addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, which typically represent ETFs and treasury firms , is also increasing at a rate below the trend, reflecting the demand deterioration that preceded the bear market of 2022. The condition of the derivatives markets further corroborates the weakening appetite for risk. Funding rates in perpetual futures have dropped to their lowest levels since December 2023. Historically, such declines in funding rates indicate a reduced willingness to maintain long positions, a phenomenon commonly associated with bear market conditions rather than bullish trends. Technical analysis also reveals the deterioration of Bitcoin’s price structure, with the cryptocurrency falling below its 365-day moving average—a crucial long-term support level that has historically delineated bull and bear markets. Looking ahead, historical data suggests that Bitcoin’s bear market bottoms typically align with its realized price, currently estimated around $56,000. This implies a potential drawdown of approximately 55% from the recent all-time high. Intermediate support is anticipated around the $70,000 level, suggesting a relatively shallow bear market compared to previous cycles. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $87,635.

56346803,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=884046,1766671243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56346803.jpeg,Sharp drop in China leads Toyota's global sales to 1.9% November decline,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/toyota-global-sales-fall-about-2/,"Toyota opened November with weaker numbers across sales and production, and China sat at the center of the drop. The automaker said global demand cooled as Beijing pulled the plug on subsidies that once pushed electric and fuel‑efficient cars. Those incentives had kept showroom traffic alive. Once they vanished, the slowdown followed fast. Global sales slipped 1.9% from a year earlier to 965,919 vehicles, including deliveries from Daihatsu and Hino Motors also fell. Output dropped 3.4% to 934,001 units. Toyota shared the data on Thursday as pressure mounted across the auto industry. The decline landed during a tense stretch for carmakers worldwide. Trade disputes remain active. Rules keep changing. Economic signals stay mixed. Toyota’s November numbers reflected those conditions as companies try to meet long‑term demand while dealing with near‑term policy shocks and market stress. China delivered the sharpest blow. Sales of Toyota and Lexus vehicles in the country dropped 12% during the month. The company said trade‑in subsidies ended in major cities after funding ran dry. The timing matched rising political friction between China and Japan. In November, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made comments about Taiwan that angered Chinese officials. China later warned its citizens against traveling to Japan. China sales slump hits production while other regions split results Toyota built 15% more vehicles in Thailand during November, and output in the United States also rose by 9%, but those gains failed to offset steep declines elsewhere. Manufacturing in China fell by 14% production in Japan dropped 9.7%, and the United Kingdom also saw a 7.9% decline. Toyota reported each figure as subsidy changes and weaker demand hit Asian and European markets at the same time. The European Union added another twist. Earlier this month, EU officials rolled back an effective ban on combustion engines. The move gave traditional carmakers more room to scale battery models alongside hybrids. Toyota already leaned on gas‑electric technology long before rivals. Still, the policy shift could give Chinese electric vehicle brands more space to grow across Europe. Political pressure also built in the United States. President Donald Trump placed Toyota in his sights as he prepared new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. Earlier this month, Trump said he was opening a path for Asia’s small “kei” cars to be built and sold in the US, even though they do not meet current federal safety rules. “We are looking at ways to make that happen,” Trump said. More recently, Toyota said it will ship three US‑built models back to Japan. The move followed signals from the White House and aimed to ease trade friction with Washington. Rivals struggle in China as local brands gain ground fast Other automakers faced similar pressure, like Honda whose sales got even weaker in November thanks to China and a lingering chip shortage that follows a political dispute between China and the Netherlands involving a major semiconductor supplier. Honda’s global sales dropped 15% to 273,681 units. China accounted for a 34% fall. The company has now posted declines in the country for 22 straight months. Production in North America collapsed 61% due to chip shortages. Honda said the supply crunch forced temporary plant closures in Japan and China during year‑end holidays. Nissan Motor Co. delivered a different result in China. Global production fell 4.2% to 257,008 vehicles, but output in China jumped 22%. Growth came from new electric models launched earlier this year, including the N6 and N7. Despite that boost, global sales still slipped 4.9% in November. China’s market also showed how fast tastes are changing. Huawei Technologies Co.’s ultra‑luxury Maextro S800 sedan surged ahead of foreign rivals. The model now outsells Porsche’s Panamera and Mercedes‑Benz’s S‑Class among cars priced above $100,000. Since launching in May, Maextro sales overtook all competitors in September. In November, deliveries exceeded combined sales of the Panamera and BMW’s 7 Series, according to data from ECC Intelligence.

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/bybit-29th-xrp-proof-of-reserve-update-you-need-to-see-this/,"In a crypto market still shaped by the aftershocks of past exchange failures, transparency has become a defining measure of credibility. Proof-of-reserves disclosures are no longer optional trust signals; they are essential benchmarks that help users assess whether their assets are genuinely protected. As scrutiny intensifies across centralized platforms, Bybit’s latest XRP reserve update has emerged as a notable data point worth closer examination. The update was brought to public attention by crypto analyst Xaif on X, who highlighted Bybit’s 29th proof-of-reserves disclosure and its implications for XRP holders. Rather than raising alarms, the figures presented offer a snapshot that reinforces confidence in how the exchange manages and safeguards user XRP balances. BYBIT 29th PROOF OF RESERVES $XRP UPDATE User Holdings Snapshot (Dec 17): 262,619,809 XRP Bybit Wallet Reserves: 267,603,595 XRP Reserve Ratio: 101% (Fully backed + excess on-chain proof!) https://t.co/RXfocppsRi pic.twitter.com/08CD2PsqTj — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 25, 2025 XRP User Holdings and On-Chain Reserves According to the December 17 snapshot cited in the update, total XRP held on behalf of users on Bybit amounted to 262,619,809 XRP. This figure represents the full extent of customer liabilities in XRP at the time the snapshot was taken. In comparison, Bybit’s publicly verifiable on-chain wallets reportedly held 267,603,595 XRP in reserves. The excess of reserves over user holdings is a critical distinction, as it demonstrates that the exchange was not merely matching liabilities but holding more XRP than required to cover customer balances. Interpreting the 101% Reserve Ratio The resulting reserve ratio of 101% indicates that Bybit’s XRP reserves exceeded user liabilities by a measurable margin. In practical terms, this means all customer XRP was fully backed, with additional XRP held as surplus. Such over-collateralization is generally viewed as a positive indicator, suggesting an added liquidity buffer in the event of sudden withdrawal demand or market stress. Within the framework of proof-of-reserves reporting, a reserve ratio above 100% strengthens the credibility of an exchange’s custody claims, especially when balances are verifiable on-chain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Update Matters for XRP Holders For XRP holders using centralized exchanges, reserve transparency carries particular weight. XRP’s global liquidity role and its increasing relevance in institutional and cross-border payment discussions make custody assurance a key concern. A fully backed and slightly over-reserved position reduces counterparty risk and provides reassurance that user funds are not being rehypothecated or fractionally reserved. Bybit’s continued publication of reserve snapshots also allows users to monitor consistency over time, rather than relying on isolated disclosures. A Broader Transparency Signal This 29th proof-of-reserves update reflects a broader industry shift toward sustained, repeatable transparency. While proof-of-reserves is not a substitute for comprehensive financial audits, it has become an important baseline standard for centralized exchanges seeking to maintain user trust. As highlighted by Xaif, Bybit’s XRP reserve position as of December 17 stands as a clear example of how on-chain verification can reinforce confidence in exchange solvency. In a market where trust is earned through data rather than declarations, this update sends a signal that Bybit is actively aligning with evolving transparency expectations.

56346794,https://finbold.com/?p=259639,1766671613,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"Ripple will unlock 1 billion XRP on January 1, 2026 — What to expect?",https://finbold.com/ripple-will-unlock-1-billion-xrp-on-january-1-2026-what-to-expect/,"Ripple is poised to release 1 billion XRP from escrow on January 1, 2026, marking its first scheduled token unlock of the new year. As has historically been the practice, however, the release is unlikely to see the entire 1 billion XRP entering the open market. Indeed, the forthcoming release is part of an escrow schedule established in 2017 to enhance transparency and supply predictability. According to this arrangement, 1 billion XRP is unlocked at the beginning of each month, but Ripple then typically earmarks a portion for operations or liquidity needs while re-escrowing the remainder. With only a week or so remaining, the focus is thus on the exact figure we’re going to see in circulation and, of course, whether it is going to affect XRP price dynamics in early January. The first Ripple XRP escrow of 2026 In recent months, Ripple has regularly returned between 60% and 80% of unlocked tokens to escrow. For instance, during the December 2025 unlock , roughly 1 billion XRP was released, but 70% of it was promptly re-locked, with only 300,000 XRP retained for potential distribution. The practice so far thus suggests that Ripple is going to return the bulk of the new batch to long-term storage once again. Nonetheless, the figures still represent a substantial sum at current valuations, even if only a part of the release actually becomes liquid. Accordingly, traders tend to monitor on-chain activity and price more closely, especially if there are large transfers that could signal incoming selling pressure, even if previous unlocks have shown little lasting effect on XRP’s price. What’s more notable is that the upcoming release also comes at a moment when the narrative surrounding XRP could be influenced by the CLARITY Act, which has now been confirmed for January. The act is important as it establishes clear rules for how banks and financial institutions can engage with digital assets, including XRP. Together, these developments could have a more substantial impact on XRP prices in the following weeks, or regulatory developments might influence how much Ripple is going to re-lock following the ‘dump.’ Featured image via Shutterstock The post Ripple will unlock 1 billion XRP on January 1, 2026 — What to expect? appeared first on Finbold .",Cryptocurrency news|crypto|XRP,EN,0,0,MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Finbold', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",finbold,2025-12-25 14:06:53

The rally comes after a firmer daily reference rate set by the People’s Bank of China, which market desks read as another step in a pattern seen over recent months, with policymakers allowing gains at a measured pace while keeping tight control over daily swings. Central bank allows gains as dollar selling builds in local markets The yuan has surged by more than 3.8% this year, helped by a weaker US dollar , money flowing into China’s stock market rebound, and easing global tensions. “The yuan has been bolstered by weakness in the dollar and seasonal foreign-exchange conversion by exporters,” said Wang Qing, chief macro analyst at Golden Credit Rating. “A sustained yuan gain will be helpful in increasing the appeal of China’s capital markets to foreign investors.” Onshore markets saw active dollar selling during Thursday’s session, as traders allegedly said large Chinese banks were buying dollars around 7.006. Offshore trading remained thin as well. Hong Kong markets were closed on Dec. 25 and Dec. 26 for public holidays, which limited liquidity during the session, traders said. Despite the rally, some banks say the yuan still trades at low levels when compared with trade partners and domestic conditions. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the currency stood about 25% below levels suggested by economic fundamentals, including China’s ongoing deflation pressures. Zhaopeng Xing, senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, said the yuan is likely to stay in a 6.95 to 7 per dollar range during the first half of next year. Property debt talks resume as Vanke bond vote reaches deadline Currency strength has unfolded alongside renewed pressure in China’s property sector. China Vanke Co., which recently secured temporary relief on a local bond, returned to negotiations as holders of another note finished voting on a payment delay. Investors holding a 3.7 billion yuan bond, worth about $526 million, were given until 3 p.m. Thursday to choose from six proposals seeking to push back repayment. Without approval, the developer would need to pay the bond when it falls due on Dec. 28, or within a five working day grace period, raising the risk of default. Vanke carries about $50 billion in interest-bearing liabilities as the housing market continues to struggle with falling prices and weak demand. The latest talks followed a narrow vote that extended a grace period on a 2 billion yuan bond, even as a proposal to delay principal repayment by 12 months failed. This week, S&P Global Ratings cut Vanke’s long-term issuer rating to selective default, saying the grace-period extension counted as a distressed debt restructuring. Some offshore bondholders have been contacted by Houlihan Lokey Inc. and PJT Partners, firms often involved before formal creditor groups are set up to handle restructuring talks. At the policy level, officials continue to adjust housing rules while avoiding direct rescues of individual firms. Beijing city said it will ease home purchase rules for non-residents to support sales.

However, one analyst sees an explosive move ahead and shared a bullish Dogecoin price prediction of $1 if historical patterns repeat. Dogecoin seems headed to close the year with losses exceeding 60% as the crypto market has shunned well-established meme coins and has mostly favored exotic tokens like Pippin ($PIPPIN) and MemeCore ($M). $Doge /weekly #Dogecoin repeats the previous pattern pic.twitter.com/RKg3eNB9oy — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) December 25, 2025 However, trader Alan Tardigrade spotted an interesting duplicate of a descending triangle pattern that popped up back in 2024, and that led to a spike in the price of DOGE shortly afterward. Same as back then, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) technical indicator fell below a key area of support and then started to increase rapidly after DOGE broke the triangle. Tardigrade predicts a potential move to $1 if this happens. This is consistent with the kind of upside potential seen in 2024, when DOGE spiked from $0.10 to $0.45 in a matter of weeks. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Could Drop By Another 31% Before the Next Leg Up Commences Looking at Dogecoin’s chart, there’s still room for further downside before this next leg up unfolds. Source: TradingVIew Trading volumes have subsided on Christmas Day as most traders are away enjoying the holidays. Data from CoinMarketCap shows a 25% drop, accounting for 3% of the token’s circulating market cap. The price just broke below the $0.13 support, and could now be heading to the $0.09 area. This means a 31% downside risk in the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has failed to move above the 14-day moving average and the mid-line for weeks. This means that bears are still in control of the price action as negative momentum readings continue to be high. Apart from well-established meme coins like DOGE, a new mine-to-earn (M2E) game called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) offers a fun, easy, and inexpensive way to mine meme coins. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Presale Raises Nearly $2.4M to ‘Gamify’ Mining Mining cryptocurrencies previously required thousands of dollars invested in expensive equipment. However, Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that by introducing a fun blockchain-based game that lets players launch mining servers instantly and without hassle.

In addition, up to 70% of the tokens used to upgrade existing rigs will be burned permanently to reduce $PEPENODE’s circulating supply.

The complaint, filed on Dec. 22, 2025, in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, names seven defendants tied to what regulators describe as a classic “investment confidence” scheme. The SEC says the operation relied on fake trading platforms, fabricated profits, and aggressive messaging tactics to lure victims. According to the agency, the case reflects a growing pattern of crypto scams that blend social media recruitment, encrypted messaging apps, and false claims of regulatory approval. Alleged scheme relied on WhatsApp groups and fake platforms The SEC says the fraud began with online ads and social media outreach that funneled potential investors into private WhatsApp groups. There, scammers posed as experienced traders and financial educators while promoting crypto strategies described as AI driven and low risk. Within those groups, the defendants allegedly encouraged members to open accounts on three supposed trading platforms: Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co., Ltd., and Cirkor Inc. The SEC claims the platforms falsely presented themselves as licensed or registered with U.S. regulators . Once funds were deposited, investors reportedly saw dashboards showing steady gains. However, regulators say the balances and profits were entirely fabricated and designed only to build confidence and prompt larger deposits. Fake token offerings and blocked withdrawals followed After initial “success,” the SEC alleges the defendants pushed victims to buy sham “security token offerings” linked to companies that did not exist. Promotional materials promised high returns and exclusive access. When investors attempted to withdraw funds, the platforms allegedly imposed surprise fees and taxes. The SEC says operators threatened account freezes or total losses unless additional payments were made. Investigators also allege that most investor funds were quickly transferred overseas through a network of bank accounts and crypto wallets, leaving little chance of recovery once victims stopped paying. Enforcement action fits broader SEC crackdown The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and the return of ill gotten gains, plus interest. The agency says the lawsuit underscores its focus on retail investor protection in crypto markets. In recent years, regulators have repeatedly warned about scams using messaging apps, fake trading apps, and false regulatory claims. The SEC says this case follows earlier actions against similar crypto confidence schemes that surged during past market cycles. Officials continue to urge investors to verify registration claims and remain cautious of unsolicited crypto investment offers.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-25 14:22:08
56347426,https://finbold.com/?p=259641,1766672611,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,2 cryptocurrencies to reach a $1 billion market cap in 2026,https://finbold.com/2-cryptocurrencies-to-reach-a-1-billion-market-cap-in-2026/,"A growing number of analysts expect fresh capital to rotate back into crypto markets in 2026, particularly toward assets with clear narratives, improving liquidity, and visible catalysts. Based on Finbold’s analysis on Christmas Day 2025 and recent market behaviour, two cryptocurrencies stand out as realistic candidates to (re)approach a $1 billion market capitalization next year. OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) OFFICIAL TRUMP ( TRUMP ) is currently trading near the psychologically important $1 billion market cap threshold after rebounding to around $4.96, up roughly 2.6% over the past 24 hours. The move is notable given that the token remains down approximately 20% over the last 30 days, suggesting the recent bounce is less about trend reversal and more about structural factors in supply and sentiment. TRUMP 1-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The most immediate pressure on TRUMP came from a $24.8 million token unlock on December 22, when 4.89 million tokens entered circulation. While unlocks often exacerbate downside momentum, price action on December 25 indicates that the market has largely absorbed this new supply. Volume has stabilized, and selling pressure appears to have eased, allowing the token to reclaim ground near prior resistance. Looking ahead, TRUMP’s path toward a sustained $1 billion valuation will likely hinge on whether the $5 level flips from resistance into support. As a politically themed memecoin, its narrative remains a double-edged sword. Regulatory risk is persistent, but election cycles, media exposure, and political milestones could reintroduce speculative demand. With roughly 800 million tokens still reserved for gradual release by Trump-linked entities, supply dynamics will remain a central variable through 2026. Cosmos (ATOM) Cosmos ( ATOM ) is approaching the $1 billion market cap mark from a fundamentally different angle. ATOM rose just over 3% in the past 24 hours, outperforming the broader crypto market, and currently sits near a $966 million valuation. While still down nearly 19% over the past 30 days, recent developments suggest improving medium-term fundamentals. ATOM 1-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap A key catalyst is THORChain’s launch of a public beta for its native cross-chain swap interface on December 23. The update allows direct ATOM swaps without bridges or wrapped assets, increasing Cosmos’ exposure to THORChain’s liquidity network. This integration likely contributed to a pickup in trading activity, with ATOM posting roughly $42.7 million in 24-hour volume. At the same time, Cosmos Labs has issued a Request for Proposals to redesign ATOM’s tokenomics by January 15, 2026. Speculation around lower inflation and improved fee capture from major Cosmos SDK chains such as dYdX and Cronos has added a constructive undertone to price action. While the outcome remains uncertain, the discussion alone has helped reframe ATOM as an evolving asset rather than a stagnant one. The bigger picture Both TRUMP and ATOM have traded well above $1 billion market caps in previous cycles, making a return to that level far from inconceivable. TRUMP relies on narrative-driven momentum and supply absorption, while Cosmos’ case rests on ecosystem growth and economic restructuring. If capital inflows accelerate in 2026, these contrasting paths could converge at the same destination, a renewed $1 billion valuation.

The move marks another step in the city’s effort to bring more crypto-related activities under formal oversight. The government said the new regimes will sit alongside the existing licensing system for virtual asset trading platforms, which is already supervised by the Securities and Futures Commission. Officials aim to close regulatory gaps covering firms that deal in digital assets or hold client crypto assets outside licensed exchanges. The proposals follow public consultations conducted by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the SFC. Authorities reported broad support from market participants and said they will now move toward legislative drafting. New Licenses Target Dealers and Custodians Under the planned framework, virtual asset dealers will require a license to provide dealing services, including over-the-counter crypto transactions. Regulators said this will bring these firms under standards similar to those applied to traditional securities dealers, while adjusting requirements to reflect crypto-specific risks. Virtual asse t custodians will also fall under a dedicated licensing regime. These firms are responsible for safeguarding client digital assets, including private keys. The government said custody rules will focus on asset segregation, internal controls, and operational resilience to reduce the risk of losses or misuse. The SFC will oversee both regimes, expanding its role beyond trading platforms. Officials said the goal is to ensure consistent supervision across the virtual asset ecosystem, rather than limiting oversight to exchanges alone. Framework Builds on Existing Platform Rules Hong Kong already requires virtual asset trading platforms to hold an SFC license. The regulator publishes a public register showing licensed platforms and applicants, giving investors visibility into which firms are authorized to operate. The new dealer and custodian regimes are designed to complement this system. Authorities said some firms currently operate outside the trading platform model but still handle client crypto assets or execute trades. The new rules aim to bring those activities within the same regulatory perimeter. Officials said the expanded framework supports investor protection while maintaining Hong Kong’s role as a digital asset hub. The government plans to submit legislation to the Legislative Council after completing technical work on the rules. Once implemented, the regimes will further formalize Hong Kong’s crypto market, aligning it more closely with traditional financial regulation while accounting for the distinct features of virtual assets.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-25 14:24:05

Fortune magazine reached this conclusion after analyzing forecasts from 15 major global banks using the Perplexity AI model to distill their outlooks into one defining theme. According to the analysis , banks view 2026 as a mix of powerful long-term trends and growing structural vulnerabilities. Markets appear resilient on the surface, but that strength depends on a narrow set of conditions, while risks continue to build across geopolitical, monetary, and valuation fronts. Major US stock indexes: the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq ended 2025 with solid gains despite trade disputes, inflation pressures, and persistent concerns about asset bubbles. Many analysts expect momentum to carry into 2026, supported in part by fiscal stimulus from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which the US Senate approved in July. Still, optimism is increasingly concentrated. For many strategists, the market’s confidence rests largely on one factor: artificial intelligence. AI Optimism Meets the Risk of Overheating Artificial intelligence is emerging as both a driver of growth and a source of instability. In a note titled Promise and Pressure , JPMorgan Wealth Management CEO Christine Lemko said AI is expected to reshape industries and investment opportunities by 2026, but warned that enthusiasm may be running ahead of fundamentals. JPMorgan estimates that Big Tech’s annual capital spending has surged from roughly $150 billion in 2023 to a projected $500 billion by 2026. Nearly 40% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization is now tied directly or indirectly to expectations around AI-driven growth. While comparisons to the dot-com era are inevitable, JPMorgan argues the situation is not yet extreme. The bank tracks five indicators of speculative excess and says none are currently flashing red. Analysts note that investor euphoria is rising but has not yet reached levels that would trigger heightened caution. At the same time, JPMorgan acknowledges that many of the ingredients for a future market bubble are in place. The firm believes the risk of a bubble forming later is greater than the risk that markets have already peaked. Macroeconomic Fault Lines Beneath the Surface Beyond AI, broader economic forces add to the uncertain outlook. Deutsche Bank economists Jim Reid and Peter Sidorov point to political fragmentation in Europe and the potential for renewed US-China tensions following the end of a year-long trade truce. They also warn that recession risks are elevated due to a fragile labor market. The US economy continues to show weak job growth, while the unemployment rate remains stable largely because the labor force is shrinking. Macquarie Chief Economist David Doyle describes the situation as a delicate balance, noting that even a modest acceleration in layoffs could push unemployment higher. Goldman Sachs shares that concern. Chief economist Jan Hatzius identifies the labor market as the economy’s primary vulnerability, saying that while a recession may be avoided, it remains too early to rule one out. These dynamics are also shaping Federal Reserve policy. Despite inflation remaining above the 2% target, signs of labor market weakness gave the Fed room to cut interest rates. Bank of America forecasts core inflation of 2.8% by the end of 2026 and 2.4% by the end of 2027, with short-term pressure coming from tariffs and temporary factors, including price adjustments linked to the men’s World Cup. Consumers and a K-Shaped Recovery After the pandemic, US consumers surprised economists with their resilience. By late 2025, however, a K-shaped economy is becoming more evident. Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi says wealthier households continue to strengthen their finances, while roughly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Despite these pressures, overall sentiment on Wall Street remains cautiously optimistic. Vanguard notes that economies have held up through rising tariffs, a plateau in labor supply, and slowing growth. Still, Deutsche Bank cautions that investors should not expect calm markets, warning that sharp swings in sentiment are likely in 2026.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-25 14:36:55

As of December 25, users reported that platforms including Coinbase and Gemini were unavailable through several major internet service providers. According to the Manila Bulletin , the restrictions follow an order from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC). The regulator directed providers to block access to around 50 online trading platforms identified by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as operating without proper authorization. Philippine regulators have not released a complete list of affected services. However, the move signals a clear shift in regulatory posture, as authorities move from informal tolerance toward stricter enforcement. Under the new approach, holding a local license has become a key requirement for operating in the country’s crypto market. Blocking Orders Expand Beyond Binance The restrictions on Coinbase and Gemini follow earlier action against Binance, marking a broader campaign against unlicensed crypto platforms. In December 2023, authorities introduced a 90-day transition period requiring Binance to comply with local regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the grace period was intended to give users time to withdraw their funds. On March 25, 2024, the NTC ordered internet providers to block Binance’s services. Nearly a month later, the SEC requested that Apple and Google remove the exchange’s app from their app stores. After the block was fully implemented, the SEC said it could no longer approve any refund mechanisms for Filipino users. Regulators Signal Wider Enforcement Ahead More recently, the SEC identified 10 additional exchanges. including OKX, Bybit, and KuCoin — that it said were operating in the Philippines without a license. In a statement, the NTC said its directive was based on a formal request from the BSP to block websites and mobile applications of unlicensed virtual asset service providers. The agency emphasized that the measures are part of a broader effort to strengthen oversight of digital financial services. The NTC cited Section 902-N of the Non-Banking Financial Institutions Regulation Manual, as amended by BSP Circular No. 1206, which sets out the operational requirements for virtual asset service providers in the Philippines. The regulator said blocking access is intended to prevent further activity by unregistered platforms that expose the public to financial risks. The commission added that similar action could extend to other international firms as authorities seek to limit unauthorized financial transactions and unregulated exchanges. All financial services operating in the Philippines, the NTC said, must comply with central bank requirements. Even as enforcement tightens, companies operating within the regulatory framework are expanding their presence. Separately, the Philippine government has launched the Integrity Chain blockchain platform to record public contracts and infrastructure milestones, highlighting that while unlicensed crypto activity faces restrictions, regulated blockchain initiatives continue to move forward.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-25 14:47:11

At the same time, Glassnode charts showed cycle timing staying close to past patterns as capitulation surged to a new high. Asia Drives Bitcoin Buying as US Leads Selling, Data Shows Bitcoin trading patterns split sharply by region this week, with US sessions turning into the largest source of selling while Asian hours absorbed most of the buying, according to cumulative return data shared by analyst Ted Pillows. Bitcoin Cumulative Return by Session. Source: Velo Data, Ted Pillows The chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s cumulative return by trading session, shows US hours sliding steadily into negative territory from Dec. 18 to Dec. 25. During the same period, Asia Pacific sessions climbed consistently, building positive returns while Europe hovered closer to flat. As a result, net price support increasingly came from Asian markets as US pressure weighed on the downside. Meanwhile, the divergence became clearer after midweek volatility. US sessions saw repeated drawdowns that pushed cumulative returns deeper below zero, suggesting sustained distribution rather than brief profit taking. In contrast, Asia continued to post gains even as price action softened elsewhere, indicating stronger dip buying during those hours. Overall, the session based breakdown highlights how regional flows are shaping short term Bitcoin price action. While US traders reduced exposure, Asian demand helped offset selling and stabilize the broader market. The data underscores that Bitcoin’s recent moves depend less on a single market and more on shifting regional participation as liquidity rotates across global trading hours. Bitcoin Cycle Timing Matches Prior Market Phases Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s current market cycle continues to follow historical timing patterns seen in previous bull and consolidation phases, according to cycle performance data shared by analyst CryptoGerla. The chart compares Bitcoin’s price performance since cycle lows across multiple market cycles, including 2011–2015, 2015–2018, 2018–2022, and the current cycle. Bitcoin Price Performance Since Cycle Low. Source: Glassnode, CryptoGerla The data shows that Bitcoin’s post-low price trajectory in the current cycle closely aligns with earlier cycles at similar time intervals. After the initial expansion phase, price action typically shifts into a cooling period marked by lower highs and slowing momentum. The highlighted section on the chart shows that previous cycles experienced comparable drawdowns and consolidation phases before the cycle fully matured. Overall, the cycle comparison suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price behavior reflects structural repetition rather than an anomaly. While short-term volatility remains present, the broader timing model indicates that the market continues to move within a familiar historical framework rather than deviating from past cycle behavior. Capitulation Gauge Hits New High Alongside Late Year Sell Off A Glassnode chart shared by trader Gordon Gekko shows Bitcoin’ s “capitulation metric” surging to its highest reading on record as spot price dropped sharply in late 2025. The red capitulation line jumps toward the top of the chart’s right axis, while the black price line falls from recent highs above $110,000 toward the $100,000 area.

Earlier capitulation spikes appeared during mid 2024 and again in early 2025, and each coincided with fast price drawdowns. However, the latest spike stands out as the largest move on the series, suggesting a heavier wave of forced selling or loss realization compared with prior pullbacks in the same window. Gordon said the reading indicates the strongest capitulation event seen so far and linked it to heightened volatility.

The forecast aligns with the Fed’s own projections and recent rate history, which show policymakers cutting cautiously after periods of economic stress rather than rushing toward deep stimulus. The view comes as markets weigh how far and how fast the Fed may ease after the sharp tightening that followed the 2022 inflation surge. Fed History Shows Caution After Major Shocks The federal funds rate has moved in long cycles shaped by crises and recoveries. After the 2008 global financial crisis, the Fed cut rates rapidly toward zero and kept them there for years during the post-GFC recovery. A similar emergency response followed the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, when rates again fell near zero to stabilize the economy. Federal Funds Rate History. Source: Federal Reserve / iShares That pattern shifted sharply in 2022 as inflation surged. The Fed lifted rates at the fastest pace in decades, pushing the policy rate above 5 percent by 2023. Since then, inflation has cooled, but officials have signaled caution about cutting too quickly, aiming to avoid repeating past stop-and-go mistakes. BlackRock’s analysts frame the current phase as different from prior crises. With growth slowing but not collapsing, they argue that policy no longer needs emergency-level support. As a result, any cuts are likely to be gradual and data-dependent rather than front-loaded. Dot Plot Points to Limited Easing Through 2026 The Federal Open Market Committee’s December 2025 dot plot reinforces that view. The median projection shows the fed funds rate easing from about 3.6 percent in 2025 to roughly 3.4 percent in 2026, then drifting toward 3.1 percent in 2027 and 3.0 percent in the longer run. December 2025 Fed Dot Plot. Source: Federal Reserve That path implies roughly one to two quarter-point cuts in 2026, depending on economic conditions. While some policymakers see room for deeper easing, the highest forecasts in the dot plot stay near 4 percent, highlighting persistent uncertainty around inflation and labor markets. BlackRock ’s base case broadly tracks the median dots, with expectations centered on 25 to 50 basis points of cuts next year. The firm emphasizes that stronger-than-expected employment or sticky services inflation could slow that pace, while a sharper growth slowdown could accelerate it. For now, both BlackRock and the Fed signal the same message.

For those investors currently searching for the best crypto to invest in, there emerges the scarce yet highly profitable investment opportunity of MUTM, fueled by its highly organized presale and massive acceptance from the investing community. This new crypto has attracted attention from both retail and institutional investors, signaling its potential as a serious contender in the market. Instead of experiencing stalled prices, like the sideways action of BTC in the face of market uncertainty, MUTM has received massive acceptance, having sold almost all of Phase 6 of its presale, which has attracted the impulsive involvement of almost 19,000 people, along with contributions of more than $19 million. Early supporters of MUTM are also currently enjoying more than 250% profit from its original investment price of $0.01, and the succeeding presale phases promise yet another price boost, solidifying its place among the best crypto to invest in. Bitcoin Experiences Correction to $85K – What’s Next for Traders? Bitcoin (BTC) has just experienced the biggest collapse today, dropping to the range of $85,000 due to an inability to sustain the breakout above the significant resistance trend line at $90,000. The sharp decline was accompanied by aggressive bearish 4-hour candlesticks, indicating that leveraged buy orders were quickly unwinding due to overwhelming pressure from sellers. As of now, Bitcoin has been supported temporarily at the level of $85,500, and it is an extremely important task to hold it above that point if any type of comeback to the level of $88,500 or another try to reach $90,000 is to be expected. Otherwise, the decline below $85,500 may provoke an adjustment to the zone around $80,000, where technical and psychological factors meet. Although Bitcoin prices continue to put pressure, many investors have been looking recently into diverse sectors in the crypto market, specifically searching for new crypto projects that show strong potential in the DeFi and blockchain space. Phase 6 Presale Momentum Indicates Rising Confidence Among Investors The recent momentum that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seeing rapid demand in Phase 6 of their presale highlights why this project is being considered among the best crypto to invest in today. Investors are now hurrying to grab their tokens prior to cost increase in phase 7. A total of $19.5 million has been raised by the project, with a total of 18,580 MUTM token holders so far since the presale began. The current price for Phase 6 is $0.035. This is an increase of 250% from the initial price of $0.01 in Phase 1. As soon as Phase 6 ends, Phase 7 begins at $0.04, which is close to a 20% increment, exemplifying the importance of timely investors. Most investors believe that MUTM is among the most promising new crypto coins destined to attain $1. Enhanced Infrastructure Ensures Pricing Accuracy and Reliability Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracle services to provide accurate pricing feeds by cross-referencing the prices of its token with highly traded assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Mutuum Finance deploys various oracle solutions such as fallback oracles, aggregation feeds, and in-chain data. This robust infrastructure facilitates collateral value estimations, risk management, and liquidation mechanisms, ensuring that Mutuum Finance runs efficiently in all market scenarios. The appeal of MUTM does not just end there. Its innovative loan and borrow mechanism ensures sustainable usability of the cryptocurrency by offering interest for participation in the system. Further, the smart contract developed for lending and borrowing is audited by Halborn Security, making it one of the best crypto to invest in for both short-term gains and long-term reliability. While the current state of the market has Bitcoin struggling to retain $85K support levels, smart investors are exploring opportunities in projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $19.5 million in sales and phase 6 close to sold out with 18,580 holders already on board, the time to get in on the ground floor of the next big cryptocurrency of 2026 is running out fast. Early entry into this new crypto could position investors at the forefront of the market, placing MUTM firmly among the best crypto to invest in this year.

Financial institutions are no longer asking whether digital assets belong in capital markets, but which networks can realistically support settlement, liquidity, and compliance at scale. This shift has placed renewed focus on blockchain systems that mirror the logic of traditional finance while improving efficiency. That institutional recalibration was spotlighted in a recent clip shared by Mr. Man on X, featuring comments from Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital , during a discussion on crypto investment products and market demand. McClurg’s remarks provide a rare, ground-level view of how different investor classes are responding to XRP-linked offerings—and why XRP continues to resonate with global capital markets. “XRPL and XRP are the rails to the GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM” – Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital pic.twitter.com/3tNSPU2Fot — Mr. Man (@MrManXRP) December 24, 2025 Retail Momentum Meets Institutional Capital McClurg explained that when new exchange-traded products tied to digital assets are launched, early traction typically comes from retail investors. Canary Capital observed that same pattern initially. However, within a short period, the firm began receiving outreach from pension funds and insurance companies across multiple jurisdictions. This progression is significant. Pension funds and insurers are among the most conservative participants in global finance, constrained by long-term liabilities, regulatory requirements, and risk controls. Their growing engagement signals that XRP is being evaluated not just as a crypto asset, but as a financial instrument with systemic relevance. Why XRP Is Intuitive for Wall Street A key point raised by McClurg is that XRP is comparatively easy for traditional finance professionals to understand. Unlike highly abstract or experimental blockchain models, XRP’s core function aligns with familiar financial concepts: settlement, liquidity, and payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By describing XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as “the rails for the financial system,” McClurg framed the asset in infrastructure terms rather than speculative ones. The XRPL’s emphasis on speed , cost efficiency, and reliability closely resembles the purpose of legacy payment rails—only modernized through blockchain technology. Growing Global Interest in Financial Rails McClurg’s comments also highlight that interest is not confined to the United States. Global capital markets, particularly institutions exploring cross-border payments and on-chain settlement, are increasingly attentive to blockchain networks that can integrate with existing financial structures. As tokenization, real-time settlement, and digital liquidity become strategic priorities, infrastructure-focused assets like XRP are gaining credibility. Rather than attempting to serve every possible blockchain use case, XRP’s specialization appears to align with what large financial institutions are actively seeking. A Shift Toward Utility-Centered Valuation The broader implication of McClurg’s remarks is a shift in how digital assets are being evaluated. Utility, clarity, and institutional compatibility are emerging as decisive factors. In that environment, XRP’s long-standing focus on payments and financial infrastructure positions it as a serious contender in the evolving architecture of global finance. As institutional interest deepens, the narrative around XRP is increasingly less about speculation—and more about its role in the future plumbing of the financial system.

Kyle Dijamco, a 31-year-old marketer based in Los Angeles, sits right in the middle of that crowd. He holds about $25,000 worth of Palantir shares. He added to that position earlier this year after the stock pulled back. “It’s an exciting stock to own,” Kyle said. His bet reflects a wider trend among small investors who kept buying even when the stock slipped. Retail investors pour billions into Palantir despite valuation warnings Retail investors are on track to buy literally $8 billion worth of Palantir’s stock on a net basis as of press time, which is an increase of over 80% in a year and more than 400% rally compared from 2 years ago in 2023. This helped turn Palantir into the fifth most-bought security of the year, trailing only Tesla, Nvidia, and the SPY itself. “It’s been great,” said Viraj Patel, deputy head of research at Vanda, which tracks retail trading flows. “Palantir has kind of been brought into this group of AI-tech poster children.” Retail interest followed strong gains. The stock rose more than 150% in 2025, setting up a third straight year of triple-digit growth. Over three years, the shares climbed nearly 3,000%, far ahead of the S&P 500’s roughly 80% gain and the Nasdaq Composite’s more than 120% rise. Since its 2020 market debut, Palantir has often confused investors. The company works with governments and private firms, helping them organize large data sets. The stock also drew attention as artificial intelligence spending grew and as the Trump administration pushed policies focused on federal efficiency and national defense. “The joke for a while has always been like, ‘What does Palantir even do?’” said Paxton Earl, a software-focused investment banker. After reading filings, Paxton said his view changed. “This is actually an insane business. It’s really good.” He learned the company earns revenue beyond military contracts and works with consumer brands such as Ferrari and Wendy’s. Wall Street hesitates as social media backs the stock The PLTR stock crashed by 16% in November, its worst monthly performance in more than two years, after investors sold AI-related names over valuation concerns. Wall Street described the decline as profit-taking mixed with worries about the AI trade. Even so, Palantir stayed popular online, appearing appeared frequently on the dumb money WallStreetBets forum and ranked as the most mentioned ticker on several days in 2025, based on tracking by Breakout Point. “They [retail investors] adore it,” said Ivan Ćosović, managing director at Breakout Point. Some online creators raised ethical concerns tied to wartime technology and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts, but that debate did not stop discussion. The company also leaned into retail attention. Unlike many firms, Palantir allows questions from individual investors during earnings calls. In a video filmed on a ski trail, CEO Alex Karp thanked small shareholders. “Exceedingly grateful to all of you individual investors who took the time and opportunity,” Alex said. Institutional investors surveyed by LSEG mostly rated the stock a hold. Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, said the valuation makes the shares a “non-starter” for many clients. Palantir trades at about 450 times trailing earnings, far above the S&P 500 average near 28, which is very similar to Tesla’s setup a decade ago, as the company remains the only one with more retail concentration than institutional. Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management revealed short positions against Palantir and Nvidia in the third quarter. Alex dismissed the move as “bats— crazy.” Retail investors stayed focused on price swings. “You kind of become a little bit desensitized to the price swings,” Kyle said. He plans to buy more shares on the next downturn. “I just have that conviction that it’s going to do well.” Get seen where it counts.

The decision gives chip buyers and supply chains temporary certainty, yet it signals that Washington still plans to act later if conditions change. The move comes as global governments continue to treat semiconductors as strategic assets. As a result, trade tools remain central to broader efforts to reshape technology supply chains. Tariff Delay Extends Section 301 Action The delay stems from a Section 301 investigation led by the Office of the United States Trade Representative into China’s semiconductor policies. The probe began in late 2024 and focused on alleged state support for China’s chip industry, including mature or “legacy” semiconductors used in cars, appliances, and industrial equipment. Under the final decision, the tariff rate stays at zero for 18 months. Any increase will not take effect before June 23, 2027. In addition, U.S. officials must announce the final rate at least 30 days before enforcement, giving companies time to adjust sourcing and contracts. For now, the delay reduces immediate cost pressure on U.S. manufacturers that still rely on Chinese chips. At the same time, it keeps the threat of future tariffs alive, allowing Washington to revisit the issue as trade talks and industrial policy evolve. Tariffs Add to a Long History of Chip Tensions The postponed action does not replace existing measures. A separate 50 percent tariff on certain Chinese semiconductors, introduced earlier, already took effect at the start of 2025. That layer remains in place and continues to shape trade flows between the two countries. Semiconductors have played a growing role in U.S. trade policy since the late 2010s. Earlier tariff rounds targeted a wide range of Chinese technology goods. More recently, Washington has paired tariffs with export controls and domestic subsidies to reduce reliance on overseas chip production. By delaying the new tariff until 2027, the United States adds flexibility to that strategy. Officials can monitor market conditions, domestic chip capacity, and China’s policy response before locking in higher duties. Meanwhile, companies face a familiar pattern: short-term stability, followed by longer-term uncertainty. Together, these steps show how semiconductors remain at the center of U.S.–China economic rivalry, with tariffs used less as a shock tool and more as a calibrated lever.",News|Ai,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-25 15:08:24

Price action and momentum indicators suggest the bearish structure remains intact, with downside risks increasing unless buyers step in quickly. This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto PR agency that is committed to data-backed communication in the crypto industry. Outset PR helps Web3 projects amplify their narrative and convert momentum into verifiable outcomes. ADA Slips Below Moving Averages As of time of writing, ADA is trading around $0.35, firmly below both its 7-day simple moving average at $0.365 and the 30-day SMA at $0.40. Trading beneath these short- and medium-term averages confirms weak market structure and ongoing downside control by sellers. The loss of the $0.357 pivot level proved critical. Once broken, stop-loss orders were triggered, accelerating selling pressure and pushing the price toward recent lows. Momentum indicators continue to support the bearish outlook. The MACD histogram stands at -0.00025, confirming negative momentum and a lack of bullish follow-through. The Relative Strength Index is currently at 35.46, signaling oversold conditions. While this increases the probability of short-term stabilization or a technical bounce, oversold readings alone are not sufficient to reverse a downtrend without confirmation from price structure. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. ADA Key Levels to Watch On the downside, the immediate level to watch is $0.347, which marks the most recent swing low. A daily close below this support would expose ADA to a deeper move toward the 2025 low near $0.320. On the upside, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.451 now acts as resistance, highlighting the extent of the recent breakdown. Any recovery attempts below this level are likely to face selling pressure. Cardano Price Outlook ADA remains below critical support and moving averages, with bearish momentum firmly in place. While oversold conditions may limit immediate downside, a failure to hold $0.347 would likely extend losses toward $0.320. Until ADA reclaims key resistance levels, the technical outlook continues to favor further downside risk. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

One of the methods to fix this is to build credibility through media coverage. It is quite easy to appear in a headline, but it is hard to stay visible in places that matter. The gap is rarely budget — it is whether media attention is earned or manufactured. This is why organic PR has become central to how trusted crypto companies communicate today. Agencies like Outset PR, which work closely with journalists rather than around them, have built their approach on this shift. Why crypto media plays by different rules Crypto journalism moves fast and filters hard. Editors cover volatile markets, regulatory pressure, and technical failures in real time. At the same time, they operate with deep skepticism. Years of sponsored “analysis” and short-lived projects have made promotional language easy to spot and quick to reject. As a result, most top-tier outlets avoid paid placements altogether. They rely on expert commentary, not press releases. Visibility follows relevance, not spend. How organic PR works in crypto Organic PR is earned media driven by editorial need. A project appears in coverage because a journalist needs insight, explanation, or interpretation — and a credible source delivers it clearly and on time. Insight replaces announcements Journalists rarely need product updates framed as news. They need answers. In crypto, that usually means: Explaining market reactions Interpreting regulatory developments Breaking down protocol mechanics Providing context after hacks or failures Projects that contribute clear, non-promotional insight become useful quickly. Those that push messaging do not. Proactive pitching follows the story, not the roadmap Effective organic PR tracks what journalists are already writing — and what they are about to write. PR teams pitch concise, ready-to-use commentary that fits those narratives. When done well, one pitch can lead to multiple features across outlets, because the insight travels with the story. This is not about volume. It is about alignment. Reactive commentary depends on speed Many of the best opportunities come through journalist requests. These often arrive with hours, sometimes minutes, to respond. Most Web3 teams cannot operate at that speed internally. Founders are busy. Legal checks slow everything down. By the time commentary is ready, the article is published. This is where Press Office by Outset PR emerged. The service monitors journalist requests in real time, shapes media-ready responses, and delivers them fast enough to be usable. Journalists select quotes based on clarity, relevance, and authority. Tone matters, so promotional language is filtered out. Sources who consistently deliver clean, useful insight become repeat contributors. This is how organic PR compounds over time. Outset PR’s Press Office Works as a Personal Newsroom Instead of campaign-based PR, many crypto-native teams now operate as ongoing press offices. The approach focuses on: Continuous expert commentary Proactive and reactive media engagement Long-term journalist relationships At Outset PR, the Press Office model treats media work as infrastructure rather than promotion. Angles are selected, commentary is shaped, outreach is handled, and results are measured against clear benchmarks. The output is not one-off exposure, but steady presence in tier-1 outlets where paid coverage is not an option. Final thoughts Earning trust in blockchain is not about louder messaging or more coverage. It is about showing up consistently, with clear insight, in places where credibility is earned. Organic PR works in crypto because it respects how media actually functions. Models like the Press Office at Outset PR reflect that reality: earned visibility, built over time, grounded in editorial value. In a market where trust is scarce, that approach remains one of the few that scales without breaking credibility. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The sharp downturn breaks from the typical end-of-year rally, highlighting growing caution among investors. Historical data highlights the depth of Bitcoin’s current slump. The last Q4 this weakness was witnessed was in 2018, when BTC plunged 42.16% during the post-bull-market crash. While today’s decline is milder, it still signals a rare break from Bitcoin’s usual year-end resilience. Market sentiment reflects growing unease among traders and investors. Per Coincodex data, Bitcoin is presently trading at $87,709, with the Fear & Greed Index registering a low of 23. This reading indicates “ extreme fear ,” a state often associated with heightened volatility and cautious market behavior. Investors appear wary, influenced by broader macroeconomic pressures and uncertainty surrounding the crypto regulatory landscape. Well, Bitcoin’s sluggish performance reflects a convergence of global pressures, such as high interest rates, tightening liquidity, and persistent inflation concerns have eroded risk appetite, hitting speculative assets hardest. As a high-risk asset, Bitcoin has been particularly vulnerable. While extreme fear can occasionally present long-term buying opportunities, analysts warn that bearish sentiment and technical weakness may drive further short-term declines. Traders are closely watching key support levels and macroeconomic signals that could either stabilize the market or accelerate the slide. Despite a challenging market, crypto experts note Bitcoin’s historical resilience over the long term. Past corrections, including the steep Q4 losses of 2018, were eventually followed by strong recoveries, highlighting the asset’s rebound potential. Near-term prospects remain cautious, with traders contending with heightened uncertainty and sentiment-driven swings. As 2025 draws to a close, analysts are closely monitoring sentiment indicators, trading volumes, and macroeconomic trends to assess whether Bitcoin can regain momentum or extend its year-end slide. Conclusion On Christmas Day, Bitcoin faces one of its weakest Q4s in years, with extreme fear dominating market sentiment. While caution is key, history shows such downturns often precede strong rebounds. BTC’s performance in the coming weeks will be crucial, shaping both short-term trading and market sentiment as 2026 approaches",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-25 15:20:04

Why Esports Betting Is Different from Traditional Sports Esports betting doesn’t behave like football, basketball, or tennis. Matches are faster, momentum shifts more often, and betting markets react almost instantly to in-game events. A few key differences stand out right away: Matches are shorter and more volatile Markets change rapidly during play Live betting matters more than pre-match lines Odds move aggressively after small events In CS:GO, a single pistol round can flip the outlook of an entire map. In Dota 2, one lost team fight or failed Roshan attempt can swing win probabilities within seconds. This makes esports betting odds far more sensitive than those in traditional sports. Because of that, esports bettors tend to value: Fast bet execution Stable live odds updates Platforms that don’t freeze markets constantly Crypto fits this environment well. When deposits, bets, and withdrawals move quickly, bettors can focus on timing rather than logistics. This is one of the main reasons esports crypto betting has outpaced traditional payment methods in competitive gaming markets. Dexsport — Esports Crypto Betting Platform Reviewed Dexsport is designed with fast-moving markets in mind, and esports betting is a clear example of where that design pays off. Rather than treating esports as a secondary category, Dexsport integrates CS:GO and Dota 2 directly into its core betting experience. CS:GO and Dota 2 Markets on Dexsport Dexsport covers the most commonly used esports markets without overloading the interface. For CS:GO and Dota 2 bettors, this balance is important. Typical markets include: Match winner Map winner Total maps Handicap betting Live betting during ongoing maps These options are easy to access, and market switches during live play feel smooth rather than disruptive. This is especially useful for csgo betting with crypto and dota 2 betting with crypto, where timing often matters more than long-term prediction. Esports Odds and Live Betting Performance Dexsport performs well in live esports environments. Odds update consistently, and markets tend to remain open longer instead of locking after every minor event. This creates more real opportunities rather than forcing bettors to chase closed lines. For live bettors, this matters: Fewer rejected bets due to odds changes Clear signaling when lines are adjusted Better flow during high-action moments This makes Dexsport competitive as both a best csgo esports crypto betting site and a strong option for dota 2 esports crypto betting without relying on gimmicks. Crypto Speed and Usability Crypto integration on Dexsport feels natural rather than bolted on. Bets are placed directly from crypto balances, and the platform avoids unnecessary friction during active sessions. For esports bettors, the advantage is simple: No delays when moving funds No interruptions during live matches Faster access to winnings after settlement Dexsport works best when markets move fast — which is exactly how esports behaves. What Makes CS:GO and Dota 2 Ideal for Crypto Betting Not all esports titles work equally well for betting. CS:GO and Dota 2 stand out because their match structure, pacing, and market depth align naturally with fast, crypto-based wagering. Both games generate constant in-game events, which means betting opportunities don’t stop after the opening minutes. For platforms that support esports crypto betting, this creates a steady flow of odds movement and live markets. CS:GO Betting Dynamics CS:GO is one of the most straightforward esports titles for betting. Matches are broken into clear rounds, maps, and series formats, making outcomes easier to follow even for casual viewers. What makes CS:GO especially suitable for crypto betting: Short rounds with frequent momentum shifts Clear win conditions at map and match level High liquidity on major tournaments Strong live betting demand Because events unfold quickly, csgo esports crypto betting rewards bettors who can act fast. Crypto platforms handle this better by removing payment delays and keeping live markets responsive. For many users, CS:GO becomes the entry point into csgo betting with crypto because the learning curve is relatively low compared to more complex esports titles. Dota 2 Betting Dynamics Dota 2 offers a deeper and more strategic betting environment. Matches last longer, and outcomes are influenced by drafting, objectives, and team coordination rather than simple scorelines. Key characteristics that define Dota 2 betting: Long matches with multiple swing points Objectives like towers and Roshan affecting odds Draft phase shaping early betting sentiment Strong live betting activity throughout the match Because of this structure, dota 2 esports betting with crypto often leans more heavily on live markets. Bettors can react to drafts, early-game tempo, or decisive team fights without committing everything pre-match. Crypto adds flexibility here. When odds change rapidly during long matches, having instant access to funds and stable execution becomes a real advantage. Why These Games Fit Crypto Betting So Well CS:GO and Dota 2 share one important trait: speed of information. Viewers see what’s happening in real time, and odds react almost immediately. Crypto betting platforms are better equipped to handle this environment because they: Support faster bet execution Keep live esports odds available longer Avoid interruptions caused by payment checks This combination is why CS:GO and Dota 2 continue to dominate esports betting odds markets — and why crypto has become the preferred payment method for many competitive esports bettors. Esports Betting Markets Explained (CS:GO & Dota 2) Understanding esports betting markets is essential before placing wagers, especially when using crypto. While CS:GO and Dota 2 share some common markets, each game also has its own logic that affects how bets should be approached. For players new to esports crypto betting, starting with core markets is usually more effective than chasing exotic options. Core Esports Betting Markets These markets form the foundation of both csgo crypto betting and dota betting crypto: Match WinnerThe simplest option — betting on which team wins the series. This market is popular pre-match and during early live phases. Map WinnerCommon in CS:GO, where each map plays differently. Bettors often use this market to react to strong starts or momentum shifts. Total MapsA popular strategic market for best-of-three or best-of-five series. It’s often used when teams are closely matched. Handicap BettingAllows bettors to back underdogs with a map or round advantage. Useful when odds on favorites feel too short. These markets are easy to follow and well-suited for both pre-match and live betting with crypto. Live Betting Markets and Timing Live betting is where esports truly separates itself from traditional sports. Odds change rapidly, and timing becomes more important than prediction alone. During live matches, bettors often focus on: Momentum after pistol rounds (CS:GO) Draft advantages and early kills (Dota 2) Objective control and economy swings Team fight outcomes In dota 2 esports crypto betting, live markets are especially active because matches can turn multiple times. Crypto platforms allow bettors to adjust positions without worrying about payment delays or locked balances. Common Mistakes in Esports Betting Even experienced bettors fall into predictable traps. A few to avoid: Overreacting to a single round or fight Betting every live market instead of waiting Ignoring team styles and map preferences Chasing losses during fast-moving matches Esports rewards discipline more than volume. Picking fewer, higher-quality bets usually leads to better long-term results. In esports betting, timing beats quantity. Final Verdict — Is Dexsport Worth It for Esports Crypto Betting? Esports betting demands speed, timing, and stable odds — and not every platform is built to handle that pace. CS:GO and Dota 2 move fast, live markets shift constantly, and small delays can completely change the value of a bet. This is where crypto-native platforms have a clear edge. Dexsport fits naturally into this environment. It doesn’t overcomplicate esports betting with unnecessary features or cluttered markets. Instead, it focuses on what matters most: clean CS:GO and Dota 2 coverage, responsive live betting, and smooth crypto execution. Dexsport works especially well for bettors who: Prefer csgo betting with crypto and dota 2 betting with crypto Rely on live esports markets rather than long pre-match builds Want stable esports odds without constant market freezes Value fast crypto handling during active betting sessions Rather than positioning itself as a general casino that happens to offer esports, Dexsport feels intentionally built for competitive betting. That makes it a strong contender for players searching for a best CS:GO esports crypto betting site or a reliable option for Dota 2 esports crypto betting. Ready to Bet on CS:GO and Dota 2 with Crypto? If you’re looking for a platform that matches the pace of esports and supports crypto betting without friction, Dexsport is worth a closer look.

Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Dec. 24, Hadick pushed back on the idea that crypto has entered a new “winter,” framing the year’s disappointment as a function of recency bias rather than a clean break in market structure. “It hasn’t had a great year. But I think it’s important to zoom out,” Hadick said. “If you look at the returns for bitcoin relative to the day before the election in ’24, bitcoin is up about 26%, Nasdaq is up about 28%… even further than that two years, bitcoin’s doubled, Nasdaq is up 50%.” Hadick emphasized he’s not trading chart patterns. “I’m not a technical investor. I’m a long-term investor. We’re a VC fund,” he said, adding that he “continue[s] to see a strong and constructive 2026. 2026 predictions are… another positive year for the industry (zoom out), especially for continued innovation in prediction markets, stablecoins and tokenized assets, and scalability and infrastructure for financial markets https://t.co/SIm1rCkiv9 — Rob Hadick ＞|＜ (@HadickM) December 24, 2025 2026 Crypto Predictions Pressed on what “a good 2026” means in practice for the crypto market, Hadick tied his outlook to macro conditions and what he sees as compounding real-world usage. “For the token prices themselves—bitcoin, ethereum—there’s likely to be continued momentum,” he said. “I think from a macroeconomic perspective … we’ll have better monetary policy. And then we’re going to have more and more adoption of tokenized assets.” One data point he said: “McKinsey just said that they think 3% of all cross-border payments is happening in stablecoins right now. That’s up from basically 0% a year ago,” Hadick said, adding that he expects “another tenfold increase.” Hadick described Dragonfly as deliberately non-ideological across chains and sectors, positioning the firm less as a “bitcoin vs. ethereum” shop and more as a bet on market-structure innovation. “We invest in everybody that’s doing anything that’s interesting in tokenized digital assets,” he said. “We’re not what I would say ideological about crypto. What we are is investing in the future of innovation in financial markets.” When the conversation turned from majors to categories, Hadick leaned into two themes: stablecoins and prediction markets . “Stablecoins I think are here to stay. I think it’s going to grow tenfold,” he said. “I think prediction markets are here to stay. I think they’re going to grow tenfold.” On prediction markets specifically, Hadick argued the addressable market extends well beyond sports betting, despite the current overlap. He pointed to Polymarket’s growth as evidence of expanding use cases. “If you look at Polymarket volume today, they’ve gone from $50 million a month in early ’24… they’re now going to do probably about $4 billion of volume this month,” he said, adding that “only about 35% of that is sports,” putting Polymarket in contrast with Kalshi, which he characterized as “more of a sports platform because they’re infrastructure for Robinhood.” Hadick also invoked Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeff Sprecher’s long-running tokenization thesis to argue prediction markets may converge with broader financial infrastructure rather than remain a niche wagering product. “If you talk to Jeff Sprecher over at ICE… he’ll tell you he believes in the tokenization of all markets,” Hadick said. “I talked to him before he made the investment in Polymarket… his perspective is that this is going to be as big as ICE itself. Probably.” He suggested the functional framing is less “bets” and more programmable risk transfer. “I talked to an insurance company maybe a month ago that was thinking about how they can hedge out risk in weather related activities,” Hadick said. “That’s just one use case… every single thing and every single market and outcome that can be put [into] a market—or really just a binary option, which is what it is.” Ethereum Vs. Solana Asked to pick sides in the Ethereum–Solana debate, Hadick refused the “MySpace vs. Facebook” framing. “No, they’re both Facebook,” he said, arguing the market will require multiple settlement environments if tokenization becomes mainstream. In his view, Ethereum’s advantage is where value and stablecoin liquidity already sit, while Solana’s edge is high-throughput, low-cost flow. “Most stablecoins today are on Ethereum,” Hadick said. “Ethereum is where a large amount of… economic activity exists… but if you look at the trading volume, it’s happening more on Solana, which is more optimized for that type of transaction flow and for low cost transactions.” Still, Hadick conceded the platform layer is not frozen. He said Dragonfly is invested in a newer chain, Monad, describing it as “trying to be a Solana killer,” and cited figures he said reflected early-stage market positioning: a roughly $2 billion valuation and a token price around $0.002. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.92 trillion.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Crypto Prediction 2026|Crypto Predictions|dragonfly capital|Rob Hadick,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-25 15:30:44

The news comes right after the monetary authority in Moscow published a plan for the regulation of digital asset transactions in Russia, including the provision of related services. Sberbank hopes to lend fiat using crypto as collateral Known now as Sber, Russia’s largest bank by assets, is exploring the possibility of lending rubles in return for cryptocurrencies, the local press reported. According to the Deputy Chairman of its Management Board, Anatoly Popov, the bank is currently considering options for providing loans against crypto as collateral. The majority state-owned bank is ready to work with Russian regulators to develop solutions for this kind of service, the Sber executive told the TASS news agency. In excerpts from an interview, quoted by the country’s leading business dailies Kommersant and Vedomosti, Popov stated: “We are currently exploring the possibility of cryptocurrency-secured lending … I hope we will be able to talk about such transactions soon.” He also noted that Sberbank continues to expand financing through its own digital asset platform. Since January of this year, the bank has hosted more than 160 issues of digital financial assets, including the country’s first tokens for real estate and oil. “Cryptocurrency market regulation in Russia is still in its infancy, and we are ready to participate in developing relevant solutions and creating the infrastructure to launch such services, together with the regulator,” Anatoly Popov emphasized. The banker’s statements come after, earlier this week, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) released key takeaways from its new concept for comprehensive regulation of the nation’s crypto space, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Meanwhile, Russia’s largest stock markets, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and the St. Petersburg Exchange (SPB) declared they are ready to launch cryptocurrency trading. Russian crypto regulations coming in 2026 The CBR plan brings major changes to Moscow’s attitude toward decentralized digital money. First of all, cryptocurrencies and stablecoins will be recognized as “currency assets.” Then, access to them will be expanded significantly, far beyond the framework of the existing “experimental legal regime,” which was initially supposed to remain in place for three years. Non-professional, retail investors will be allowed to acquire Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other coins, which are currently available only to “highly qualified” investors. Nevertheless, the monetary authority emphasized it still views cryptocurrency as a high-risk instrument and made it clear it prefers to use Russia’s existing financial infrastructure for crypto operations. Legislative amendments to implement the strategy have already been filed with the government in Moscow, and the central bank expects lawmakers to approve them by July 1, 2026. The proposals also aim to overhaul Russia’s market for digital financial assets (DFAs) regulated with a dedicated law, which entered into force in 2021. That legislation legalized the issuance and circulation of Russian digital assets, which represent tokenized securities and other real assets, as well as digital rights. The latter are still issued exclusively on private blockchains, but the Bank of Russia wants to allow domestic companies to circulate them on public networks in order to attract foreign investment. Earlier this week, Russia’s largest private bank, Alfa-Bank, announced it’s launching a DFA based on fuel. The instrument, issued on behalf of the Trassa network of gas stations, tokenizes regular gasoline as a funding and marketing tool, part of its loyalty program. Get seen where it counts.

The warning comes after a single victim lost nearly $50 million in USDT in what analysts describe as one of the largest on-chain phishing losses in recent months. How a Single Copy-Paste Error Triggered a $50M Crypto Heist The incident unfolded in under an hour. According to on-chain data and security firms tracking the case, the victim withdrew funds from Binance and sent a small test transaction of 50 USDT to the correct destination address. Crypto trader loses $50 million to address poisoning scam as industry grapples with nearly $90 billion in cumulative security losses. #Crypto #Scam https://t.co/ZXn2iF8wdi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2025 Minutes later, the user copied an address from their transaction history and sent 49,999,950 USDT to a different wallet that closely resembled the intended recipient. The fraudulent address had been planted by attackers through a prior microtransaction, a common tactic used in address poisoning scams. The victim’s wallet, active for about two years and largely used for USDT transfers, sent the funds shortly after the withdrawal from Binance. Initial reports indicated the stolen USDT remained at the destination address temporarily, though similar cases show funds are often quickly moved, swapped, or laundered through multiple wallets. In this case, blockchain investigators later observed portions of the funds converted to ETH and routed through several addresses, with some passing through the Tornado Cash mixer. Zhao addressed the incident in a public post , describing it as a problem the industry should be able to eliminate entirely. He proposed that wallets automatically flag and block known poison addresses using simple blockchain queries, warning users before transactions are sent. He also urged industry security groups to maintain real-time blacklists that wallets could consult prior to execution and suggested filtering out spam transactions entirely so users do not see dust transfers in their histories. Binance Wallet, he said, already implements some of these protections. As Address Poisoning Grows, Lawmakers and Stablecoin Issuers Step In Address poisoning , sometimes referred to as dusting, is a form of phishing in which attackers send tiny amounts of crypto to wallets from addresses designed to look nearly identical to legitimate ones. When users later copy an address from their transaction history instead of a verified source, they may unknowingly paste the attacker’s address. Matching the first few and last characters of a wallet address is often enough to deceive users, especially during high-value transfers. Security firms say the tactic is growing as SlowMist and other analysts have flagged address poisoning as an increasing threat, particularly on networks with low transaction fees where attackers can operate at scale. TRM Labs has documented extensive dusting activity on the TRON blockchain, where free or near-free transfers allow bots to flood wallets with spoofed transactions. Source: TRM Labs Their research shows attackers generate thousands of vanity addresses and deploy automated systems that target recently active or high-balance wallets, especially those holding stablecoins like USDT. Source: Chainalysis The $50 million loss comes amid a broader surge in crypto-related fraud. Industry estimates suggest nearly $90 billion has been lost to hacks and exploits since crypto’s inception, with more than $9 billion recorded in 2025 alone. November saw over $276 million stolen, and phishing was identified by CertiK as the most damaging scam category of 2024, accounting for more than $1 billion in losses. U.S. authorities reported that Americans lost roughly $9.3 billion to crypto investment scams in 2024 , a sharp year-over-year increase.

Among the most anticipated updates are the Glamsterdam and Hegota forks, which are integral to the developers’ roadmap for the Ethereum ecosystem. Key Decisions Ahead For Ethereum’s Hegota Fork Hegota aligns with Ethereum’s newly established upgrade schedule, which aims to facilitate smoother, incremental updates twice a year. Hegota is distinctive as it effectively merges two critical components of Ethereum’s architecture: the execution layer, known as “Bogota,” and the consensus layer called “Heze.” A pivotal decision for the Hegota update is selecting the key feature that will take center stage. Developers are expected to make this choice in early 2026, and front-runners such as Verkle Trees and state/history expiry are currently under consideration. While these terms may seem technical, they focus on a pressing issue: Ethereum’s data storage is becoming excessively large and resource-intensive. The continuous influx of transactions, non-fungible token (NFT) mints, decentralized finance (DeFi) trades, and memecoins has contributed to Ethereum’s “state,” which is the live database maintained by nodes. During a recent call discussing the urgency for Hegota, the need for action became clear. As ETH approaches its target of 180 million gas by late 2026, the current Merkle Patricia tree structure will struggle to support the network’s demands. The Path Forward The integration of Verkle Trees is not merely a desirable enhancement; it is essential for maintaining viable solo staking as Ethereum’s throughput is expected to triple. The implementation of Verkle Trees and mechanisms for state/history expiry aim to compress or archive older data, preventing the city hall from collapsing under the weight of paperwork. Reports suggest that if developers can execute these changes effectively, Ethereum will become more streamlined and better suited for an influx of new users in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Following Glamsterdam, which will address features such as proposer-builder separation (ePBS), access lists, and gas repricing, Hegota will further refine Ethereum’s data storage systems instead of starting the fee structure from scratch.

Recent analysis by on-chain expert Ali Martinez sheds light on a compelling historical pattern within Bitcoin cycles . His data reveals a remarkably consistent timeline that has governed the king crypto’s major price movements. This insight isn’t just trivia; it provides a crucial framework for navigating future volatility and making informed decisions. What Are the Key Numbers in Historical Bitcoin Cycles? Ali Martinez shared a clear breakdown on social media platform X. According to his analysis of past Bitcoin cycles , the journey from a bear market bottom to a bull market peak has historically taken approximately 1,064 days. That’s just under three years. Conversely, the subsequent decline from that peak down to a new market bottom has typically unfolded over a much shorter period of around 364 days, or about one year. This pattern highlights a fundamental asymmetry: long, grinding ascents followed by sharper, more rapid corrections. Recognizing this rhythm helps investors manage expectations and emotional responses during different market phases. How Can This Cycle Knowledge Shape Your Strategy? While past performance never guarantees future results, these historical Bitcoin cycles offer valuable context. For instance, if we identify a definitive market low, this pattern suggests a multi-year growth window may lie ahead. Conversely, after a major peak, it warns of a potential year-long consolidation or downtrend. Consider these actionable insights derived from the cycle data: Patience in Accumulation: The long ascent phase rewards disciplined, long-term accumulation strategies rather than short-term speculation. Risk Management Post-Peak: The shorter decline phase underscores the need for robust risk management and profit-taking strategies after major rallies. Psychological Preparedness: Knowing the typical duration of downturns can help investors maintain composure and avoid panic selling. What Are the Limitations of Relying Solely on Cycles? It’s crucial to approach cycle analysis with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market evolves constantly. New factors like institutional adoption through ETFs, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic shifts can compress or extend these historical timelines. Therefore, cycle analysis should be one tool among many in your research toolkit, not a crystal ball. Always combine this macro view with other fundamental and on-chain metrics to build a complete picture. The key is to use the knowledge of Bitcoin cycles to inform a flexible and resilient strategy, not to predict exact dates. Conclusion: Navigating the Future with Historical Insight The revelation of a consistent ~3-year bottom-to-peak pattern in Bitcoin cycles provides a powerful narrative for understanding market structure. It emphasizes the virtue of patience during bull runs and the importance of caution after major tops. By internalizing these historical rhythms, investors can cultivate a calmer, more strategic approach, potentially turning market volatility from a source of fear into an opportunity for growth. The past doesn’t dictate the future, but it often rhymes, offering a valuable guide for the journey ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Do these Bitcoin cycles guarantee the same timing will happen again? A: No. Historical patterns are informative but not guarantees. Market cycles can be influenced by new variables like institutional investment or global economics, potentially altering their length. Q2: How do I identify a true market bottom or peak? A: Bottoms and peaks are typically confirmed in hindsight. Analysts use a combination of price action, on-chain metrics (like MVRV Z-Score), and market sentiment indicators to identify potential turning points. Q3: Should I only buy at the absolute bottom and sell at the peak? A: Trying to time the exact bottom and peak is extremely difficult. A more reliable strategy is dollar-cost averaging (DCA) during periods perceived as good value and taking profits gradually on the way up. Q4: How does the 2024 Bitcoin halving fit into these cycles? A: Historically, halving events (which reduce new Bitcoin supply) have acted as catalysts within the larger cycle, often preceding major bull runs. However, their impact is analyzed within the broader cycle context. Q5: Are altcoin cycles the same as Bitcoin cycles? A: Generally, no. Bitcoin often leads the market. Altcoins frequently experience more exaggerated boom-and-bust cycles, with their major rallies often occurring in the later stages of a Bitcoin bull market. Q6: What’s the most important takeaway from cycle analysis? A: The core takeaway is to understand the market’s phased nature—periods of expansion and contraction—and to align your strategy (accumulation vs. distribution) accordingly, rather than reacting emotionally to short-term price moves. Did this breakdown of historical Bitcoin cycles help clarify the market’s rhythm?

To see which assets have the biggest potential to explode, Finbold has identified 2 cryptocurrencies to reach the $100 billion market cap in Q1 2026. Solana (SOL) Solana’s ( SOL ) market capitalization currently sits around $68 billion, meaning it would need to gain roughly 32% to reach the $100 billion mark. While the figure might at first seem beyond the realm of possibility, the milestone is now looking increasingly attainable as the forthcoming Alpenglow upgrade could serve as a major catalyst for long-term adoption. Set to leave the test phase in early 2026, the upgrade is designed to cut transaction finality to around 150 milliseconds from roughly 12 seconds and increase block capacity by about 25%. This could make Solana even more competitive in the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) sphere and institutional applications. Indeed, large protocol upgrades, such as Ethereum’s Merge, have often preceded price rallies. In addition, two U.S. banks are now settling USD Coin ( USDC ) transactions on Solana, and Visa plans to continue building on its stablecoin momentum, underscoring institutional confidence in the network. As of the time of writing, SOL is trading at $122.5 after a modest daily uptick of 0.27%. Solana 24-hour price. Source: Finbold Cardano (ADA) Our second pick, Cardano ( ADA ), has a much smaller market capitalization compared to Solana, being worth only $12.7 billion. Accordingly, it would need a much stronger rally to hit $100 billion (more than 87%, to be precise). Still, some recent bullish developments on the network look promisingly positive. Most notably, Cardano’s privacy-focused sidechain, Midnight ( NIGHT ), is introducing a Solana bridge designed to access roughly $95 billion in DeFi liquidity. While Midnight’s future success could take some attention away from ADA, it also has the potential to significantly expand the broader Cardano ecosystem by drawing new developers, users, and institutional interest. At the same time, the CLARITY Act, set to enter Senate markup next month, will provide some additional framework for ADA as a commodity. Further regulatory oversight could potentially open the path for the much-awaited ADA ETFs, news of which would likely be a major catalyst. At press time, ADA is priced at $0.35, down 0.62% on the daily chart. ADA 24-hour price. Source: Finbold What cryptocurrencies will reach a $100 billion market cap in Q1 2026? In short, both Solana and Cardano have the potential to reach the $100 billion market cap in Q1 2026, albeit Solana is a more likely candidate. Namely, Solana benefits from tangible network upgrades and growing institutional adoption, making a 32% rally seem achievable. Cardano, requiring a more ambitious 87% increase, is supported primarily by its Midnight sidechain rally, which likewise serves as a bridge to Solana. Accordingly, investors should watch both cryptocurrencies closely, as their fates appear to be interlinked, at least in the short run.

Bitcoin has not been able to maintain a short run health, Ethereum has been stuck at important areas and meme coins have lost their volume. Once this occurs, traders tend to seek out smaller assets which have more definite near term spark offs. The same change is occurring. The focus is shifting rapidly to one crypto of DeFi that already demonstrated an active price trend as wider markets decelerate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The project that attracts that attention is Mutuum Finance . It is an eth based DeFi crypto that aims at lending and borrowing. At a high level, users are providing assets in order to receive yield, and borrowers acquire liquidity by collating assets. This leads to a loop of usage that expands as the demand increases. The structure is what makes MUTM unique in the uncertain market conditions. Borrowing rules are defined. Collateral logic is clear. Flow of interests is foreseeable. The traits become important in the event of the volatility increase since the traits minimize the guesswork containing the value creation. V1 is coming , and this is significant to traders interested in what crypto to buy. This phase tends to change the mindset of an idea to action. Such time is frequently a stimulus to new interests. Participation and What the Numbers are Telling Up to date, over $19M has been raised and the base of holders has reached over 18,500 wallets. These numbers are important since there has been consistent growth. It was not a product of a single lance. This tendency in crypto news is commonly interpreted as accumulation. The fact that more wallets are holding through the various phases indicates that there is a belief that there is confidence in the build, not a short term trading. To someone who may pose the question of which crypto is the finest one to invest in today, the engagement patterns such as this usually have greater importance than hype. MUTM is (currently) selling at $0.035 and at Phase 6, and is now less than 1% available. The maximum amount of tokens is 4B. That number consisted of a 45.5% early distribution that would equate approximately 1.82B tokens. There have not been sudden changes in price movement but instead the progression of the phases. MUTM has increased approximately 250% since the initial one. Each phase took place, decreased the supply and increased the entry price. Quality supply narrows as one moves to the next level. Price discovery is sensitive at such a time historically. Reduced tokens are left and competition to demand has to be within a reduced window. Security Audits Security is a significant determining factor to the success of DeFi crypto in the long term. Mutuum Finance has gone through a CertiK audit with good marks. The protocol structure has also been reviewed in Halborn Security . These measures would minimise the technical risk and enhance the trust. There is an extra layer of a bug bounty of $50K. It promotes constant experimentation prior to the extensive usage. It has oracles that are to be used to serve right pricing and the stabilitycoin function is intended to serve the demand to borrow. The roadmap also includes expansion of layer-2 to decrease the fees and enhance speed. All these combined are an indicator of infrastructure preparedness. This is the reason why MUTM is perceived as not merely a short term trade by many. Why Timing Matters Right Now Tightening of phase availability of less than 1% has been behaviour altering. Higher allocations have been observed, such as new whale sized entries. The 24 hour leaderboard places emphasis on regular activity as opposed to one time buys which is in most cases an indicator of increasing competition. Demand has also been increased by card payment access. Later stage phases tend to be speeded up by an easier access. With a projection of Q1 2026, MUTM is at a stage where there is tight supply, infrastructure and the visibility is gaining. To traders in search of the potential best crypto to purchase now or the next biggest Cryptocurrency, this mixture justifies the sudden shift in attention.

More Inflows Expected,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-update-more-inflows-expected/,"Investor focus on crypto exchange‑traded funds has shifted dramatically since the launch of U.S. spot XRP ETFs in mid‑November 2025 , with these new products drawing consistent interest even as broader macro conditions weigh on risk assets. Rather than fading after initial curiosity, capital flows into XRP‑linked ETFs have remained steady, underscoring a growing institutional appetite for regulated exposure to XRP’s unique utility and market positioning. According to an X post by Xaif, trading activity in XRP ETFs is building momentum late in the trading session, with current volume sitting at $9.02 million and almost $10 million more room before market close, suggesting additional inflows could materialize before the session ends. This observation comes amid confirmed data showing that XRP ETF inflows have now outpaced expectations, with the category extending its uninterrupted streak of net inflows. $XRP ETF Update Current volume sitting at $9.02M and we’ve still got almost $10M more room left before market close. More inflows expected https://t.co/oKDM0jCD3l pic.twitter.com/69UxqTlSo4 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 24, 2025 Sustained Inflows and Record Streak Since debuting on November 13, 2025, U.S. spot XRP ETFs have recorded 30 + consecutive trading days of net inflows , a remarkable feat in the cryptocurrency ETF space. Over this period, cumulative net subscription capital has surged past $1 billion, lifting total assets under management across these products to roughly $1.1 – $1.2 billion. Notably, this category has achieved its milestone with zero outflow days, contrasting sharply with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have experienced significant redemptions in the same timeframe. The sustained inflow streak sets XRP ETFs apart. Data from independent trackers show regular daily inflows from major issuers such as Canary Capital’s XRPC , 21Shares’ TOXR, Bitwise’s XRP ETF, Grayscale’s GXRP, and Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ , indicating broad allocation across the institutional landscape rather than concentrated interest in a single product. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Dynamics and Divergence Despite this inflow resilience, XRP’s spot price has at times lagged behind these positive flow dynamics , reflecting a divergence between regulated capital entry and broader market sentiment. In traditional markets, ETFs frequently act as stabilizing vehicles; in crypto, however, the dual realities of evolving risk aversion and lingering macro pressures have muted price response even as institutional engagement deepens. Investors are showing a clear preference for diversified crypto exposure through XRP-linked products, as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw tens of millions in outflows over recent weeks – a stark contrast that highlights this shift. What Comes Next Looking ahead, analysts are watching whether the late‑day trading activity noted by Xaif will translate into sustained net inflows and whether this institutional interest can catalyze broader market confidence. If current momentum persists, XRP ETFs could continue to attract capital, potentially reshaping liquidity dynamics and positioning XRP as a structural allocation in diversified crypto portfolios. With regulated adoption still in its early stages, the resilience of these flows suggests that investor interest in XRP ETFs may be more enduring than cyclical.

He says the deal that built the company was also the worst move he ever made. Warren ran the company for six decades. He turned a broken textile business into a group worth more than $1 trillion. Still, he calls the purchase a mistake that cost him hundreds of billions of dollars. That claim sounds wild on paper, since the company made Warren rich, and his Class A shares make up most of his $151 billion fortune. That puts him at No. 10 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. If he kept the B shares he started donating in 2006, now worth $208 billion, his wealth would sit near $359 billion, placing him at No. 22 instead. A cheap textile stock turns into a personal standoff Warren traced the error back to 1962. At the time, he ran a small partnership worth about $7 million. People would call it a hedge fund today. He spotted Berkshire Hathaway as a cheap stock based on working capital. The business itself was a dying textile company. Mills kept closing. Each closure funded stock buybacks. He planned to buy shares, tender them back, and take a small win. By 1964, he owned a large stake. Warren met CEO Seabury Stanton, who asked what price he wanted in a tender offer. He said $11.50 and gave his word. Weeks later, the offer arrived at $11.375. He felt cheated by one-eighth of a dollar. He refused to sell. He bought more shares. He took control. Stanton lost his job. Warren later said the move locked serious money into a terrible business. Berkshire became the base for everything that followed. In 1967, he used it to buy a strong insurance company. He later said he should have bought that insurer through a new entity instead. The textile assets stayed attached like dead weight. He spent 20 years trying to make textiles work before giving up. Twenty years of losses drain billions from future value Warren said the textile unit earned nothing year after year. Berkshire’s net worth sat near $20 million at one point. He said that money dragged the entire company down. He estimated the cost at $200 billion in lost value. He joked that trying to run textiles made him think he could manage any bad business. That idea did not hold up. When asked about lessons, Warren said managers should leave bad businesses fast. He said success comes from owning good companies, not fixing broken ones. He added a line to Berkshire’s annual report years later saying that when a great manager meets bad economics, the business reputation always wins. Warren explained that he learned this late because his early training focused on cheap assets. He worked with Ben Graham starting around 1950. That system pushed bargain hunting. He later said buying good companies at fair prices works better. He said if he failed to learn that lesson from Berkshire, he never would. Hard businesses offer no bonus points in markets Warren said it took two decades to finally quit textiles. After Stanton, Ken Chase ran the division. He described Chase as honest and capable.Even with effort, the business failed. Berkshire bought Waumbec Mills in Manchester, New Hampshire. That also failed. New machines promised job savings. Those plans piled up in a drawer. None fixed the core problem. Warren said he still gets calls about hard businesses. People suggest tackling them with money and talent. He rejects that logic. He compared business to sports. In markets, difficulty brings no reward. Easy wins count the same. He said stepping over low bars beats jumping high ones. He acknowledged entering newspapers. Berkshire bought The Buffalo Evening News in 1977. Early years were weak. Later years were strong. Warren said the industry changed completely by 2010. Berkshire sold the paper in 2020. He also described his approach as the opposite of business school playbooks. He avoids selling average units unless they face permanent losses or labor issues. Asked about Charlie Munger, Warren said his partner would name the same mistake. Warren said Munger warned him back in 1959. He said listening earlier would have saved years of trouble. Warren likes to laugh and accept that lesson publicly, right before stepping away from the job for good. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Data compiled by CryptoQuant shows that open interest has dropped to around $453 million, indicating a substantial decline in the use of leveraged positions and a shift in trader behavior. Reset in XRP’s Derivatives Market Earlier in 2025, XRP futures OI surpassed $1 billion on multiple occasions. This period coincided with strong price rallies and increased speculative activity. Such high levels evidenced heavy participation from traders using leverage, which increased the market’s sensitivity to sharp and sudden price movements. A similar pattern emerged again in mid-2025, when OI climbed back above the $1 billion mark. This pointed to renewed speculative interest and continued reliance on derivatives. However, the current market structure has changed significantly. CryptoQuant found that OI has been trending lower over time before dropping more sharply to its current level. This means a considerable withdrawal of short-term speculative traders from the market. The decline in OI has had a direct impact on XRP’s recent price behavior. Lower risk appetite and reduced momentum in the derivatives market have contributed to volatile price action, particularly in the absence of strong liquidity-driven breakouts. At the same time, CryptoQuant observed that the contraction in OI reduces the chances of forced liquidations, which are more common during periods of excessive leverage. Previous instances have shown that phases of low OI have often represented transitional periods in the market. During such phases, trading activity tends to move away from highly speculative, leverage-driven behavior toward conditions that rely more heavily on genuine spot market demand. Mixed Market Signals The structural reset comes at a time when XRP’s decline has pushed it below several crucial support levels, including $2.00 and $1.90. The altcoin is now hovering around $1.87. While analyst Ali Martinez warned that losing $1.90 could lead to further downside, on-chain data suggests mixed signals. Santiment stated that rising bearish sentiment has historically preceded price recoveries for XRP. Meanwhile, Crypto Whale data shows large holders may be accumulating again, as spot taker CVD indicates buying pressure is stronger than selling.

One such investor, a true Bitcoin OG identified as address 1011short, has just made a significant addition to their portfolio. According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, this experienced trader has increased their long position in Solana (SOL) by a staggering 207,351 tokens. This move comes alongside already substantial positions in Ethereum and Bitcoin, painting a picture of a high-conviction, high-risk strategy that’s currently facing millions in unrealized losses. What does this tell us about market sentiment among crypto veterans? Who Is This Bitcoin OG and What’s Their Strategy? The term Bitcoin OG refers to original gangsters of the Bitcoin space—early adopters who have weathered multiple market cycles. The address 1011short represents one such veteran. Their current portfolio reveals a daring approach: a 5x leveraged long position on 203,341 ETH, another 5x long on 1,000 BTC, and a massive 10x long position on 508,929 SOL. By adding more SOL now, this Bitcoin OG is doubling down on their conviction despite facing approximately $43 million in paper losses. This suggests they believe in a strong rebound for these major assets, particularly Solana. Why Would a Bitcoin Veteran Bet Big on Solana? For a Bitcoin OG to allocate such significant capital to Solana is noteworthy. Bitcoin purists often focus solely on the original cryptocurrency. However, this trader’s move indicates a pragmatic, diversified strategy. Solana has established itself as a major smart contract platform with high throughput and a growing ecosystem. The decision to use high leverage (5x and 10x) shows an aggressive belief in upcoming price appreciation. Key reasons for this bet might include: Ecosystem Growth: Solana’s network activity and developer interest remain strong. Technical Positioning: The asset may be seen as undervalued relative to its potential. Market Cycle Play: Experienced traders often accumulate positions during periods of fear or consolidation. This Bitcoin OG is not just betting on Bitcoin’s dominance but on the broader altcoin market recovery, with Solana as a primary vehicle. Understanding the Risks of Leveraged Crypto Positions The $43 million in unrealized losses highlights the extreme risk inherent in leveraged trading. While this Bitcoin OG clearly has substantial capital, such strategies can lead to rapid liquidation if the market moves against them. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. For everyday investors, this serves as a crucial reminder: Volatility is Magnified: A 10% price drop can wipe out a 10x long position entirely. Capital Preservation is Key: Even veterans can face steep paper losses. Conviction vs. Reality: Strong belief must be balanced with risk management. Watching a seasoned Bitcoin OG navigate these waters provides real-time lessons in crypto market psychology and risk tolerance. What Can We Learn From This Bitcoin OG’s Move? Actions from early adopters often serve as valuable market signals. This Bitcoin OG increasing their SOL position, despite losses, suggests a long-term horizon and unwavering confidence in their thesis. For observers, it underscores several actionable insights: Diversification Matters: Even Bitcoin maximalists explore other promising protocols. Timing is Strategic: Adding to a position during a drawdown can lower average cost. Transparency is Powerful: On-chain data allows everyone to learn from major players. Ultimately, while mimicking such a high-risk strategy is not advisable for most, understanding the rationale behind it can inform your own market perspective. Conclusion: A Veteran’s High-Stakes Confidence Play The move by this anonymous Bitcoin OG is a testament to the high-conviction, high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency trading. Adding over 200,000 SOL to an already massive leveraged position demonstrates a fearless approach rooted in experience. While the current unrealized losses are significant, they represent only a snapshot in time. This trader is playing a longer game, betting on the resurgence of major crypto assets. For the market, it’s a fascinating case study in veteran strategy, risk management, and the enduring belief in blockchain’s future growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘Bitcoin OG’ mean? ‘Bitcoin OG’ stands for ‘Original Gangster’ in the Bitcoin context. It refers to early adopters and investors who have been involved with Bitcoin since its early days and have extensive experience through multiple market cycles. What is a long position? A long position means buying an asset with the expectation that its price will increase in the future. The investor profits if the price goes up. A ‘5x long’ or ’10x long’ means using leverage to amplify the potential gains (and losses) of that bet. What are unrealized losses? Unrealized losses are paper losses on an investment that has decreased in value since purchase but has not yet been sold. The loss becomes ‘realized’ only when the asset is sold at the lower price. Why is this trader’s activity public? Cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on public blockchains. While wallet addresses are pseudonymous, analytics firms like Lookonchain can track the movement of large sums, making the strategies of major holders visible. Should I copy this trading strategy? Absolutely not. This involves extreme leverage and risk suitable only for those with vast capital and risk tolerance. It is an observation point for market sentiment, not an investment recommendation. What does this say about Solana’s prospects? It indicates that at least one highly experienced investor believes Solana has strong potential for future price appreciation, enough to justify a large, leveraged bet even during a downturn.

With its structured gameplay, constant pauses, and massive betting volume around leagues like the NFL, it fits naturally into the world of online crypto wagering. As more players look for alternatives to traditional sportsbooks, american football crypto betting sites are gaining attention for their speed, flexibility, and fewer payment barriers. In this guide, we break down how American football betting works, explain why crypto is a strong match for this sport, compare leading american football sportsbooks, and highlight platforms that deliver a reliable betting experience with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. Best American Football Crypto Betting Sites Compared Choosing the right platform matters just as much as understanding the markets. While many sportsbooks claim to support crypto, not all of them are equally strong when it comes to American football coverage, live odds, and execution speed. Below is a side-by-side comparison of popular american football crypto betting sites, focusing on the features that actually impact betting performance. Platform Crypto Supported American Football Markets Live Betting KYC Policy Best For Dexsport BTC, ETH, USDT, more Full markets + live Yes No mandatory KYC Balanced crypto football betting Stake 17+ coins Deep NFL coverage Yes KYC on withdrawal High liquidity & odds Lucky Block BTC, ETH, USDT, more Solid coverage Yes No KYC to play Bonuses & simplicity BetPanda 13+ coins Standard markets Limited No KYC (conditional) Privacy-focused users Thunderpick BTC, ETH, USDT Basic football markets Yes Conditional KYC Esports-first bettors Dexsport — Crypto Football Betting Platform Overview Dexsport positions itself as one of the most balanced options among crypto american football betting sites. The platform doesn’t try to overwhelm users with overly complex features — instead, it focuses on stable markets, clean odds presentation, and smooth crypto execution. American Football Markets and Live Odds Dexsport covers all core American football betting markets, including: Moneyline, spreads, and totals Quarter and half betting Live spreads and live totals during games Live betting is where the platform performs best. Odds update consistently after key plays, and markets remain open long enough to allow informed decisions rather than rushed clicks. For bettors focused on online crypto football betting, this stability is critical. Crypto Payments and Usability Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits are processed quickly, and bets are placed directly from crypto balances. There’s no forced conversion or unnecessary delay between markets, which makes switching between pre-match and live betting seamless. For regular NFL bettors, the advantage is clear: Faster access to live odds Fewer interruptions during games Predictable withdrawal behavior Dexsport feels built for bettors who value control and timing rather than bonus gimmicks. Why Dexsport Stands Out Dexsport works best for players who want: American football betting with Bitcoin or Ethereum Clean live odds without constant market freezes A crypto-first betting flow without mandatory KYC Bet on American Football with Crypto on Dexsport Other Notable American Football Crypto Betting Sites While Dexsport offers a balanced experience, several other platforms also cover American football betting with crypto — each with a slightly different focus. Stake — High Liquidity and Market Depth Stake is known for its deep NFL market coverage and strong liquidity. Odds are competitive, and live betting options are extensive. However, KYC is required at the withdrawal stage, which may not suit privacy-focused users. Best for bettors who prioritize odds volume and market depth over anonymity. Lucky Block — Bonuses and Easy Access Lucky Block offers solid American football coverage combined with aggressive welcome bonuses. It’s easy to access and supports multiple cryptocurrencies, though some players report mixed experiences during withdrawals. Best for casual bettors attracted by promotions. BetPanda — Privacy-Oriented Crypto Betting BetPanda focuses on anonymity and fast crypto transactions. American football markets are available, but live betting depth and streaming features are more limited compared to larger sportsbooks. Best for users who value privacy over advanced betting tools. Thunderpick — Esports-First, Football as Secondary Thunderpick is primarily an esports betting platform. While it does offer American football markets, coverage is lighter, and live betting options are not as robust. Best for esports bettors who occasionally wager on football. Why American Football Works Well for Crypto Betting American football is built around stoppages, drives, and situational moments — which makes it unusually betting-friendly. Unlike continuous-flow sports, bettors get repeated chances to reassess odds and place new wagers. A few structural features stand out: Frequent pauses between plays Clear game segments (quarters, halves, drives) Heavy focus on statistics and matchups Strong live betting demand throughout the game These characteristics align perfectly with online crypto football betting. Crypto transactions allow bettors to react quickly without waiting on payment approvals or balance updates, which is especially useful when live odds move fast after key plays. Another advantage is market depth. American football offers far more than just win-or-lose bets. Spreads, totals, and prop markets create constant opportunities, making football crypto betting feel more strategic than reactive. American Football vs Soccer — Key Betting Differences Outside the U.S., “football” usually means soccer. While both sports attract massive betting interest, they behave very differently from a wagering perspective — especially when crypto is involved. The main differences are easy to spot: Game flow:Soccer is continuous, while American football is segmented into plays and drives. Betting windows:Soccer live betting often requires quick reactions during open play. American football gives bettors more time to analyze and act between snaps. Market structure:Soccer focuses heavily on match result and totals. American football offers spreads, props, quarter betting, and situational markets. Live betting behavior:NFL odds adjust after almost every possession, creating frequent entry points for live bets. Because of this, American football is often more forgiving for bettors new to crypto. The pauses allow time to manage wallets, evaluate odds, and place bets without rushing — something that fits well with crypto football betting sites designed for fast execution. If soccer rewards instinct, American football rewards structure — and crypto betting thrives on structure. How American Football Betting Works If you’re new to American football betting, the number of available markets can feel overwhelming at first. In reality, most bets fall into a few core categories, and once you understand them, everything else becomes an extension. For users exploring american football crypto betting sites, mastering these basics is more important than chasing complex bets. Core American Football Betting Markets These are the markets most commonly used on crypto american football betting sites and the foundation of nearly every betting strategy. MoneylineA straight bet on which team wins the game. Simple, but often paired with lower odds when favorites are involved. Point SpreadThe most popular football betting market. The favorite must win by more than the spread, while the underdog can lose by a certain margin and still cover. Totals (Over/Under)Betting on the combined number of points scored by both teams. This market is heavily influenced by pace, weather, and team style. These markets are available pre-match and remain active throughout the game on most online crypto football betting platforms. Advanced and Live Betting Markets Once the game starts, additional options open up — especially for bettors who prefer live action. Common live and advanced markets include: Quarter and half betting Player props (touchdowns, yards, receptions) Team totals Live spreads and totals Live betting is where American football truly shines. Odds shift after every drive, turnover, or score, giving bettors multiple chances to enter or adjust positions. Because of the sport’s stop-start nature, crypto bettors can analyze situations calmly rather than rushing decisions. This is one reason football crypto betting works especially well during live NFL games. Why Crypto Makes Live Football Betting Easier Crypto betting platforms reduce friction during live play. Instead of worrying about: delayed balance updates locked funds payment checks Bettors can focus on timing, matchup dynamics, and value. On well-built crypto football betting sites, wagers are placed instantly, and odds updates feel smooth rather than disruptive. In American football, patience and timing matter more than speed — and crypto supports both. Risks to Know When Betting on American Football with Crypto Crypto betting removes many traditional barriers, but it also introduces a different set of risks that bettors should understand before placing wagers on American football. The most common ones include: Volatility of crypto balancesYour betting bankroll can change in value independently of match results, especially when using BTC or ETH. Live betting overexposureAmerican football offers frequent live markets, and it’s easy to place too many bets during momentum swings. Bonus conditionsSome crypto football betting sites attach high wagering requirements to bonuses, which can delay withdrawals. Conditional verificationEven crypto-focused platforms may request KYC checks after unusually large withdrawals or suspicious activity. These risks don’t make crypto betting worse — they simply shift responsibility more toward the player. Understanding them upfront helps avoid frustration later. Final Verdict — Best American Football Crypto Betting Sites American football remains one of the strongest betting markets in the world, and crypto has become an increasingly natural way to access it. Fast transactions, flexible bankroll management, and smoother live betting all give crypto an edge over traditional payment methods. Among the platforms reviewed, each serves a slightly different audience. Some focus on liquidity and volume, others on bonuses or privacy. What separates the strongest platforms is balance — between odds quality, usability, and crypto execution. Dexsport stands out as one of the best american football crypto betting sites for players who want reliable markets, stable live odds, and smooth Bitcoin and Ethereum betting without unnecessary friction. It doesn’t rely on hype or extreme promotions, instead delivering a consistent, crypto-first football betting experience. For bettors looking to combine online crypto football betting with clean execution and strong American football coverage, Dexsport remains a compelling choice.

What started as a niche alternative to traditional online casinos has evolved into a full betting ecosystem that now includes sportsbooks, live betting, and multi-asset wagering. Players are no longer choosing platforms based solely on whether they accept crypto — they’re looking at speed, stability, asset flexibility, and overall usability. As crypto betting matures, a clear shift is taking place: from volatile, single-coin gambling toward platforms that support Bitcoin and stablecoins, optimized for live play and real-time decision-making. Understanding these trends is key to seeing where the market is heading — and which platforms are already aligned with that direction. How Crypto Gambling Has Evolved So Far The earliest crypto gambling platforms were simple by today’s standards. Most accepted only Bitcoin, offered limited betting products, and focused almost entirely on casino-style games. Over time, several structural changes reshaped the market: Bitcoin became widely accepted but exposed bankrolls to volatility Live betting gained popularity, demanding faster execution Players began switching between casino games and sports betting UX expectations increased alongside mainstream adoption This evolution pushed crypto gambling away from experimental setups toward more refined platforms. Users started to value reliability just as much as decentralization, especially when placing live bets where timing matters. As a result, modern crypto gambling platforms are no longer defined by what coin they accept, but by how well they integrate crypto into the betting experience. Dexsport as a Case Study of Modern Crypto Gambling Dexsport illustrates how crypto gambling platforms are adapting to these new expectations. Rather than focusing on a single asset or a single product, Dexsport is built around flexibility — supporting multiple cryptocurrencies while offering casino games, sports betting, and live wagering within one environment. What makes Dexsport relevant as a trend indicator is not any single feature, but the combination of choices it reflects: Support for Bitcoin alongside stablecoins Emphasis on live betting and real-time interaction Crypto-first access without unnecessary friction A unified platform instead of separate betting silos This structure aligns closely with where crypto gambling demand is moving. Players increasingly want to shift between assets depending on risk preference, switch between casino and sports betting without barriers, and manage bankrolls efficiently during live sessions. Modern crypto gambling isn’t about choosing Bitcoin over everything else — it’s about choosing the right asset for the right moment. Dexsport’s approach shows how platforms are responding to that mindset, positioning themselves for a market that values adaptability over ideology. Bitcoin Still Matters — But Its Role Is Changing Bitcoin remains a core pillar of crypto gambling sites . It’s widely recognized, highly liquid, and still preferred by experienced bettors who are comfortable with volatility. For some players, BTC is part of the strategy — not just a payment method, but a high-risk, high-reward asset. In crypto gambling, Bitcoin is often used when: Players expect short sessions rather than long bankroll management Volatility is seen as an upside, not a drawback Bets are placed pre-match rather than live Large wagers are made by high-volume users That said, Bitcoin is no longer the default choice for everyone. As crypto betting has become more mainstream, the limitations of volatility have become more visible — especially during live betting. When odds change rapidly and decisions must be made in seconds, unpredictable balance swings can work against the bettor. This has gradually shifted user behavior toward assets that offer more control. Bitcoin hasn’t disappeared from crypto gambling. Its role has simply become more selective. The Rise of Stablecoin-Based Betting Stablecoins have quietly transformed how many players approach crypto gambling. Assets like USDT and USDC remove price fluctuation from the equation, allowing bettors to focus entirely on odds, timing, and strategy. This shift is particularly noticeable in live betting environments. Why Bettors Are Choosing Stablecoins Stablecoin-based betting offers several practical advantages: Bankroll value stays predictable Risk is tied to betting decisions, not market swings Easier session planning and stake sizing Clearer win/loss tracking For users who treat crypto gambling as entertainment or structured betting rather than speculation, stablecoins feel more intuitive. Stablecoins and Live Betting Dynamics Live betting rewards quick decisions and consistent stake management. Stablecoins support this by removing an extra variable from the process. During live sessions: Bettors can scale stakes confidently Odds movement is easier to evaluate Loss control becomes more disciplined This is why many modern platforms now see higher live betting volume in stablecoins than in Bitcoin. The asset choice matches the tempo of the betting environment. As live betting grows, stability becomes a feature — not a compromise. From Crypto Casinos to Full Betting Ecosystems Another major trend shaping crypto gambling is consolidation. Early platforms focused on a single product — usually casino games or basic sports betting. Today, users expect more from fewer platforms. Modern crypto gambling ecosystems typically combine: Casino games Live casino tables Sports betting In-play and live markets This shift reflects changing user behavior. Players don’t want to manage multiple accounts or move funds between platforms. They want flexibility inside a single interface, with crypto acting as the common layer across all products. Platforms that support multiple assets, betting formats, and live interaction are better positioned to retain users long-term. Decentralization, Transparency, and Trust As crypto gambling matures, trust is no longer built on promises alone. Players increasingly expect verifiable systems, clearer rules, and fewer opaque processes — especially when real money is involved. This is where decentralization and transparency come into play. Modern crypto gambling platforms are gradually adopting: Provably fair mechanics for selected games On-chain transaction visibility Clear bonus and withdrawal rules Reduced reliance on manual intervention While full decentralization is still rare in gambling, the direction is clear. Platforms are moving away from black-box operations toward systems that allow users to verify outcomes, track funds, and understand how bets are processed. For players, this doesn’t necessarily mean “fully decentralized casinos.” It means less blind trust and more structural confidence. What Crypto Gambling May Look Like Next Rather than expanding endlessly, the crypto gambling market appears to be consolidating around a few core ideas. Based on current trends, the next phase is likely to include: Wider use of stablecoins for live betting Faster, cleaner interfaces focused on usability Fewer platforms, but with deeper functionality Less friction between casino, sportsbook, and live betting Speculation-driven gambling is gradually giving way to experience-driven betting. Players care less about novelty and more about consistency — how a platform performs during real sessions, not how many features it advertises. In this environment, flexibility becomes a competitive advantage. Platforms that support multiple assets, adapt to different betting styles, and reduce operational friction are better positioned for long-term relevance. Conclusion Crypto gambling is moving away from a Bitcoin-only mindset toward flexibility and control. While BTC remains important, stablecoins are increasingly shaping live betting, bankroll management, and overall user behavior. Platforms that support multiple assets, fast execution, and seamless movement between casino and betting products are better aligned with this shift. Dexsport reflects these trends by combining Bitcoin and stablecoin betting within a single, crypto-native ecosystem.

Levels lying between the two thresholds correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three core regions, there are also two “extreme” zones in the Fear & Greed Index, known as the extreme fear and extreme greed. The former occurs at and below 25, while the latter occurs above 75. Now, here is how the sentiment among investors in the current Bitcoin market is, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the majority sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector is one of extreme fear at the moment, with the indicator sitting at a value of 23. The despair among the investors isn’t new, as the index has, in fact, remained in this region for the last couple of weeks. As displayed in the chart, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has indicated extreme fear for 13 consecutive days now, underscoring the FUD that has been present in the market. If history is anything to go by, though, the extremely fearful sentiment may not actually be such a bad sign for BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Often, digital asset markets tend to move in a direction that goes contrary to the crowd’s belief. This probability of an opposite move generally becomes the strongest inside the extreme sentiment zones, with major tops and bottoms historically forming while the index has been in the respective region. The price low in November, which has acted as the bottom for Bitcoin so far, also occurred alongside an extended stay inside the extreme fear territory. Clearly, though, that extreme fear streak wasn’t enough to reignite sustained bullish momentum for BTC, as the asset has only consolidated since then. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bottom? History Points To October 2026, Says Analyst As such, it only remains to be seen whether the latest stay inside extreme fear will be able to change that or if it will be a while before the bottom is reached in the current cycle.

Things started coming apart in the final stretch of 2025, when tech stocks were being tossed around like dice. Sell-offs, wild rallies, overpriced deals, and mountains of debt raised the alarm on whether this AI wave is turning into something more fragile, like a bubble. And now, it’s not just about who’s talking about AI, it’s about who’s getting paid and who’s footing the bill, according to CNBC. Stephen Yiu, who runs money over at Blue Whale Growth Fund, said this market has never cared much about separating winners from the ones just throwing money around.“Every company seems to be winning,” Stephen said.“But it’s very important to differentiate,” he added, warning that this is exactly what investors might finally start doing. He pointed out that people, especially retail investors using ETFs, don’t bother looking under the hood. Whether it’s a startup, a firm bleeding cash to fund AI infrastructure, or someone just collecting the checks, everyone’s been lumped into the same pile. That may not last. Big Tech dumps billions into AI infrastructure as models evolve Stephen broke things down into three clear categories: private AI startups, public companies spending heavily on AI, and firms supplying the infrastructure. The first camp, companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, got $176.5 billion in funding in just the first nine months of 2025, based on PitchBook data. Meanwhile, giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are cutting massive checks to infrastructure vendors like Nvidia and Broadcom. Stephen’s fund doesn’t just look at hype. They judge value by checking how much free cash a company has after capital spending, compared to its stock price. The problem? Most of the Magnificent 7 stocks are now “trading at a significant premium,” Stephen said. They’ve gone deep into AI spending, and their numbers look bloated as a result. He said he wouldn’t touch AI spenders right now, even if he believes in the future of the technology. His focus is on the firms that are getting paid, not the ones blowing money to chase future returns. Julien Lafargue, who leads market strategy at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, said all this froth isn’t everywhere. It’s concentrated in “specific segments rather than across the broader market.” And the real trouble? It’s the companies riding the AI buzz with no revenue to show for it. Julien singled out “some quantum computing-related companies” as examples where the hype train has left the station with no earnings in sight. “Investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,” he said. “Differentiation is key.” Rising asset costs complicate business models for AI spenders The AI market shake-up also exposes how the biggest names are changing. Big Tech, once proud of being asset-light, is now buying land, building data centers, and gobbling up GPUs. Companies like Google and Meta are no longer software firms, they’re hyperscalers with physical overhead. That shift doesn’t just eat cash. It changes how investors should look at them entirely. Dorian Carrell, who oversees multi-asset income at Schroders, said old methods of valuing these companies don’t cut it anymore. “We’re not saying it’s not going to work,” Dorian said . “But we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in?” To keep the AI build-out running, tech firms went to the debt markets this year. Meta and Amazon both tapped that route, but according to Ben Barringer, tech research head at Quilter Cheviot, they’re still in a net cash position. That’s very different from companies barely holding it together. “The private debt markets will be very interesting next year,” Dorian added. Stephen warned that unless AI-driven revenue outpaces what’s being spent, profit margins will tighten. And investors will start asking harder questions. Infrastructure and hardware don’t last forever. They wear down. The cost of that wear and tear isn’t yet visible in profit and loss statements. “It’s not part of the P&L yet,” Stephen said. “Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers. So, there’s going to be more and more differentiation.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

56352961,648566,1766682018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56352961.jpeg,Here’s How The Largest XRP Treasury Company Has Fared In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/largest-xrp-treasury-company/,"Evernorth’s decision to build one of the largest known XRP treasuries has become one of the most closely watched institutional crypto experiments of 2025. What began as a high-conviction accumulation strategy has since evolved into a stress test of timing, volatility management, and long-term positioning in a market that has repeatedly punished short-term optimism. A High-Conviction XRP Treasury Meets Market Reality Evernorth accumulated approximately 388.7 million XRP between late October and late December 2025, deploying capital aggressively as XRP traded in a strong uptrend. At its peak, the position was valued at roughly $947 million and briefly generated a gain of about $71 million. This early performance reinforced the thesis that institutional-scale XRP exposure could deliver meaningful upside if market momentum held. However, that momentum did not persist. As XRP’s price slid from the $2.60 region toward the $1.80 range, Evernorth’s treasury position moved decisively below its aggregate cost basis. What was once a profitable allocation quickly turned into a substantial unrealized drawdown. By late December, the paper loss had expanded to roughly $220–225 million, according to on-chain and price-based estimates. Importantly, this outcome was not driven by forced selling or liquidation . The losses remain unrealized, meaning Evernorth has not exited its position. Instead, the situation reflects a classic mark-to-market recalibration, where exposure size and price volatility intersect unfavorably. Moreover, a chart shared by market watcher JA_Maartun in relation to Evernorth’s treasury illustrates a clear progression, with early profit zones giving way to sustained loss territory as XRP’s price trend weakened over time. What Evernorth’s Performance Signals For Institutional Strategy Beyond the headline loss figure, Evernorth’s 2025 performance highlights several structural realities about institutional crypto exposure. First, concentration risk is non-trivial. A treasury strategy centered on a single volatile asset amplifies sensitivity to short- and medium-term price swings, regardless of long-term conviction. Even disciplined accumulation can be undermined by unfavorable macro and market timing. Second, Evernorth’s experience underscores the disconnect that can exist between price action and broader institutional interest. While the altcoin’s spot price declined , XRP-linked exchange-traded products reportedly continued to attract steady inflows , pushing total ETF-held XRP value to around $1.25 billion. This divergence suggests that some institutional participants are expressing exposure through structured vehicles rather than direct balance-sheet holdings, potentially mitigating volatility risk. In practical terms, Evernorth’s XRP treasury has so far delivered a sobering outcome in 2025: large-scale exposure, significant paper losses, and heightened scrutiny. Yet, the case reframes how success and failure are measured in crypto treasury strategies . The current unrealized loss does not automatically invalidate the strategy, but it does reset expectations. The ability to withstand prolonged drawdowns without triggering exits will determine whether this treasury move is remembered as a misstep or a long-duration bet that simply endured early turbulence.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-25 17:00:18

While the visuals suggested chaos, the event was confined to a niche trading pair and did not reflect broader market weakness. As reported by Max Crypto on X, the plunge occurred on Binance’s BTC/USD1 pair, where Bitcoin briefly touched $24,111 before recovering almost immediately. This dramatic swing was caused by the low liquidity of the USD1 pairing rather than any fundamental issue with Bitcoin itself. Major pairs such as BTC/USDT remained anchored around $87,000, highlighting that mainstream markets were unaffected. WTF JUST HAPPENED BTC/USD1 crashed below $25,000 on Binance. pic.twitter.com/4HS3MYJcCv — Max Crypto (@MaxCrypto) December 25, 2025 USD1 Stablecoin Under the Spotlight The crash underscores the unique risks associated with the USD1 stablecoin. Backed by the Trump family and promoted with a 20% APY deposit incentive, USD1 has seen unusually high swap volumes. Its shallow order books make it highly sensitive to large trades, especially during thin holiday market conditions, where even a single significant sell order can trigger extreme price distortions. Market Mechanics Behind the Dip Flash crashes in low‑liquidity pairs often result from abrupt market imbalances. When large orders hit limited buy-side depth, automated stop-loss triggers and arbitrage bots amplify the movement, producing what traders call a “flash wick.” In this case, arbitrage activity quickly restored prices, preventing any spillover into major trading venues.

Traders must account for liquidity and market depth when entering positions in newly launched or exotic instruments. For exchanges and developers, it highlights the potential for price anomalies in small‑cap or incentivized tokens, even when the underlying asset — Bitcoin — remains fundamentally strong. In conclusion, the BTC/USD1 crash is a textbook example of a microstructure event: dramatic in appearance, fleeting in effect. Mainstream Bitcoin markets stayed calm while charts briefly spiked, showing this episode was a liquidity glitch, not a sign of Bitcoin’s real value.

According to The Block’s 2026 outlook report, that’s exactly what happened in 2025. The industry achieved monumental milestones in adoption and regulation, but the anticipated price explosion never arrived. This analysis dives into the paradox of a booming ecosystem paired with a muted crypto market response. Why Was the Crypto Market Response So Subdued? The total market capitalization shattered records, soaring past $4.3 trillion. However, this growth masked a critical detail. Price appreciation was not widespread. Instead, gains concentrated in a handful of major tokens, leaving much of the ecosystem flat. This selective rally points to a maturation phase, where value accrues to networks with proven utility rather than speculative hype. The overall crypto market response, therefore, reflected a shift from broad, frenzied speculation to targeted, fundamentals-driven investment. How Did Blockchain Specialization Shape the Landscape? A key trend explaining the tempered crypto market response was the clear specialization of Layer 1 networks. This division of labor created efficiency but limited the viral, cross-chain momentum seen in previous bull markets. Solana, BNB, and Hyperliquid became the go-to hubs for speculative trading and derivatives. Ethereum solidified its role as a secure settlement and data availability layer, central to its rollup-centric roadmap. Coinbase’s Base network emerged as a leading Layer 2, attracting developers and users with its ease of use. This specialization meant growth was deep, not wide, contributing to the overall muted sentiment. What Drove Real Institutional Adoption in 2025? Beyond trading, 2025 witnessed profound institutional integration. This was a cornerstone of mainstream entry, yet its effect on prices was gradual, not explosive. First, the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization sector moved from pilot programs to large-scale deployment. Major institutions began tokenizing everything from treasury bonds to real estate, seeking blockchain’s efficiency. Second, the spot ETF market expanded dramatically. Following Bitcoin and Ethereum, regulators approved ETFs for assets like Solana and Ripple, providing traditional investors with familiar, regulated access points. Finally, a new breed of financial entity emerged: the Digital Asset Trust (DAT) firm. These firms acted as custodians and service providers, bridging the gap between legacy finance and crypto protocols. Their growth signaled deep structural integration, a slow-burn fuel for the ecosystem rather than a spark for immediate price pumps. Did On-Chain Activity Tell a Different Story? If price action was calm, on-chain activity was bustling. The engine of this activity was not simple token swaps but complex financial instruments. Derivatives Trading: Perpetual decentralized exchanges (DEXs) saw volume skyrocket, indicating sophisticated traders were active. Prediction Markets: Platforms for betting on real-world events gained traction, showcasing blockchain’s utility beyond finance. This surge in advanced use cases confirmed that the crypto market response was not due to a lack of activity, but a change in the type of activity driving value. How Did U.S. Regulation Finally Evolve? A major hurdle cleared in 2025 was regulatory uncertainty. The U.S. transitioned toward a more clearly defined framework. While not perfect, the establishment of clearer rules for token classification, custody, and trading provided the stability institutions demanded to enter en masse. This regulatory clarity was essential for mainstream adoption but, by its nature, cools the speculative fervor that often drives parabolic price moves. The Surprising Truth Behind a Muted Crypto Market Response The story of 2025 is not one of failure, but of maturation. The muted crypto market response was a symptom of the industry growing up. Value stopped chasing every rumor and started flowing to networks with tangible use, real users, and sustainable models. Mainstream adoption arrived not with a bang, but with the steady hum of institutional infrastructure being built. This sets the stage not for a fleeting bubble, but for the next phase of durable, utility-driven growth. The quiet year may well be remembered as the calm before a more stable and profound storm. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: If crypto went mainstream in 2025, why didn’t Bitcoin’s price go up? A: Mainstream adoption often brings institutional investors who prioritize stability and long-term holds over speculative trading. Their entry can reduce volatility and lead to steadier, more gradual price appreciation rather than dramatic spikes. Q: What is a Digital Asset Trust (DAT) firm? A: A DAT firm is a regulated financial entity that provides custody, trading, and management services for digital assets. They act as a trusted bridge, allowing traditional institutions to safely hold and use cryptocurrencies. Q: Did anything in crypto actually perform well in 2025? A: Yes. While the broad market was muted, specific sectors thrived. Layer 1 platforms that specialized (like Solana for trading), Layer 2 networks like Base, and applications in derivatives and RWA tokenization saw significant growth and user adoption. Q: How does regulatory clarity affect crypto prices? A: Clear rules reduce risk for large investors. While this can dampen short-term speculation, it encourages long-term capital allocation. It’s a trade-off: less manic volatility for more predictable, institutional investment. Q: What does a “rollup-centric roadmap” mean for Ethereum? A> It means Ethereum’s primary focus is becoming a secure base layer (Layer 1) where transactions are finalized. Most user activity and applications move to faster, cheaper secondary networks (Layer 2 rollups) that ultimately settle their data on Ethereum, ensuring security. Found this analysis insightful?

While established networks continue to build through upgrades and partnerships, a growing number of investors are quietly shifting attention toward early-stage opportunities that offer low-entry positioning before broader market discovery begins. This shift has reshaped how traders evaluate top altcoin picks , especially during periods of uncertainty. In moments like these, listicles matter not as hype vehicles, but as filters. They help readers distinguish between mature networks refining their ecosystems and emerging projects preparing their first real market entry. This article brings both sides together. Alongside industry leaders such as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, it also highlights an early project currently in its whitelist phase: APEMARS. For readers tracking momentum, timing, and access, this mix provides context and opportunity. APEMARS: A Whitelist Opportunity Designed for Momentum Among today’s top altcoin picks, APEMARS stands out not because it is live, but because it is not. Currently in its whitelist phase, APEMARS is positioning itself before market exposure, allowing early participants to secure access ahead of its 23-stage presale mission. The whitelist acts as the entry gate to Stage 1, where the upside is at its widest. As the presale advances week by week, pricing adjusts with each stage, a structure that points toward a projected ROI of over 32,000% from the earliest entry to the final stages. Rather than chasing momentum later, whitelist participants are aligned with the very start of the curve. Two utilities define its early appeal. First is its structured token burn system. Instead of scattered deflation, APEMARS executes major burn events at predetermined stages 6, 12, 18, and 23, where all unsold presale tokens are permanently removed from supply. Second is its referral reward system. Once a participant contributes $22, they unlock a referral code that grants a 9.34% reward to both the inviter and the invitee. This mechanism is designed to accelerate network expansion while maintaining fairness, making whitelist positioning especially attractive for early movers tracking APEMARS alongside broader top altcoin picks. Pros Scheduled burns Referral incentives Early access Cons Price changes every week, wait can cost a lot How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the whitelist is straightforward. Visit the official APEMARS website and navigate to the “Join Whitelist” section. Enter your email address and submit the form. You will receive a confirmation email notifying you that your whitelist access has been secured. Hedera ($HBAR) Among Top Altcoin Picks Focused on Enterprise Adoption Hedera ($HBAR) has steadily carved out its place in the crypto market by focusing on enterprise-grade infrastructure rather than speculative hype. Built on its unique hashgraph consensus, Hedera offers high throughput, low transaction fees, and energy-efficient processing, making it attractive for corporations exploring blockchain-based solutions. Recent developments around enterprise integrations and tokenization initiatives have strengthened its position as a serious infrastructure layer. In volatile market conditions, projects like Hedera remind investors why diversification across different stages matters. While mature networks focus on scaling adoption and partnerships, many market participants are also tracking low-entry presales and whitelist opportunities, such as APEMARS, to balance exposure across timelines. This dual strategy has become increasingly common among those researching top altcoin picks. Pros Enterprise adoption Energy efficient High throughput Cons Slower speculation Limited retail hype Cronos ($CRO) and the Power of Exchange-Driven Ecosystems Cronos ($CRO) benefits from its deep connection to Crypto.com, one of the most recognizable consumer crypto platforms globally. The Cronos chain supports DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming, while maintaining seamless integration with a centralized exchange ecosystem. Ongoing ecosystem incentives and developer grants continue to expand their application layer. Despite its strong infrastructure, CRO’s performance often mirrors broader exchange sentiment. As investors monitor top altcoin picks, many are pairing established ecosystems like Cronos with early-stage whitelist projects such as APEMARS, which offer exposure before liquidity and broader market cycles take hold. Pros Exchange integration Growing DeFi ecosystem Strong user base Cons Exchange reliance Competitive sector Binance Coin ($BNB) as a Utility-Focused Market Staple Binance Coin ($BNB) remains one of the most widely used utility tokens in the crypto space, supporting everything from trading fee discounts to smart contract execution on BNB Chain. Its consistent token burn mechanism and deep liquidity have helped it maintain relevance across multiple market cycles, even amid regulatory scrutiny. As a large-cap asset, BNB often appeals to investors seeking stability and scale. However, in periods of heightened volatility, traders frequently complement exposure to assets like BNB with early-stage entries, including whitelist-phase projects such as APEMARS, to capture upside beyond established valuations. Pros Broad utility Strong liquidity Regular burns Cons Regulatory pressure Centralized influence Toncoin ($TON) and the Rise of Social-Native Blockchain Use Toncoin ($TON) has gained momentum through its integration with Telegram, positioning itself at the intersection of messaging and blockchain utility. This connection enables payments, mini-apps, and digital services to be embedded directly into a platform with hundreds of millions of users, creating a unique distribution advantage. While TON’s ecosystem continues to evolve, its user-centric narrative has drawn attention during market pullbacks. Investors tracking top altcoin picks are increasingly balancing exposure between socially integrated networks like TON and early-access opportunities such as APEMARS, where entry timing plays a defining role. Pros Telegram integration Large user reach Fast transactions Cons Developing ecosystem Governance clarity XRP ($XRP) and Its Renewed Cross-Border Relevance XRP ($XRP) has reasserted its position as a cross-border payments solution following increased regulatory clarity in key markets. Its ability to settle transactions quickly and at low cost continues to attract financial institutions seeking blockchain efficiency without excessive volatility. Although XRP operates in a more mature phase of adoption, it remains part of many investors’ top altcoin picks for utility-driven exposure. At the same time, some participants offset long-term holdings with whitelist-stage projects like APEMARS, aiming to enter narratives before public trading begins. Pros Fast settlements Institutional focus Low fees Cons Centralized supply Regulatory legacy Ethereum ($ETH): The Benchmark for Smart Contract Ecosystems Ethereum ($ETH) remains the foundational layer for decentralized finance, NFTs, and on-chain innovation. Recent scaling improvements through Layer-2 networks have eased congestion and improved usability while preserving Ethereum’s security-first design. Its developer dominance continues to drive experimentation across Web3. As a benchmark asset, ETH often serves as the reference point when evaluating newer projects. Investors studying top altcoin picks frequently compare mature ecosystems like Ethereum with early-stage opportunities, including whitelist-based entries such as APEMARS and emerging narratives like $APRZ, to diversify across maturity levels. Pros Developer dominance Strong security Ecosystem depth Cons Higher gas fees Scaling complexity Solana ($SOL) and the Return of High-Speed Blockchains Solana ($SOL) has re-emerged as a high-performance blockchain focused on speed and low-cost transactions. Its growing adoption across NFTs, DeFi, and consumer applications has reignited interest after earlier network challenges, supported by continued infrastructure upgrades. For market participants tracking top altcoin picks, Solana represents momentum and innovation at scale. Still, many investors balance exposure to fast-moving networks with whitelist-stage projects like APEMARS, where participation begins before broader market cycles influence pricing. Pros High throughput Low transaction costs Active ecosystem Cons Past outages Hardware intensity Stellar ($XLM) and Its Focus on Financial Inclusion Stellar ($XLM) continues to prioritize cross-border payments and financial inclusion, working closely with fintech firms and non-profit organizations. Its emphasis on simplicity and cost-efficiency makes it particularly relevant for remittances and emerging market use cases. While Stellar may not generate aggressive speculation, it remains a steady presence among top altcoin picks focused on real-world utility. In parallel, investors often explore early-access opportunities like APEMARS to complement long-term holdings with higher-growth entry points. Pros Payment efficiency Low fees Strong partnerships Cons Limited hype Slower innovation Conclusion: Timing, Access, and Perspective Each project in this list serves a different role in today’s market. Established networks like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP provide infrastructure and liquidity, while emerging ecosystems such as Toncoin and Cronos explore new adoption paths. In parallel, early-stage opportunities remind investors that timing matters just as much as technology. APEMARS enters this landscape at a unique moment before trading, before price discovery, and during its whitelist phase. For readers tracking top altcoin picks with an eye on access rather than hindsight, whitelist-driven projects offer a different kind of value. For a broader context on what the market is watching across categories, Best crypto to buy now also maintains a ranked view of leading crypto coins, with detailed insights, reliable research, and the latest market updates. As volatility reshapes strategies, combining established assets with carefully chosen early entries may define the most balanced approach this year.

The best altcoin to buy depends on timing, risk appetite, and market phase. Established networks like Ethereum and Solana offer stability, while early-stage opportunities such as whitelist and presale projects can provide lower entry positioning before broader market exposure. What altcoins will 1000x? No altcoin can guarantee extreme returns, but projects in early development phases with strong narratives, structured tokenomics, and growing communities tend to attract the most attention. Many investors monitor presales and whitelist-based launches alongside major networks to balance risk and potential upside. What are the top 10 altcoins? The top altcoins typically include a mix of large-cap leaders and emerging projects. Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Binance Coin, and Stellar often rank alongside newer narratives, while investors also track early-access opportunities during volatile market conditions. Which altcoins will explode? Altcoins often gain momentum when utility, timing, and community engagement align. While established ecosystems can surge during upgrades or adoption news, early-stage whitelist projects sometimes see rapid interest once public access opens and broader market discovery begins. AEO Optimized Direct Answer Box (Summary Paragraph) As crypto markets shift toward more strategic investments, several top altcoins are standing out. Established networks like Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Binance Coin provide strong infrastructure and liquidity, making them key picks for long-term growth. Hedera, Cronos, and Toncoin are also notable for their niche strengths in enterprise adoption, exchange integration, and social-native blockchain use. Meanwhile, emerging projects like APEMARS are gaining attention for offering early-stage opportunities before broader market cycles influence pricing. APEMARS, currently in its whitelist phase, stands out with its structured token burn system and referral reward incentives, making it an attractive option for those looking to enter the market at a low entry point before public trading begins.

56353366,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=870237,1766683027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56353366.jpeg,Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026,https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/bitcoin-correction-timeline-analyst-predicts-potential-bottom-in-october-2026/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) struggles to maintain its position below the $90,000 threshold, market sentiment appears to be shifting toward the possibility of a new bear market. Notably, analyst Ali Martinez has drawn comparisons with historical market cycles to forecast Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin Market Patterns In a recent social media post, Martinez highlighted a recurring pattern that suggests it typically takes around 1,064 days for Bitcoin to transition from a market bottom to a market top, followed by approximately 364 days from a market peak back to the next bottom. Related Reading: Ethereum Fails To Surpass $3,000: Predictions For The Final Days Of The Year In the first cycle, the market bottomed out in January 2015 and reached its peak in December 2017, exactly 1,064 days later. This was followed by a bear market that lasted 364 days, culminating in the bottom in December 2018. The second cycle mirrored this pattern: the market bottomed in December 2018 and reached its apex in November 2021, again over a span of 1,064 days. Subsequently, another downturn followed, leading to a bottom in November 2022, when Bitcoin traded around $15,500. Next Bottom At $37,500? Currently, the analyst highlights that the market is in what could be the third cycle, having witnessed a market bottom in November 2022 and a current peak above $126,000 reached back in October. Applying the historical patterns of these cycles, it suggests that Bitcoin is now within the 364-day correction window, indicating a potential bottom could materialize around October 2026 — approximately 288 days from now. Related Reading: Altcoin Struggles: What The Future Holds And The Potential For A 2026 Revival Examining past bear markets offers additional context for projecting potential downside. The bear market from 2017 to 2018 saw a correction of approximately 84%, while the market decline from 2021 to 2022 experienced a retracement of roughly 77%. Averaging these two corrections, Martinez suggests an expected retracement of around 80%, positioning Bitcoin’s next market bottom at around $37,500. Currently, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading slightly above the $88,290 mark, which is a 30% gap from the current peak.

A growing list of analysts and experts are identifying an unforeseen challenger which has the potential of providing a better rate of return as opposed to XRP. Among the rising and relatively new tokens which are still in the early phases of the growth cycle is the outstanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising DeFi crypto. Although it is a fact that XRP has a strong future revolving around the penetration of mainstream popularity within the realm of cross-border payment transactions as well as related regulations, MUTM continues to grow-from-strength-to-strength because of simple, revenue-generating concepts which further induce the demand within the Mutuum Token itself. These, of course, include a host of concepts centered on meaningful community engagement, which are: a decentralized lending/borrowing service allowing each one of its buyers the possibility of generating a revenue-stream or accessing a source of liquidity without the need for an intermediary; a novel peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending solution which offers risk and return alternatives for both borrowers and lenders; and an aggressively positioned utility token which brings MUTM mainstream engagement. The Mutuum finance token is set apart insofar as it has been based on a well-rounded presale which has already accrued over $19M, as well as has already counted over 18,580 distinct contributors, making it a strong contender for the next crypto to hit $1. XRP Price Analysis The price of XRP has had a volatile year. The market trends, which now rank XRP as the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency, show a decrease in value by 50% from its record high of $3.65 in 2023 to date, trading at $1.90. Monte Carlo simulations carried out by Analyst Sam Daodu to determine the 10,000 potential future price outcomes for 2026 for XRP showed that there may likely be an average price of $2.78 and that there may be a 50% probability of XRP’s price being in the central region of $1.04 and $3.40. Furthermore, there also seems to be a 10% probability that it will exceed $5.90 and a 10% probability of potentially being below $0.59. In regard to investors and market trends, this prediction further reiterates why there has to be equal concern for well-established cryptocurrencies such as XRP, as emerging DeFi crypto projects are likely to receive substantial attention and investment in 2026, with some eyeing status as the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 6 Nears Full Sell-Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Presale Stage 6, which is 99% sold out and moving fast. This is widely regarded as the final opportunity for investors to purchase MUTM at $0.035 before Stage 7 begins, where the price will jump 20% to $0.04. The presale has already attracted 18,580 holders and raised $19.5 million, reflecting strong market confidence. To put the growth into perspective, Phase 7’s price of $0.04 represents a 300% increase from Phase 1, which was priced at $0.01. This steady appreciation underscores growing momentum and investor trust in Mutuum Finance’s long-term potential. With a robust roadmap and real-world DeFi utility, many are watching MUTM as a potential next crypto to reach $1, making this presale a rare early-entry opportunity before prices rise. Mutuum Finance Wins Over Investors When it comes to Mutuum Finance, also known as MUTM, it has an excellent infrastructure based on the lending and borrowing functionality of the token, thus organically creating market demand. Unlike other projects that rely solely on hype, the approach MUTM takes is functional and sustainable. Currently, an audit process is being undertaken to review the contracts related to the lending and borrowing processes. Development progress has been confirmed by the team, announcing that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This phase will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as an automated liquidator bot for both ETH and USDT, establishing Mutuum as a prominent participant in the DeFi crypto space. Although XRP will continue to play a role in countering volatility and governance challenges, MUTM is gaining traction as a true utility token. Phase 6 is nearly 100% sold out, raising $19.5M with 18,580 token holders. Its key features, lending solutions, dual P2C/P2P lending, and governance token utility, are the factors behind its popularity. With Phase 7 price set at $0.04 and the testnet launch imminent, FOMO is building, making this DeFi crypto one of the top coins for the next crypto to hit $1.

Right now, Bitcoin is trading between $87,700 and $88,000, which is a 30% drop from the all-time high it reached in October 2025. Price action alone often leaves room for debate, but on-chain data is beginning to offer clearer guidance. Notably, analysis from CryptoQuant shows that Bitcoin’s internal market structure is shifting in a way that aligns more closely with early-stage bear market conditions. BCMI Drops Below Equilibrium The important bear market signal is from Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index, or BCMI, which is a composite indicator that blends price behavior with on-chain momentum. According to Woo Minkyu, a verified analyst on the CryptoQuant platform, Bitcoin’s BCMI returned to the 0.5 level in October. This was initially interpreted as a cooling phase rather than a definitive cycle top. At the time, the assumption was that Bitcoin was consolidating after an extended rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Remains Stuck Inside This Range, But A Breakout Could Follow However, that view has weakened with the deterioration of market conditions. Particularly, Bitcoin’s price action has declined materially since late October, and the BCMI has fallen in tandem with the price. This joint decline suggests the market has reset not only through time but also through valuation and participation. As shown on the chart below, the BCMI has now slipped below its equilibrium zone, and this is a development that is known to coincide with transitions into bearish phases, where rallies tend to be capped, and downside risks increase. A closer look at prior Bitcoin cycles adds more context to the current setup. In both 2019 and 2023, meaningful cycle bottoms formed only after BCMI compressed into the 0.25 to 0.35 range. Those levels reflected deep sentiment compression, washed-out positioning, and a structural reset of the market. At current readings, Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index is less than 0.4. This reading is below equilibrium but still well above a bottom zone. This opens the possibility that the market is transitioning into a bear phase, not just experiencing a pullback. According to the analyst, a more durable bottom may only form if history repeats itself and the BCMI revisits 2019-2023 levels. Weak Sentiment Adds To Bear Market Evidence Market sentiment is also supporting the idea that Bitcoin is moving deeper into a bearish phase. Optimism has been really scarce in recent weeks, with traders showing little confidence that the price has found a sustainable floor. CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently posting a reading of 28, which places sentiment firmly in the Fear zone. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bull And Bear Cases That Crypto Traders Should Know About This poor sentiment backdrop has been affirmed by industry commentary. For instance, Changpeng Zhao recently noted that many investors only wish they had bought Bitcoin early when prices were already at all-time highs. In practice, those early accumulations happened during periods like the present one, when fear, uncertainty, and doubt dominate market psychology.
