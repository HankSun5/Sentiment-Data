MNT and GT underperformed due to inflation risk and weak bullish momentum. Liquidity, supply metrics, and sentiment drove divergence in exchange token returns. A sharp divergence has emerged in the exchange token sector over the past two months, highlighting a market that is increasingly rewarding utility and sound tokenomics while punishing perceived risks. An analysis of five prominent exchange tokens shows that while Binance Coin (BNB), Bitget Token (BGB), and OKX’s OKB posted respectable gains, Bybit’s Mantle (MNT) and GateToken (GT) trailed with significant losses.

As Arbitrum Spikes and Theta Taps AI Expansion,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-most-potential-crypto-of-2025-as-arbitrum-spikes-and-theta-taps-ai-expansion/,"The crypto world in 2025 is no longer dominated by hype alone—utility and real-world use cases are now setting the pace. With thousands of tokens competing for attention, only a select few are being recognized as the most potential crypto contenders. These aren’t just speculative assets—they are solving actual problems in industries like finance, data infrastructure, and digital ownership. Among the projects gaining traction, Qubetics has entered the spotlight for its bold push into real world asset tokenization. Meanwhile, heavyweights like Arbitrum and Theta are also innovating in ways that reinforce their positions among the most potential crypto networks to watch this year. For participants and developers alike, recognizing the most potential crypto early can define long-term success. In 2025, the projects combining tangible utility with scalable ecosystems are likely to lead the next wave. Qubetics ($TICS) Is Redefining the RWA Narrative—The Countdown Is On Qubetics isn’t just riding the tokenization wave—it’s shaping it. The protocol is launching a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that simplifies access for enterprises, entrepreneurs, and professionals. This isn’t just another DeFi platform; it’s a robust, user-friendly gateway to tokenize assets ranging from real estate to intellectual property. At the heart of Qubetics’ design is a massive shift in tokenomics. By slashing its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, the protocol has introduced scarcity from the start. The public sale allocation has increased to 38.55%, placing power directly in the hands of its user base. This move toward decentralization comes with significant implications for governance and long-term value. As of June 2025: Presale Stage: 37th Tokens Sold: 515 million+ Holders: 27,800+ Funds Raised: $17.9 million+ Current Price: $0.3370 Next Price Jump: $0.40 (20% hike) Recent community updates hint at a Tier 1 CEX listing by Q3 and a mainnet rollout by early Q4. Analysts from BlockForge Labs highlight $TICS among the most potential crypto assets of the year, citing its community-led model, aggressive burn mechanism, and enterprise-focused features. What truly sets Qubetics apart is its solution-driven framework. Many of its predecessors failed to simplify tokenization for real-world use cases. In contrast, Qubetics enables asset-backed digital ownership, wrapped in a legally compliant and cross-chain compatible system. In a digital era where tangible value is becoming harder to secure, Qubetics makes RWA tokenization accessible—and that’s not just innovation, it’s necessity. Investment Scenario: What a $10,000 Entry Looks Like in Qubetics’ Final Presale Stage Let’s say you’re entering Qubetics with a $10,000 buy-in during stage 37 at the current price of $0.3370. That gets you approximately 29,672 $TICS tokens before the listing price increases to $0.40. With only 10 million tokens left and a fast-closing window, timing is critical. At listing, those tokens will be worth $11,869, giving you a solid 18.7% gain right out of the gate. Looking further ahead, if $TICS reaches $5, that same $10K entry would turn into $148,360—a 1,383% return fueled by Qubetics’ unique tokenomics, reduced supply model (now just 1.36 billion total tokens), and increased community control through its 38.55% public allocation. If the token surges to $10 in the next bull run, your $10,000 becomes $296,720—a 2,867% ROI. For anyone looking to make a strategic move with limited capital, this might be the single strongest presale opportunity currently live in 2025. Arbitrum (ARB) Soars 7.47% in 24 Hours, Volume Spikes Over 84% Arbitrum (ARB), currently ranked #50 among cryptocurrencies, surged 7.47% in the last 24 hours to trade at $0.3645, pushing its market cap to $1.77 billion—up 7.44% on the day. Trading volume skyrocketed 84.05% to $169.52 million, giving it a high 9.56% volume-to-market cap ratio. With a circulating supply of 4.86 billion ARB out of a 10 billion total supply, the project shows significant market activity despite being 84.79% below its all-time high of $2.40 recorded in January 2024. Arbitrum, which has a profile score of 66% and UCID 11841, is supported by verified contracts (0x912C…9E6548), explorers like arbiscan.io, and various wallets. Notably, ARB is up 48.79% from its all-time low of $0.245, reached just two months ago in April 2025. Theta Network (THETA) Climbs 6.21% in Daily Rally, Market Cap Hits $789M Theta Network (THETA), ranked #88 in the global crypto market, surged 6.21% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7896, bringing its market cap to $789.63 million with a matching fully diluted valuation. The 24-hour trading volume rose 41.76% to $23.37 million, resulting in a 2.97% volume-to-market cap ratio. With its entire 1 billion THETA supply already in circulation, the token maintains a profile score of 72% and is backed by explorers like explorer.thetatoken.org, multiple wallets, and a UCID of 2416. Despite trading 95.03% below its all-time high of $15.90 from April 2021, THETA has seen a remarkable 1,886.99% gain since its all-time low of $0.03977 in March 2020. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: The Future is Tangible Real World Asset Tokenization is becoming more than a buzzword. It is transforming how value is represented, owned, and traded across the digital economy. Qubetics is at the forefront of this shift, bringing practicality to a concept that once seemed too complex for mainstream adoption. Key components of Qubetics’ RWA Marketplace: Tokenization Simplicity : Businesses can tokenize assets in minutes using an intuitive UI. Legal Framework : Built-in compliance tools for KYC/AML and regional regulation adherence. Interoperability : Supports Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Revenue Distribution : Token holders earn from marketplace fees and asset-based revenues. Enterprise Use Cases : Real estate, patents, music rights, logistics, and supply chain assets. This model provides an entry point into Web3 for those traditionally excluded due to complexity or legal constraints. With the crypto presale nearing its final moments, Qubetics stands as a living example of the most potential crypto transforming digital finance. Conclusion: Why Timing and Utility Matter More Than Hype in 2025 The surge in crypto adoption is no longer driven by promises—it’s driven by solutions. Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Theta each offer a unique approach to solving real-world problems using blockchain. But among them, Qubetics commands immediate attention. With scarcity building, functionality maturing, and a crypto presale window rapidly closing, the opportunity is real. For those tracking the most potential crypto projects in 2025, this is not the time to stay passive. Qubetics represents a rare alignment of innovation, timing, and traction—making it a standout among the most potential crypto players right now. As the final crypto presale stage winds down, it could become one of the most potential crypto success stories of this market cycle.

Per a report from Forbes Russia , the ministry says its proposal is currently undergoing interdepartmental review. However, if the plans are adopted as-is, Russian law agencies and courts will be given the power to seize crypto from illegal miners. Russia: Miners May Be Fined for Flaunting Bans Under the new proposal, Russian judges will also be able to punish individuals engaging in illegal mining. Courts will be able to hand out fines worth between 100,000 to 200,000 rubles ($1,272 to $2,544). Maksut Shadayev, the Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, speaking at the Federation Council earlier this year. (Source: Federation Council/VK/Screenshot) Forbes Russia says it has seen the ministry’s proposal. It says Moscow also wants to fine and confiscate crypto from any individual found illegally participating in a mining pool. Harsher fines still lie in store for solo entrepreneurs and officials. This group will have to pay between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($2,544 to $5088) if convicted. Authorities will also gain the power to take coins from industrial miners who flaunt crypto mining rules. The new rules will let courts impose a fine of 1 million ($12,728) to 2 million rubles ($25,456) on corporations involved in illegal mining. The ministry wants to amend the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses, seeking to effectively make illegal mining a criminal offense. BTC hashrate distribution amongst the largest known mining pools over the past four days. (Source: Blockchain.com) Crypto Payments Could Also Be Criminalized Under a law that came into force last year, unregistered Russian individuals can mine crypto at home, provided they do not use more than 6,000 kWh per month. However, in some 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions, mining restrictions apply. The law also states that people with unexpunged convictions for economic crimes, or those convicted of extremist or terrorist crimes, cannot mine crypto. The law also bans certain electricity and grid management firms from mining crypto. Additionally, the ministry plans to punish individuals and firms for making settlements in crypto in Russia outside the Central Bank-run crypto sandbox. The ministry’s proposals include plans to fine people and firms who use crypto as a payment tool up to 1 million rubles ($12,728). The Central Bank, however, appears to think that the threat of confiscating coins from people who seek to do business in crypto will be a bigger deterrent. Andrey Medvedev, the bank’s Legal Department lead, told attendees at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum last month: “The key thing is that the [crypto] illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. And this will be the most painful thing.” Russia and China say the Pentagon's proposed missile-defense shield will be destabilizing.

The commission also decided to postpone a proposed year-round ban on mining in the Zabaikalsky Krai and Buryatia regions.

The move comes after weeks of range-bound price action, and while the breakout attempt has gained attention, traders are now watching closely for confirmation through a decisive push above the next resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? So far, ETH has held up well despite broader market volatility. With buyers back in control, the focus has shifted to whether Ethereum can break through the upper boundary of its current range and begin a sustained move higher. Without follow-through, price risks slipping back into consolidation, frustrating bullish positioning. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is now pushing into weekly range highs, specifically a zone defined by a cluster of upper shadows and the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA). This region has repeatedly acted as resistance, rejecting previous rally attempts. Ethereum Bulls Eye Breakout Confirmation Ethereum is at a critical juncture as bulls push price toward the $2,800 resistance — a level that must be decisively cleared to confirm a breakout and transition into a full bullish phase. After a sharp rebound from April’s low, where ETH traded near $1,400, the asset has surged more than 90%, reclaiming key moving averages and breaking through previous short-term resistance levels. Momentum is clearly building, but Ethereum now faces its most important test. The $2,800 zone marks the top of the current range and coincides with multiple technical barriers. Cheds highlighted that ETH is now trading into weekly range highs, where a cluster of upper shadows has repeatedly rejected price. This region also aligns with the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA), reinforcing it as a major zone of resistance. According to Cheds, the bear thesis fails if ETH can flip $2,750 into support — a level that would likely signal trend reversal and sustained upside. However, macro risks remain. US Treasury yields continue to climb, reflecting concerns over inflation and tighter financial conditions. Rising yields often put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by pulling liquidity out of speculative markets. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s structure remains strong. As long as bulls maintain pressure and defend higher lows, the path toward reclaiming $3,000 becomes more probable. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger increased participation, both from technical traders and investors sidelined by recent volatility. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but the momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June ETH Reaches Key Resistance Zone After Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $2,688 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong breakout from a multi-day ascending triangle structure. The move was backed by rising volume and a clean reclaim of all major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($2,558), 100 SMA ($2,571), and 200 SMA ($2,535) — which now act as support beneath price. ETH has pushed directly into a key resistance zone between $2,690 and $2,735, highlighted by several previous rejection wicks. This area has acted as a supply zone since mid-May, capping every breakout attempt and leading to swift pullbacks. The current test marks Ethereum’s fifth attempt to break above this level in recent weeks, which increases the odds of a potential breakout, especially if bulls maintain momentum and volume remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, if ETH fails to clear this zone, a pullback toward the 200 SMA or the $2,600 level is likely, especially if volume tapers off. The structure remains bullish in the short term, with higher lows forming and buying pressure increasing. A confirmed 4H close above $2,735 would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger a push toward $2,900–$3,000. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but bulls are clearly pressing on the door.

In a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, Saylor argued that Chanos fundamentally misunderstands Strategy’s business model, calling the arbitrage thesis “misguided.” Chanos, known for shorting companies he deems overvalued, recently suggested investors should bet against bet against Srategy due to its substantial premium over the firm’s Bitcoin-adjusted book value. That premium, which exceeded 200% at one point in 2024, has been a focal point for skeptics who view Strategy as a glorified Bitcoin holding company. But Saylor pushed back. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” he said. “We’re actually the largest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world.” Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison Saylor emphasized that unlike Bitcoin trusts or closed-end funds, Strategy retains the flexibility to actively manage capital by issuing new financial instruments and leveraging its balance sheet. “Trusts can’t leverage Bitcoin. They can’t issue preferred shares, they can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can,” Saylor asserted. “What [Chanos] still doesn’t understand is that we are not a holding company or a closed-end trust — we are an operating company.” Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently pivoted its capital-raising strategy. Rather than issuing convertible bonds or diluting shareholders through common stock sales, the firm has embraced preferred stock instruments to finance its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. This includes the newly launched STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Perpetual Stride) preferred shares — a trio of high-yield offerings that collectively raised nearly $1 billion last week. Saylor accuses Chanos of misjudging business model Chanos has not responded to Saylor’s latest remarks. But Saylor was unsparing in his critique of the hedge fund manager’s valuation approach. Saylor said Chanos is valuing the business, generating $8.4 billion of shareholder value at zero, and he is hoping the equity will somehow trade to NAV. He continued to say that Chanos is not paying attention to if Strategy can issue preferred shares that yield 10% and invest that in Bitcoin, which has been going up by 57% for the past four and a half years. Saylor noted that the company is capturing the 47% arbitrage, effectively risk-free for their common stock shareholders. As of Tuesday, Strategy held approximately 582,000 Bitcoin — valued at about $63 billion — making it the largest corporate holder of the asset globally. The company has made over 70 Bitcoin purchase announcements since mid-2020 when Saylor initiated the strategy of using corporate funds to buy the digital currency. Saylor plans stock buybacks to squeeze shorts if premium narrows Saylor also hinted at future financial maneuvers to counter short-seller strategies. Should the premium on Strategy’s stock narrow too much, the firm could issue more preferred shares and use the proceeds to repurchase common shares, further tightening supply and squeezing shorts. “If the stock trades at a weak premium, we’re just going to sell the preferred,” he said. “And if the stock rallies up, he’s going to get liquidated and wiped out.” While the war of words between Chanos and Saylor may intensify, it reflects a broader debate over how to value a Bitcoin-centric operating company in a market still grappling with crypto’s integration into traditional finance. For now, Saylor remains unapologetically bullish — on Bitcoin and Strategy’s ability to outperform critics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Support near the 50-day and 100-day EMAs may lead to a future price surge. Positive futures market indicators suggest growing institutional commitment to XRP. Despite market fluctuations, XRP remains stable with strong support around it. As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.27 , and it has gone up by 0.85% during the past 24 hours. The price increased strongly at the start of March but soon fell again after passing through some important moving averages. XRP Derivatives Market Shows Strong Bullish Signals In the derivatives market, XRP shows signs that add strength to the idea of a bullish trend. According to CoinGlass, the daily trading volume has gone up to $5.27 billion by 26.64%, and open interest rose by 5.25% to $4.27 billion. Such high numbers indicate countries are becoming more interested and are investing for the long term.

Each is gaining momentum for different reasons: Unstaked is leveraging a $1 million giveaway to drive presale growth, Aave is rolling out a major DeFi infrastructure update, and HYPE is testing bullish resistance levels near $40. In a market hungry for clarity and purpose, these three are giving investors plenty to consider. While many search for the best crypto to buy right now, the rising winners seem to combine utility, community alignment, and strong fundamentals. Unstaked leads the way with its unique AI-driven platform and a no-insider-allocation presale. Aave reaffirms its legacy with a sophisticated overhaul to risk management. HYPE, on the other hand, shows that even high-volatility assets can deliver when supported by data and demand. Aave Umbrella Update Overhauls Risk and Rewards The upcoming Aave (AAVE) updates, part of the Umbrella upgrade, are set to reshape the protocol’s risk management framework. Aave is transitioning from locking AAVE and LP tokens to allowing aToken based contributions, enabling users to directly stake assets like aUSDC and aUSDT in exchange for variable yields. More importantly, slashing events will now be triggered automatically based on smart contract data, removing the need for governance votes in most risk events. The update also introduces StakeTokens, which represent a user’s stake in the safety module. These tokens carry slashing risk tied to actual pool deficits, but are managed via a more transparent and decentralized system. Aave is also reducing emissions of AAVE rewards while continuing strategic buybacks, aiming for long-term sustainability. The update arrives at a crucial time for Aave, as competition among DeFi protocols intensifies. Investors monitoring Aave updates are particularly encouraged by the improved capital efficiency and real-time risk response built into this release. For many, it adds further weight to AAVE’s reputation as the best crypto to buy right now among large-cap DeFi assets. HYPE Builds Momentum Despite Whale Exit Despite recent volatility, Hyperliquid (HYPE) remains a strong project in the perpetuals space. After a dramatic $1 million profit-taking move by high-profile trader James Wynn, HYPE has steadied above the $31 level and is now targeting a move toward $40. Wynn entered at an average price of $24.84 and exited near $32.72, marking a 31.9% return on a leveraged trade. While his exit briefly shook confidence, fundamentals behind the project remain strong. Hyperliquid’s May metrics point to increasing traction: TVL rose 108% to $1.46 billion, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume reached a record-breaking $248.3 billion. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows an early bullish crossover, and the price is consolidating just under a resistance zone at $35. If that level breaks, the HYPE coin target of $40 may be in play. For short-term traders and high-risk speculators, HYPE offers volatility, volume, and narrative alignment. However, even conservative investors are now watching closely, as Hyperliquid’s performance makes it a surprise opportunity for the best crypto to buy right now, particularly for those seeking explosive upside potential in DeFi-native environments. Unstaked: AI, Rewards, and the Road to $10M While legacy DeFi players grow and high-octane trades unfold, Unstaked is capturing sustained attention with its AI-powered community platform and unique token model. Currently in Stage 19 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $9.4 million, with tokens priced at $0.011065. The projected launch price is $0.1819, representing a potential 28x return for early buyers. At the heart of the project is a Proof of Intelligence model, where users earn rewards based on contributions, not simply for holding. Unlike many presales, Unstaked features no insider allocations, which fosters trust and fairness within the community. Its AI tools, community voting system, and merit-based incentives combine to form a truly decentralized product vision. To further amplify interest, Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway, awarding 20 winners $50,000 in $UNSD tokens each. Entry requires a minimum $100 purchase and completion of a few social tasks, creating a highly engaged and invested early user base. Among the many presales in the market, Unstaked stands out for its clarity of purpose and execution. It’s not just another AI token or governance play, it’s a live testbed for community-driven crypto development. For investors evaluating the best crypto to buy right now, Unstaked is fast becoming the presale to beat. What Informed Investors Are Watching in 2025 The crypto market in 2025 is rewarding substance, not just speculation. As the latest Aave (AAVE) updates streamline DeFi safety nets, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) coin target bulls push toward $40, Unstaked’s strong community, transparent model, and AI-powered platform are pushing it to the top of presale watchlists. Unstaked’s $1 million campaign, combined with no insider advantages and a performance-based reward system, offers a refreshing model for future crypto launches. Whether you’re a DeFi veteran or new to the space, now is a rare window where development, incentives, and investor alignment are syncing up. For those searching for the best crypto to buy right now, the answer may lie not in the familiar names of old cycles, but in those quietly building the next one.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 791,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on gold’s price action, noting that the precious metal’s chart is the “most important chart to watch” this week. According to the trader, gold appears to have printed a bearish lower high setup on the six-hour chart, suggesting that the precious metal could fall to as low as $3,200 in the near term. “As long as Gold stays sub-$3,365, we’re likely going to see a sharp fall in the coming one to two weeks of anything between 4-10%, resulting into a sudden macroeconomic shift.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Van de Poppe believes that falling gold prices will be beneficial for altcoins, as it suggests an increased appetite for risk among investors. “At the end of [last] week, a sudden [gold] correction took place, which might result in the confirmation of a short-term downtrend. This is vital, as that would attract more investors towards Altcoins. Why? It would enable more investors to be jumping into risk-on assets, when gold implies that it continues to fall. This means –> money/liquidity flows from risk-off assets towards risk-on assets, and the best asset class remains to be crypto.” But the trader warns that altcoins will likely see lower levels if gold shatters $3,365. “If it does break above that crucial level, the theory is invalidated, and we’re likely open for printing new highs, which then means that we’re printing new lows on altcoins. For me, this is crucial, as a correction in Gold and rally in the CNH (offshore Chinese renminbi) implies that we’re going to be seeing more interest flowing into crypto after that.” At time of writing, gold is trading for $3,324, up more than 60% in the last 18 months.

This comes as the SEC has requested issuers that are launching the Solana ETFs to submit their updated filings especially for the S-1 form within a week potentially signaling approvals. Filing changes signal accelerated Solana ETF approvals A source cited by Blockworks has suggested the filing changes could accelerate the Solana ETF approval, possibly in July or within three to five weeks, before October when most of the final deadlines for a SEC decision expire. According to two sources that spoke with Blockworks, the SEC will provide comments the S-1 forms within a space of 30 days of submission. The agency reportedly solicited for explanations from companies on how investors will get their money back in crypto. It’s also pushing to know if companies plan to include staking, which means earning rewards by helping run the Solana network. The SEC is also said to be open to allowing staking as part of these products. “If staking gets approved, it changes the game” said one enthusiast identified as Crypto Racoon on X platform.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of approval in 2025 are at 90%, which matches their forecast for LitecoinETF approval. “We think the SEC may now focus on handling 19b-4 filings for Solana and staking ETFs earlier than planned.” Bloomberg analysts. Seyffart indicated this week that SEC may prioritize reviewing 19b-4 filings for Solana and bet ETFs sooner than expected, adding that the issuers and industry players have likely been working with SEC together with its crypto taskforce to finalize the details. He also added that Solana and XRP already have futures-based ETFs, which usually makes it easier for the SEC to give a not to spot ETFs. Last month the regulator delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF indicating that it had not “reached any conclusions” on the19b-4 filing to list the proposed ETF. The delay was viewed as procedural rather than rejection. Grayscale wants to convert its SOL Trust into a spot ETF, reflecting the path it used to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF funds. The firm’s filing was delayed on May 13, while Franklin Templeton’s proposal was delayed on April 30, according to SEC. In the meantime, filings by Fidelity and VanEck were postponed on May 19. After the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum ETF in May this year, attention has now turned to other top digital assets like Solana. News of the development sent SOL 4% up, bringing its price close to $165 per trading view data.

He warns that increased oversight could stifle innovation and weaken the US’s competitive edge against China. Speaking to Bloomberg News on Tuesday, Schmidt—who also oversees security at Amazon Web Services (AWS)—cautioned against government overreach in the rapidly evolving AI sector. He said the tension with regulation of any kind is that it tends to retard progress. Schmidt continued to say their approach is to let the industry define appropriate standards—guided primarily by customer needs and demands. Tech leaders push back as Washington moves to rein In AI development Schmidt’s remarks echo those made last month by Microsoft, OpenAI, AMD, and CoreWeave executives during a congressional hearing. The tech leaders argued that government regulation could hinder their ability to compete globally—especially with China, which has made AI development a national priority. Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, emphasized the necessity of “sensible regulation that doesn’t slow us down,” signaling a widening fissure between innovation and governing within the tech world. The fight over AI regulation is heating up on Capitol Hill. A controversy erupted when the House tucked language into President Donald Trump’s broad tax package that would prevent states from going their own way to enforce new AI rules. The provision prompted bipartisan pushback and focused attention on a growing worry that there are no controls on the development of AI. A vocal advocate for unfettered AI growth, Trump has taken steps to dismantle constraints, including repealing the Biden administration’s executive order on AI and promoting AI-related investments in the Middle East. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the move, calling it essential to national security and asserting that “regulatory restraint” was key to ensuring America’s dominance in AI. Attorney General Rob Bonta said he strongly opposes any effort to block states from developing and enforcing common-sense regulation. He noted that states must be able to protect their residents by responding to emerging and evolving AI technology. California implemented a raft of bills this year limiting specific uses of AI, illustrating the kind of laws that would be blocked under the moratorium. Like several other states, California has criminalized the use of AI to generate sexually explicit images of individuals without their consent. The state also prohibits unauthorized deepfakes in political advertising and requires healthcare providers to notify patients when interacting with an AI, not a human. Healthcare provider networks, also known as HMOs, are barred in California from using AI systems instead of doctors to decide medical necessity. Senate challenges House approach However, the House provision may not survive Senate scrutiny. Under budget reconciliation rules, only measures directly related to federal spending or revenue can bypass the filibuster and pass with a simple majority. The Senate proposed alternative language as a workaround: denying federal broadband funding to states that impose their own AI regulations. But the provision’s fate hinges on the ruling of the Senate parliamentarian, who has not yet weighed in. “We have yet to argue this before the parliamentarian. I anticipate that we will do so this week or next week,” Senate Commerce Chairman Ted Cruz told Bloomberg TV . “I don’t know how she’ll rule.” Still, Cruz called the Senate’s approach “very sound policy.” The regulatory debate comes as Amazon ramps up investment in AI infrastructure. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant recently announced plans to spend up to $20 billion on server farms in Pennsylvania—further evidence of the company’s high-stakes bet on artificial intelligence as a core driver of future growth. Like its peers, Amazon sees AI as not just a technological leap but a geopolitical one. And for now, industry leaders are betting that the fewer the rules, the faster they can run.

American Bitcoin (ABTC), backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has quietly accumulated over 215 BTC, valued at $23 million, since its launch on April 1. As revealed in a recent SEC filing dated June 6, ABTC isn’t just a mining company; it’s a Bitcoin accumulation vehicle with long-term ambitions. Operating over 60,000 miners housed in Hut 8 facilities, ABTC generates over 10.17 EH/s of hashpower without owning any real estate. Instead of converting mined Bitcoin into cash, the company stores its reserves securely using Coinbase Custody. Eric and Donald Trump Jr.-backed American #Bitcoin quietly accumulates 215 $BTC ($23M+) since April launch ahead of public merger. pic.twitter.com/OXP9wZvDRS — amit malik (@amitmalikmalik) June 10, 2025 With Eric Trump joining the board and a public listing in the works via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, the company is tying its identity and brand equity to Bitcoin itself. Key points: ABTC’s mining approach focuses on BTC accumulation, not fiat conversion. Trump family’s backing adds political clout and media visibility. Market sees this as bullish supply-side pressure—less BTC on exchanges. U.S. Charges $500M Crypto Laundering Plot While ABTC builds a bullish case, U.S. regulators dropped a bombshell. The DOJ arrested Iurii Gugnin, founder of Evita Pay and Evita Investments, for laundering over $500 million through U.S. banks and crypto platforms, mainly using Tether (USDT). U.S. CRACKS DOWN ON CRYPTO KING: SECRET TECH DEALS WITH RUSSIA EXPOSED U.S. prosecutors charged Iurii Gugnin, founder of crypto payments company Evita, with laundering over $500 million and helping Russians get sensitive American tech. Court documents allege Gugnin used… https://t.co/ccVEVtO59E pic.twitter.com/XMQiVOeatj — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) June 10, 2025 Gugnin is accused of helping sanctioned Russian entities like Sberbank and Rosatom dodge international restrictions. The indictment includes 22 counts of bank fraud, each carrying up to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors allege he: Bought U.S. technology for banned firms. Falsified documents to hide ties to Russia. Exploited crypto’s opacity to bypass sanctions. This case reinforces growing concerns that digital assets are being used to sidestep international law, prompting stricter global oversight. Still, Bitcoin’s transparent and decentralized nature differentiates it from intermediated platforms and may continue to attract regulatory favor. Japan’s QE Pivot May Ignite Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sees a potential global liquidity wave on the horizon. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) resumes quantitative easing (QE) at its June 16–17 meeting, Hayes believes it could be the next big tailwind for Bitcoin. The Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting could impact global risk assets. If they shift to QE, $BTC may surge towards $200K as it becomes a hedge against sovereign risks. Read the full article https://t.co/i2bvc3IJ2I — Nova – {News} AI Agent (@ChainGPTAINews) June 10, 2025 Why? Japan recently signaled plans to reduce bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter. But with rising yields, 30-year JGBs hit 3.185% in May—officials may reverse course. Bitcoin previously surged to $112,000 when yields spiked, suggesting investors see it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability. Hayes predicts: QE would boost risk assets, including BTC. Institutions may turn to Bitcoin as a “counterparty-risk-free” asset. A renewed rally could push Bitcoin toward the $200,000 mark in 2025. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $112K and Beyond? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC remains in a bullish ascending channel on the 2-hour chart, trading above the 50-EMA ($107,510) and making consistent higher lows. A bullish engulfing candle on June 9 pushed the price above a key barrier at $108,627, with current resistance at $110,668. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is flattening, hinting at weakening momentum, while candlesticks show upper wicks—a sign of hesitation. A confirmed breakout above $111,000 could ignite momentum toward $112,000 and $113,500. Technical Levels to Watch: Support: $108,000 (channel base), $107,510 (50-EMA) Resistance: $111,000, $113,500 Trade idea: Buy on breakout or bounce off 50-EMA with a tight stop-loss Conclusion Macro shifts, regulatory crackdowns, and high-profile political support are reshaping the narrative surrounding Bitcoin. As ABTC accumulates, Japan considers more stimulus, and chart patterns remain constructive, the path toward $200K is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a data-backed possibility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading at just $0.03, is drawing comparisons to early-stage Ethereum (ETH) for its ambitious DeFi infrastructure and disruptive potential. The project has already raised more than $10.3 million and attracted over 11,800 holders. Meanwhile, Ethereum, still one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, continues to defend its legacy with strong developer activity and growing institutional adoption, trading at $2,486 as of early June 2025. But as retail investors ask what crypto to buy now, many are betting that MUTM could be the next crypto to take off, offering exponential upside, and potentially carving out its own market alongside Ethereum (ETH) in the changing decentralized market. Mutuum Finance’s Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their listing price of $0.06, which is a 100% gain for phase 5 investors upon the token’s launch. With over $10.3 million raised and a growing community of 11,800+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Rewards for Early Investors Fuel Ongoing Community Growth As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow, it remains committed to its earliest supporters. To show appreciation, 10 early investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway —each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This rewards them for being early backers of the project before it takes off. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key features of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $10.3 million and attracted more than 11,800 holders signaling strong early momentum in the DeFi space. As Phase 5 of the presale continues investors can still acquire tokens at $0.03 ahead of the planned $0.06 listing price which will yield a 100% ROI. The project’s hybrid lending model, Certik-audited smart contracts, and upcoming fully collateralized stablecoin highlight a serious commitment to innovation, transparency, and long-term value.

You’re Among Crypto’s Elite, Expert Claims",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/owning-10000-xrp-youre-among-cryptos-elite-expert-claims/,"According to crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina, most individual XRP holders could find themselves shut out as inflation and tight budgets squeeze their options. He argues that owning more than 10,000 XRP – which costs about $23,100 at a price of $2.31 per token – has become a barrier for anyone living paycheck to paycheck. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Rich List Data Reveals Concentration Based on reports, there are about 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses in existence. Less than 4% of those wallets contain at least 10,000 XRP. A clear majority, over 5 million addresses, hold 500 XRP or fewer. That gap shows how stacked the system is. More than 166,250 wallets sit in the 10,000–25,000 XRP range. Another 159,566 wallets carry between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. These figures point to a small group with deep pockets, while the rest trail far behind. Owning more than 10,000 $XRP nowadays is already a luxury few people can afford. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 9, 2025 Inflation Pressures Hit Small Holders Farina warns that rising inflation is forcing ordinary holders to sell just to cover daily needs. He notes, “We’re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries.” When basic goods cost more each month, people feel they have no choice but to cash out their crypto. It’s a harsh reality. Owning large amounts of XRP has morphed from a luxury into a struggle for survival. Threshold Debate Heats Up He first said 95% of XRP holders risk being priced out. Now he’s raised that warning to 99%. That jump has sparked debate. Some worry it feeds a fear of missing out on a “10,000-XRP club,” while others see it as a wake-up call. Farina questions whether Bitcoin’s rally to about $112,000 really reflects growth, or simply the dollar losing its value. He frames the issue as a tug-of-war between crypto gains and fiat losses. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Calls For New Income Streams Instead of selling crypto, Farina urges holders to find extra income. He suggests side hustles or online work as ways to avoid cutting into holdings. “If you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,” he said. His advice pushes people to rethink how they earn and where they live. Crypto markets can move on legal news and product launches, not only inflation. Ripple’s ongoing court case and ETF filings could change XRP’s path. Still, Farina’s message taps into a broader concern: the gap between small and large holders may widen as prices climb. Retail investors can still join in. They just need to pace their buys and stay aware of both crypto trends and everyday costs.

Amidst a crypto market characterized by persistent volatility, with Bitcoin fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000, market sentiment remains largely influenced by macroeconomic policies, regulatory developments, and speculative behavior. Against this backdrop, HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt leverages rigorous data analysis and a meticulous selection process to spotlight seven standout projects. These projects are strategically positioned for growth and demonstrate strong community engagement. The selected assets span some of today’s most dynamic sectors—including RWA/DeFi, AI, Meme, LSD, and SocialFi—and feature both promising new entrants and well-established projects that have recently outperformed broader market trends. New Listings Shine Across a Well-Balanced Sector Mix In May, HTX listed 23 new assets, including six stablecoins, an approach that underscores its commitment to staying at the forefront of the stablecoin trend and expanding its asset offerings. Notably, USD1 made its global debut on HTX. The token, issued by World Liberty Financial (a company backed by the Trump family), focuses on building a DeFi lending ecosystem in the United States. USD1 quickly gained traction as one of May’s most discussed projects on social media and received an S rating. Besides USD1, two other new assets in Crypto Gem Hunt #6 have stood out: SYRUP (Maple Finance) , a key player in the RWA/DeFi sector, experienced an impressive 117.7% surge following its listing on May 8, earning an A rating. SYRUP is the native token of Maple, a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to deposit USDC, receive syrupUSDC, and earn yield. All loans are collateralized by digital assets, ensuring both strong security and sustainable returns. KAITO , an innovator in the InfoFi/AI sector, recorded a remarkable 263.6% increase since its listing on HTX on February 23, securing an A rating. KAITO is building an AI-driven crypto information network that streamlines content distribution among creators, users, and capital. By empowering the content ecosystem, KAITO is positioning itself at the forefront of the convergence between crypto and AI. Veteran Projects Regain Momentum, Fueling Compelling Narratives Despite continuous shifts in market dynamics, a select group of earlier-launched projects are demonstrating remarkable resilience. Backed by strong product fundamentals and vibrant community support, they’ve recently returned to the spotlight with evolving narratives and renewed momentum, capturing the attention of both investors and users. Two Meme projects from last September, MOODENG and NEIROCTO, serve as notable examples: MOODENG , built on the Solana (SOL) chain, surged an incredible 961.5% and received an A rating. Inspired by the famous pygmy hippopotamus from Thailand, MOODENG’s unique design, strong community, and viral momentum propelled it to a nearly tenfold increase post-launch. NEIROCTO ( First Neiro On Ethereum ) is community-driven and carries on the spirit of Doge. Since its launch on September 7, 2024, it has seen a peak increase of 235%. Through consistent operational efforts and content-driven initiatives, NEIROCTO has cultivated a highly engaged Meme community. ETHFI ( ether.fi ), launched in March 2024, emerged during the boom of the LSD sector and has since recorded a 258.7% increase. With rising interest in LSD solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem, ETHFI shows strong growth potential and a solid track record. MASK (Mask Network) , launched in 2021, is a SocialFi project that recently gained 187.3%. Acting as a bridge between Web2 (traditional internet) and Web3 (decentralized internet), MASK integrates decentralized applications into mainstream social media via a browser plugin. Recent feature updates and community efforts have significantly contributed to its price recovery. HTX Crypto Gem Hunt Empowers Users Across Market Cycles To date, HTX has launched six rounds of its Crypto Gem Hunt program. The latest selection features not only high-growth new assets from emerging sectors but also established projects that have recently delivered strong performance. Together, these assets offer users a well-balanced portfolio—combining defensive stability with high-upside potential. Looking ahead, HTX Crypto Gem Hunt will continue to empower users through professional, intuitive asset discovery supported by robust data and forward-looking analysis.

While the world's largest digital asset is trading flat in the early hours of the session, CoinDesk market data shows that it's up 4% on the week. An expected Bank of Japan rate cut isn't doing that much to move the market, even though a low interest rate policy is usually what drives risk-on sentiment and positively impacts BTC prices. One metric to watch instead is the 'Coinbase Premium'. Tracked by CryptoQuant, it measures the price difference between BTC on Coinbase Pro (USD) and Binance (USDT), demonstrating the dollar demand for bitcoin (as opposed to crypto-native demand). ""The Coinbase Premium is gradually rising, indicating that buying pressure from U.S. investors is supporting the trend,"" CryptoQuant analysts wrote in a recent update . ""Additionally, whale buying activity is being observed incrementally."" Part of this movement would include BTC ETF inflow, which has hit $386.27 million so far this week, according to SoSoValue data . That being said, some market observers are concerned that a staked ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), which may be close to getting approved , could put a damper on institutional BTC interest. Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, says that an ETF that gives investors access to ETH yield from staking would be something that BTC ETFs can't match, as they just give exposure to price appreciation. ""This has created a lot of buzz, especially considering how much of bitcoin’s rally was fueled by ETF hype,"" Yang said. ""And let’s be honest: while there’s speculation around Solana or Litecoin ETFs, Ether is still the only other crypto asset with a real existence in U.S. spot ETF. That makes it a go-to option for institutions waiting and watching on the sidelines, ready to move when the timing feels right."" But for now, it's still a waiting game. At least until the BoJ's move is official, as the usual crypto-natives like Arthur Hayes are counting on BTC going parabolic as a result. DEX Volume Has Nearly Doubled in Past Year Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) have always had their eyes on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) since the concept took off in 2018 with the advent of modern Automated Market Maker (AMM) engines – the technology at the center of the product category. But as the year continues, and crypto mergers and acquisitions heat up maybe there'll be a renewed interest in DEXs, considering the massive jump in volume on the platforms in the last year. According to data from Messari, in the last year, trading volume on DEXs has jumped from around 6% of all volume to 12%. In May, that number got closer to 25% as up-and-coming DEX Hyperliquid caught the eye of the market , including crypto's most aggressive traders . But are DEXs and CEX's competitors? No, says OKX President Hong Fang. Speaking with CoinDesk earlier this year in the run-up to Consensus Hong Kong, Fang said that the two are complementary. ""The crypto-native audience will want to be able to use CEX for reliability and DEX for catching innovations,"" she said at the time. ""Such supply-demand dynamics will drive further adoption of DEX to enable innovation while supporting the gradual maturity of the crypto regulatory framework."" News Roundup Trump’s CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz Says Congress Key to Boosting Crypto Innovation and Consumer Protection Brian Quintenz, President Trump's nominee for chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), emphasized at his Senate confirmation hearing that Congress must lead in establishing clear guidelines to boost crypto innovation and consumer protection simultaneously, CoinDesk previously reported. Quintenz, who previously served as a CFTC commissioner and later as head of policy at venture capital firm a16z, argued that forthcoming market structure legislation could provide clarity needed for entrepreneurs while maintaining safeguards for consumers. During his confirmation, senators expressed concerns about vacancies at the CFTC—particularly the absence of Democratic commissioners—but Quintenz declined to commit to advocating Trump to fill these positions, emphasizing presidential discretion. He acknowledged potential resource needs should the CFTC become the primary regulator for digital commodities, advocating a ""technology-first approach"" to enhance agency efficiency, and defended the role of prediction markets as legitimate tools for hedging and risk management. Aave is Now on Sony's Soneium Aave has launched on Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain supported by electronics giant Sony, CoinDesk previously reported. This integration includes exploring real-world applications of Aave's decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin, GHO, across payments, savings, and digital commerce. Aave's involvement will extend to liquidity incentive campaigns, notably partnering with Astar, a significant blockchain player in Japan’s Web3 scene, with a dedicated 100 million ASTR allocation ($4 million) to boost adoption. Soneium already hosts a vibrant 7-million user ecosystem featuring prominent platforms like Uniswap v4, Velodrome, Stargate, and Lido, alongside native protocols Kyo Finance and SuperVol. Stani Kulechov, Aave Labs' founder, emphasized Sony’s global trust and Soneium’s consumer-centric approach as key advantages, aligning with Aave’s strategy of expanding accessibility and mainstream reach. Market Movements BTC: BTC trades below $110K as exchange reserves drop sharply, signaling strong accumulation amid significant short liquidations.

This would be necessary if Congress grants the CFTC expanded authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. “It is precedental that new jurisdiction comes with new resources,” Quintenz said in response to multiple senators’ questions. “So to the extent that new authorities come to the agency… I would anticipate that new resources would likely be needed.” Quintenz, currently head of global policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division (a16z crypto), previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021. If confirmed by the Senate, he would return to the CFTC at a moment of heightened interest in digital asset regulation and amid significant personnel turnover at the agency. Senate backs expanded resources for CFTC Lawmakers from both parties generally agreed with Quintenz’s assessment. While a few expressed reservations about President Trump’s approach to regulatory agencies, there was broad consensus that the CFTC would require a larger budget and staff to oversee an expanded crypto mandate effectively. “It is also essential that the CFTC have the institutional capacity, both in staffing and resources, to fulfill its mandate in the face of these emerging challenges,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) before asking for Quintenz’s take on resourcing. Quintenz responded that undertaking much of that responsibility would be a challenge. He added that the precedent has been to provide new resources alongside new authorities. The hearing took place as lawmakers continue to craft legislation that could hand the CFTC a central role in regulating crypto spot markets, currently in regulatory limbo between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other federal agencies. Quintenz set to lead alone as CFTC faces leadership exodus If confirmed, Quintenz may initially be the only commissioner at the CFTC. In recent weeks, all four remaining commissioners have either stepped down or announced their departures . Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger resigned to become CEO of the Blockchain Association, while Acting Chair Caroline Pham has indicated she will exit once Quintenz is confirmed. Democrats Kristin Johnson and Christy Goldsmith Romero departed or scheduled their exits. This leadership vacuum raises questions about the agency’s near-term capacity to function effectively, let alone take on new responsibilities in the fast-evolving crypto space. Quintenz, known for his pro-innovation stance during his previous CFTC tenure, has been a vocal advocate for clear regulation in the digital asset space. He has called for clearly defining the responsibilities of federal agencies in the crypto space and offering clear guidance to industry participants. His return to the CFTC, especially as the commission’s lone commissioner, could influence how the agency thinks about crypto rulemaking if Congress moves ahead with proposals to broaden the agency’s mandate. Trump’s larger fiscal plan, which includes deep cuts to government spending and essentially an omnibus bill of infrastructure and defense spending, has only complicated negotiations around the budget. While it is unclear if the CFTC will secure the resources it requires, the agency is prepared to step in potentially transformative ways in crypto regulation.

Lummis emphasizes that the policy has been tilted against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lummis said that the Bitcoin mining community is one of the hardest-hit groups due to the proposed provisions, which would endure potentially duplicative taxes and substantial compliance headaches. This interpretation follows Senator Lummis’ X post that says that America’s crypto tax laws disproportionately target Bitcoin and other digital assets. As a long-time advocate, she argued that the current tax laws are a “complete mess,” with the most problems manifested by Bitcoin. Bitcoin and digital assets are being unfairly targeted because of flawed tax rules. We need crypto revisions in reconciliation. — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 10, 2025 She said the cryptocurrency rules must be updated during the reconciliation process to curb that. Senator Lummis refers to the IRS’s crypto tax regulations as ‘bad tax regulations’ Senator Cynthia Lummis stated that Bitcoin and digital assets are wrongly singled out due to bad tax regulations. Though Lummis does not mention them by name, her remarks likely refer to the IRS’s crypto tax reporting rules, particularly those rolled out in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law took a wide view of “brokers,” placing miners and developers under the same category. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is also called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law widened the broker reporting rules in Sections 6045 and 6045A to cover digital assets. This wide-reaching categorization has faced criticism from miners and developers, who have voiced out their claims. According to them, they would be virtually unable to comply with these regulations. The rules force them to report information like names and transaction amounts in their tax filings — information they often do not even have access to. Lummis’ post called on Congress to try to make the rule change on a special amendment vehicle. The pro-Bitcoin senator calls for “crypto changes in reconciliation” to accelerate the amendment process. According to House rules, some tax or spending bills can be approved with a simple majority using reconciliation. Senator Lummis wants to use this method to change the definition of “broker” and bypass bipartisan gridlock. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970 despite regulatory uncertainties People are also worried that the flawed tax code carries the potential for double taxation in the case of miners and participants in decentralized finance (DeFi). This is because Miners get taxed on their block rewards and then again on capital gains when they sell what they own. At the same time, DeFi users could face several taxable events even if they have not made any profits. However, despite such regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970. Cryptocurrency markets are rebounding today, with the two highest performers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, posting positive gains following a weekend of largely sideways trading. US lawmakers are debating new crypto rules to solve this regulatory uncertainty that may profoundly reshape the industry. The GENIUS Act is on the verge of a cloture vote in Congress this week, with the CLARITY Act also moving forward.

""Circle IPO's clearly went very well. That's a reflection of investor interest in crypto, both institutions and retail. The financial future will be blockchain-based,"" Garlinghouse said at Apex. Garlinghouse said that one factor in the success of Circle's IPO is the market's fundamental belief that the GENIUS Act – the U.S. stablecoin legislation – will pass. As CoinDesk previously reported , the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulatory bill, is poised for imminent Senate passage with bipartisan support, potentially moving to the House and becoming law by August recess. ""Regulatory headwinds have now become tailwinds in the U.S., and that's good for the global landscape,"" Garlinghouse continued. ""It's not deregulation that we want, and we are asking for clear regulation, and progress is evident."" Other jurisdictions have also recently passed stablecoin legislation, such as Hong Kong . Korea's new administration is also said to be working on a stablecoin bill. Garlinghouse declined to comment on a potential Ripple-Circle merger or acquisition.

Toncoin Has Been Stuck Inside A Triangle On The Daily Timeframe In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that Toncoin has recently been moving inside. The pattern in question is a Triangle from technical analysis (TA), which forms when an asset’s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance in the future, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Triangles in TA. Three popular ones include the Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines relative to each other defines which type a particular triangular channel falls under. In an Ascending Triangle, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, its consolidation shrinks toward a net upside. The Descending Triangle involves just the opposite case; the upper line is sloped downward while the lower one is flat. The third variation, the Symmetrical Triangle, has its trendlines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In this pattern, the price’s range tightens to a point in a sideways manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Triangle pattern that Toncoin has seemingly been trapped within during the past few months: From the graph, it’s visible that the Triangle that the 1-day price of Toncoin has been following looks similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it’s not a perfect one; there is a slight bias to the downside. The cryptocurrency most recently found support at the lower line and has since climbed toward the midway point between the trendlines. The coin’s price is now not too far from the apex of the pattern. Generally, breakouts become more likely as consolidation becomes tighter, so it’s possible that TON may be approaching one. According to the analyst, a breakout, if it happens, could potentially end up leading to a 40% move for Toncoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative As for which direction a breakout might take the asset in, Symmetrical Triangles usually have both sides at equal probability. Since the Triangle in the current case is slightly angled down, however, an exit below the lower line may be a bit more likely. It now remains to be seen how Toncoin’s price will develop in the coming days and if the pattern will play any role. TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.3, up over 2% in the last seven days.

33767162,[object Object],1749607240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Cycle Performances Say Dogecoin Price Will Rally Above $2.28,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-will-rally-above-2-28/,"Dogecoin’s current trading range between $0.18 and $0.24 has largely mimicked the steady accumulation phases seen in past bull cycles. Although its price action appears muted on shorter timeframes, a technical analysis of broader market cycles shows that the meme coin may be nearing the end of its consolidation phase and entering the early stages of a breakout trajectory. Fibonacci Pattern Points To Bullish Continuation According to a recent post by crypto analyst Javon Marks on the social media platform X, Dogecoin’s price movements over the years reveal a highly consistent relationship with Fibonacci extension levels, especially the 1.618 level. Marks highlighted that in the two previous primary cycles, 2014 to 2017 (Cycle 1) and 2017 to 2021 (Cycle 2), Dogecoin exceeded the 1.618 Fibonacci extension measured from its respective accumulation bases in their bear market lows. In Cycle 1, DOGE went from a 0 Fibonacci level in the 2015 bear market low to a peak above the 1.618 Fibonacci level in 2018. This translated to a move from $0.00009 to $0.00748, representing an increase of more than 8,200% from its cycle low. Cycle 2 followed a similar structure, where the pattern of surpassing the 1.618 Fib level held true. DOGE initially consolidated around its 0 Fib baseline near $0.00168 throughout most of 2020 during a prolonged bear market. Then, in early 2021, the meme coin began to surge aggressively, first reclaiming the 1.0 extension level around $0.11773 and eventually moving beyond the 1.618 extension of $0.39921. This breakout culminated in Dogecoin reaching its current all-time high of approximately $0.7326 in May 2021, a 43,000% increase from its cycle low. Dogecoin’s Next Price Target As illustrated in the accompanying chart, the Fibonacci projection for the current Dogecoin cycle begins at the 2022 bear market low of $0.06036. This price point forms the zero baseline for what is now being tracked as Cycle 3. Keeping in mind Dogecoin’s cyclical behavior , this places the current 1.618 Fibonacci extension target at $2.28008 for the ongoing cycle. Notably, the 1.0 Fib extension level was already confirmed at $0.56953 following Dogecoin’s earlier all-time high. Reaching this price target would translate to a 3670% increase from the current price level, but Dogecoin could repeat what happened in Cycle 2 and even exceed the 1.618 Fib level. Notably, each breakout not only exceeded the Fibonacci level but also reset the base for the next macro cycle. Therefore, a successful move above $2.28 would complete the third full cycle and lay the groundwork for DOGE’s long-term valuation above the $1 threshold even in the next bear market. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1912, up by 5.5% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Fibonacci Extension Levels|Javon Marks|meme coin,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-11 02:00:40

While there are hundreds of options, few coins combine practical use, reliable performance, and smart pricing. With 2025 at its halfway mark, timing is key for anyone eyeing solid gains. BlockDAG is showing unmatched traction with its low price and high user base. FET is building real AI applications. BNB remains central to the Binance ecosystem, and ADA continues to push academic innovation. These four picks bring something unique to the table and are considered solid picks for anyone mapping their crypto strategy. 1. BlockDAG: Real Adoption with 1.5M Daily Users BlockDAG stands out as a top crypto to watch this year. It has already raised over $293 million and sold more than 22.2 billion coins. The price is currently frozen at $0.0018 until June 13. With a $0.05 launch price, this reflects a possible gain of 2,678%. Even early participants have seen profits of 2,520% since Batch 1 at $0.001. The platform’s X1 Miner app is driving mass usage with over 1.5 million daily users mining coins directly on mobile. The app has simple features like streak rewards, zero gas fees, and a referral program that appeals to new users. BlockDAG also supports low-code smart contracts and is fully EVM-compatible, helping developers get involved faster. It passed audits from both Halborn and CertiK, boosting trust. High-profile tie-ups, including one with Inter Milan and hints at an NBA deal, add to its credibility. While some experts note the governance model is still evolving, the metrics point to long-term value. With the GO LIVE reveal happening on June 13, BlockDAG offers strong fundamentals and market attention, placing it firmly among the top cryptos to watch now. 2. Fetch.ai: Building AI for the Real World Fetch.ai (FET) blends AI and blockchain to simplify real-world operations in areas like logistics and IoT. It allows users to set up agents that handle tasks like autonomous payments and data sharing. Businesses are beginning to explore it for reducing system inefficiencies. Its rise in 2025 coincides with a wider shift toward AI-backed crypto solutions. FET’s edge lies in its functioning use cases, unlike many theoretical AI coins. It remains budget-friendly, making it one of the top cryptos to watch for practical automation. With more developers joining the platform and solid real-world tests, it positions itself for future growth. 3. BNB: Central Role in a Massive Ecosystem BNB stays relevant through its deep integration in Binance’s services. It’s used for discounts, staking, and across the Binance Smart Chain’s expanding DeFi world. BNB’s consistent on-chain usage keeps it in the spotlight. The scheduled token burns decrease supply, increasing long-term value. Despite global regulatory challenges, Binance’s wide reach ensures BNB demand holds firm. It’s accepted on multiple platforms outside Binance as well. BNB remains a top crypto to watch for those who want steady growth in a high-utility asset. Though not the highest gainer, it’s a dependable option. 4. Cardano: Steady Growth from Research-Based Development Cardano (ADA) has always followed a deliberate, research-heavy path. Instead of fast launches, it focuses on peer-reviewed improvements and secure infrastructure. This has gained attention from developers looking for long-term platforms. In 2025, ADA is seeing more use cases, especially in smart contracts and digital identity. Its DeFi ecosystem is also expanding slowly but surely. Staking allows users to earn while helping the network. For those looking for a top crypto to watch that emphasizes slow but solid growth, ADA is a reliable option with a forward-thinking roadmap. The Bottom Line Identifying the top crypto to watch involves finding real usage, growth potential, and smart timing. BlockDAG stands out with a $0.0018 price until June 13, over 22.2 billion coins sold, and its June 13 GO LIVE reveal nearing. FET brings proven AI integration into blockchain, while BNB thrives on Binance utility. ADA stays the course with a methodical approach to blockchain advancement. Each of these coins offers something valuable. Depending on your approach, one may align better than the others. But BDAG definitely deserves a spot on your radar in 2025 for its consistent growth and ROI potential.

Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy with a $17.9M Presale Surge,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-out-on-bitcoin-cash-qubetics-is-the-popular-crypto-coin-to-buy-with-a-17-9m-presale-surge/,"In the final quarter of 2017, as the crypto market entered one of its most explosive growth phases, Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) stood out as a high-potential fork of Bitcoin—engineered to deliver faster, more cost-effective transactions. Launched in August 2017 at around $240, $BCH rapidly gained traction and soared to an all-time high of over $4,000 by December, generating more than 1,500% gains in just a few months. For early adopters, it was a defining moment. But for most, the opportunity vanished almost as quickly as it appeared. Today, with similar early-stage momentum and real-world utility, Qubetics ($TICS) is positioning itself as one of the top altcoins to buy, offering a compelling entry point before wider market adoption. Those who hesitated or dismissed it as another altcoin missed a chance to secure triple-digit gains. Today, $BCH trades around $460, a fraction of its all-time high—but still respected as a foundational player in the decentralized payments space. While Bitcoin Cash maintains relevance, it’s no longer viewed as the breakthrough it once was. Its growth has stabilised, its hype subdued. And in a market that rewards innovation and momentum, backers are asking—what’s the next major leap? Qubetics might just be the answer. With its unique decentralized VPN utility, a lean supply strategy, and over $17.9 million raised so far in its crypto presale, Qubetics has swiftly positioned itself as the most popular crypto coin to buy in 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): Reducing Risks of Censorship With Decentralized VPN With governments tightening internet surveillance and traditional VPNs raising privacy concerns, Qubetics came up with a decentralized VPN powered by blockchain infrastructure. It’s a smart, forward-thinking use of crypto tech—giving users control over their digital privacy in a way centralised providers simply can’t match. A decentralized VPN allows individuals and organizations to route internet traffic across a global network of nodes, reducing risks of censorship, tracking, or data harvesting. It’s not just a tool for privacy junkies. Freelancers working across borders, NGOs operating in restricted environments, financial firms protecting sensitive communication—Qubetics offers them all a more secure path online. For developers, there’s an opportunity to plug into the protocol and create privacy-enhancing apps, all while earning $TICS tokens as network contributors. And that’s only one layer of Qubetics’ appeal. The token is powering into its final public crypto presale stage, offering buyers a unique combination of timing, scarcity, and real-world utility. The crypto presale—currently in Stage 37—has already sold over 515 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,800 holders, raising upwards of $17.9 million. At $0.3370 per token, there’s a built-in 20% upside when $TICS lists at $0.40. But analysts are looking much further ahead, estimating price levels of $5 to $15 once the mainnet launches and demand surges. This isn’t a speculative meme coin built on social media hype. Qubetics is rolling out use cases with teeth. The protocol is also structured to solve real cross-border payment inefficiencies, enabling faster, cheaper asset transfers without relying on third-party intermediaries. The total supply of Qubetics was recently slashed from 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, turning $TICS into one of the leanest upcoming tokens. With 38.55% of the supply now flowing into the hands of the community, decentralisation isn’t just a buzzword—it’s embedded into the DNA of the project. An $18,000 buy-in at this stage could yield staggering returns if $TICS follows the price arc analysts foresee. At $1, that’s $53,412. At $5, it’s over $267,000. And if it hits $15 after the mainnet launch? That initial capital could swell beyond $800,000. All of this helps explain why crypto enthusiasts are calling Qubetics one of the most popular crypto coins to buy right now. Bitcoin Cash ($BCH): A Veteran Player with Slower Momentum Bitcoin Cash was born from a desire to make transactions faster and cheaper than its parent, Bitcoin. And in that respect, it delivered. Over the years, $BCH carved out a dedicated user base and continues to serve as a viable payment-focused cryptocurrency with lower fees and quicker confirmation times. However, innovation has slowed. While BCH is widely accepted on some crypto-friendly platforms and remains popular in parts of Asia and Latin America, it’s not breaking new ground in terms of tech or utility. DeFi integrations are limited. NFT support is minimal. And aside from incremental protocol upgrades, $BCH isn’t making the kind of waves it did in its early days. What’s more, the crypto landscape has changed. Backers are no longer drawn only to store-of-value coins. They’re seeking tokens with purpose—those that solve actual problems, not just theoretical ones. And in that space, Bitcoin Cash is feeling the pressure. Still, $BCH remains a household name in crypto, and for risk-averse buyers, it may provide stable if unspectacular upside. It trades at around $460 with a market cap in the billions—reassuring to some, but lacking the explosive upside potential of younger tokens in active presales. As for price outlooks, $BCH could benefit from a general market recovery, but few analysts expect it to 10x or 20x from current levels without a major network overhaul or renewed hype cycle. That’s where Qubetics gains an edge. It offers the one thing $BCH can’t replicate anymore—early-stage entry into a utility-driven ecosystem backed by a scarcity-based token model. Conclusion – Which One Is The Popular Coin to Buy Now? Bitcoin Cash was one of the most popular crypto coins to buy during its launch window. Those who took the leap reaped massive gains. But that opportunity has largely passed. Today, it serves as a steady, familiar option—but not the kind of high-growth asset that backers are hunting in 2025. Qubetics fills that gap. With its decentralized VPN use case, real-world payments utility, and sharply limited supply, it isn’t trying to replicate old models—it’s building something new. Its crypto presale momentum, coupled with analysts’ price targets ranging from $5 to $15, is why $TICS is climbing the ranks among the most popular crypto coins to buy right now. For anyone still regretting missing out on the BCH breakout years ago, Qubetics might be the second chance that rarely comes twice in a lifetime.

Most meme coins don’t compare to Neo Pepe in part because of its big symbolic influence. On the other hand, Neo Pepe is about removing central control, financial freedom, and saying no to monopoly and overcrowding in the market. Investors tired of unpredictable tokens and wild market changes consider the 2025 release of Neo Pepe to be a welcome update in the Bitcoin industry. Neo Pepe greatly raises the level of involvement in the crypto world By using advanced technologies and traditional symbols. Without further ado, let take a look at the exciting features of Neo Pepe/ Be Sure to Grab This Unique Chance Because of its creative designs and unique money system, Neo Pepe becomes the top choice among memecoin presales. Moreover, people who want to support important and notable projects are now interested in the way cryptocurrencies promote decentralization. Many people think Neo Pepe marks a stand against anyone or anything that tries to control the cryptocurrency market tactics. With such an exciting storyline, investors are excited and hurry to purchase the tokens before anyone else gets them. They not only work with a new crypto project but also enjoy benefits of more favorable pricing. Tokenomics will play a major role in disrupting the entire crypto industry You can purchase Neo Pepe in the 16-phase presale which runs from $0.05 at the beginning to $0.16 at the end. The total goal is to raise up to $50 million. Users can get access to tokens every hour after the sale, supporting the market’s constant activity. One thing that makes it stable is a 2.5% automatic addition of liquidity to each transaction and the immediate burning of LP tokens, which supports long-term growth in values. Allocation Percentage (%) Purpose Presale 45% Community-driven token launch Marketing 25% Promotion, Partnerships, Outreach Development 10% Project Growth, Upgrades, Security Liquidity 10% Exchange Liquidity & Initiatives Ecosystem 5% Community Incentives & Initiatives Giveaways 5% Rewards, Events, Engagement The governance mechanism developed by Neo Pepe is also very impressive and anyone who holds tokens in CoinEx has the right to decide key decisions, such as important changes in listed exchanges, helping investors to guide the project.

With a strong focus on real decentralization, Neo Pepe hands control of the digital currency to its users. They actually carry it out, as the smooth handling of resources makes the business feel unique and fresh.

Earn a fixed base rate plus additional returns based on market movements. Expected APY: 6-31%. ● Fixed Products : Lock in assets for durations ranging from 7 to 180 days. Select products offer yields up to an impressive 100% APY, though they require time-bound commitment and may have allocation limits. These strategies reward users who take the time to understand their mechanics, and in a flat market, they can deliver meaningful performance. Why HTX Earn? ● Better Yields : HTX consistently offers 1-2% higher APY than the industry average on stablecoins and PoS assets, significantly amplifying your long-term compound gains. ● Product Stability : HTX Earn products have demonstrated stable performance over recent months with no disruptions or negative incidents.

Lightchain AI is rapidly taking front stage with over $18.5 million raised during its presale at a price of $0.007 for its creative mix of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. Lightchain AI’s special and powerful value proposition sets it apart from rivals as the bitcoin market changes constantly and guides towards remarkable development. This ambitious project has attracted the attention of investors looking for significant financial returns in the near future since it can outperform the outstanding performance of generally known meme coins. Community Power behind Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Among the finest models of the features of community-driven cryptocurrencies are Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The community of Dogecoin, one of the most well-known for its humor and kindness, is behind several Halloween costume fundraisers and similar charitable events: the first was a successful campaign in 2014 for the Jamaican bobsled team at the Winter Olympics while the others were for the NASCAR driver Josh Wise, on this occasion they used ” Dun only good everyday”. This kind of community approach completely shows the idea that deliberate actions are the only means to make everything better. Shiba Inu’s Shib Army, the community of the Shiba Inu coin, is seeing as a spirit that goes against the fact that ‘it started as a meme’, and is, thus, a founder of a totally digital island comprising projects like ShibaSwap and NFTs. In a similar vein, both communities are using social media channels to grow their operations, compile users, and create trends across the market, so underlining the great relevance of a total involvement— literally—in the cryptocurrency scene. Lightchain AI – Transforming Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence By deftly combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to solve practical problems, lightchain AI is transforming sectors. Lightchain AI, unlike meme coins like DOGE or SHIB, emphasizes utility, allowing real-time data processing and intelligent decision-making for uses including predictive analytics and supply chain optimization. Built on a scalable and strong blockchain infrastructure, Lightchain AI is the perfect fit for companies looking for dependable, high-performance tools since it is meant to efficiently manage intricate AI-driven operations. Lightchain AI has attracted investor confidence and set itself for quick global adoption and expansion having raised an amazing $18.5 million during its presale at $0.007 per token. Embedding artificial intelligence into distributed systems is guiding a daring future for blockchain innovation. Future? All About Utility While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin brought the entertainment, Lightchain AI is here to revolutionize the game. Ignore the hype; blockchain meets actual innovation here. Lightchain AI is redefining what is feasible with blazing scalability, flawless AI integration, and a strong emphasis on useful applications. This is the jaw-dropper; 15,000% of increase is possible. That’s correct; this is a revolutionary platform designed for great disturbance and actual utility, not just another bitcoin. This is your chance to enter something really revolutionary if you’re an investor searching for the next great thing. Still, that’s not all—something major is under progress. Offering creators the best venue to design, launch, and monetize meme-based projects like never before, the Memecoin Launchpad is drawing attention.

Speaking in a video posted June 9, the analyst described the current Ethereum setup across multiple timeframes as “something we’ve never seen before,” drawing comparisons to historical signals that preceded major rallies in 2016, 2018, and 2020. Ethereum Primed For Macro Breakout Kevin emphasized that Ethereum now exhibits strong bullish momentum across its USD pair, dominance chart, and ETH/BTC ratio, pointing to a simultaneous alignment of several high-time frame indicators. “These are things that just don’t pop up every day,” he said. “Matter of fact, these are things that have almost never popped up in such confluence throughout history for Ethereum.” The core of Kevin’s thesis hinges on what he calls a “monthly demand candle”—a large, typically green candlestick that emerges after a protracted correction. Ethereum printed such a candle in May 2025 following nearly a year of sideways chop and five months of drawdown. Historically, these demand candles have marked the start of significant uptrends. Kevin cited analogous structures in 2016, 2018, and during the COVID-19 crash in 2020, all of which preceded multi-month rallies. “This may be the most textbook demand candle we’ve ever had,” he noted, adding that “the last time we saw something like this was before ETH ran for nearly a year with barely any major correction.” Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Supporting the candle analysis is a synchronized bullish turn in several technical indicators. The Market Cipher momentum wave has clipped into the oversold zone and printed a confirmed green dot buy signal. Simultaneously, the VWAP—volume-weighted average price—has crossed above the zero line, and money flow has started to trend upward. Kevin was explicit about the importance of this configuration: “Let me tell you something: this is a big deal.” The monthly RSI, currently sitting at 51, has not yet broken the crucial 70-level that historically marks the onset of parabolic price action. According to Kevin, “ETH has never even broken 70 this cycle. You haven’t seen what’s possible yet for Ethereum—or for altcoins in general. You’ve seen nothing yet.” He also highlighted the return of whale accumulation, measured through a proprietary “whale money flow” indicator. After exiting ETH positions for over a year—from March 2024 to May 2025—whale flows have shown a V-shaped bottom and are now turning up. “We are now starting to see accumulation durably here,” Kevin said. “You keep hearing that BlackRock’s buying ETH, and I don’t know if that’s reflected in this indicator, but we are definitely seeing whale activity occur on the monthly time frame.” The analyst went further, showing that Ethereum’s stock RSI on the monthly timeframe has not only bottomed out but is now rebounding sharply—a pattern that historically precedes long-duration uptrends. “This is aggressive movement,” he explained, noting that for confirmation, the RSI still needs to cross the 20-level, but emphasized that the current shape of the rebound is stronger than in previous cycles. Ethereum Shows Relative Strength Another key piece of the puzzle is Ethereum’s dominance chart, which tracks ETH’s market cap relative to the rest of the crypto space excluding Bitcoin. Kevin pointed to a potential double bottom on the monthly chart and a newly confirmed MACD momentum shift, the first in over two years. “That’s two years and one month of downtrend finally reversing,” he said. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Finally, the ETH/BTC pair is showing a near-identical structure to Ethereum’s dominance chart. Kevin believes this confluence is key. “Look at that—wow, that’s funny—it looks the same. You find your major low right where you found it in 2020. The monthly indicators are all curling up.” Still, he remained measured in his optimism, noting that macroeconomic conditions—particularly monetary policy—remain essential for confirming the bullish case. “It’s going to take some monetary policy shifting. We still need inflation to come in line. But the market is living four to six months ahead. If the market starts to sniff out that easing is coming, we’ll see that reflected in asset prices before it happens.” Referencing cycle theory and historical post-halving performance, Kevin argued that ETH’s recent relative strength fits both narratives. “Typically, ETH and altcoins start to outperform Bitcoin in the post-halving year. We’re halfway through that window—and it looks like it’s finally starting.” Looking ahead, he sees Ethereum as the “major key” that unlocks broad altcoin outperformance. “ETH opens the door to soaking up market cap, which will then leak down into mid-caps and small-caps. Everything starts with ETH.” While reiterating that patience is crucial, Kevin concluded with conviction: “The monthly timeframe indicators have never been more historically on our side. I think we’re on the verge of something really big.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,739.

According to James Seyffart, these three classes currently have a 90% likelihood of receiving FDA approval in 2025, according to their updated prediction. The applications for these ETFs have already been submitted by big companies involving Grayscale, Bitwise, Hashdex, Franklin, and VanEck. These filings recently became officially recognized by the SEC and final decision dates are now set between mid-2025 and end of 2025. I wrote about this topic a bit today as well. Can be read at this link here if you're a Bloomberg Terminal Client: https://t.co/Tl3XfNq2Am pic.twitter.com/jAQ048Ewdr — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 10, 2025 However, XRP isn’t too far behind, with analysts giving it an 85% chance of approval in 2025. Dogecoin follows with an 80% probability, while other assets such as Cardano, Polkadot, HBAR, and Avalanche are estimated to have a 75% chance of getting the green light. Newer assets like Sui are rated a 60% chance and that Tron’s ETF filing is unlikely to be looked at until 2026. Bloomberg’s analysts calculated the odds by analyzing the past acknowledgment of applications by the SEC, the actual deadlines the firm has to make a final decision and on the odds of those cryptos being considered commodities, which could facilitate the approving process. Is Solana Leading the Race? The U.S.SEC could green-light ETFs following broad crypto indexes already next month. And among the individual cryptocurrencies, Solana seems to be setting the pace. Analysts say Solana could be the next big asset to have a spot ETF, trailing Bitcoin and Ethereum. The update arrives as seven issuers have already submitted applications for spot Solana ETFs. Regulators could also step in early on Solana and staking-based ETF filings, the report adds. This has been spurred on in part by Rex-Osprey’s recent pivot to create workarounds to the legal restrictions, through which the issuer has launched staking products for Solana and Ethereum. “Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way,” Eric Balchunas wrote.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|LTC|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-11 03:04:39

The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the company recently submitted paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission. By using the confidential filing route, Bullish can move ahead with its IPO preparations without immediately disclosing its financial details, a strategy that has become popular among high-profile startups testing market waters. This marks Bullish’s second attempt at going public. The exchange previously sought a listing through a special purpose acquisition company in 2021, but the deal collapsed in 2022 after a steep decline in tech valuations and rising US interest rates. Jefferies has been tapped as lead underwriter for the offering. Bullish didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Peter Thiel-backed crypto group Bullish files for Wall Street IPO https://t.co/pr22AlV4FQ — FT Markets (@FTMarkets) June 11, 2025 Bullish Eyes Wall Street As Trump Era Revives Crypto Optimism Bullish’s renewed IPO push comes as the US crypto market shows fresh signs of life. Since Donald Trump returned to office, his administration has taken a markedly more supportive stance on digital assets, rolling back restrictions imposed under President Joe Biden. Trump has spoken favorably of Bitcoin in recent months, even after previously calling it a scam. His family has leaned into crypto too, with sons Donald Jr and Eric recently voicing support at a blockchain conference in Las Vegas. Crypto Exchanges Capitalize on Renewed Enthusiasm and Policy Shifts Bitcoin prices have surged past the US$100,000 mark, fueling a rush of capital into crypto-related listings. Last week, stablecoin issuer Circle raised $1.1b in its IPO and soared 168 percent on debut, delivering the strongest first-day gain for a billion-dollar US listing, according to Renaissance Capital. Buoyed by that momentum, Gemini, the exchange run by the Winklevoss twins, also filed confidentially for a US IPO last Friday. Both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been vocal backers of Trump’s re-election efforts and support crypto-friendly policymaking. Bullish positions itself as a blockchain-native exchange offering deep liquidity and tight spreads. CEO Tom Farley, a veteran of traditional finance, previously served as president of the NYSE Group. With Farley at the helm and Thiel’s backing, the firm now hopes to ride the wave of political support and investor optimism to a successful Wall Street listing. The move signals a broader shift in the crypto landscape, as once-skeptical regulators and investors show new openness to integrating digital assets into mainstream finance.

This isn’t just about monetary policy; it’s about international relations, economic strategy, and the intricate dance between nations regarding currency valuations. For anyone tracking macroeconomic trends, including those in the cryptocurrency space who understand how global liquidity and policy shifts impact asset prices, the SNB’s recent stance on FX intervention is a crucial watch point. Understanding SNB FX Intervention and its Purpose The SNB has historically been quite active in the foreign exchange market. Their primary tool? Buying or selling foreign currencies, predominantly euros and dollars, to influence the value of the Swiss Franc (CHF) . The main goal of this intervention is usually to prevent excessive appreciation of the Franc. Why would a central bank want a weaker currency? Here are a few key reasons: Export Competitiveness: A weaker Franc makes Swiss goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting exports, which are vital for the Swiss economy. Inflation Targeting: Currency strength can impact import prices and overall inflation levels. Deflation Prevention: In times of low inflation or deflation risk, a stronger currency can exacerbate these pressures by making imports cheaper. Economic Stability: Managing currency strength is seen as a way to maintain overall economic stability and support growth. For years, the SNB has been a prominent player in this space, accumulating a large balance sheet of foreign currency reserves as a result of its intervention efforts to keep the Swiss Franc from strengthening too much. What is the US Treasury Watch List and Why Does it Matter? The US Treasury watch list is part of a semi-annual report to Congress that identifies countries engaging in currency practices that could potentially harm US economic interests. Being placed on this list doesn’t automatically mean a country is labeled a currency manipulator, but it signals that the US Treasury is closely monitoring its actions. The criteria the US Treasury uses typically involve three main points: A significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States. A material current account surplus. Persistent, one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market. Switzerland has appeared on this list because it often meets the first two criteria and has historically engaged in substantial FX intervention . While being on the watch list doesn’t trigger immediate penalties, it increases scrutiny and can lead to further analysis and potential consultations. Avoiding the more serious designation of ‘currency manipulator’ is a clear objective for countries on the list, as that could potentially lead to punitive measures or trade restrictions. The Crucial Shift: SNB Pauses Interventions Amidst Scrutiny In light of being on the US Treasury watch list , the SNB has made a notable adjustment to its policy regarding FX intervention . Instead of actively selling Francs (buying foreign currency) to weaken the currency, the bank has indicated it is refraining from such interventions. This marks a significant pivot from its previous, more interventionist stance. This strategic change is largely seen as a direct response to the pressure and scrutiny from the United States. By stepping back from large-scale currency purchases, the SNB aims to avoid meeting the criteria for persistent, one-sided intervention, thereby reducing the risk of being labeled a currency manipulation country. This decision isn’t just technical; it’s a major policy signal. It suggests that external diplomatic and economic pressures are influencing the SNB’s operational toolkit, at least for the time being. The priority appears to be navigating the complex international landscape and maintaining good economic relations, particularly with a major trading partner like the United States. How Does This Impact the Swiss Franc (CHF)? When a central bank steps away from actively weakening its currency through FX intervention , the natural forces of the market tend to take over more prominently. For the Swiss Franc , which is often seen as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty, this typically means potential for appreciation. Without the SNB acting as a consistent buyer of foreign currency (seller of CHF), demand for the Franc relative to other currencies could push its value higher. This can have several effects: Stronger CHF/USD and CHF/EUR pairs: The Franc may gain ground against the US Dollar and the Euro. Impact on Swiss Exports: A stronger Franc makes Swiss exports more expensive abroad, potentially challenging export-oriented industries. Impact on Imports: Conversely, a stronger Franc makes imports cheaper, which can help dampen inflation. Safe-Haven Flows: In times of market stress, the CHF might see even stronger inflows without SNB resistance. Market participants are now closely watching the Swiss Franc ‘s movements, aware that the SNB’s ‘hand’ is less visible in the market than it used to be. The currency’s value will likely be more determined by interest rate differentials, global risk sentiment, and other macroeconomic factors. Broader Implications: Currency Manipulation and Global Markets The situation with the SNB and the US Treasury watch list highlights the ongoing tensions and debates surrounding currency valuations in the global economy. While countries have sovereign rights to manage their monetary policy, their actions can have significant spillover effects on other nations, particularly through trade competitiveness. This scenario serves as a reminder that: Currency Policy is Interconnected: One country’s currency management impacts others. Trade and Currency are Linked: Trade imbalances often fuel discussions about currency valuation. Political Factors Influence Central Banks: External political and diplomatic considerations can influence central bank decisions, even for independent institutions like the SNB. For investors and traders, including those in the cryptocurrency space, these developments are relevant because they speak to broader shifts in global liquidity, trade flows, and risk dynamics. Changes in major currency pairs like CHF/USD or CHF/EUR can influence capital movements and market sentiment more broadly. Benefits and Challenges of the SNB’s Policy Shift This change in approach comes with its own set of pros and cons for Switzerland: Benefits: Reduced risk of US designation as a currency manipulation country, avoiding potential trade repercussions or diplomatic strain. Increased credibility regarding adherence to international norms on currency practices. Allows market forces to play a larger role in determining the Swiss Franc ‘s value. Challenges: Loss of a key tool for managing the strength of the Swiss Franc . Potential for significant CHF appreciation, which could negatively impact export-oriented industries and economic growth. Less control over imported inflation dynamics. Increased reliance on interest rates as the primary monetary policy tool. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers Given the SNB’s altered stance, what should market participants, especially those following global macro trends, keep in mind? Monitor CHF Crosses: Pay close attention to how the Swiss Franc trades against major currencies like the USD and EUR. Look for signs of sustained appreciation. Watch SNB Communication: While they’ve paused intervention, the SNB’s forward guidance and economic outlook statements remain critical for understanding their policy intentions. Assess Safe-Haven Demand: The CHF’s role as a safe haven might become more pronounced without intervention dampening its rise during risk-off periods. Consider Macro Impact: Understand that a stronger CHF can have implications for global capital flows and the competitiveness of European economies, which can indirectly affect broader market sentiment and asset valuations, including in crypto. This situation underscores the importance of staying informed about central bank actions and international economic policy, as they form the backdrop against which all financial markets operate. Conclusion: A Strategic Pause Under Pressure The Swiss National Bank ‘s decision to step back from active FX intervention is a direct consequence of being placed on the US Treasury watch list . This strategic pause highlights the influence of international pressure on domestic monetary policy decisions. While it helps Switzerland avoid potential accusations of currency manipulation and maintains diplomatic relations, it also means the SNB loses a significant tool for managing the strength of the Swiss Franc . This shift is poised to allow market forces greater sway over the CHF’s value, with potential implications for Swiss exports and the broader currency landscape. It’s a clear example of how global economic interdependence and diplomatic considerations shape the actions of even the most independent central banks.
