MNT and GT underperformed due to inflation risk and weak bullish momentum. Liquidity, supply metrics, and sentiment drove divergence in exchange token returns. A sharp divergence has emerged in the exchange token sector over the past two months, highlighting a market that is increasingly rewarding utility and sound tokenomics while punishing perceived risks. An analysis of five prominent exchange tokens shows that while Binance Coin (BNB), Bitget Token (BGB), and OKX’s OKB posted respectable gains, Bybit’s Mantle (MNT) and GateToken (GT) trailed with significant losses.

As Arbitrum Spikes and Theta Taps AI Expansion,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-most-potential-crypto-of-2025-as-arbitrum-spikes-and-theta-taps-ai-expansion/,"The crypto world in 2025 is no longer dominated by hype alone—utility and real-world use cases are now setting the pace. With thousands of tokens competing for attention, only a select few are being recognized as the most potential crypto contenders. These aren’t just speculative assets—they are solving actual problems in industries like finance, data infrastructure, and digital ownership. Among the projects gaining traction, Qubetics has entered the spotlight for its bold push into real world asset tokenization. Meanwhile, heavyweights like Arbitrum and Theta are also innovating in ways that reinforce their positions among the most potential crypto networks to watch this year. For participants and developers alike, recognizing the most potential crypto early can define long-term success. In 2025, the projects combining tangible utility with scalable ecosystems are likely to lead the next wave. Qubetics ($TICS) Is Redefining the RWA Narrative—The Countdown Is On Qubetics isn’t just riding the tokenization wave—it’s shaping it. The protocol is launching a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that simplifies access for enterprises, entrepreneurs, and professionals. This isn’t just another DeFi platform; it’s a robust, user-friendly gateway to tokenize assets ranging from real estate to intellectual property. At the heart of Qubetics’ design is a massive shift in tokenomics. By slashing its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, the protocol has introduced scarcity from the start. The public sale allocation has increased to 38.55%, placing power directly in the hands of its user base. This move toward decentralization comes with significant implications for governance and long-term value. As of June 2025: Presale Stage: 37th Tokens Sold: 515 million+ Holders: 27,800+ Funds Raised: $17.9 million+ Current Price: $0.3370 Next Price Jump: $0.40 (20% hike) Recent community updates hint at a Tier 1 CEX listing by Q3 and a mainnet rollout by early Q4. Analysts from BlockForge Labs highlight $TICS among the most potential crypto assets of the year, citing its community-led model, aggressive burn mechanism, and enterprise-focused features. What truly sets Qubetics apart is its solution-driven framework. Many of its predecessors failed to simplify tokenization for real-world use cases. In contrast, Qubetics enables asset-backed digital ownership, wrapped in a legally compliant and cross-chain compatible system. In a digital era where tangible value is becoming harder to secure, Qubetics makes RWA tokenization accessible—and that’s not just innovation, it’s necessity. Investment Scenario: What a $10,000 Entry Looks Like in Qubetics’ Final Presale Stage Let’s say you’re entering Qubetics with a $10,000 buy-in during stage 37 at the current price of $0.3370. That gets you approximately 29,672 $TICS tokens before the listing price increases to $0.40. With only 10 million tokens left and a fast-closing window, timing is critical. At listing, those tokens will be worth $11,869, giving you a solid 18.7% gain right out of the gate. Looking further ahead, if $TICS reaches $5, that same $10K entry would turn into $148,360—a 1,383% return fueled by Qubetics’ unique tokenomics, reduced supply model (now just 1.36 billion total tokens), and increased community control through its 38.55% public allocation. If the token surges to $10 in the next bull run, your $10,000 becomes $296,720—a 2,867% ROI. For anyone looking to make a strategic move with limited capital, this might be the single strongest presale opportunity currently live in 2025. Arbitrum (ARB) Soars 7.47% in 24 Hours, Volume Spikes Over 84% Arbitrum (ARB), currently ranked #50 among cryptocurrencies, surged 7.47% in the last 24 hours to trade at $0.3645, pushing its market cap to $1.77 billion—up 7.44% on the day. Trading volume skyrocketed 84.05% to $169.52 million, giving it a high 9.56% volume-to-market cap ratio. With a circulating supply of 4.86 billion ARB out of a 10 billion total supply, the project shows significant market activity despite being 84.79% below its all-time high of $2.40 recorded in January 2024. Arbitrum, which has a profile score of 66% and UCID 11841, is supported by verified contracts (0x912C…9E6548), explorers like arbiscan.io, and various wallets. Notably, ARB is up 48.79% from its all-time low of $0.245, reached just two months ago in April 2025. Theta Network (THETA) Climbs 6.21% in Daily Rally, Market Cap Hits $789M Theta Network (THETA), ranked #88 in the global crypto market, surged 6.21% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7896, bringing its market cap to $789.63 million with a matching fully diluted valuation. The 24-hour trading volume rose 41.76% to $23.37 million, resulting in a 2.97% volume-to-market cap ratio. With its entire 1 billion THETA supply already in circulation, the token maintains a profile score of 72% and is backed by explorers like explorer.thetatoken.org, multiple wallets, and a UCID of 2416. Despite trading 95.03% below its all-time high of $15.90 from April 2021, THETA has seen a remarkable 1,886.99% gain since its all-time low of $0.03977 in March 2020. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: The Future is Tangible Real World Asset Tokenization is becoming more than a buzzword. It is transforming how value is represented, owned, and traded across the digital economy. Qubetics is at the forefront of this shift, bringing practicality to a concept that once seemed too complex for mainstream adoption. Key components of Qubetics’ RWA Marketplace: Tokenization Simplicity : Businesses can tokenize assets in minutes using an intuitive UI. Legal Framework : Built-in compliance tools for KYC/AML and regional regulation adherence. Interoperability : Supports Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Revenue Distribution : Token holders earn from marketplace fees and asset-based revenues. Enterprise Use Cases : Real estate, patents, music rights, logistics, and supply chain assets. This model provides an entry point into Web3 for those traditionally excluded due to complexity or legal constraints. With the crypto presale nearing its final moments, Qubetics stands as a living example of the most potential crypto transforming digital finance. Conclusion: Why Timing and Utility Matter More Than Hype in 2025 The surge in crypto adoption is no longer driven by promises—it’s driven by solutions. Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Theta each offer a unique approach to solving real-world problems using blockchain. But among them, Qubetics commands immediate attention. With scarcity building, functionality maturing, and a crypto presale window rapidly closing, the opportunity is real. For those tracking the most potential crypto projects in 2025, this is not the time to stay passive. Qubetics represents a rare alignment of innovation, timing, and traction—making it a standout among the most potential crypto players right now. As the final crypto presale stage winds down, it could become one of the most potential crypto success stories of this market cycle.

Per a report from Forbes Russia , the ministry says its proposal is currently undergoing interdepartmental review. However, if the plans are adopted as-is, Russian law agencies and courts will be given the power to seize crypto from illegal miners. Russia: Miners May Be Fined for Flaunting Bans Under the new proposal, Russian judges will also be able to punish individuals engaging in illegal mining. Courts will be able to hand out fines worth between 100,000 to 200,000 rubles ($1,272 to $2,544). Maksut Shadayev, the Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, speaking at the Federation Council earlier this year. (Source: Federation Council/VK/Screenshot) Forbes Russia says it has seen the ministry’s proposal. It says Moscow also wants to fine and confiscate crypto from any individual found illegally participating in a mining pool. Harsher fines still lie in store for solo entrepreneurs and officials. This group will have to pay between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($2,544 to $5088) if convicted. Authorities will also gain the power to take coins from industrial miners who flaunt crypto mining rules. The new rules will let courts impose a fine of 1 million ($12,728) to 2 million rubles ($25,456) on corporations involved in illegal mining. The ministry wants to amend the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses, seeking to effectively make illegal mining a criminal offense. BTC hashrate distribution amongst the largest known mining pools over the past four days. (Source: Blockchain.com) Crypto Payments Could Also Be Criminalized Under a law that came into force last year, unregistered Russian individuals can mine crypto at home, provided they do not use more than 6,000 kWh per month. However, in some 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions, mining restrictions apply. The law also states that people with unexpunged convictions for economic crimes, or those convicted of extremist or terrorist crimes, cannot mine crypto. The law also bans certain electricity and grid management firms from mining crypto. Additionally, the ministry plans to punish individuals and firms for making settlements in crypto in Russia outside the Central Bank-run crypto sandbox. The ministry’s proposals include plans to fine people and firms who use crypto as a payment tool up to 1 million rubles ($12,728). The Central Bank, however, appears to think that the threat of confiscating coins from people who seek to do business in crypto will be a bigger deterrent. Andrey Medvedev, the bank’s Legal Department lead, told attendees at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum last month: “The key thing is that the [crypto] illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. And this will be the most painful thing.” Russia and China say the Pentagon's proposed missile-defense shield will be destabilizing.

The commission also decided to postpone a proposed year-round ban on mining in the Zabaikalsky Krai and Buryatia regions.

The move comes after weeks of range-bound price action, and while the breakout attempt has gained attention, traders are now watching closely for confirmation through a decisive push above the next resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? So far, ETH has held up well despite broader market volatility. With buyers back in control, the focus has shifted to whether Ethereum can break through the upper boundary of its current range and begin a sustained move higher. Without follow-through, price risks slipping back into consolidation, frustrating bullish positioning. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is now pushing into weekly range highs, specifically a zone defined by a cluster of upper shadows and the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA). This region has repeatedly acted as resistance, rejecting previous rally attempts. Ethereum Bulls Eye Breakout Confirmation Ethereum is at a critical juncture as bulls push price toward the $2,800 resistance — a level that must be decisively cleared to confirm a breakout and transition into a full bullish phase. After a sharp rebound from April’s low, where ETH traded near $1,400, the asset has surged more than 90%, reclaiming key moving averages and breaking through previous short-term resistance levels. Momentum is clearly building, but Ethereum now faces its most important test. The $2,800 zone marks the top of the current range and coincides with multiple technical barriers. Cheds highlighted that ETH is now trading into weekly range highs, where a cluster of upper shadows has repeatedly rejected price. This region also aligns with the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA), reinforcing it as a major zone of resistance. According to Cheds, the bear thesis fails if ETH can flip $2,750 into support — a level that would likely signal trend reversal and sustained upside. However, macro risks remain. US Treasury yields continue to climb, reflecting concerns over inflation and tighter financial conditions. Rising yields often put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by pulling liquidity out of speculative markets. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s structure remains strong. As long as bulls maintain pressure and defend higher lows, the path toward reclaiming $3,000 becomes more probable. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger increased participation, both from technical traders and investors sidelined by recent volatility. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but the momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June ETH Reaches Key Resistance Zone After Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $2,688 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong breakout from a multi-day ascending triangle structure. The move was backed by rising volume and a clean reclaim of all major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($2,558), 100 SMA ($2,571), and 200 SMA ($2,535) — which now act as support beneath price. ETH has pushed directly into a key resistance zone between $2,690 and $2,735, highlighted by several previous rejection wicks. This area has acted as a supply zone since mid-May, capping every breakout attempt and leading to swift pullbacks. The current test marks Ethereum’s fifth attempt to break above this level in recent weeks, which increases the odds of a potential breakout, especially if bulls maintain momentum and volume remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, if ETH fails to clear this zone, a pullback toward the 200 SMA or the $2,600 level is likely, especially if volume tapers off. The structure remains bullish in the short term, with higher lows forming and buying pressure increasing. A confirmed 4H close above $2,735 would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger a push toward $2,900–$3,000. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but bulls are clearly pressing on the door.

In a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, Saylor argued that Chanos fundamentally misunderstands Strategy’s business model, calling the arbitrage thesis “misguided.” Chanos, known for shorting companies he deems overvalued, recently suggested investors should bet against bet against Srategy due to its substantial premium over the firm’s Bitcoin-adjusted book value. That premium, which exceeded 200% at one point in 2024, has been a focal point for skeptics who view Strategy as a glorified Bitcoin holding company. But Saylor pushed back. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” he said. “We’re actually the largest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world.” Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison Saylor emphasized that unlike Bitcoin trusts or closed-end funds, Strategy retains the flexibility to actively manage capital by issuing new financial instruments and leveraging its balance sheet. “Trusts can’t leverage Bitcoin. They can’t issue preferred shares, they can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can,” Saylor asserted. “What [Chanos] still doesn’t understand is that we are not a holding company or a closed-end trust — we are an operating company.” Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently pivoted its capital-raising strategy. Rather than issuing convertible bonds or diluting shareholders through common stock sales, the firm has embraced preferred stock instruments to finance its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. This includes the newly launched STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Perpetual Stride) preferred shares — a trio of high-yield offerings that collectively raised nearly $1 billion last week. Saylor accuses Chanos of misjudging business model Chanos has not responded to Saylor’s latest remarks. But Saylor was unsparing in his critique of the hedge fund manager’s valuation approach. Saylor said Chanos is valuing the business, generating $8.4 billion of shareholder value at zero, and he is hoping the equity will somehow trade to NAV. He continued to say that Chanos is not paying attention to if Strategy can issue preferred shares that yield 10% and invest that in Bitcoin, which has been going up by 57% for the past four and a half years. Saylor noted that the company is capturing the 47% arbitrage, effectively risk-free for their common stock shareholders. As of Tuesday, Strategy held approximately 582,000 Bitcoin — valued at about $63 billion — making it the largest corporate holder of the asset globally. The company has made over 70 Bitcoin purchase announcements since mid-2020 when Saylor initiated the strategy of using corporate funds to buy the digital currency. Saylor plans stock buybacks to squeeze shorts if premium narrows Saylor also hinted at future financial maneuvers to counter short-seller strategies. Should the premium on Strategy’s stock narrow too much, the firm could issue more preferred shares and use the proceeds to repurchase common shares, further tightening supply and squeezing shorts. “If the stock trades at a weak premium, we’re just going to sell the preferred,” he said. “And if the stock rallies up, he’s going to get liquidated and wiped out.” While the war of words between Chanos and Saylor may intensify, it reflects a broader debate over how to value a Bitcoin-centric operating company in a market still grappling with crypto’s integration into traditional finance. For now, Saylor remains unapologetically bullish — on Bitcoin and Strategy’s ability to outperform critics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Support near the 50-day and 100-day EMAs may lead to a future price surge. Positive futures market indicators suggest growing institutional commitment to XRP. Despite market fluctuations, XRP remains stable with strong support around it. As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.27 , and it has gone up by 0.85% during the past 24 hours. The price increased strongly at the start of March but soon fell again after passing through some important moving averages. XRP Derivatives Market Shows Strong Bullish Signals In the derivatives market, XRP shows signs that add strength to the idea of a bullish trend. According to CoinGlass, the daily trading volume has gone up to $5.27 billion by 26.64%, and open interest rose by 5.25% to $4.27 billion. Such high numbers indicate countries are becoming more interested and are investing for the long term.

Each is gaining momentum for different reasons: Unstaked is leveraging a $1 million giveaway to drive presale growth, Aave is rolling out a major DeFi infrastructure update, and HYPE is testing bullish resistance levels near $40. In a market hungry for clarity and purpose, these three are giving investors plenty to consider. While many search for the best crypto to buy right now, the rising winners seem to combine utility, community alignment, and strong fundamentals. Unstaked leads the way with its unique AI-driven platform and a no-insider-allocation presale. Aave reaffirms its legacy with a sophisticated overhaul to risk management. HYPE, on the other hand, shows that even high-volatility assets can deliver when supported by data and demand. Aave Umbrella Update Overhauls Risk and Rewards The upcoming Aave (AAVE) updates, part of the Umbrella upgrade, are set to reshape the protocol’s risk management framework. Aave is transitioning from locking AAVE and LP tokens to allowing aToken based contributions, enabling users to directly stake assets like aUSDC and aUSDT in exchange for variable yields. More importantly, slashing events will now be triggered automatically based on smart contract data, removing the need for governance votes in most risk events. The update also introduces StakeTokens, which represent a user’s stake in the safety module. These tokens carry slashing risk tied to actual pool deficits, but are managed via a more transparent and decentralized system. Aave is also reducing emissions of AAVE rewards while continuing strategic buybacks, aiming for long-term sustainability. The update arrives at a crucial time for Aave, as competition among DeFi protocols intensifies. Investors monitoring Aave updates are particularly encouraged by the improved capital efficiency and real-time risk response built into this release. For many, it adds further weight to AAVE’s reputation as the best crypto to buy right now among large-cap DeFi assets. HYPE Builds Momentum Despite Whale Exit Despite recent volatility, Hyperliquid (HYPE) remains a strong project in the perpetuals space. After a dramatic $1 million profit-taking move by high-profile trader James Wynn, HYPE has steadied above the $31 level and is now targeting a move toward $40. Wynn entered at an average price of $24.84 and exited near $32.72, marking a 31.9% return on a leveraged trade. While his exit briefly shook confidence, fundamentals behind the project remain strong. Hyperliquid’s May metrics point to increasing traction: TVL rose 108% to $1.46 billion, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume reached a record-breaking $248.3 billion. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows an early bullish crossover, and the price is consolidating just under a resistance zone at $35. If that level breaks, the HYPE coin target of $40 may be in play. For short-term traders and high-risk speculators, HYPE offers volatility, volume, and narrative alignment. However, even conservative investors are now watching closely, as Hyperliquid’s performance makes it a surprise opportunity for the best crypto to buy right now, particularly for those seeking explosive upside potential in DeFi-native environments. Unstaked: AI, Rewards, and the Road to $10M While legacy DeFi players grow and high-octane trades unfold, Unstaked is capturing sustained attention with its AI-powered community platform and unique token model. Currently in Stage 19 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $9.4 million, with tokens priced at $0.011065. The projected launch price is $0.1819, representing a potential 28x return for early buyers. At the heart of the project is a Proof of Intelligence model, where users earn rewards based on contributions, not simply for holding. Unlike many presales, Unstaked features no insider allocations, which fosters trust and fairness within the community. Its AI tools, community voting system, and merit-based incentives combine to form a truly decentralized product vision. To further amplify interest, Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway, awarding 20 winners $50,000 in $UNSD tokens each. Entry requires a minimum $100 purchase and completion of a few social tasks, creating a highly engaged and invested early user base. Among the many presales in the market, Unstaked stands out for its clarity of purpose and execution. It’s not just another AI token or governance play, it’s a live testbed for community-driven crypto development. For investors evaluating the best crypto to buy right now, Unstaked is fast becoming the presale to beat. What Informed Investors Are Watching in 2025 The crypto market in 2025 is rewarding substance, not just speculation. As the latest Aave (AAVE) updates streamline DeFi safety nets, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) coin target bulls push toward $40, Unstaked’s strong community, transparent model, and AI-powered platform are pushing it to the top of presale watchlists. Unstaked’s $1 million campaign, combined with no insider advantages and a performance-based reward system, offers a refreshing model for future crypto launches. Whether you’re a DeFi veteran or new to the space, now is a rare window where development, incentives, and investor alignment are syncing up. For those searching for the best crypto to buy right now, the answer may lie not in the familiar names of old cycles, but in those quietly building the next one.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 791,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on gold’s price action, noting that the precious metal’s chart is the “most important chart to watch” this week. According to the trader, gold appears to have printed a bearish lower high setup on the six-hour chart, suggesting that the precious metal could fall to as low as $3,200 in the near term. “As long as Gold stays sub-$3,365, we’re likely going to see a sharp fall in the coming one to two weeks of anything between 4-10%, resulting into a sudden macroeconomic shift.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Van de Poppe believes that falling gold prices will be beneficial for altcoins, as it suggests an increased appetite for risk among investors. “At the end of [last] week, a sudden [gold] correction took place, which might result in the confirmation of a short-term downtrend. This is vital, as that would attract more investors towards Altcoins. Why? It would enable more investors to be jumping into risk-on assets, when gold implies that it continues to fall. This means –> money/liquidity flows from risk-off assets towards risk-on assets, and the best asset class remains to be crypto.” But the trader warns that altcoins will likely see lower levels if gold shatters $3,365. “If it does break above that crucial level, the theory is invalidated, and we’re likely open for printing new highs, which then means that we’re printing new lows on altcoins. For me, this is crucial, as a correction in Gold and rally in the CNH (offshore Chinese renminbi) implies that we’re going to be seeing more interest flowing into crypto after that.” At time of writing, gold is trading for $3,324, up more than 60% in the last 18 months.

This comes as the SEC has requested issuers that are launching the Solana ETFs to submit their updated filings especially for the S-1 form within a week potentially signaling approvals. Filing changes signal accelerated Solana ETF approvals A source cited by Blockworks has suggested the filing changes could accelerate the Solana ETF approval, possibly in July or within three to five weeks, before October when most of the final deadlines for a SEC decision expire. According to two sources that spoke with Blockworks, the SEC will provide comments the S-1 forms within a space of 30 days of submission. The agency reportedly solicited for explanations from companies on how investors will get their money back in crypto. It’s also pushing to know if companies plan to include staking, which means earning rewards by helping run the Solana network. The SEC is also said to be open to allowing staking as part of these products. “If staking gets approved, it changes the game” said one enthusiast identified as Crypto Racoon on X platform.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of approval in 2025 are at 90%, which matches their forecast for LitecoinETF approval. “We think the SEC may now focus on handling 19b-4 filings for Solana and staking ETFs earlier than planned.” Bloomberg analysts. Seyffart indicated this week that SEC may prioritize reviewing 19b-4 filings for Solana and bet ETFs sooner than expected, adding that the issuers and industry players have likely been working with SEC together with its crypto taskforce to finalize the details. He also added that Solana and XRP already have futures-based ETFs, which usually makes it easier for the SEC to give a not to spot ETFs. Last month the regulator delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF indicating that it had not “reached any conclusions” on the19b-4 filing to list the proposed ETF. The delay was viewed as procedural rather than rejection. Grayscale wants to convert its SOL Trust into a spot ETF, reflecting the path it used to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF funds. The firm’s filing was delayed on May 13, while Franklin Templeton’s proposal was delayed on April 30, according to SEC. In the meantime, filings by Fidelity and VanEck were postponed on May 19. After the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum ETF in May this year, attention has now turned to other top digital assets like Solana. News of the development sent SOL 4% up, bringing its price close to $165 per trading view data.

He warns that increased oversight could stifle innovation and weaken the US’s competitive edge against China. Speaking to Bloomberg News on Tuesday, Schmidt—who also oversees security at Amazon Web Services (AWS)—cautioned against government overreach in the rapidly evolving AI sector. He said the tension with regulation of any kind is that it tends to retard progress. Schmidt continued to say their approach is to let the industry define appropriate standards—guided primarily by customer needs and demands. Tech leaders push back as Washington moves to rein In AI development Schmidt’s remarks echo those made last month by Microsoft, OpenAI, AMD, and CoreWeave executives during a congressional hearing. The tech leaders argued that government regulation could hinder their ability to compete globally—especially with China, which has made AI development a national priority. Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, emphasized the necessity of “sensible regulation that doesn’t slow us down,” signaling a widening fissure between innovation and governing within the tech world. The fight over AI regulation is heating up on Capitol Hill. A controversy erupted when the House tucked language into President Donald Trump’s broad tax package that would prevent states from going their own way to enforce new AI rules. The provision prompted bipartisan pushback and focused attention on a growing worry that there are no controls on the development of AI. A vocal advocate for unfettered AI growth, Trump has taken steps to dismantle constraints, including repealing the Biden administration’s executive order on AI and promoting AI-related investments in the Middle East. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the move, calling it essential to national security and asserting that “regulatory restraint” was key to ensuring America’s dominance in AI. Attorney General Rob Bonta said he strongly opposes any effort to block states from developing and enforcing common-sense regulation. He noted that states must be able to protect their residents by responding to emerging and evolving AI technology. California implemented a raft of bills this year limiting specific uses of AI, illustrating the kind of laws that would be blocked under the moratorium. Like several other states, California has criminalized the use of AI to generate sexually explicit images of individuals without their consent. The state also prohibits unauthorized deepfakes in political advertising and requires healthcare providers to notify patients when interacting with an AI, not a human. Healthcare provider networks, also known as HMOs, are barred in California from using AI systems instead of doctors to decide medical necessity. Senate challenges House approach However, the House provision may not survive Senate scrutiny. Under budget reconciliation rules, only measures directly related to federal spending or revenue can bypass the filibuster and pass with a simple majority. The Senate proposed alternative language as a workaround: denying federal broadband funding to states that impose their own AI regulations. But the provision’s fate hinges on the ruling of the Senate parliamentarian, who has not yet weighed in. “We have yet to argue this before the parliamentarian. I anticipate that we will do so this week or next week,” Senate Commerce Chairman Ted Cruz told Bloomberg TV . “I don’t know how she’ll rule.” Still, Cruz called the Senate’s approach “very sound policy.” The regulatory debate comes as Amazon ramps up investment in AI infrastructure. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant recently announced plans to spend up to $20 billion on server farms in Pennsylvania—further evidence of the company’s high-stakes bet on artificial intelligence as a core driver of future growth. Like its peers, Amazon sees AI as not just a technological leap but a geopolitical one. And for now, industry leaders are betting that the fewer the rules, the faster they can run.

American Bitcoin (ABTC), backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has quietly accumulated over 215 BTC, valued at $23 million, since its launch on April 1. As revealed in a recent SEC filing dated June 6, ABTC isn’t just a mining company; it’s a Bitcoin accumulation vehicle with long-term ambitions. Operating over 60,000 miners housed in Hut 8 facilities, ABTC generates over 10.17 EH/s of hashpower without owning any real estate. Instead of converting mined Bitcoin into cash, the company stores its reserves securely using Coinbase Custody. Eric and Donald Trump Jr.-backed American #Bitcoin quietly accumulates 215 $BTC ($23M+) since April launch ahead of public merger. pic.twitter.com/OXP9wZvDRS — amit malik (@amitmalikmalik) June 10, 2025 With Eric Trump joining the board and a public listing in the works via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, the company is tying its identity and brand equity to Bitcoin itself. Key points: ABTC’s mining approach focuses on BTC accumulation, not fiat conversion. Trump family’s backing adds political clout and media visibility. Market sees this as bullish supply-side pressure—less BTC on exchanges. U.S. Charges $500M Crypto Laundering Plot While ABTC builds a bullish case, U.S. regulators dropped a bombshell. The DOJ arrested Iurii Gugnin, founder of Evita Pay and Evita Investments, for laundering over $500 million through U.S. banks and crypto platforms, mainly using Tether (USDT). U.S. CRACKS DOWN ON CRYPTO KING: SECRET TECH DEALS WITH RUSSIA EXPOSED U.S. prosecutors charged Iurii Gugnin, founder of crypto payments company Evita, with laundering over $500 million and helping Russians get sensitive American tech. Court documents allege Gugnin used… https://t.co/ccVEVtO59E pic.twitter.com/XMQiVOeatj — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) June 10, 2025 Gugnin is accused of helping sanctioned Russian entities like Sberbank and Rosatom dodge international restrictions. The indictment includes 22 counts of bank fraud, each carrying up to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors allege he: Bought U.S. technology for banned firms. Falsified documents to hide ties to Russia. Exploited crypto’s opacity to bypass sanctions. This case reinforces growing concerns that digital assets are being used to sidestep international law, prompting stricter global oversight. Still, Bitcoin’s transparent and decentralized nature differentiates it from intermediated platforms and may continue to attract regulatory favor. Japan’s QE Pivot May Ignite Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sees a potential global liquidity wave on the horizon. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) resumes quantitative easing (QE) at its June 16–17 meeting, Hayes believes it could be the next big tailwind for Bitcoin. The Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting could impact global risk assets. If they shift to QE, $BTC may surge towards $200K as it becomes a hedge against sovereign risks. Read the full article https://t.co/i2bvc3IJ2I — Nova – {News} AI Agent (@ChainGPTAINews) June 10, 2025 Why? Japan recently signaled plans to reduce bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter. But with rising yields, 30-year JGBs hit 3.185% in May—officials may reverse course. Bitcoin previously surged to $112,000 when yields spiked, suggesting investors see it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability. Hayes predicts: QE would boost risk assets, including BTC. Institutions may turn to Bitcoin as a “counterparty-risk-free” asset. A renewed rally could push Bitcoin toward the $200,000 mark in 2025. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $112K and Beyond? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC remains in a bullish ascending channel on the 2-hour chart, trading above the 50-EMA ($107,510) and making consistent higher lows. A bullish engulfing candle on June 9 pushed the price above a key barrier at $108,627, with current resistance at $110,668. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is flattening, hinting at weakening momentum, while candlesticks show upper wicks—a sign of hesitation. A confirmed breakout above $111,000 could ignite momentum toward $112,000 and $113,500. Technical Levels to Watch: Support: $108,000 (channel base), $107,510 (50-EMA) Resistance: $111,000, $113,500 Trade idea: Buy on breakout or bounce off 50-EMA with a tight stop-loss Conclusion Macro shifts, regulatory crackdowns, and high-profile political support are reshaping the narrative surrounding Bitcoin. As ABTC accumulates, Japan considers more stimulus, and chart patterns remain constructive, the path toward $200K is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a data-backed possibility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading at just $0.03, is drawing comparisons to early-stage Ethereum (ETH) for its ambitious DeFi infrastructure and disruptive potential. The project has already raised more than $10.3 million and attracted over 11,800 holders. Meanwhile, Ethereum, still one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, continues to defend its legacy with strong developer activity and growing institutional adoption, trading at $2,486 as of early June 2025. But as retail investors ask what crypto to buy now, many are betting that MUTM could be the next crypto to take off, offering exponential upside, and potentially carving out its own market alongside Ethereum (ETH) in the changing decentralized market. Mutuum Finance’s Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their listing price of $0.06, which is a 100% gain for phase 5 investors upon the token’s launch. With over $10.3 million raised and a growing community of 11,800+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Rewards for Early Investors Fuel Ongoing Community Growth As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow, it remains committed to its earliest supporters. To show appreciation, 10 early investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway —each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This rewards them for being early backers of the project before it takes off. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key features of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $10.3 million and attracted more than 11,800 holders signaling strong early momentum in the DeFi space. As Phase 5 of the presale continues investors can still acquire tokens at $0.03 ahead of the planned $0.06 listing price which will yield a 100% ROI. The project’s hybrid lending model, Certik-audited smart contracts, and upcoming fully collateralized stablecoin highlight a serious commitment to innovation, transparency, and long-term value.

You’re Among Crypto’s Elite, Expert Claims",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/owning-10000-xrp-youre-among-cryptos-elite-expert-claims/,"According to crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina, most individual XRP holders could find themselves shut out as inflation and tight budgets squeeze their options. He argues that owning more than 10,000 XRP – which costs about $23,100 at a price of $2.31 per token – has become a barrier for anyone living paycheck to paycheck. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Rich List Data Reveals Concentration Based on reports, there are about 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses in existence. Less than 4% of those wallets contain at least 10,000 XRP. A clear majority, over 5 million addresses, hold 500 XRP or fewer. That gap shows how stacked the system is. More than 166,250 wallets sit in the 10,000–25,000 XRP range. Another 159,566 wallets carry between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. These figures point to a small group with deep pockets, while the rest trail far behind. Owning more than 10,000 $XRP nowadays is already a luxury few people can afford. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 9, 2025 Inflation Pressures Hit Small Holders Farina warns that rising inflation is forcing ordinary holders to sell just to cover daily needs. He notes, “We’re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries.” When basic goods cost more each month, people feel they have no choice but to cash out their crypto. It’s a harsh reality. Owning large amounts of XRP has morphed from a luxury into a struggle for survival. Threshold Debate Heats Up He first said 95% of XRP holders risk being priced out. Now he’s raised that warning to 99%. That jump has sparked debate. Some worry it feeds a fear of missing out on a “10,000-XRP club,” while others see it as a wake-up call. Farina questions whether Bitcoin’s rally to about $112,000 really reflects growth, or simply the dollar losing its value. He frames the issue as a tug-of-war between crypto gains and fiat losses. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Calls For New Income Streams Instead of selling crypto, Farina urges holders to find extra income. He suggests side hustles or online work as ways to avoid cutting into holdings. “If you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,” he said. His advice pushes people to rethink how they earn and where they live. Crypto markets can move on legal news and product launches, not only inflation. Ripple’s ongoing court case and ETF filings could change XRP’s path. Still, Farina’s message taps into a broader concern: the gap between small and large holders may widen as prices climb. Retail investors can still join in. They just need to pace their buys and stay aware of both crypto trends and everyday costs.

Amidst a crypto market characterized by persistent volatility, with Bitcoin fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000, market sentiment remains largely influenced by macroeconomic policies, regulatory developments, and speculative behavior. Against this backdrop, HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt leverages rigorous data analysis and a meticulous selection process to spotlight seven standout projects. These projects are strategically positioned for growth and demonstrate strong community engagement. The selected assets span some of today’s most dynamic sectors—including RWA/DeFi, AI, Meme, LSD, and SocialFi—and feature both promising new entrants and well-established projects that have recently outperformed broader market trends. New Listings Shine Across a Well-Balanced Sector Mix In May, HTX listed 23 new assets, including six stablecoins, an approach that underscores its commitment to staying at the forefront of the stablecoin trend and expanding its asset offerings. Notably, USD1 made its global debut on HTX. The token, issued by World Liberty Financial (a company backed by the Trump family), focuses on building a DeFi lending ecosystem in the United States. USD1 quickly gained traction as one of May’s most discussed projects on social media and received an S rating. Besides USD1, two other new assets in Crypto Gem Hunt #6 have stood out: SYRUP (Maple Finance) , a key player in the RWA/DeFi sector, experienced an impressive 117.7% surge following its listing on May 8, earning an A rating. SYRUP is the native token of Maple, a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to deposit USDC, receive syrupUSDC, and earn yield. All loans are collateralized by digital assets, ensuring both strong security and sustainable returns. KAITO , an innovator in the InfoFi/AI sector, recorded a remarkable 263.6% increase since its listing on HTX on February 23, securing an A rating. KAITO is building an AI-driven crypto information network that streamlines content distribution among creators, users, and capital. By empowering the content ecosystem, KAITO is positioning itself at the forefront of the convergence between crypto and AI. Veteran Projects Regain Momentum, Fueling Compelling Narratives Despite continuous shifts in market dynamics, a select group of earlier-launched projects are demonstrating remarkable resilience. Backed by strong product fundamentals and vibrant community support, they’ve recently returned to the spotlight with evolving narratives and renewed momentum, capturing the attention of both investors and users. Two Meme projects from last September, MOODENG and NEIROCTO, serve as notable examples: MOODENG , built on the Solana (SOL) chain, surged an incredible 961.5% and received an A rating. Inspired by the famous pygmy hippopotamus from Thailand, MOODENG’s unique design, strong community, and viral momentum propelled it to a nearly tenfold increase post-launch. NEIROCTO ( First Neiro On Ethereum ) is community-driven and carries on the spirit of Doge. Since its launch on September 7, 2024, it has seen a peak increase of 235%. Through consistent operational efforts and content-driven initiatives, NEIROCTO has cultivated a highly engaged Meme community. ETHFI ( ether.fi ), launched in March 2024, emerged during the boom of the LSD sector and has since recorded a 258.7% increase. With rising interest in LSD solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem, ETHFI shows strong growth potential and a solid track record. MASK (Mask Network) , launched in 2021, is a SocialFi project that recently gained 187.3%. Acting as a bridge between Web2 (traditional internet) and Web3 (decentralized internet), MASK integrates decentralized applications into mainstream social media via a browser plugin. Recent feature updates and community efforts have significantly contributed to its price recovery. HTX Crypto Gem Hunt Empowers Users Across Market Cycles To date, HTX has launched six rounds of its Crypto Gem Hunt program. The latest selection features not only high-growth new assets from emerging sectors but also established projects that have recently delivered strong performance. Together, these assets offer users a well-balanced portfolio—combining defensive stability with high-upside potential. Looking ahead, HTX Crypto Gem Hunt will continue to empower users through professional, intuitive asset discovery supported by robust data and forward-looking analysis.

While the world's largest digital asset is trading flat in the early hours of the session, CoinDesk market data shows that it's up 4% on the week. An expected Bank of Japan rate cut isn't doing that much to move the market, even though a low interest rate policy is usually what drives risk-on sentiment and positively impacts BTC prices. One metric to watch instead is the 'Coinbase Premium'. Tracked by CryptoQuant, it measures the price difference between BTC on Coinbase Pro (USD) and Binance (USDT), demonstrating the dollar demand for bitcoin (as opposed to crypto-native demand). ""The Coinbase Premium is gradually rising, indicating that buying pressure from U.S. investors is supporting the trend,"" CryptoQuant analysts wrote in a recent update . ""Additionally, whale buying activity is being observed incrementally."" Part of this movement would include BTC ETF inflow, which has hit $386.27 million so far this week, according to SoSoValue data . That being said, some market observers are concerned that a staked ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), which may be close to getting approved , could put a damper on institutional BTC interest. Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, says that an ETF that gives investors access to ETH yield from staking would be something that BTC ETFs can't match, as they just give exposure to price appreciation. ""This has created a lot of buzz, especially considering how much of bitcoin’s rally was fueled by ETF hype,"" Yang said. ""And let’s be honest: while there’s speculation around Solana or Litecoin ETFs, Ether is still the only other crypto asset with a real existence in U.S. spot ETF. That makes it a go-to option for institutions waiting and watching on the sidelines, ready to move when the timing feels right."" But for now, it's still a waiting game. At least until the BoJ's move is official, as the usual crypto-natives like Arthur Hayes are counting on BTC going parabolic as a result. DEX Volume Has Nearly Doubled in Past Year Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) have always had their eyes on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) since the concept took off in 2018 with the advent of modern Automated Market Maker (AMM) engines – the technology at the center of the product category. But as the year continues, and crypto mergers and acquisitions heat up maybe there'll be a renewed interest in DEXs, considering the massive jump in volume on the platforms in the last year. According to data from Messari, in the last year, trading volume on DEXs has jumped from around 6% of all volume to 12%. In May, that number got closer to 25% as up-and-coming DEX Hyperliquid caught the eye of the market , including crypto's most aggressive traders . But are DEXs and CEX's competitors? No, says OKX President Hong Fang. Speaking with CoinDesk earlier this year in the run-up to Consensus Hong Kong, Fang said that the two are complementary. ""The crypto-native audience will want to be able to use CEX for reliability and DEX for catching innovations,"" she said at the time. ""Such supply-demand dynamics will drive further adoption of DEX to enable innovation while supporting the gradual maturity of the crypto regulatory framework."" News Roundup Trump’s CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz Says Congress Key to Boosting Crypto Innovation and Consumer Protection Brian Quintenz, President Trump's nominee for chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), emphasized at his Senate confirmation hearing that Congress must lead in establishing clear guidelines to boost crypto innovation and consumer protection simultaneously, CoinDesk previously reported. Quintenz, who previously served as a CFTC commissioner and later as head of policy at venture capital firm a16z, argued that forthcoming market structure legislation could provide clarity needed for entrepreneurs while maintaining safeguards for consumers. During his confirmation, senators expressed concerns about vacancies at the CFTC—particularly the absence of Democratic commissioners—but Quintenz declined to commit to advocating Trump to fill these positions, emphasizing presidential discretion. He acknowledged potential resource needs should the CFTC become the primary regulator for digital commodities, advocating a ""technology-first approach"" to enhance agency efficiency, and defended the role of prediction markets as legitimate tools for hedging and risk management. Aave is Now on Sony's Soneium Aave has launched on Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain supported by electronics giant Sony, CoinDesk previously reported. This integration includes exploring real-world applications of Aave's decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin, GHO, across payments, savings, and digital commerce. Aave's involvement will extend to liquidity incentive campaigns, notably partnering with Astar, a significant blockchain player in Japan’s Web3 scene, with a dedicated 100 million ASTR allocation ($4 million) to boost adoption. Soneium already hosts a vibrant 7-million user ecosystem featuring prominent platforms like Uniswap v4, Velodrome, Stargate, and Lido, alongside native protocols Kyo Finance and SuperVol. Stani Kulechov, Aave Labs' founder, emphasized Sony’s global trust and Soneium’s consumer-centric approach as key advantages, aligning with Aave’s strategy of expanding accessibility and mainstream reach. Market Movements BTC: BTC trades below $110K as exchange reserves drop sharply, signaling strong accumulation amid significant short liquidations.

This would be necessary if Congress grants the CFTC expanded authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. “It is precedental that new jurisdiction comes with new resources,” Quintenz said in response to multiple senators’ questions. “So to the extent that new authorities come to the agency… I would anticipate that new resources would likely be needed.” Quintenz, currently head of global policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division (a16z crypto), previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021. If confirmed by the Senate, he would return to the CFTC at a moment of heightened interest in digital asset regulation and amid significant personnel turnover at the agency. Senate backs expanded resources for CFTC Lawmakers from both parties generally agreed with Quintenz’s assessment. While a few expressed reservations about President Trump’s approach to regulatory agencies, there was broad consensus that the CFTC would require a larger budget and staff to oversee an expanded crypto mandate effectively. “It is also essential that the CFTC have the institutional capacity, both in staffing and resources, to fulfill its mandate in the face of these emerging challenges,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) before asking for Quintenz’s take on resourcing. Quintenz responded that undertaking much of that responsibility would be a challenge. He added that the precedent has been to provide new resources alongside new authorities. The hearing took place as lawmakers continue to craft legislation that could hand the CFTC a central role in regulating crypto spot markets, currently in regulatory limbo between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other federal agencies. Quintenz set to lead alone as CFTC faces leadership exodus If confirmed, Quintenz may initially be the only commissioner at the CFTC. In recent weeks, all four remaining commissioners have either stepped down or announced their departures . Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger resigned to become CEO of the Blockchain Association, while Acting Chair Caroline Pham has indicated she will exit once Quintenz is confirmed. Democrats Kristin Johnson and Christy Goldsmith Romero departed or scheduled their exits. This leadership vacuum raises questions about the agency’s near-term capacity to function effectively, let alone take on new responsibilities in the fast-evolving crypto space. Quintenz, known for his pro-innovation stance during his previous CFTC tenure, has been a vocal advocate for clear regulation in the digital asset space. He has called for clearly defining the responsibilities of federal agencies in the crypto space and offering clear guidance to industry participants. His return to the CFTC, especially as the commission’s lone commissioner, could influence how the agency thinks about crypto rulemaking if Congress moves ahead with proposals to broaden the agency’s mandate. Trump’s larger fiscal plan, which includes deep cuts to government spending and essentially an omnibus bill of infrastructure and defense spending, has only complicated negotiations around the budget. While it is unclear if the CFTC will secure the resources it requires, the agency is prepared to step in potentially transformative ways in crypto regulation.

Lummis emphasizes that the policy has been tilted against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lummis said that the Bitcoin mining community is one of the hardest-hit groups due to the proposed provisions, which would endure potentially duplicative taxes and substantial compliance headaches. This interpretation follows Senator Lummis’ X post that says that America’s crypto tax laws disproportionately target Bitcoin and other digital assets. As a long-time advocate, she argued that the current tax laws are a “complete mess,” with the most problems manifested by Bitcoin. Bitcoin and digital assets are being unfairly targeted because of flawed tax rules. We need crypto revisions in reconciliation. — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 10, 2025 She said the cryptocurrency rules must be updated during the reconciliation process to curb that. Senator Lummis refers to the IRS’s crypto tax regulations as ‘bad tax regulations’ Senator Cynthia Lummis stated that Bitcoin and digital assets are wrongly singled out due to bad tax regulations. Though Lummis does not mention them by name, her remarks likely refer to the IRS’s crypto tax reporting rules, particularly those rolled out in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law took a wide view of “brokers,” placing miners and developers under the same category. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is also called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law widened the broker reporting rules in Sections 6045 and 6045A to cover digital assets. This wide-reaching categorization has faced criticism from miners and developers, who have voiced out their claims. According to them, they would be virtually unable to comply with these regulations. The rules force them to report information like names and transaction amounts in their tax filings — information they often do not even have access to. Lummis’ post called on Congress to try to make the rule change on a special amendment vehicle. The pro-Bitcoin senator calls for “crypto changes in reconciliation” to accelerate the amendment process. According to House rules, some tax or spending bills can be approved with a simple majority using reconciliation. Senator Lummis wants to use this method to change the definition of “broker” and bypass bipartisan gridlock. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970 despite regulatory uncertainties People are also worried that the flawed tax code carries the potential for double taxation in the case of miners and participants in decentralized finance (DeFi). This is because Miners get taxed on their block rewards and then again on capital gains when they sell what they own. At the same time, DeFi users could face several taxable events even if they have not made any profits. However, despite such regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970. Cryptocurrency markets are rebounding today, with the two highest performers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, posting positive gains following a weekend of largely sideways trading. US lawmakers are debating new crypto rules to solve this regulatory uncertainty that may profoundly reshape the industry. The GENIUS Act is on the verge of a cloture vote in Congress this week, with the CLARITY Act also moving forward.

""Circle IPO's clearly went very well. That's a reflection of investor interest in crypto, both institutions and retail. The financial future will be blockchain-based,"" Garlinghouse said at Apex. Garlinghouse said that one factor in the success of Circle's IPO is the market's fundamental belief that the GENIUS Act – the U.S. stablecoin legislation – will pass. As CoinDesk previously reported , the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulatory bill, is poised for imminent Senate passage with bipartisan support, potentially moving to the House and becoming law by August recess. ""Regulatory headwinds have now become tailwinds in the U.S., and that's good for the global landscape,"" Garlinghouse continued. ""It's not deregulation that we want, and we are asking for clear regulation, and progress is evident."" Other jurisdictions have also recently passed stablecoin legislation, such as Hong Kong . Korea's new administration is also said to be working on a stablecoin bill. Garlinghouse declined to comment on a potential Ripple-Circle merger or acquisition.

Toncoin Has Been Stuck Inside A Triangle On The Daily Timeframe In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that Toncoin has recently been moving inside. The pattern in question is a Triangle from technical analysis (TA), which forms when an asset’s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance in the future, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Triangles in TA. Three popular ones include the Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines relative to each other defines which type a particular triangular channel falls under. In an Ascending Triangle, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, its consolidation shrinks toward a net upside. The Descending Triangle involves just the opposite case; the upper line is sloped downward while the lower one is flat. The third variation, the Symmetrical Triangle, has its trendlines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In this pattern, the price’s range tightens to a point in a sideways manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Triangle pattern that Toncoin has seemingly been trapped within during the past few months: From the graph, it’s visible that the Triangle that the 1-day price of Toncoin has been following looks similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it’s not a perfect one; there is a slight bias to the downside. The cryptocurrency most recently found support at the lower line and has since climbed toward the midway point between the trendlines. The coin’s price is now not too far from the apex of the pattern. Generally, breakouts become more likely as consolidation becomes tighter, so it’s possible that TON may be approaching one. According to the analyst, a breakout, if it happens, could potentially end up leading to a 40% move for Toncoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative As for which direction a breakout might take the asset in, Symmetrical Triangles usually have both sides at equal probability. Since the Triangle in the current case is slightly angled down, however, an exit below the lower line may be a bit more likely. It now remains to be seen how Toncoin’s price will develop in the coming days and if the pattern will play any role. TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.3, up over 2% in the last seven days.

While there are hundreds of options, few coins combine practical use, reliable performance, and smart pricing. With 2025 at its halfway mark, timing is key for anyone eyeing solid gains. BlockDAG is showing unmatched traction with its low price and high user base. FET is building real AI applications. BNB remains central to the Binance ecosystem, and ADA continues to push academic innovation. These four picks bring something unique to the table and are considered solid picks for anyone mapping their crypto strategy. 1. BlockDAG: Real Adoption with 1.5M Daily Users BlockDAG stands out as a top crypto to watch this year. It has already raised over $293 million and sold more than 22.2 billion coins. The price is currently frozen at $0.0018 until June 13. With a $0.05 launch price, this reflects a possible gain of 2,678%. Even early participants have seen profits of 2,520% since Batch 1 at $0.001. The platform’s X1 Miner app is driving mass usage with over 1.5 million daily users mining coins directly on mobile. The app has simple features like streak rewards, zero gas fees, and a referral program that appeals to new users. BlockDAG also supports low-code smart contracts and is fully EVM-compatible, helping developers get involved faster. It passed audits from both Halborn and CertiK, boosting trust. High-profile tie-ups, including one with Inter Milan and hints at an NBA deal, add to its credibility. While some experts note the governance model is still evolving, the metrics point to long-term value. With the GO LIVE reveal happening on June 13, BlockDAG offers strong fundamentals and market attention, placing it firmly among the top cryptos to watch now. 2. Fetch.ai: Building AI for the Real World Fetch.ai (FET) blends AI and blockchain to simplify real-world operations in areas like logistics and IoT. It allows users to set up agents that handle tasks like autonomous payments and data sharing. Businesses are beginning to explore it for reducing system inefficiencies. Its rise in 2025 coincides with a wider shift toward AI-backed crypto solutions. FET’s edge lies in its functioning use cases, unlike many theoretical AI coins. It remains budget-friendly, making it one of the top cryptos to watch for practical automation. With more developers joining the platform and solid real-world tests, it positions itself for future growth. 3. BNB: Central Role in a Massive Ecosystem BNB stays relevant through its deep integration in Binance’s services. It’s used for discounts, staking, and across the Binance Smart Chain’s expanding DeFi world. BNB’s consistent on-chain usage keeps it in the spotlight. The scheduled token burns decrease supply, increasing long-term value. Despite global regulatory challenges, Binance’s wide reach ensures BNB demand holds firm. It’s accepted on multiple platforms outside Binance as well. BNB remains a top crypto to watch for those who want steady growth in a high-utility asset. Though not the highest gainer, it’s a dependable option. 4. Cardano: Steady Growth from Research-Based Development Cardano (ADA) has always followed a deliberate, research-heavy path. Instead of fast launches, it focuses on peer-reviewed improvements and secure infrastructure. This has gained attention from developers looking for long-term platforms. In 2025, ADA is seeing more use cases, especially in smart contracts and digital identity. Its DeFi ecosystem is also expanding slowly but surely. Staking allows users to earn while helping the network. For those looking for a top crypto to watch that emphasizes slow but solid growth, ADA is a reliable option with a forward-thinking roadmap. The Bottom Line Identifying the top crypto to watch involves finding real usage, growth potential, and smart timing. BlockDAG stands out with a $0.0018 price until June 13, over 22.2 billion coins sold, and its June 13 GO LIVE reveal nearing. FET brings proven AI integration into blockchain, while BNB thrives on Binance utility. ADA stays the course with a methodical approach to blockchain advancement. Each of these coins offers something valuable. Depending on your approach, one may align better than the others. But BDAG definitely deserves a spot on your radar in 2025 for its consistent growth and ROI potential.

Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy with a $17.9M Presale Surge,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-out-on-bitcoin-cash-qubetics-is-the-popular-crypto-coin-to-buy-with-a-17-9m-presale-surge/,"In the final quarter of 2017, as the crypto market entered one of its most explosive growth phases, Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) stood out as a high-potential fork of Bitcoin—engineered to deliver faster, more cost-effective transactions. Launched in August 2017 at around $240, $BCH rapidly gained traction and soared to an all-time high of over $4,000 by December, generating more than 1,500% gains in just a few months. For early adopters, it was a defining moment. But for most, the opportunity vanished almost as quickly as it appeared. Today, with similar early-stage momentum and real-world utility, Qubetics ($TICS) is positioning itself as one of the top altcoins to buy, offering a compelling entry point before wider market adoption. Those who hesitated or dismissed it as another altcoin missed a chance to secure triple-digit gains. Today, $BCH trades around $460, a fraction of its all-time high—but still respected as a foundational player in the decentralized payments space. While Bitcoin Cash maintains relevance, it’s no longer viewed as the breakthrough it once was. Its growth has stabilised, its hype subdued. And in a market that rewards innovation and momentum, backers are asking—what’s the next major leap? Qubetics might just be the answer. With its unique decentralized VPN utility, a lean supply strategy, and over $17.9 million raised so far in its crypto presale, Qubetics has swiftly positioned itself as the most popular crypto coin to buy in 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): Reducing Risks of Censorship With Decentralized VPN With governments tightening internet surveillance and traditional VPNs raising privacy concerns, Qubetics came up with a decentralized VPN powered by blockchain infrastructure. It’s a smart, forward-thinking use of crypto tech—giving users control over their digital privacy in a way centralised providers simply can’t match. A decentralized VPN allows individuals and organizations to route internet traffic across a global network of nodes, reducing risks of censorship, tracking, or data harvesting. It’s not just a tool for privacy junkies. Freelancers working across borders, NGOs operating in restricted environments, financial firms protecting sensitive communication—Qubetics offers them all a more secure path online. For developers, there’s an opportunity to plug into the protocol and create privacy-enhancing apps, all while earning $TICS tokens as network contributors. And that’s only one layer of Qubetics’ appeal. The token is powering into its final public crypto presale stage, offering buyers a unique combination of timing, scarcity, and real-world utility. The crypto presale—currently in Stage 37—has already sold over 515 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,800 holders, raising upwards of $17.9 million. At $0.3370 per token, there’s a built-in 20% upside when $TICS lists at $0.40. But analysts are looking much further ahead, estimating price levels of $5 to $15 once the mainnet launches and demand surges. This isn’t a speculative meme coin built on social media hype. Qubetics is rolling out use cases with teeth. The protocol is also structured to solve real cross-border payment inefficiencies, enabling faster, cheaper asset transfers without relying on third-party intermediaries. The total supply of Qubetics was recently slashed from 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, turning $TICS into one of the leanest upcoming tokens. With 38.55% of the supply now flowing into the hands of the community, decentralisation isn’t just a buzzword—it’s embedded into the DNA of the project. An $18,000 buy-in at this stage could yield staggering returns if $TICS follows the price arc analysts foresee. At $1, that’s $53,412. At $5, it’s over $267,000. And if it hits $15 after the mainnet launch? That initial capital could swell beyond $800,000. All of this helps explain why crypto enthusiasts are calling Qubetics one of the most popular crypto coins to buy right now. Bitcoin Cash ($BCH): A Veteran Player with Slower Momentum Bitcoin Cash was born from a desire to make transactions faster and cheaper than its parent, Bitcoin. And in that respect, it delivered. Over the years, $BCH carved out a dedicated user base and continues to serve as a viable payment-focused cryptocurrency with lower fees and quicker confirmation times. However, innovation has slowed. While BCH is widely accepted on some crypto-friendly platforms and remains popular in parts of Asia and Latin America, it’s not breaking new ground in terms of tech or utility. DeFi integrations are limited. NFT support is minimal. And aside from incremental protocol upgrades, $BCH isn’t making the kind of waves it did in its early days. What’s more, the crypto landscape has changed. Backers are no longer drawn only to store-of-value coins. They’re seeking tokens with purpose—those that solve actual problems, not just theoretical ones. And in that space, Bitcoin Cash is feeling the pressure. Still, $BCH remains a household name in crypto, and for risk-averse buyers, it may provide stable if unspectacular upside. It trades at around $460 with a market cap in the billions—reassuring to some, but lacking the explosive upside potential of younger tokens in active presales. As for price outlooks, $BCH could benefit from a general market recovery, but few analysts expect it to 10x or 20x from current levels without a major network overhaul or renewed hype cycle. That’s where Qubetics gains an edge. It offers the one thing $BCH can’t replicate anymore—early-stage entry into a utility-driven ecosystem backed by a scarcity-based token model. Conclusion – Which One Is The Popular Coin to Buy Now? Bitcoin Cash was one of the most popular crypto coins to buy during its launch window. Those who took the leap reaped massive gains. But that opportunity has largely passed. Today, it serves as a steady, familiar option—but not the kind of high-growth asset that backers are hunting in 2025. Qubetics fills that gap. With its decentralized VPN use case, real-world payments utility, and sharply limited supply, it isn’t trying to replicate old models—it’s building something new. Its crypto presale momentum, coupled with analysts’ price targets ranging from $5 to $15, is why $TICS is climbing the ranks among the most popular crypto coins to buy right now. For anyone still regretting missing out on the BCH breakout years ago, Qubetics might be the second chance that rarely comes twice in a lifetime.

Lightchain AI is rapidly taking front stage with over $18.5 million raised during its presale at a price of $0.007 for its creative mix of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. Lightchain AI’s special and powerful value proposition sets it apart from rivals as the bitcoin market changes constantly and guides towards remarkable development. This ambitious project has attracted the attention of investors looking for significant financial returns in the near future since it can outperform the outstanding performance of generally known meme coins. Community Power behind Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Among the finest models of the features of community-driven cryptocurrencies are Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The community of Dogecoin, one of the most well-known for its humor and kindness, is behind several Halloween costume fundraisers and similar charitable events: the first was a successful campaign in 2014 for the Jamaican bobsled team at the Winter Olympics while the others were for the NASCAR driver Josh Wise, on this occasion they used ” Dun only good everyday”. This kind of community approach completely shows the idea that deliberate actions are the only means to make everything better. Shiba Inu’s Shib Army, the community of the Shiba Inu coin, is seeing as a spirit that goes against the fact that ‘it started as a meme’, and is, thus, a founder of a totally digital island comprising projects like ShibaSwap and NFTs. In a similar vein, both communities are using social media channels to grow their operations, compile users, and create trends across the market, so underlining the great relevance of a total involvement— literally—in the cryptocurrency scene. Lightchain AI – Transforming Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence By deftly combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to solve practical problems, lightchain AI is transforming sectors. Lightchain AI, unlike meme coins like DOGE or SHIB, emphasizes utility, allowing real-time data processing and intelligent decision-making for uses including predictive analytics and supply chain optimization. Built on a scalable and strong blockchain infrastructure, Lightchain AI is the perfect fit for companies looking for dependable, high-performance tools since it is meant to efficiently manage intricate AI-driven operations. Lightchain AI has attracted investor confidence and set itself for quick global adoption and expansion having raised an amazing $18.5 million during its presale at $0.007 per token. Embedding artificial intelligence into distributed systems is guiding a daring future for blockchain innovation. Future? All About Utility While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin brought the entertainment, Lightchain AI is here to revolutionize the game. Ignore the hype; blockchain meets actual innovation here. Lightchain AI is redefining what is feasible with blazing scalability, flawless AI integration, and a strong emphasis on useful applications. This is the jaw-dropper; 15,000% of increase is possible. That’s correct; this is a revolutionary platform designed for great disturbance and actual utility, not just another bitcoin. This is your chance to enter something really revolutionary if you’re an investor searching for the next great thing. Still, that’s not all—something major is under progress. Offering creators the best venue to design, launch, and monetize meme-based projects like never before, the Memecoin Launchpad is drawing attention. This is a game-changing combination of opportunity, inventiveness, and imagination all in one location. Are you prepared to travel forward into blockchain?

Speaking in a video posted June 9, the analyst described the current Ethereum setup across multiple timeframes as “something we’ve never seen before,” drawing comparisons to historical signals that preceded major rallies in 2016, 2018, and 2020. Ethereum Primed For Macro Breakout Kevin emphasized that Ethereum now exhibits strong bullish momentum across its USD pair, dominance chart, and ETH/BTC ratio, pointing to a simultaneous alignment of several high-time frame indicators. “These are things that just don’t pop up every day,” he said. “Matter of fact, these are things that have almost never popped up in such confluence throughout history for Ethereum.” The core of Kevin’s thesis hinges on what he calls a “monthly demand candle”—a large, typically green candlestick that emerges after a protracted correction. Ethereum printed such a candle in May 2025 following nearly a year of sideways chop and five months of drawdown. Historically, these demand candles have marked the start of significant uptrends. Kevin cited analogous structures in 2016, 2018, and during the COVID-19 crash in 2020, all of which preceded multi-month rallies. “This may be the most textbook demand candle we’ve ever had,” he noted, adding that “the last time we saw something like this was before ETH ran for nearly a year with barely any major correction.” Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Supporting the candle analysis is a synchronized bullish turn in several technical indicators. The Market Cipher momentum wave has clipped into the oversold zone and printed a confirmed green dot buy signal. Simultaneously, the VWAP—volume-weighted average price—has crossed above the zero line, and money flow has started to trend upward. Kevin was explicit about the importance of this configuration: “Let me tell you something: this is a big deal.” The monthly RSI, currently sitting at 51, has not yet broken the crucial 70-level that historically marks the onset of parabolic price action. According to Kevin, “ETH has never even broken 70 this cycle. You haven’t seen what’s possible yet for Ethereum—or for altcoins in general. You’ve seen nothing yet.” He also highlighted the return of whale accumulation, measured through a proprietary “whale money flow” indicator. After exiting ETH positions for over a year—from March 2024 to May 2025—whale flows have shown a V-shaped bottom and are now turning up. “We are now starting to see accumulation durably here,” Kevin said. “You keep hearing that BlackRock’s buying ETH, and I don’t know if that’s reflected in this indicator, but we are definitely seeing whale activity occur on the monthly time frame.” The analyst went further, showing that Ethereum’s stock RSI on the monthly timeframe has not only bottomed out but is now rebounding sharply—a pattern that historically precedes long-duration uptrends. “This is aggressive movement,” he explained, noting that for confirmation, the RSI still needs to cross the 20-level, but emphasized that the current shape of the rebound is stronger than in previous cycles. Ethereum Shows Relative Strength Another key piece of the puzzle is Ethereum’s dominance chart, which tracks ETH’s market cap relative to the rest of the crypto space excluding Bitcoin. Kevin pointed to a potential double bottom on the monthly chart and a newly confirmed MACD momentum shift, the first in over two years. “That’s two years and one month of downtrend finally reversing,” he said. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Finally, the ETH/BTC pair is showing a near-identical structure to Ethereum’s dominance chart. Kevin believes this confluence is key. “Look at that—wow, that’s funny—it looks the same. You find your major low right where you found it in 2020. The monthly indicators are all curling up.” Still, he remained measured in his optimism, noting that macroeconomic conditions—particularly monetary policy—remain essential for confirming the bullish case. “It’s going to take some monetary policy shifting. We still need inflation to come in line. But the market is living four to six months ahead. If the market starts to sniff out that easing is coming, we’ll see that reflected in asset prices before it happens.” Referencing cycle theory and historical post-halving performance, Kevin argued that ETH’s recent relative strength fits both narratives. “Typically, ETH and altcoins start to outperform Bitcoin in the post-halving year. We’re halfway through that window—and it looks like it’s finally starting.” Looking ahead, he sees Ethereum as the “major key” that unlocks broad altcoin outperformance. “ETH opens the door to soaking up market cap, which will then leak down into mid-caps and small-caps. Everything starts with ETH.” While reiterating that patience is crucial, Kevin concluded with conviction: “The monthly timeframe indicators have never been more historically on our side. I think we’re on the verge of something really big.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,739.

According to James Seyffart, these three classes currently have a 90% likelihood of receiving FDA approval in 2025, according to their updated prediction. The applications for these ETFs have already been submitted by big companies involving Grayscale, Bitwise, Hashdex, Franklin, and VanEck. These filings recently became officially recognized by the SEC and final decision dates are now set between mid-2025 and end of 2025. I wrote about this topic a bit today as well.

Dogecoin follows with an 80% probability, while other assets such as Cardano, Polkadot, HBAR, and Avalanche are estimated to have a 75% chance of getting the green light. Newer assets like Sui are rated a 60% chance and that Tron’s ETF filing is unlikely to be looked at until 2026. Bloomberg’s analysts calculated the odds by analyzing the past acknowledgment of applications by the SEC, the actual deadlines the firm has to make a final decision and on the odds of those cryptos being considered commodities, which could facilitate the approving process. Is Solana Leading the Race? The U.S.SEC could green-light ETFs following broad crypto indexes already next month. And among the individual cryptocurrencies, Solana seems to be setting the pace. Analysts say Solana could be the next big asset to have a spot ETF, trailing Bitcoin and Ethereum. The update arrives as seven issuers have already submitted applications for spot Solana ETFs. Regulators could also step in early on Solana and staking-based ETF filings, the report adds. This has been spurred on in part by Rex-Osprey’s recent pivot to create workarounds to the legal restrictions, through which the issuer has launched staking products for Solana and Ethereum. “Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way,” Eric Balchunas wrote.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|LTC|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-11 03:04:39

The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the company recently submitted paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission. By using the confidential filing route, Bullish can move ahead with its IPO preparations without immediately disclosing its financial details, a strategy that has become popular among high-profile startups testing market waters. This marks Bullish’s second attempt at going public. The exchange previously sought a listing through a special purpose acquisition company in 2021, but the deal collapsed in 2022 after a steep decline in tech valuations and rising US interest rates. Jefferies has been tapped as lead underwriter for the offering. Bullish didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Peter Thiel-backed crypto group Bullish files for Wall Street IPO https://t.co/pr22AlV4FQ — FT Markets (@FTMarkets) June 11, 2025 Bullish Eyes Wall Street As Trump Era Revives Crypto Optimism Bullish’s renewed IPO push comes as the US crypto market shows fresh signs of life. Since Donald Trump returned to office, his administration has taken a markedly more supportive stance on digital assets, rolling back restrictions imposed under President Joe Biden. Trump has spoken favorably of Bitcoin in recent months, even after previously calling it a scam. His family has leaned into crypto too, with sons Donald Jr and Eric recently voicing support at a blockchain conference in Las Vegas. Crypto Exchanges Capitalize on Renewed Enthusiasm and Policy Shifts Bitcoin prices have surged past the US$100,000 mark, fueling a rush of capital into crypto-related listings. Last week, stablecoin issuer Circle raised $1.1b in its IPO and soared 168 percent on debut, delivering the strongest first-day gain for a billion-dollar US listing, according to Renaissance Capital. Buoyed by that momentum, Gemini, the exchange run by the Winklevoss twins, also filed confidentially for a US IPO last Friday. Both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been vocal backers of Trump’s re-election efforts and support crypto-friendly policymaking. Bullish positions itself as a blockchain-native exchange offering deep liquidity and tight spreads. CEO Tom Farley, a veteran of traditional finance, previously served as president of the NYSE Group. With Farley at the helm and Thiel’s backing, the firm now hopes to ride the wave of political support and investor optimism to a successful Wall Street listing. The move signals a broader shift in the crypto landscape, as once-skeptical regulators and investors show new openness to integrating digital assets into mainstream finance.

This isn’t just about monetary policy; it’s about international relations, economic strategy, and the intricate dance between nations regarding currency valuations. For anyone tracking macroeconomic trends, including those in the cryptocurrency space who understand how global liquidity and policy shifts impact asset prices, the SNB’s recent stance on FX intervention is a crucial watch point. Understanding SNB FX Intervention and its Purpose The SNB has historically been quite active in the foreign exchange market. Their primary tool? Buying or selling foreign currencies, predominantly euros and dollars, to influence the value of the Swiss Franc (CHF) . The main goal of this intervention is usually to prevent excessive appreciation of the Franc. Why would a central bank want a weaker currency? Here are a few key reasons: Export Competitiveness: A weaker Franc makes Swiss goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting exports, which are vital for the Swiss economy. Inflation Targeting: Currency strength can impact import prices and overall inflation levels. Deflation Prevention: In times of low inflation or deflation risk, a stronger currency can exacerbate these pressures by making imports cheaper. Economic Stability: Managing currency strength is seen as a way to maintain overall economic stability and support growth. For years, the SNB has been a prominent player in this space, accumulating a large balance sheet of foreign currency reserves as a result of its intervention efforts to keep the Swiss Franc from strengthening too much. What is the US Treasury Watch List and Why Does it Matter? The US Treasury watch list is part of a semi-annual report to Congress that identifies countries engaging in currency practices that could potentially harm US economic interests. Being placed on this list doesn’t automatically mean a country is labeled a currency manipulator, but it signals that the US Treasury is closely monitoring its actions. The criteria the US Treasury uses typically involve three main points: A significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States. A material current account surplus. Persistent, one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market. Switzerland has appeared on this list because it often meets the first two criteria and has historically engaged in substantial FX intervention . While being on the watch list doesn’t trigger immediate penalties, it increases scrutiny and can lead to further analysis and potential consultations. Avoiding the more serious designation of ‘currency manipulator’ is a clear objective for countries on the list, as that could potentially lead to punitive measures or trade restrictions. The Crucial Shift: SNB Pauses Interventions Amidst Scrutiny In light of being on the US Treasury watch list , the SNB has made a notable adjustment to its policy regarding FX intervention . Instead of actively selling Francs (buying foreign currency) to weaken the currency, the bank has indicated it is refraining from such interventions. This marks a significant pivot from its previous, more interventionist stance. This strategic change is largely seen as a direct response to the pressure and scrutiny from the United States. By stepping back from large-scale currency purchases, the SNB aims to avoid meeting the criteria for persistent, one-sided intervention, thereby reducing the risk of being labeled a currency manipulation country. This decision isn’t just technical; it’s a major policy signal. It suggests that external diplomatic and economic pressures are influencing the SNB’s operational toolkit, at least for the time being. The priority appears to be navigating the complex international landscape and maintaining good economic relations, particularly with a major trading partner like the United States. How Does This Impact the Swiss Franc (CHF)? When a central bank steps away from actively weakening its currency through FX intervention , the natural forces of the market tend to take over more prominently. For the Swiss Franc , which is often seen as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty, this typically means potential for appreciation. Without the SNB acting as a consistent buyer of foreign currency (seller of CHF), demand for the Franc relative to other currencies could push its value higher. This can have several effects: Stronger CHF/USD and CHF/EUR pairs: The Franc may gain ground against the US Dollar and the Euro. Impact on Swiss Exports: A stronger Franc makes Swiss exports more expensive abroad, potentially challenging export-oriented industries. Impact on Imports: Conversely, a stronger Franc makes imports cheaper, which can help dampen inflation. Safe-Haven Flows: In times of market stress, the CHF might see even stronger inflows without SNB resistance. Market participants are now closely watching the Swiss Franc ‘s movements, aware that the SNB’s ‘hand’ is less visible in the market than it used to be. The currency’s value will likely be more determined by interest rate differentials, global risk sentiment, and other macroeconomic factors. Broader Implications: Currency Manipulation and Global Markets The situation with the SNB and the US Treasury watch list highlights the ongoing tensions and debates surrounding currency valuations in the global economy. While countries have sovereign rights to manage their monetary policy, their actions can have significant spillover effects on other nations, particularly through trade competitiveness. This scenario serves as a reminder that: Currency Policy is Interconnected: One country’s currency management impacts others. Trade and Currency are Linked: Trade imbalances often fuel discussions about currency valuation. Political Factors Influence Central Banks: External political and diplomatic considerations can influence central bank decisions, even for independent institutions like the SNB. For investors and traders, including those in the cryptocurrency space, these developments are relevant because they speak to broader shifts in global liquidity, trade flows, and risk dynamics. Changes in major currency pairs like CHF/USD or CHF/EUR can influence capital movements and market sentiment more broadly. Benefits and Challenges of the SNB’s Policy Shift This change in approach comes with its own set of pros and cons for Switzerland: Benefits: Reduced risk of US designation as a currency manipulation country, avoiding potential trade repercussions or diplomatic strain. Increased credibility regarding adherence to international norms on currency practices. Allows market forces to play a larger role in determining the Swiss Franc ‘s value. Challenges: Loss of a key tool for managing the strength of the Swiss Franc . Potential for significant CHF appreciation, which could negatively impact export-oriented industries and economic growth. Less control over imported inflation dynamics. Increased reliance on interest rates as the primary monetary policy tool. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers Given the SNB’s altered stance, what should market participants, especially those following global macro trends, keep in mind? Monitor CHF Crosses: Pay close attention to how the Swiss Franc trades against major currencies like the USD and EUR. Look for signs of sustained appreciation. Watch SNB Communication: While they’ve paused intervention, the SNB’s forward guidance and economic outlook statements remain critical for understanding their policy intentions. Assess Safe-Haven Demand: The CHF’s role as a safe haven might become more pronounced without intervention dampening its rise during risk-off periods. Consider Macro Impact: Understand that a stronger CHF can have implications for global capital flows and the competitiveness of European economies, which can indirectly affect broader market sentiment and asset valuations, including in crypto. This situation underscores the importance of staying informed about central bank actions and international economic policy, as they form the backdrop against which all financial markets operate. Conclusion: A Strategic Pause Under Pressure The Swiss National Bank ‘s decision to step back from active FX intervention is a direct consequence of being placed on the US Treasury watch list . This strategic pause highlights the influence of international pressure on domestic monetary policy decisions. While it helps Switzerland avoid potential accusations of currency manipulation and maintains diplomatic relations, it also means the SNB loses a significant tool for managing the strength of the Swiss Franc . This shift is poised to allow market forces greater sway over the CHF’s value, with potential implications for Swiss exports and the broader currency landscape. It’s a clear example of how global economic interdependence and diplomatic considerations shape the actions of even the most independent central banks.

For too long, navigating the legal landscape for digital assets in the United States has felt like traversing a maze with shifting walls. This uncertainty impacts everything from innovation and investment to consumer protection. That’s why the recent news surrounding Brian Quintenz, the nominee for chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is generating significant interest. Quintenz has stepped forward with a clear pledge: to bring much-needed clarity to US crypto regulation . Who is Brian Quintenz and Why Does His Nomination Matter for Brian Quintenz CFTC ? Brian Quintenz isn’t a newcomer to the regulatory or crypto space. He previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2020, giving him direct experience within the agency he’s now nominated to lead. Following his time at the CFTC, he took on a role as head of policy for a16z crypto, the dedicated crypto fund of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. This background is particularly noteworthy. His tenure at a16z crypto placed him at the heart of the industry, engaging directly with developers, entrepreneurs, and investors grappling with the existing regulatory ambiguity. This unique perspective—having seen the challenges from both the regulator’s and the innovator’s side—positions him to potentially bridge gaps and foster a more workable framework for Brian Quintenz CFTC leadership. His nomination hearing is a critical step, scheduled for June 11, where he will outline his vision and face questions from lawmakers. The Urgent Need for Clear US Crypto Regulation Why is regulatory clarity such a hot topic? The current state of US crypto regulation is often described as fragmented and inconsistent. Different agencies, primarily the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have asserted jurisdiction over various aspects of the crypto market, sometimes leading to overlapping or conflicting guidance. This lack of a unified, clear framework creates significant hurdles: Hindered Innovation: Startups and established companies are hesitant to build and launch new products or services for fear of running afoul of regulations that aren’t clearly defined. Investor Uncertainty: Both retail and institutional investors face confusion regarding which assets are regulated how, and under whose authority, impacting confidence and participation. Market Fragmentation: The lack of clear rules can push legitimate crypto businesses to operate outside the U.S., potentially limiting domestic growth and job creation. Enforcement by Litigation: Without clear rules, regulators have often resorted to enforcement actions to signal their stance, which is costly, time-consuming, and reactive rather than proactive. Quintenz’s pledge directly addresses this pain point, suggesting a potential shift towards a more proactive and structured approach to establishing US crypto regulation . Understanding the CFTC’s Role in CFTC Crypto Regulation The CFTC’s primary mandate is to protect market participants from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to futures, swaps, and other derivatives. Under current law, the CFTC generally regulates crypto assets that are deemed commodities. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, have been referred to as commodities by CFTC officials in the past, particularly in the context of futures markets. The CFTC’s involvement in CFTC crypto regulation has historically focused on derivatives products like Bitcoin futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges. They have also pursued enforcement actions against platforms and individuals involved in fraudulent activities related to commodity-classified digital assets. Quintenz, having served at the CFTC, is intimately familiar with the agency’s powers and limitations. His nomination signals an intent to leverage the CFTC’s existing authority while potentially advocating for legislative changes to broaden or clarify its role in overseeing the broader spot crypto market, especially concerning preventing manipulation and ensuring market integrity. This focus on market oversight is a critical component of his stated goals. Tackling the Complex Challenge of Token Classification One of the most significant challenges in regulating crypto assets is determining what they actually are from a legal perspective. Are they securities, commodities, or something else entirely? This question of token classification is central because it dictates which regulatory body has primary jurisdiction (SEC for securities, CFTC for commodities, etc.) and what rules apply. Quintenz’s emphasis on token classification is crucial. A clear, consistent framework for classifying digital assets based on their characteristics and use cases could provide the foundational clarity the market desperately needs. This isn’t a simple task, as many tokens have hybrid features or evolve over time. Potential approaches to token classification could involve: Developing specific tests tailored to digital assets, potentially building upon existing frameworks like the Howey Test (used for securities). Creating new legislative categories for certain types of tokens. Providing clear guidance on when a token transitions from potentially being a security (e.g., during a fundraising event) to potentially being a commodity or utility token (e.g., when a network becomes decentralized and functional). Quintenz’s background, including his time engaging with the diverse range of projects at a16z crypto, suggests he understands the nuances involved in token classification and the need for a practical, forward-looking approach. What Could Quintenz’s Leadership Mean for Crypto Market Oversight ? Beyond classification, Quintenz’s focus on crypto market oversight aims to ensure fair and orderly markets, prevent manipulation, and protect participants. This involves looking at exchanges, trading platforms, and other intermediaries. Effective crypto market oversight under the CFTC could involve: Establishing clear rules for crypto trading platforms that list commodity-classified digital assets. Implementing surveillance mechanisms to detect fraud and manipulation across these markets. Setting standards for customer protection and custody of digital assets under CFTC purview. Working with international regulators to address the global nature of crypto markets. His experience at the CFTC gives him insight into the tools and strategies the agency uses for traditional markets. The challenge and opportunity lie in adapting these tools effectively for the unique characteristics of decentralized digital asset markets. His time in the industry likely provided valuable insights into the operational realities and technological capabilities of crypto platforms, which could inform a pragmatic approach to crypto market oversight . Potential Benefits of Quintenz’s Approach If Quintenz is confirmed and successfully implements his vision for clear US crypto regulation , the benefits could be substantial: Increased Investment: Institutional investors, often wary of regulatory uncertainty, could feel more comfortable entering the market. Boosted Innovation: Developers and entrepreneurs would have a clearer path to build and deploy new technologies and services within the U.S. Enhanced Consumer Protection: Clear rules can better protect individuals from scams, fraud, and market manipulation. Greater Market Integrity: Defined oversight helps build trust in the market’s fairness and reliability. U.S. Leadership: Establishing a clear framework could position the U.S. as a leader in the global digital asset space. Challenges on the Horizon Despite the optimistic outlook, the path to clear CFTC crypto regulation and broader U.S. clarity is not without challenges: Congressional Action: Much of the desired clarity may require new legislation from Congress, which can be a slow and politically complex process. Inter-Agency Coordination: Effective regulation requires seamless cooperation between the CFTC, SEC, and other relevant bodies like the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve. Historical tensions or differing views can complicate this. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance between protecting investors and fostering technological advancement is a delicate act. Overly strict rules could stifle innovation. Market Volatility and Evolution: The crypto market is constantly evolving with new assets and technologies, requiring regulations to be adaptable and forward-thinking. Looking Ahead: The June 11th Hearing and Beyond The upcoming nomination hearing on June 11th will be a crucial moment. It will provide the first public opportunity for Quintenz to elaborate on his plans for US crypto regulation , his approach to token classification , and his strategy for crypto market oversight under the banner of CFTC crypto regulation . Lawmakers will likely probe his views on key issues, his relationship with other regulators, and how he plans to navigate the complex political landscape. His confirmation, if it occurs, would place someone with direct industry experience and a stated commitment to clarity at the helm of a key U.S. financial regulator during a pivotal time for digital assets. While significant legislative hurdles may remain, a clear, proactive stance from the CFTC under his leadership could provide a vital piece of the regulatory puzzle, offering a potential blueprint for other agencies and Congress to follow. A Compelling Summary Brian Quintenz’s nomination for CFTC chair and his pledge to clarify US crypto regulation represent a significant development for the digital asset space. With his unique background spanning both regulatory enforcement and direct industry policy, he is positioned to potentially bring a pragmatic and informed approach to complex issues like token classification and crypto market oversight . While challenges remain, particularly regarding legislative action and inter-agency coordination, a confirmed Quintenz could spearhead efforts within the CFTC to provide the clarity that the market desperately needs, fostering greater innovation, investment, and protection within the rapidly evolving world of crypto assets under clear CFTC crypto regulation .

U.S Representative William Timmons from South Carolina is urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to release internal documents explaining its changing stance on Ethereum’s legal status over the years. Asking for Ethereum Internal Documents In his letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins , Timmons expressed concern over what he described as the SEC’s “zigzagging” behavior when it comes to ETH. He noted that the public and crypto market participants deserve transparency, especially after years of mixed signals from the agency. To get to the bottom of it, Timmons has requested key internal documents from the SEC. These include: Emails discussing Ethereum and whether it qualifies as a security Records about the ETH 2.0 investigation Files titled “ETH – Security or Not” and similar subjects These documents were previously identified in a lawsuit involving Coinbase but had not been shared publicly. 2018 Promise, 2025 Confusion Back in 2018, the SEC’s Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, stated that Ether and Bitcoin would not be treated as securities. This made people in the crypto community feel more secure. But, under Chair Gary Gensler and the Biden administration, the rules seem less clear, as they refused to offer more clarity on their security status. Meanwhile, Timmons pointed out that this confusion is bad for businesses and for regular people who are interested in crypto. He said, “The American people and the crypto community deserve transparency as Congress moves forward with the CLARITY Act.” I just sent a letter to SEC Chair Atkins requesting documents on the SEC’s inconsistent treatment of ETH under Chair Gensler and the Biden administration.

A recent announcement from Riot Platforms has caught the attention of the market: the company has offloaded a significant portion of its holdings in fellow Bitcoin Mining firm, Bitfarms. This move, involving the sale of 1.75 million Bitfarms shares valued at approximately $1.58 million, reduces Riot’s stake and potentially reshapes the competitive landscape. Understanding the Riot Platforms Sale Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), a prominent player in the North American Bitcoin mining sector, disclosed the sale of 1.75 million shares of its competitor, Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF). This transaction was reported by CoinDesk and represents a notable divestment. Here are the key details of the sale: Shares Sold: 1,750,000 Bitfarms shares Estimated Value: Approximately $1.58 million Previous Stake: Not explicitly stated in the snippet, but context implies it was higher than the resulting stake. Resulting Stake: Riot’s ownership in Bitfarms is now reduced to 14.3%. This sale comes after a period of heightened interaction between the two companies, stemming from Riot’s earlier attempts to acquire Bitfarms. A Look Back: The Riot-Bitfarms Saga It’s impossible to discuss Riot’s sale of Bitfarms shares without acknowledging the recent history between the two entities. For a period, Riot Platforms pursued an acquisition of Bitfarms, aiming to create a mining giant. This pursuit led to considerable tension and a public management dispute between the two companies. Key points from that period include: Riot’s unsolicited acquisition proposal. Bitfarms’ resistance to the takeover bid. Public exchanges and disagreements over company valuation and strategy. The eventual settlement of the management dispute in September of the previous year. The settlement seemingly cooled the acquisition ambitions, and this recent sale indicates a further step away from deep entanglement between the two, at least from Riot’s perspective as a major shareholder. Why Did Riot Platforms Sell? Exploring Potential Reasons While the official reason for the sale hasn’t been detailed beyond the announcement itself, market observers and analysts can speculate on several potential drivers behind Riot Platforms’ decision to offload Bitfarms shares: 1. Capital Allocation Strategy: Riot may be raising capital for its own operational needs, expansion plans, or investments in its core infrastructure. Selling a non-controlling stake in a competitor can be a way to unlock value from an investment that is no longer strategic or has served its purpose. 2. Strategic Refocus: The sale could signal Riot’s intention to focus purely on its internal growth and operations rather than maintaining a significant stake in a direct competitor, especially after the failed acquisition attempt and settled dispute. 3. Market Conditions: Given the volatility inherent in Crypto Mining Stocks , Riot might believe this is an opportune time to realize gains or limit exposure to a specific asset, potentially re-deploying funds into areas they control directly. 4. Reducing Exposure Post-Dispute: Following a public dispute and settled differences, reducing a large ownership stake might simply be a clean way for both companies to move forward independently without one holding a significant influence over the other. Without direct commentary from Riot Platforms, these remain potential explanations, but they highlight the strategic considerations major companies in the Bitcoin Mining space face. What Does This Sale Mean for RIOT Stock and BITF Stock? For investors holding or considering RIOT Stock and BITF Stock , this sale carries different implications: For RIOT Stock: The sale injects approximately $1.58 million in capital into Riot’s treasury. While not a massive sum for a company of Riot’s size, it adds liquidity. It reduces Riot’s exposure to the performance of Bitfarms. Riot’s future will now be less tied to BITF’s operational successes or challenges. It could be interpreted positively as Riot focusing on its core business, or neutrally as a portfolio adjustment. For BITF Stock: The sale removes a large shareholder from Bitfarms’ cap table. While Riot still holds a significant 14.3%, the reduced stake means Riot’s influence or potential future actions (like further sales) are somewhat lessened. Depending on how the shares were sold (e.g., on the open market), it could potentially exert temporary selling pressure on BITF shares. It solidifies Bitfarms’ independence from Riot following the failed acquisition attempt. The market’s reaction to this news will ultimately determine the short-term price impact on both stocks, but the strategic implications are clear: Riot is reducing its direct investment link to Bitfarms. Challenges and Opportunities in Bitcoin Mining The context for this sale is the dynamic and often challenging Bitcoin Mining industry. Miners face numerous factors influencing their profitability and strategy: Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Mining revenue is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate wildly. Increasing Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining increases, requiring more computational power for the same reward. Energy Costs: Electricity is the primary operational cost, and volatile or high energy prices can significantly impact margins. Halving Events: The periodic halving of the Bitcoin block reward (the most recent one occurred recently) cuts the primary source of revenue for miners in half, forcing them to become more efficient or find alternative revenue streams. Hardware Costs: Acquiring and maintaining the latest generation of mining rigs requires significant capital investment. Opportunities: Technological Advancements: Development of more efficient mining hardware (ASICs) can provide a competitive edge. Favorable Energy Deals: Securing low-cost, stable, and potentially renewable energy sources is crucial for profitability. Scaling Operations: Building large-scale, efficient data centers can lower per-unit costs. Vertical Integration: Some miners explore hosting services, equipment repair, or even proprietary mining pool operations. Strategic Capital Management: Moves like the one made by Riot – selling non-core assets – demonstrate active management to navigate the capital-intensive nature of the business. Riot’s sale of Bitfarms shares can be seen as part of a broader strategy to navigate these challenges and capitalize on opportunities, potentially freeing up resources to tackle internal goals or react to market shifts. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors interested in Crypto Mining Stocks like RIOT and BITF, this event underscores several important points: Monitor Strategic Moves: Pay attention to how major miners manage their assets, raise capital, and adjust their investment portfolios. These actions can signal confidence (or lack thereof) in certain areas or strategies. Understand Company Relationships: Be aware of significant cross-holdings or past acquisition attempts between companies in the same sector. These relationships can influence decision-making. Assess Capital Needs: Consider whether a company might need to raise funds through equity sales, debt, or asset divestitures, especially in the wake of the halving and ongoing operational costs. Evaluate Core Business Strength: Ultimately, the performance of RIOT Stock and BITF Stock will depend heavily on their core mining efficiency, energy strategy, balance sheet health, and execution capabilities in a post-halving environment. While the $1.58 million sale is relatively small in the grand scheme of Riot’s market capitalization, it’s a tangible action that reflects strategic thinking within the company. Conclusion: A Strategic Adjustment in the Mining Landscape Riot Platforms’ decision to sell 1.75 million Bitfarms shares for $1.58 million marks a notable step in the relationship between the two Bitcoin Mining companies. Following a settled dispute over a failed acquisition attempt, this divestment reduces Riot’s stake to 14.3% and signals a potential strategic adjustment. Whether driven by capital needs, a refocus on core operations, or a response to market conditions, the sale highlights the dynamic capital management required in the volatile crypto mining sector. For investors, it’s a reminder to look beyond headlines and consider the strategic implications of such moves on both the selling and holding companies within the competitive landscape of Crypto Mining Stocks .

Specifically, community members are reporting that Alby has withdrawn funds from their inactive Bitcoin wallet accounts without explicit recent permission. This development, initially highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X, has understandably caused significant concern and discussion within the crypto community, bringing the spotlight onto platform terms of service and how user funds are managed. What Exactly Happened with the Alby Wallet and User Funds? The core of the issue stems from Alby’s terms of service, particularly as they apply to certain types of accounts created in the past. According to reports and a look at Alby’s stated policies, the platform has a provision regarding shared wallets linked to legacy accounts. These are accounts established in 2023 or earlier. The policy reportedly states that if such a shared wallet remains inactive for a continuous period of 12 months – defined as having no transactions whatsoever – Alby reserves the right to deduct the full balance held within that specific wallet. This action, reportedly taken under the terms of this specific crypto wallet policy , has led to users finding their Bitcoin funds depleted without a recent, direct notification or request for permission for the withdrawal itself. While the policy may be written into the terms users agreed to, the practical outcome of losing funds from an seemingly forgotten or inactive account has sparked significant criticism. Understanding Alby’s Crypto Wallet Policy on Inactivity To fully grasp the situation, it is crucial to understand the context of Alby’s operations. Alby functions as a browser extension and platform primarily focused on connecting users to the Bitcoin and Lightning Network. It facilitates payments and interactions within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Like many services that handle user assets, even in a partially custodial or facilitated manner, platforms often have terms governing inactive accounts. However, the specific nature of deducting the entire balance from an inactive Bitcoin wallet associated with legacy accounts is what has caused alarm. Users in the crypto space often hold a strong belief in sovereignty over their assets, encapsulated by the phrase “not your keys, not your coin.” While Alby for some functions involves custodial elements (especially for Lightning or simplified user experience), users still expect a high degree of control and security for their user funds . Key aspects of the reported policy: Applies to shared wallets. Linked to legacy accounts (created in 2023 or earlier). Triggered by 12 consecutive months of inactivity (no transactions). Allows deduction of the full wallet balance. This differs from standard practices like applying small inactivity fees, which are sometimes seen in traditional finance or even some older online service accounts. The deduction of the full balance is perceived by many as a drastic measure. Why Does an Inactive Bitcoin Wallet Policy Matter So Much? The reaction to Alby’s action highlights fundamental expectations within the cryptocurrency community regarding asset ownership and platform responsibility. When users deposit Bitcoin funds into a wallet or onto a platform, they expect those funds to remain accessible and secure, barring explicit user action or perhaps extreme, clearly communicated circumstances like platform insolvency (which is not the case here). The concept of an inactive Bitcoin wallet losing its balance due to a policy, even if technically agreed upon in terms of service, raises questions about: User Awareness: Were users sufficiently aware of this specific clause, especially for older accounts? Terms of service documents can be lengthy and complex. Communication: Was there adequate recent communication or warning sent to users with potentially affected inactive Bitcoin wallet balances before the deduction took place? Proportionality: Is deducting the full balance a proportionate response to account inactivity? Trust: Actions like this can erode trust in platforms, even those facilitating beneficial services like the Lightning Network. Users need confidence that their user funds are safe. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of understanding the specific terms governing any platform where you hold cryptocurrency, whether it is an exchange, a custodial wallet, or a service like the Alby wallet . Protecting Your User Funds: Actionable Insights For users concerned about their assets, particularly those using or who have used an Alby wallet or similar services, several actionable steps can be taken: Check Your Alby Account: If you have an Alby account, especially one created before 2024, log in and check your balance and transaction history. Verify the status of any wallets you may have. Review Terms of Service: Make it a practice to review the terms and conditions of any platform where you store or manage cryptocurrency. Pay close attention to clauses regarding inactivity, fees, and asset handling. Understand the specific crypto wallet policy of each service you use. Understand Wallet Types: Differentiate between non-custodial wallets (where you hold the private keys) and custodial or semi-custodial solutions (where the platform holds the keys on your behalf). Custodial solutions inherently carry counterparty risk and are subject to the platform’s policies. Alby, especially for simplified Lightning use, involves elements of platform management of funds. Maintain Activity: If you have funds in a wallet or on a platform with an inactivity policy, make a small transaction periodically (e.g., once every few months) to ensure it is registered as active. Even sending a few satoshis can suffice. Consolidate Funds: For significant amounts of Bitcoin funds , consider holding them in a non-custodial wallet where you control the private keys. Use platforms like Alby primarily for smaller, transactional amounts if you are uncomfortable with their specific policies regarding inactivity. Contact Support: If you believe funds were incorrectly deducted or you need clarification on your account status and the crypto wallet policy , contact Alby support directly. This situation underscores that the responsibility for safeguarding user funds ultimately lies with the user being informed and proactive about how their assets are held and managed by third-party services. Broader Implications for Crypto Wallet Policy and User Trust The incident with the Alby wallet is more than just an isolated event; it highlights broader tensions and challenges in the cryptocurrency space: Balancing Usability and Sovereignty: Platforms like Alby aim to make using Bitcoin and Lightning easier, which often involves abstracting away some complexities, sometimes leading to solutions that are not strictly non-custodial. Finding the right balance between ease of use and ensuring users retain ultimate control and understanding of their Bitcoin funds is an ongoing challenge. Transparency: While the policy might be in the terms, the lack of perceived clear, recent communication before the action for legacy inactive Bitcoin wallet holders is a major point of contention. Platforms need to be hyper-transparent, especially when policies can lead to loss of assets. The “Fine Print” Problem: This event serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of reading and understanding the terms of service, no matter how tedious it seems. A platform’s crypto wallet policy is legally binding. Industry Standards: The crypto industry is still maturing. Establishing clearer norms around handling inactive accounts, especially concerning forfeiture of assets, is important for building long-term trust. Ultimately, trust is paramount in the relationship between users and crypto platforms. Incidents where user funds are affected unexpectedly, even based on existing terms, can damage that trust and reinforce the need for users to be vigilant and informed. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Inactive Bitcoin Wallet Holders The reports of Alby withdrawing funds from inactive Bitcoin wallet balances associated with legacy accounts have sent ripples through the community, prompting discussions about platform policies, user awareness, and the safety of user funds . While Alby’s actions appear to be based on a specific clause within their crypto wallet policy for older, inactive shared wallets, the lack of perceived clear communication and the nature of deducting the full balance have rightly raised concerns. This situation serves as a critical reminder for everyone holding cryptocurrency on third-party platforms: understand the terms, stay aware of your account status, and consider the risks associated with custodial solutions. For those with an Alby wallet , especially older ones, checking your account and activity status is a prudent step. As the crypto space evolves, clear communication and user-friendly policies that respect the principle of asset sovereignty will be key to building enduring trust.

Recent analysis from Citi indicates a significant potential for JPY underperformance , a forecast that warrants attention from investors monitoring global trends. What is Behind Citi’s JPY Underperformance Forecast? Citi’s view on the potential weakness of the Japanese Yen stems from several converging macroeconomic factors. Analysts point primarily to the divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of Japan and other major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Monetary Policy Divergence: While other central banks have aggressively tightened policy to combat inflation, the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose stance, keeping interest rates exceptionally low. This creates a significant yield differential, making Yen-denominated assets less attractive compared to those in regions with higher rates. Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between Japanese interest rates and those in the US and Europe remains wide. This encourages ‘carry trade’ strategies, where investors borrow in low-yielding Yen and invest in higher-yielding currencies, putting downward pressure on the Yen. Global Economic Context: The global economic outlook, coupled with commodity price movements and trade balances, also plays a role in currency valuations. Citi’s Yen forecast considers these external pressures on Japan’s economy and currency. How Does the Bank of Japan’s Stance Impact the Yen Forecast? The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is a central player in the Yen forecast . Its commitment to yield curve control (YCC) and negative interest rates, despite global inflationary pressures, is a primary driver of the Yen’s weakness. While there has been speculation about potential shifts in BoJ policy, the bank has largely maintained its accommodative stance, reinforcing the yield differential that weighs on the currency. Any future adjustments to YCC or interest rates by the Bank of Japan would be a critical event for the Forex market and could significantly alter the Yen’s trajectory. However, Citi’s current analysis suggests that the conditions supporting Yen weakness are likely to persist in the near term. Exploring the Implications for the Forex Market Citi’s expectation of JPY underperformance has direct implications for participants in the Forex market . Traders and investors holding or trading Yen pairs (like USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY) need to factor this outlook into their strategies. A weaker Yen can impact export competitiveness for Japan and influence global trade flows. For those trading other currency pairs, understanding the Yen’s potential moves is important as it can influence overall market sentiment and cross-currency correlations. The carry trade, fueled by the BoJ’s low rates, remains a prominent strategy, contributing to demand for other currencies against the Yen. This dynamic is a key feature of the current Forex market landscape. What Does Citi’s Analysis Suggest for Investors? For investors, particularly those with international portfolios or exposure to currency risk, Citi’s Citi analysis provides a potential heads-up. While this is not investment advice, the outlook suggests considering the following: Currency Exposure: Reviewing exposure to the Japanese Yen in investment portfolios. Carry Trade Opportunities: Understanding the potential for continued carry trade dynamics in the Forex market. Macroeconomic Monitoring: Keeping a close watch on Bank of Japan policy announcements and global interest rate movements. Diversification: Considering diversification strategies that account for potential currency volatility. Citi’s perspective highlights the importance of staying informed about macroeconomic trends, as they ripple through traditional financial markets and can indirectly influence risk sentiment in markets like cryptocurrency. Challenges and Uncertainties in the JPY Forecast While Citi’s analysis points to potential JPY underperformance , the future is never without uncertainty. Several factors could challenge this outlook: Unexpected BoJ Shift: A sudden or faster-than-anticipated pivot in monetary policy by the Bank of Japan could lead to rapid Yen strengthening. Global Economic Shock: A significant global recession or geopolitical event could trigger safe-haven flows into the Yen, despite yield differentials. Changes in Inflation: While Japan’s inflation has risen, a sharp decline could reduce pressure on the BoJ to change policy, while persistent high inflation could eventually force their hand. These potential shifts underscore the need for continuous monitoring and risk management in the Forex market . Conclusion: Navigating Potential Yen Weakness Citi’s analysis serves as a significant indicator for market participants. The potential for sustained JPY underperformance is grounded in the clear divergence of monetary policy, driven primarily by the Bank of Japan ‘s unique stance amidst global tightening. This outlook impacts the Forex market directly, influencing trading strategies and investment decisions. While challenges and uncertainties exist, understanding the core drivers behind this Yen forecast , as highlighted by Citi analysis , is vital for navigating the complexities of the current macroeconomic environment.

The founder of MicroStrategy, a company that has made significant headlines for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, recently turned his attention to one of the globe’s largest and most influential companies: Apple. Saylor took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to make a compelling suggestion that sent ripples through both the tech and crypto communities: Apple should consider adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. Who is Michael Saylor and Why Does His Opinion Matter? Michael Saylor is not just the head of MicroStrategy; he has become one of the most vocal and prominent advocates for Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy began aggressively acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020, positioning the company as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency globally. This strategy shifted MicroStrategy’s focus, making it almost a proxy for Bitcoin investment for many investors. Saylor’s rationale is rooted in macroeconomics. He views traditional fiat currencies as subject to inflation and believes that holding large cash reserves can lead to a loss of purchasing power over time. Bitcoin, in his view, serves as a superior store of value – a form of digital gold that is scarce, decentralized, and resistant to censorship and inflation. His conviction is backed by MicroStrategy’s multi-billion dollar investment, demonstrating a deep commitment to this belief. Therefore, when Michael Saylor speaks about corporate Bitcoin adoption, the market listens, especially when the target company is a titan like Apple. The Suggestion: Apple Should Buy BTC The core of the recent discussion stems from Michael Saylor’s direct post on X. He specifically urged Apple to buy BTC, framing it as a strategic financial move. The suggestion immediately sparked widespread debate, given Apple’s immense cash reserves and its status as a technological trendsetter. Apple holds a massive amount of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet – often exceeding tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars. Managing this capital effectively is crucial for shareholder value. Saylor’s argument is that a portion of this vast reserve would be better preserved and potentially grown by converting it into Bitcoin, rather than holding it in traditional, low-yield, inflation-susceptible assets. What are the Potential Benefits of Apple Buying Bitcoin? Considering a move as significant as Apple buying Bitcoin involves weighing numerous potential advantages. For a company of Apple’s scale, the implications are vast and could set a precedent for other corporations. Balance Sheet Protection: Like MicroStrategy, Apple could use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, preserving the purchasing power of its capital reserves over the long term. Innovation Signal: Investing in Bitcoin would signal Apple’s forward-thinking approach and potential interest in the broader Web3 and blockchain space, aligning with its image as a leader in technology and innovation. Potential for Capital Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation. A strategic allocation could potentially enhance shareholder value through capital gains. Attracting Talent and Customers: A move into Bitcoin could resonate with a demographic interested in digital assets and decentralized technologies, potentially attracting both employees and consumers. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin (relative to traditional financial markets) could provide diversification benefits to Apple’s corporate treasury portfolio. What Challenges Could Apple Face with Bitcoin? Despite the potential benefits, Apple buying Bitcoin is far from a simple decision. There are significant hurdles and risks that a company of Apple’s profile would need to navigate carefully. Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. Holding a volatile asset on the balance sheet could expose Apple to significant quarterly fluctuations in reported earnings, which might concern investors accustomed to stable financial reporting. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Apple would need to consider potential changes in regulations, tax treatment, and compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. Shareholder Concerns: Some shareholders might be risk-averse or skeptical of cryptocurrencies, viewing a Bitcoin investment as speculative rather than prudent treasury management. Reputational Risk: Associating the Apple brand with a volatile and sometimes controversial asset like Bitcoin could carry reputational risks, particularly if there are significant price drops or negative public perception events related to crypto. Operational Complexity: Managing a large Bitcoin position involves significant operational and security considerations, including custody solutions, accounting treatment, and internal controls. How Could Institutional Adoption Impact Bitcoin? The concept of institutional adoption, where large corporations and financial institutions invest in or use Bitcoin, is a major theme in the crypto market. MicroStrategy’s move was a catalyst, followed by companies like Tesla and Block (formerly Square). If Apple were to buy BTC, the impact on the Bitcoin market would likely be profound. Apple’s scale means even a small percentage of its cash reserves allocated to Bitcoin would represent a significant purchase volume, potentially driving up the price. More importantly, it would lend immense credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, potentially encouraging other large corporations and institutional investors to follow suit. This widespread institutional adoption could increase market liquidity, reduce volatility over the long term (as more supply is held by long-term investors), and accelerate the development of infrastructure around Bitcoin. Why Does Michael Saylor Believe Apple Should Buy BTC? Michael Saylor’s advocacy for Apple buying Bitcoin stems directly from his core investment thesis. He sees Apple as a prime candidate for the reasons mentioned earlier: a massive cash hoard eroding in value due to inflation, a reputation for innovation that aligns with pioneering new financial strategies, and the potential to set a powerful example for the rest of the corporate world. Saylor often emphasizes that holding cash is not a risk-free strategy; it carries the implicit risk of losing purchasing power. He positions Bitcoin as a superior alternative for preserving capital over decades. For a company like Apple, planning for the very long term, this argument holds significant weight in Saylor’s view. He likely sees it as a logical extension of corporate finance in the digital age. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For While Apple has not publicly indicated any plans to buy Bitcoin for its treasury (beyond potentially holding some for specific services like Apple Pay integrations with crypto platforms, which is different from treasury management), Michael Saylor’s suggestion highlights a significant potential future trend. For investors and market watchers, key things to observe include: Any official statements or hints from Apple executives regarding their treasury strategy or views on digital assets. Other large corporations making similar moves to MicroStrategy, Tesla, or Block, indicating a broader trend of institutional adoption. Regulatory developments in major economies concerning corporate holdings of cryptocurrencies. Market reaction to Saylor’s comments and whether they inspire further debate or action within the corporate finance world. The discussion initiated by Michael Saylor serves as a reminder of the ongoing convergence between traditional finance, corporate strategy, and the burgeoning world of digital assets like Bitcoin. Conclusion: A Bold Suggestion for a Tech Giant Michael Saylor’s call for Apple to buy Bitcoin is more than just a passing comment; it’s a strategic suggestion rooted in a deep conviction about Bitcoin’s role as a future store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic instability. While the decision rests entirely with Apple’s leadership and board, the potential benefits of preserving capital, signaling innovation, and capitalizing on potential appreciation are clear from Saylor’s perspective. However, the significant challenges related to volatility, regulation, and shareholder sentiment mean such a move would require careful consideration and planning. Regardless of whether Apple takes the plunge, the conversation sparked by Michael Saylor underscores the growing relevance of Bitcoin in corporate treasury discussions and the potential for further institutional adoption to shape the future of finance.

The Moscow Exchange (MOEX), Russia’s primary stock exchange, is making a notable move by stepping further into the digital asset space. On June 10, MOEX is officially launching its own Bitcoin index , a benchmark designed to track the price movements of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a technical addition; it signals a potential shift in how traditional financial institutions in Russia view and interact with the volatile yet captivating crypto market. Let’s dive into what this MOEX BTC index means, how it works, and why it matters. What is the Moscow Exchange Launching and Why Now? The core news is straightforward: the Moscow Exchange will start calculating and publishing the MOEXBTC index from June 10. This index is intended to provide a transparent and accessible reference point for the price of Bitcoin against the US Dollar Tether (USDT), a widely used stablecoin in the crypto trading world. While Russia’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies has historically been cautious, with outright bans on using crypto for payments, there has been a gradual exploration of how digital assets fit into the broader financial system, particularly for international trade and potentially for sophisticated investors. The decision to launch a Bitcoin index now could be interpreted in several ways: Acknowledging Market Demand: Despite regulatory hurdles, interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains high among Russian investors and businesses. Providing an index through a regulated, traditional platform like MOEX caters to this demand, even if direct trading isn’t immediately available via the index itself. Laying the Groundwork: An index is often a precursor to more complex financial products. By establishing a reliable benchmark, MOEX could be preparing for the potential introduction of Bitcoin-related derivatives, ETFs, or other instruments in the future, should the regulatory environment evolve. Integration with Global Trends: Traditional exchanges worldwide are increasingly engaging with crypto assets, offering futures, options, or indexes. MOEX’s move aligns with this global trend, ensuring it doesn’t fall behind in the evolving financial landscape. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Data services and index licensing are valuable business areas for exchanges. A popular crypto index can generate revenue and attract new participants to the platform. This move suggests a pragmatic approach from MOEX, focusing on providing data and a benchmark within the existing regulatory framework for now, while potentially positioning itself for future opportunities in the Russia crypto space. How Will the MOEX BTC Index Work? Understanding the Methodology According to reports, the MOEXBTC index won’t be based on trading activity directly on the Moscow Exchange itself, at least not initially. Instead, it will derive its value from price data aggregated from several major global cryptocurrency exchanges. Specifically, it will use data from perpetual futures and swaps contracts for the BTC/USDT pair on platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements: Data Sources: Relying on large, liquid global exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Bitget) ensures the index reflects significant trading volume and market activity. Instrument Type: Focusing on perpetual futures and swaps for BTC/USDT is interesting. These are derivative contracts that track the price of the underlying asset (Bitcoin) but don’t have an expiry date (like traditional futures). They are popular in crypto trading due to their leverage potential and funding rate mechanisms that help keep their price close to the spot price. Using these instruments for an index provides a continuous price feed and reflects the sentiment and activity in the highly liquid derivatives market. Index Calculation: MOEX will aggregate and process the price data from these sources to calculate the MOEXBTC index value. The exact weighting and calculation methodology haven’t been fully detailed in the initial reports, but standard index practices involve filtering data, handling outliers, and potentially volume-weighting prices from different sources to create a representative benchmark. Publishing: The index value will be published regularly, likely throughout the trading day (or even 24/7, given the nature of crypto markets, though MOEX traditionally operates on specific hours). This provides real-time or near-real-time tracking of Bitcoin’s price performance. By using data from perpetual swaps on major platforms, MOEX is tapping into the most active and liquid part of the global crypto market to build its Bitcoin index . This approach allows them to offer a relevant benchmark without needing to handle direct spot crypto trading on their own platform, which would likely face more complex regulatory hurdles in Russia. Significance of the MOEX Bitcoin Index for Russia and Beyond The launch of the MOEX BTC index is more than just a technical event; it carries symbolic and practical significance, particularly within the context of the Russia crypto landscape and its relationship with global finance. For Russian Investors and Institutions: Regulated Benchmark: Provides a formal, regulated reference point for Bitcoin’s price within the traditional financial system. This can make it easier for institutions and sophisticated investors to monitor Bitcoin’s performance and potentially include it in analysis or reporting. Potential for Future Products: As mentioned, an index is foundational. Its existence could pave the way for MOEX-listed products like futures, options, or even exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to Bitcoin’s price, offering regulated avenues for exposure. Increased Awareness and Legitimacy: The mere fact that Russia’s main exchange is launching a crypto index lends a degree of legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class within the country, potentially influencing public perception and future regulatory decisions. Alternative Access: For those who find direct crypto exchange access cumbersome or risky, a MOEX-provided index offers a way to track the market via a familiar, trusted platform. For the Moscow Exchange: Innovation and Modernization: Keeps MOEX relevant in a rapidly evolving financial world where digital assets are gaining prominence. Attracting New Participants: Could draw traders and investors interested in crypto but who prefer operating within the traditional exchange infrastructure. Diversifying Offerings: Adds a new asset class benchmark to its existing suite of indexes for stocks, bonds, and commodities. Data Provider Role: Enhances its position as a key financial data provider in Russia. For the Global Crypto Market: Increased Global Adoption Signal: Another traditional exchange, albeit in a complex geopolitical environment, acknowledging and creating a benchmark for Bitcoin underscores the asset’s growing global presence. Potential for Data Impact: While MOEX isn’t adding trading volume, its use of data from major exchanges reinforces their importance in global price discovery. This move is a cautious but clear step by the Moscow Exchange into the digital asset domain, reflecting a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in the modern financial landscape, even within the constraints of Russia’s current regulatory environment. Challenges and Considerations in the Russia Crypto Landscape While the launch of the MOEX BTC index is a positive step for integrating crypto into traditional finance in Russia, it’s crucial to consider the challenges and complexities inherent in the current environment. Regulatory Uncertainty: Russia’s crypto regulations are still evolving. While digital asset ownership is legal, using crypto for payments is banned. The legal status of derivative products linked to a crypto index on MOEX remains to be seen and will depend on future regulatory clarity. Geopolitical Factors: The Moscow Exchange operates within a specific geopolitical context. International sanctions and restrictions can impact its operations, access to global data sources, and the ability of international participants to interact with MOEX products, even an index. Data Reliability: While MOEX is sourcing data from major exchanges, the reliability and integrity of data from unregulated or less regulated platforms can sometimes be a concern, although top-tier exchanges generally have robust systems. MOEX will need a solid methodology to ensure the index’s accuracy. Limited Immediate Impact on Direct Trading: The index itself is a benchmark, not a trading product. Its immediate impact on direct Bitcoin trading volume within Russia or globally is likely minimal. Its value lies more in providing a reference and potentially enabling future regulated products. Investor Access: While the index is published by MOEX, direct access to view or use this index might initially be limited to professional market participants or require specific brokerage services connected to MOEX. Retail access might be indirect. Navigating the Russia crypto space requires careful attention to these factors. The index is a sign of progress, but it doesn’t instantly solve all the regulatory and operational complexities. How Does MOEX’s Move Compare to Other Crypto Index Initiatives? The Moscow Exchange isn’t the first traditional financial institution to launch a crypto index . Major exchanges and financial data providers globally have already established similar benchmarks. For instance: CME Group: Offers various crypto indexes (like the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate) which underpin its Bitcoin futures and options contracts. Nasdaq: Provides several crypto indexes, often in partnership with data firms, tracking various cryptocurrencies. S&P Dow Jones Indices: Launched cryptocurrency indexes to bring crypto assets into the fold of traditional benchmarks. Bloomberg and Refinitiv: Financial data giants that provide extensive crypto pricing and index data. MOEX’s approach of using data from major global crypto exchanges is a common method for traditional finance players entering this space without immediately launching their own spot trading platforms. However, the specific context of Russia’s regulatory environment and MOEX’s operational constraints due to sanctions make its initiative noteworthy. It highlights the persistent global interest in Bitcoin as an asset, even in jurisdictions with complex relationships with decentralized finance. The MOEXBTC index adds another data point to the growing ecosystem of crypto index offerings provided by traditional financial institutions, reflecting the asset class’s increasing integration into mainstream finance, albeit at different paces and through various models worldwide. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers What does the launch of the MOEX BTC index mean for you, whether you’re an investor, trader, or just following the market? Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on how Russia’s crypto regulations evolve following this index launch. Will it lead to more regulated products on MOEX? Will it influence the broader stance on crypto within the country? Use the Index as a Reference: While you might not trade directly on MOEX, the MOEXBTC index can serve as another data point for tracking Bitcoin’s price, particularly if you are interested in how a traditional Russian financial institution is benchmarking the asset. Understand the Data Sources: Be aware that the index is based on data from specific global exchanges and specific contract types (perpetual swaps). This might lead to slight variations compared to spot prices on other platforms or indexes based on different methodologies. Evaluate Future Products: If MOEX eventually launches products tied to the index (like futures), carefully evaluate their structure, liquidity, fees, and regulatory status before considering participation. Contextualize the News: See this as part of the broader trend of traditional finance engaging with crypto, but understand the unique regulatory and geopolitical context in which MOEX operates. This development is a fascinating case study in how traditional finance adapts to the rise of digital assets within challenging regulatory and geopolitical landscapes. It’s a step towards integrating Bitcoin into Russia’s formal financial system, even if initially just as a benchmark. Looking Ahead: What Could Follow the MOEX Bitcoin Index? The launch of the MOEXBTC index on June 10 is likely not the final chapter in the Moscow Exchange’s engagement with digital assets. The establishment of a reliable benchmark often precedes the introduction of more sophisticated financial instruments. Potential future developments could include: Bitcoin Futures or Options: Similar to CME Group, MOEX could launch derivatives contracts settled in rubles or potentially another currency, based on the MOEXBTC index. Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs): If regulations permit, MOEX could list Bitcoin-backed ETNs or potentially even ETFs, offering investors regulated exposure without direct crypto ownership. Indexes for Other Cryptocurrencies: If the Bitcoin index proves successful and regulations allow, MOEX might consider launching indexes for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Spot Trading (Longer Term): While less likely in the short term given current regulations, a long-term evolution could involve MOEX facilitating regulated spot trading of cryptocurrencies. These future steps are heavily dependent on the evolution of Russia crypto regulations. However, by creating the MOEX BTC index , MOEX is building the necessary infrastructure and gaining experience in handling crypto-related data, positioning itself to move quickly if and when the regulatory environment becomes more favorable for broader digital asset integration. Conclusion: A Key Step for Russia’s Financial Landscape The Moscow Exchange’s decision to launch a Bitcoin index is a significant milestone. Starting June 10, the MOEXBTC index will provide a regulated benchmark for Bitcoin’s price, drawing data from major global crypto exchanges. This move reflects the growing importance of digital assets and represents a cautious yet deliberate step by Russia’s main exchange to engage with the crypto market. While direct trading on MOEX isn’t part of this initial launch, the index lays crucial groundwork for potential future regulated crypto products. It signals a pragmatic approach within the complex Russia crypto landscape, acknowledging market interest and aligning with global trends of traditional finance integrating digital assets. The success and future impact of the MOEXBTC index will depend on regulatory evolution and market adoption, but its launch undeniably marks a notable moment in the intersection of traditional Russian finance and the global cryptocurrency ecosystem.

From May 29 to June 5, Santiment’s Alpha Narratives dashboard recorded a significant surge in discussions centered on artificial intelligence, surpassing even crypto-related chatter. Online conversations have revolved around concerns over AI-driven job losses, the growing role of autonomous agents, and the promise of decentralized AI infrastructure. AI Discourse Users debated both risks and rewards, weighing job displacement against productivity gains. The hype is not just philosophical; in fact, industry activity is steadily ramping up. Companies like Kite AI and the 0G Foundation are fueling development, with the latter recently launching an $88.88 million fund to back AI-integrated DeFi tools and autonomous systems. On the investor side, whale activity from figures such as James Wynn and business intelligence company Strategy has sparked renewed market confidence. Meanwhile, Solana, Loud Token, and various meme coins have enjoyed surging social engagement, as it reflected how narratives around innovation continue to move token prices. Santiment revealed that conversations have even touched on AI’s role in daily life, from driving to debugging code. Such discourse essentially reflects how deeply the technology is embedding itself across sectors. AI Integration Accelerates The latest observation comes at a time when a growing number of crypto users appear comfortable entrusting AI with their finances, according to a CoinGecko survey published recently that found a majority are willing to let AI agents manage portions of their investment portfolios. Meanwhile, the crypto mining sector is rapidly aligning with the AI boom. Riot Platforms, for example, appointed three new directors to its board in February, including one with a background in repurposing Bitcoin mining equipment for high-performance computing (HPC). Other major mining firms – Hive Digital and Hut 8 – also pivoted part of their operations toward AI workloads last year. More recently, Amazon announced a $20 billion investment to establish two AI-driven data centers in Pennsylvania. Salem Township and Falls Township are top contenders for the buildout. The project will be paired with educational and workforce training initiatives in cloud computing.

That’s the intriguing possibility raised by BitMEX Exchange co-founder, Arthur Hayes. He suggests that a specific action from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) could unleash a significant rally for Bitcoin and other risk assets. This isn’t just idle speculation; it ties into the complex interplay between global monetary policy and the crypto market. Who is Arthur Hayes and Why Listen to Him? Arthur Hayes is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for his often provocative and insightful macro-driven analysis of the crypto market. As a co-founder of BitMEX, one of the early major crypto derivatives exchanges, he has a deep understanding of market mechanics and liquidity flows. His views are closely watched because he often connects the dots between traditional finance, central bank actions, and their potential impact on digital assets like Bitcoin . When Hayes speaks about macro factors influencing crypto, the market pays attention. Understanding the Bank of Japan ‘s Unique Position While many central banks globally have been aggressively tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has largely remained an outlier. For years, the BOJ has maintained ultra-low interest rates and pursued extensive asset purchase programs – a form of Quantitative Easing – to stimulate its economy and fight deflation. This dovish stance contrasts sharply with the rate hikes seen from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and others. This divergence in policy is key to Hayes’ thesis. How Could Quantitative Easing Fuel a Bitcoin Rally? Quantitative Easing (QE) is essentially a tool central banks use to inject liquidity into the financial system. By purchasing government bonds or other assets, the central bank increases the money supply and lowers borrowing costs. The theory is that this encourages lending and investment, stimulating economic activity. However, a common side effect of prolonged QE is that it can lead to excess liquidity sloshing around the global financial system. This excess capital often seeks returns in riskier assets, including stocks, commodities, and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . Hayes’ argument is that if the Bank of Japan were to not only delay any potential move towards tightening but perhaps even ramp up its QE efforts, it would represent a significant injection of liquidity into a global system that is otherwise seeing liquidity withdrawn by other central banks. This fresh wave of liquidity could find its way into assets like Bitcoin , driving prices higher. The Specific BOJ Policy Hayes is Watching According to reports citing Hayes, the critical window he is focused on is the Bank of Japan ‘s monetary policy meeting scheduled for June 16–17. The market is closely watching whether the BOJ will signal any shift away from its ultra-loose stance, particularly regarding its yield curve control policy, which pins long-term interest rates near zero. Hayes suggests that if the BOJ decides *against* tightening at this meeting, or even signals a *continuation* or *expansion* of QE, it could be the catalyst for a significant market reaction. Why this specific meeting and this specific action? A delay in tightening by a major global central bank, especially one as significant as the BOJ, would be a dovish surprise in a world bracing for more hawkishness. This surprise could release pent-up capital flows, and given the current financial landscape, Hayes believes Bitcoin is well-positioned to benefit from this. Why Bitcoin as a Beneficiary? The source snippet highlights a crucial point: rising bond yields and default concerns have already increased institutional interest in Bitcoin as a hedge. In an environment where traditional safe havens like government bonds are becoming less attractive (due to yield volatility or default fears), and where concerns about currency devaluation persist due to central bank actions (even if others are tightening, the cumulative effect of years of QE is still felt), Bitcoin ‘s characteristics as a decentralized, hard-capped asset become more appealing. Institutions and sophisticated investors look for assets that can preserve capital or offer uncorrelated returns during times of economic uncertainty. The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against monetary inflation and systemic risk gains traction in such periods. If the Bank of Japan ‘s actions signal a continuation of policies that could be perceived as inflationary or destabilizing in the long run (by adding more liquidity), it could reinforce the case for holding Bitcoin , attracting further institutional and retail investment, and potentially triggering the rally Hayes predicts. The Macro Picture: Liquidity, Yields, and Risk Assets Let’s break down the macro forces at play: Global Liquidity: Central banks withdrawing liquidity generally pressures risk assets. The BOJ adding or maintaining significant liquidity goes against this trend, potentially creating pockets of capital seeking returns. Rising Bond Yields: When bond yields rise rapidly, it can make bonds more attractive relative to risk assets, but it can also signal underlying economic stress or inflation expectations. For institutions, navigating volatile bond markets increases the appeal of alternative hedges. Default Concerns: Fears of defaults (sovereign or corporate) push investors towards assets perceived as being outside the traditional financial system or less susceptible to counterparty risk. Bitcoin , with its decentralized nature, fits this narrative for some. These factors create a complex environment where traditional portfolio diversification is challenging. Hayes argues that in this context, a dovish surprise from the Bank of Japan could provide the specific jolt needed to send capital towards assets like Bitcoin that are seen as potential beneficiaries of or hedges against these macro trends. Potential Challenges and What to Watch For While Hayes’ thesis is compelling, it’s important to consider potential challenges: BOJ’s Actual Decision: The BOJ might surprise the market by signaling a shift towards tightening, even if minor. This would likely have the opposite effect. Other Macro Headwinds: Global recession fears, regulatory crackdowns, or other geopolitical events could overshadow the impact of the BOJ’s decision. Crypto-Specific Factors: The crypto market has its own internal dynamics, including sentiment, technological developments, and regulatory news, which can influence price independent of macro factors. Magnitude of Impact: Even if the BOJ remains dovish, the size and duration of its impact on the global liquidity pool and subsequently on Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be massive. Investors should closely monitor the official announcements from the Bank of Japan following their June meeting, paying attention not just to interest rates but also to language regarding asset purchases and yield curve control. Actionable Insights for Readers Based on this analysis: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on major central bank announcements, particularly from the Bank of Japan , and understand how they fit into the global monetary policy landscape. Understand the Macro Link: Recognize that Bitcoin ‘s price is increasingly influenced by global macro liquidity and risk sentiment, not just crypto-specific news. Consider Bitcoin ‘s Role as a Hedge: Evaluate how Bitcoin might fit into your portfolio as a potential hedge against inflation, currency debasement, or systemic risk, especially in light of current bond market conditions and default concerns. Manage Risk: Hayes’ prediction is a potential catalyst, not a certainty. Any investment based on such a prediction should be part of a well-diversified strategy with appropriate risk management. Conclusion: Will the BOJ Trigger a Bitcoin Surge? Arthur Hayes presents a clear and intriguing case: the Bank of Japan ‘s monetary policy decision in June could be the unexpected trigger for a significant Bitcoin rally. His argument hinges on the BOJ’s unique position as one of the last major central banks maintaining ultra-loose policy. Should they delay tightening or resume aggressive Quantitative Easing , the resulting injection of global liquidity, combined with existing institutional interest in Bitcoin driven by rising bond yields and default concerns, could create a powerful upward force for BTC and other risk assets. While the outcome is uncertain and other factors are at play, Hayes’ analysis provides a valuable framework for understanding how global macroeconomics continues to shape the future of the cryptocurrency market. The world will be watching the BOJ meeting closely. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

Notably, the SEC has asked prospective issuers to clarify procedures for in-kind redemption. The regulator is reportedly open to allowing staking as part of these products. Additionally, the sources noted that the agency will provide comments on the updated filings within 30 days of their submission. Solana ETF Has 90% Odds of Approval Although it is still unclear when spot Solana ETFs will be approved, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that it would “more likely” be in early Q4, 2025. “Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected,” he wrote on X. “If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — I wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest.” Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days.

More likely to be in early 4Q. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Analyst Seyffart also predicted that the odds of altcoin ETF approvals in 2025 are 90% for Solana and Litecoin . While XRP closely follows at 85%, other altcoins, including Dogecoin and HBAR, have an 80% chance of approval this year. Companies that have filed S-1s include Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton and Fidelity. Interestingly, Seyffart believes the SEC views these altcoins as commodities, a positive outlook for their approval prospects compared to securities. Source: X (James Seyffart) SOL Closely Follows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Plans Grayscale is planning to follow the blueprint it used for its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, aiming to convert its existing SOL Trust into a spot ETF. In February, the SEC formally acknowledged Grayscale’s spot Solana ETF proposal. However, in May, the agency delayed its decision, stating that it hadn’t reached any conclusions. Last month, the SEC pushed back its decision on the SOL ETF proposals from Bitwise and 21Shares. The agency noted it needs added time to sort through technical details, legal questions, and investor-protection issues. Meanwhile, Brazil’s regulator gave the green light for the first-ever spot Solana ETF in August 2024. Later, the country also approved a second Solana spot ETF offered by the asset manager Hashdex.

In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plays a pivotal role in safeguarding financial markets and consumers. A recent significant development signals the FCA’s reinforced commitment to tackling these new frontiers, particularly concerning FCA crypto regulation . This move is set to have notable implications for businesses and investors navigating the digital asset space in the UK. FCA Crypto Regulation Takes Center Stage with Key Appointment In a strategic move reflecting its expanding responsibilities, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently announced the appointment of Sarah Pritchard as its new deputy chief executive. This isn’t just a standard personnel change; it signifies a deliberate broadening of the FCA’s focus areas. Sarah Pritchard’s remit will now explicitly include oversight of critical emerging sectors, notably the regulation of stablecoins, various activities carried out by crypto firms UK , and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services. Her role will also involve supporting the FCA’s growing international engagement, highlighting the cross-border nature of these modern financial activities. Why Stablecoin Rules UK Are Becoming Critical Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, like a fiat currency – have gained significant traction. They are often seen as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, used for trading, payments, and remittances. However, their increasing use and potential integration into mainstream finance raise important regulatory questions around stability, consumer protection, and financial crime risks. The inclusion of stablecoin regulation under Sarah Pritchard’s purview underscores the FCA’s recognition of their growing importance and the potential risks they pose if left unchecked. Developing clear Stablecoin rules UK is seen as a necessary step to foster confidence and manage systemic risks as these assets become more prevalent in the UK’s financial ecosystem. This focus aligns with global regulatory trends aiming to establish frameworks for digital assets that pose potential financial stability concerns. What the Expanded Remit Means for Crypto Firms UK For businesses operating in the UK’s digital asset market, this appointment and the expanded mandate signal an era of increased regulatory scrutiny and potentially, clearer guidelines. Crypto firms UK involved in activities such as issuing or facilitating the use of stablecoins, or providing other crypto-related services falling under the FCA’s new scope, should prepare for enhanced oversight. This could involve: More detailed requirements for authorization and registration. Stricter rules around consumer protection, transparency, and risk management. Increased emphasis on preventing financial crime, including anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Potential new rules specifically tailored to stablecoin activities. While increased regulation can present compliance challenges, it can also bring benefits, such as greater market confidence, reduced risk of illicit activity, and potentially pave the way for broader institutional adoption by providing a clearer legal and regulatory framework. Beyond Crypto: Buy Now Pay Later and the FCA’s Broader Scope While the focus of this article is on crypto, it’s important to note that the FCA new deputy ‘s expanded role also covers Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL). This highlights the FCA’s broader strategy to adapt its regulatory framework to encompass a range of new financial products and services that have rapidly grown in popularity, often operating in previously unregulated or under-regulated spaces. This demonstrates the FCA’s commitment to ensuring consumer protection across diverse and evolving financial technologies. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in UK Crypto Laws The development and implementation of comprehensive UK crypto laws and regulations present both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in crafting rules that effectively mitigate risks without stifling innovation in a rapidly evolving technological space. The opportunity is to create a regulatory environment that attracts legitimate businesses, protects consumers, and positions the UK as a leader in responsible financial technology innovation. Sarah Pritchard’s appointment and the explicit inclusion of crypto and stablecoins in her portfolio signal a strategic prioritization by the FCA. It indicates that the regulator is gearing up to provide more clarity and structure to these markets. For crypto firms, staying informed and proactively engaging with the evolving regulatory landscape will be crucial for long-term success and compliance in the UK. In conclusion, the FCA’s appointment of a new deputy chief executive with a specific mandate covering crypto regulation, stablecoins, and BNPL is a significant development. It underscores the regulator’s commitment to adapting to the digital age and brings the prospect of more defined FCA crypto regulation . While the exact shape of future rules will unfold, this move clearly signals that digital assets are now firmly on the FCA’s regulatory radar, demanding attention from all market participants.

We’ve got some concerning news that needs your immediate attention. A recent report, a collaboration between industry players Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic, shines a stark light on a rapidly growing threat in the digital asset space: AI-driven crypto scams . And the numbers? They’re alarming, pointing to billions in crypto losses . The Rising Tide of Crypto Scams: A $4.6 Billion Problem Let’s cut straight to the chase. The report reveals that global crypto scam losses surged by a significant 24% year-over-year, reaching a staggering $4.6 billion. That’s a massive amount of value stolen from individuals and businesses navigating the cryptocurrency world. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a substantial escalation in the scale and impact of fraudulent activities. This surge indicates that scammers are becoming more sophisticated and effective in their methods. While the crypto market continues to mature and attract mainstream attention, it also remains a prime target for malicious actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities, both technical and human. Deepfake Crypto Scams: The AI-Powered Threat Takes Center Stage Here’s where things get particularly concerning. The report highlights the prominent role of artificial intelligence, specifically deepfake technology, in fueling these losses. Deepfakes, as you might know, are synthetic media where a person’s likeness is replaced or altered using AI, often making it look like they are saying or doing something they never did. In the context of crypto, deepfakes are being weaponized for impersonation. Scammers create convincing fake videos or audio of trusted figures – perhaps a known CEO, a crypto influencer, or even a supposed friend or colleague – to promote fake projects, solicit funds, or spread misinformation leading to investment decisions based on lies. The report’s findings are chilling: Nearly 40% of high-value fraud cases investigated in 2024 involved the use of deepfake technology. This shows just how integrated AI manipulation has become in significant fraudulent operations. In just the first quarter of 2025, a reported 87 deepfake scam rings were dismantled. While this shows law enforcement and security firms are active, the sheer number of operations being uncovered highlights the scale of the problem currently operating. The effectiveness of deepfake crypto scams lies in their ability to bypass traditional skepticism. Seeing or hearing someone you trust endorsing something or asking for help can be incredibly persuasive, making it harder for victims to recognize the deception before it’s too late. Beyond Deepfakes: Understanding Cryptocurrency Fraud Tactics While deepfakes are the shiny, terrifying new tool, they often work in tandem with older, proven scam tactics. The report points out that alongside deepfakes, the most common methods driving cryptocurrency fraud include: Social Engineering: This is the art of manipulating people into giving up confidential information. Think phishing emails that look exactly like they’re from your exchange, fake support calls asking for your seed phrase, or even elaborate romance scams where the scammer eventually asks for crypto investments. Deepfakes amplify social engineering by making the impersonation aspect incredibly convincing. Ponzi-Style Frauds: These are classic pyramid schemes adapted for the crypto age. Scammers promise impossibly high returns on investment, paying early investors with money from later investors. They collapse when the flow of new money stops, leaving the majority with significant crypto losses . These often use sophisticated websites and marketing, sometimes even incorporating fake testimonials enhanced by AI. Understanding that these tactics are interconnected is crucial. A deepfake might be used to initiate contact or build trust, which is then exploited through social engineering to get you into a Ponzi scheme or trick you into sending funds directly. Why Are AI Scams Particularly Effective Against Crypto? It’s worth asking why the crypto space seems to be such a fertile ground for AI scams and other types of cryptocurrency fraud . Several factors contribute to this: Irreversibility: Unlike traditional banking where transactions can sometimes be reversed, crypto transactions on public blockchains are generally final. Once you send crypto to a scammer’s wallet, it’s extremely difficult, often impossible, to get it back. Perceived Anonymity: While blockchains are transparent, identifying the real-world identity behind a wallet address can be challenging, especially if scammers use mixers or multiple wallets. Complexity: The technology and concepts behind cryptocurrency can be complex for newcomers. Scammers exploit this lack of understanding, using jargon and confusing explanations to appear legitimate. Hype and FOMO: The fast-paced nature and potential for high returns in crypto create an environment where Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is prevalent. Scammers prey on this, pushing urgent investment opportunities that require quick decisions without proper due diligence. Decentralization: While a core strength, the decentralized nature means there isn’t a central authority to flag or stop fraudulent transactions in the same way a bank might. These factors, combined with the enhanced realism provided by AI like deepfakes, create a perfect storm for sophisticated scams leading to significant crypto losses . Combating Deepfake Scams: Actionable Steps and the Report’s Call So, what can be done about this escalating threat? The report by Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic doesn’t just highlight the problem; it also points towards necessary countermeasures. The core recommendations revolve around strengthening defenses on multiple fronts: 1. Stronger Verification Practices Platforms and services need to step up their game. This includes: Implementing and improving Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to make it harder for scammers to operate anonymously. Enhancing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other account security measures. Developing better systems for verifying the legitimacy of users and transactions. 2. Enhanced Cybersecurity Training and Awareness This is perhaps the most critical defense for individual users. Education is power when facing social engineering and deepfakes. For Individuals: Learn to recognize the signs of a scam. Be skeptical of unsolicited contact, especially if it involves requests for funds or personal information. Verify identities through independent means – don’t rely on the video or audio call alone. Be wary of promises of unrealistic returns. Understand how to secure your wallets and private keys. For Platforms: Invest in advanced fraud detection systems, including those that can potentially identify AI-generated content or unusual behavioral patterns indicative of scams. Provide clear and accessible security guidance to users. 3. Increased Collaboration Combating sophisticated AI scams requires a united front. This means: Crypto exchanges and service providers sharing information about known scam tactics and addresses. Collaboration between the crypto industry and law enforcement agencies to track and dismantle scam operations. Security firms continuously researching and publishing findings on new threats, like this joint report does. For you, the individual crypto holder, the most important takeaway is vigilance. Treat every unsolicited message, every unexpected video call from someone you haven’t spoken to in a while, and every too-good-to-be-true investment opportunity with extreme caution. Always verify information through official channels you initiate yourself. In Conclusion: Stay Safe in an Evolving Threat Landscape The report from Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic serves as a crucial warning: AI scams , particularly those leveraging deepfake technology, are no longer a theoretical threat. They are here, they are effective, and they are directly contributing to billions in crypto losses globally. The 24% increase in losses and the widespread use of deepfakes in high-value fraud cases highlight the urgent need for increased awareness and stronger security measures. As the technology behind deepfakes and other AI tools becomes more accessible, the threat of cryptocurrency fraud will only continue to evolve. By understanding the common tactics, recognizing the red flags, and adopting robust security practices – both individually and collectively as an industry – we can hope to build a more secure future for digital assets and protect ourselves from falling victim to these alarming crypto scams .

The world of digital assets is buzzing as US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are quickly closing in on an astonishing $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume. This incredible pace highlights the immense investor interest and liquidity these products have brought to the cryptocurrency market since their launch. What Exactly Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the massive volume figures, let’s quickly touch upon what a Spot Bitcoin ETF is. Simply put, it’s an investment fund traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This structure allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Think of it as a bridge between the traditional financial world and the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Their approval and launch in the U.S. earlier this year were highly anticipated events. Why? Because they offer several key advantages: Accessibility: Easily traded through standard brokerage accounts. Convenience: No need to worry about private keys, wallets, or exchange security. Regulation: Operate within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection. Liquidity: High trading volumes on major exchanges can make buying and selling easier. These factors have contributed significantly to the rapid accumulation of Bitcoin ETF volume we are now witnessing. The Staggering Rise of Bitcoin ETF Volume Towards $1 Trillion The journey towards $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been nothing short of spectacular. According to data tracked by The Block, this significant milestone is being approached in less than 18 months since the first products hit the market. The pace of trading activity saw a notable acceleration as Bitcoin’s price climbed to new all-time highs, even briefly touching levels near $112,000. Higher prices often correlate with increased trading interest and volume as investors react to market movements, both buying and selling. To put this volume into perspective, reaching $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume so quickly demonstrates the strong demand and active trading occurring within these new investment vehicles. It signifies a significant level of capital flowing through these regulated pathways into the Bitcoin market. Dominance Defined: The Power of BlackRock IBIT Within the competitive landscape of Spot Bitcoin ETFs , one player stands out remarkably: BlackRock’s IBIT . BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has quickly become the undisputed leader in the market. IBIT’s dominance is clear when looking at the numbers: Volume Share: It commands over 79% of the total trading volume among all US spot Bitcoin ETFs. This means for every $100 traded across these ETFs, roughly $79 goes through IBIT. Assets Under Management (AUM): IBIT holds a staggering $70 billion in assets, representing the value of the Bitcoin it holds on behalf of investors. This figure alone highlights the massive inflows directed towards BlackRock’s offering. The success of BlackRock IBIT can be attributed to several factors, including BlackRock’s established reputation, extensive distribution networks, and effective marketing efforts. Their ability to attract and retain such a large portion of the market share has been a key driver in the overall surge in Bitcoin ETF volume . Comparing Crypto ETFs: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum While Bitcoin ETFs have been stealing the spotlight with their rapid volume growth, it’s also useful to look at the performance of other Crypto ETFs , specifically those tracking Ethereum. Spot Ethereum ETFs launched more recently, in July 2024. Since their debut, they have accumulated $83.4 billion in trading volume and hold $6.6 billion in assets. Let’s compare the two: Metric US Spot Bitcoin ETFs US Spot Ethereum ETFs Launch Timeline Less than 18 months ago Since July 2024 Cumulative Trading Volume Approaching $1 Trillion $83.4 Billion Total Assets Under Management Approx. $70 Billion+ (across all ETFs) $6.6 Billion Leading Product (by AUM) BlackRock IBIT ($70 Billion) (Specific leader not mentioned in source, but overall market is smaller) This comparison clearly shows the vast difference in scale between the two markets currently. Bitcoin ETF volume is significantly higher, and their assets under management are substantially larger. This could be due to Bitcoin’s longer history, greater public awareness, and its status as the first major cryptocurrency to have a spot ETF approved in the U.S. Market Dynamics: Inflows, Outflows, and Price Impact The journey to nearly $1 trillion in Bitcoin ETF volume hasn’t been a straight line of just inflows. While total net inflows across all Spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive $44.9 billion, this figure accounts for significant outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). GBTC existed as a closed-end fund before converting into a spot ETF. This conversion allowed investors who were previously locked in to redeem their shares, leading to substantial outflows as some took profits or switched to lower-fee competitors like BlackRock IBIT or Fidelity’s FBTC. Despite these GBTC outflows, the strong inflows into the newly launched ETFs have more than compensated, resulting in a significant net positive flow of capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem via these regulated products. This influx of institutional and retail capital through ETFs is widely seen as a major factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price rally in recent periods. What Does This Mean for the Future? The rapid growth in Bitcoin ETF volume and assets signals increasing mainstream acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. As these products mature and attract more investors, their influence on Bitcoin’s price discovery and market structure is likely to grow. Potential future developments could include: Continued competition among issuers, potentially leading to lower fees. Increased adoption by financial advisors and institutional investors. Greater market efficiency and liquidity for Bitcoin. Potential approval of other single-asset or multi-asset Crypto ETFs . Investors interested in this space should continue to monitor trading volumes, inflow/outflow data, and overall market sentiment. Understanding the dynamics of products like BlackRock IBIT and the overall Bitcoin ETF volume trends is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto investment landscape. Summary: A New Era of Bitcoin Investment In conclusion, the fact that US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly approaching $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume in such a short period is a monumental achievement. It underscores the strong demand for regulated Bitcoin investment products and the significant impact they are having on the market. Led by the overwhelming dominance of BlackRock IBIT , these ETFs have successfully bridged the gap for many traditional investors looking to access Bitcoin. While challenges like market volatility remain, the trajectory suggests that Bitcoin ETFs are poised to play an increasingly central role in the future of both cryptocurrency and traditional finance.

It dropped to 2.28 when Ripple Labs has just announced a major partnership deal with Guggenheim Partners. With the sentiment in the markets seemingly improving, this unexpected sudden drop is leaving many traders caviling. From a technical perspective, however, there is still some good news for XRP’s holders, as they believe it is currently capped above $2.25, which is a crucial Fibonacci retracement level and an important support area. XRP historically tends to rebound from this region—proof that markets do tend to behave in a recurrent manner. For the time being, this zone is likely to act as a buffer for the token. On-chain activity is starting to pick up as well. Supporters are particularly focused on June 16, a date that has become synonymous with possible resolutions in the Ripple vs SEC saga. Quite a number of people seem to believe that a favorable outcome could serve as a very strong catalyst for XRP’s next move. XRP Price Prediction: What’s Next? From a technical point of view, XRP is trying to recover from a key support zone in the range of $2.10 and $2.25. Immediate resistance levels are marked at $2.34 and $2.44, with stronger resistance near $2.60. Other traders are looking for a possible double bottom pattern forming on the charts, which would be a bullish pattern if confirmed in the On shorter timeframes, particularly the 8-hour chart, XRP is showing signs of a bullish divergence. While the price has slipped, momentum indicators like the RSI are quietly trending higher, suggesting a possible price bounce in the near term. However, one wildcard could shake things up — the upcoming U.S. CPI inflation data set to be released within the next 24 hours.

Deutsche Bank, one of the globe’s leading financial institutions, is reportedly diving deeper into the realm of digital assets. Specifically, they are exploring the potential of a Deutsche Bank stablecoin and innovative tokenized deposits . This isn’t just a minor technical tweak; it signals a significant step in the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption and the evolution of banking digital currencies . What Exactly is Deutsche Bank Exploring? According to reports from Bloomberg, cited by Ledger Insights, Deutsche Bank is actively investigating two key areas within the digital asset space: Developing its own stablecoin: This would be a digital currency issued by the bank, likely pegged 1:1 to a traditional fiat currency like the Euro or US Dollar. The aim would be to provide a stable digital medium for transactions within the bank’s ecosystem or potentially for clients. Implementing tokenized deposit solutions: This involves representing traditional bank deposits as digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). These tokens would essentially be digital claims on fiat currency held at the bank. Deutsche Bank isn’t just theorizing. They have already participated in trials, including collaborating with Swiss bank UBS. This hands-on approach suggests they are seriously evaluating the technical feasibility and business case for these digital asset initiatives. The bank is weighing whether to launch its own proprietary solutions, such as a dedicated Deutsche Bank stablecoin , or to join forces with existing industry initiatives and consortia. Why Are Banks Pursuing Banking Digital Currencies? The interest from major banks like Deutsche Bank in issuing their own forms of digital money or representing deposits digitally isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors are driving this push towards banking digital currencies : Efficiency Gains: Traditional payment and settlement systems can be slow, costly, and complex, especially across borders. Digital currencies and tokenized assets on DLT can potentially enable near-instantaneous, 24/7 settlement, reducing counterparty risk and operational costs. Enhanced Control and Programmability: Unlike public cryptocurrencies, bank-issued digital currencies or tokenized deposits could offer banks and regulators greater control. They can also incorporate ‘programmability,’ allowing for automated payments or conditional transactions, opening up new business models. Responding to Market Demand: Corporate clients and other financial institutions are increasingly exploring digital assets. Banks need to evolve their offerings to meet this demand and remain relevant in a rapidly digitizing financial landscape. Competitive Pressure: Other financial institutions, fintech firms, and even central banks (with Central Bank Digital Currencies – CBDCs) are exploring or launching digital currency initiatives. Banks must innovate to stay competitive. The exploration by Deutsche Bank highlights a strategic imperative to adapt to a future where digital assets play a more central role in finance. Stablecoins in Banking: More Than Just Crypto? When we talk about stablecoins in banking , it’s important to differentiate them from the decentralized stablecoins found in the broader cryptocurrency market (like USDT, USDC, DAI). While the underlying technology might be similar (often blockchain or DLT), bank-issued stablecoins would operate within a regulated framework, tied directly to the bank’s reserves and balance sheet. The potential use cases for stablecoins in banking are vast: Wholesale Payments: Facilitating large-value interbank payments or corporate treasury transactions more efficiently. Cross-Border Settlements: Simplifying and speeding up international payments and foreign exchange settlements. Securities Settlement: Enabling atomic settlement (simultaneous exchange of asset and payment) for tokenized securities. Internal Processes: Improving efficiency in internal bank operations, such as managing collateral or liquidity. A Deutsche Bank stablecoin could initially be used for internal or wholesale purposes, potentially expanding to corporate clients as the technology and regulation mature. The key benefit is leveraging the speed and programmability of DLT while maintaining the stability and trust associated with a major bank. Understanding Tokenized Deposits While related, tokenized deposits are slightly different from stablecoins. A stablecoin is typically a new digital liability issued by an entity (which could be a bank). A tokenized deposit, on the other hand, is a digital representation of an existing bank deposit liability. Think of it as putting your existing bank balance onto a blockchain as a token. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Bank-Issued Stablecoin Tokenized Deposit Nature New digital liability issued by bank Digital representation of existing deposit liability Underlying Asset Backed by reserves held by the issuer (bank) Direct claim on fiat currency deposit at the bank Regulation Likely subject to specific stablecoin regulations Governed by existing banking regulations for deposits Use Case Focus Wholesale payments, cross-border, potentially retail Intra-bank, interbank, corporate payments, DLT-based transactions Tokenized deposits leverage the existing, highly regulated framework of bank deposits, potentially making them easier to implement from a regulatory perspective compared to issuing a completely new stablecoin. They could be crucial for facilitating transactions involving other tokenized assets (like tokenized securities or real estate) on DLT platforms. Institutional Crypto Adoption: Deutsche Bank Joins the Ranks Deutsche Bank’s exploration is not an isolated event. It’s part of a growing wave of institutional crypto adoption among major financial players. The report mentions other giants like Citi, HSBC, and JP Morgan. JP Morgan, for instance, has been a pioneer with its JPM Coin and the Onyx platform, specifically focused on wholesale payments and tokenized assets. This demonstrates a clear trend: banks are moving beyond simply viewing crypto as an asset class for trading and are actively exploring the underlying technology (DLT) to improve their core banking functions and create new digital products. This shift signifies increasing confidence, albeit cautious, from traditional finance in the potential of distributed ledger technology and digital assets to revolutionize banking infrastructure and services. Institutional crypto adoption is no longer a niche concept; it’s becoming a strategic priority. Benefits of Bank-Led Digital Asset Initiatives The potential advantages for banks and their clients exploring initiatives like the Deutsche Bank stablecoin or tokenized deposits include: Improved Liquidity Management: Real-time visibility and control over tokenized funds. Reduced Settlement Risk: Atomic settlement capabilities minimize counterparty risk in transactions involving tokenized assets. Lower Transaction Costs: Streamlined processes can reduce fees associated with traditional payments. New Revenue Streams: Potential for offering innovative digital asset services to clients. Increased Transparency: DLT can provide a transparent and immutable record of transactions (within a permissioned network). Challenges and Considerations Ahead Despite the potential, the path forward is not without hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: While tokenized deposits might fit existing rules better, stablecoins face evolving regulatory frameworks globally. Interoperability: Ensuring different bank-issued tokens or tokenized deposit systems can interact with each other and with other DLT networks. Security Risks: Guarding against cyber threats and ensuring the integrity of the DLT platform. Technical Complexity: Implementing and integrating DLT into existing legacy banking systems is a significant undertaking. Market Acceptance: Educating clients and ensuring widespread adoption of new digital currency solutions. Deutsche Bank’s evaluation process will undoubtedly involve navigating these complex technical, operational, and regulatory landscapes. What Does This Mean for the Future of Banking? Deutsche Bank’s exploration is a strong indicator that major banks see digital currencies and tokenization not just as a trend, but as a fundamental shift in how value will be moved and represented in the future. Whether they launch a Deutsche Bank stablecoin , focus solely on tokenized deposits , or join an industry platform, their involvement validates the technology’s potential. This move accelerates the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. It suggests a future where clearing and settlement could be faster, cheaper, and more efficient, and where new, programmable financial products become possible. The race for leadership in banking digital currencies is clearly heating up. Conclusion Deutsche Bank’s reported exploration into stablecoins and tokenized deposits is a pivotal development in the financial world. It underscores the growing momentum behind institutional crypto adoption and highlights the strategic importance major banks are placing on digital assets. While challenges remain, the potential benefits in efficiency, control, and new capabilities are driving this innovation. As more institutions like Deutsche Bank delve into banking digital currencies and explore solutions like a potential Deutsche Bank stablecoin or tokenized deposits , the landscape of global finance is set for a significant transformation, bringing the speed and programmability of digital assets into the core of traditional banking.

While gold has historically been the go-to asset, recent performance data is prompting experts to consider a new contender: Bitcoin . Is Bitcoin Truly a Better Inflation Hedge Than Gold? According to Elliot Johnson, CEO of Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, the numbers speak for themselves. Johnson recently highlighted Bitcoin’s remarkable performance, suggesting it has significantly outperformed other asset classes , including gold, when viewed as a hedge against inflation. This perspective was shared via economic news account Walter Bloomberg on X, drawing attention to Bitcoin’s potential in safeguarding purchasing power. In a recent note, Johnson presented compelling data comparing the five-year performance of Bitcoin against gold and the U.S. dollar: Bitcoin (BTC): Demonstrated explosive growth, returning over 1,000% in value. Gold: Showed a respectable, but comparatively modest, return of 92.5%. U.S. Dollar: Suffered a significant loss, depreciating by more than 20% due to inflationary pressures over the same period. These figures underscore Johnson’s argument that Bitcoin has served as a far more effective store of value against the backdrop of rising inflation and currency devaluation. Understanding the Appeal of Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge Why might Bitcoin be gaining traction as a preferred inflation hedge over traditional assets like gold? Several factors contribute to this view: Digital Scarcity: Like gold’s finite supply, Bitcoin has a capped maximum supply of 21 million coins. This predetermined scarcity, enforced by its decentralized protocol, is a core part of its value proposition, especially in times when fiat currencies can be printed in unlimited quantities. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates independently of any central bank or government. This makes it immune to the monetary policies that can lead to currency devaluation, a key factor driving inflation. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, offering a level of portability and accessibility that physical gold cannot match. Divisibility: Unlike gold, which is difficult to divide into small units, Bitcoin can be divided into very small fractions (up to eight decimal places, known as Satoshis), making it highly divisible and suitable for transactions of any size. Comparing Bitcoin and Gold: Key Differences for Investment While both Bitcoin and Gold are considered stores of value, their characteristics as an Investment differ: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its high price volatility compared to the relatively stable price movements of gold. This presents both higher potential returns and higher risks. History & Tradition: Gold has thousands of years of history as a store of value and medium of exchange. Bitcoin is a nascent technology, just over a decade old. Tangibility: Gold is a physical asset you can hold. Bitcoin exists only digitally. Adoption: While institutional adoption of Bitcoin is growing rapidly, gold is still more widely held by central banks and traditional financial institutions. Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Investment Despite the impressive performance highlighted by Johnson, investing in Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is not without its challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can impact market sentiment and price. Security Risks: Storing Bitcoin requires technical understanding to avoid loss due to hacks, scams, or losing private keys. Market Manipulation: The crypto market is still relatively small compared to traditional markets, potentially making it more susceptible to manipulation. Understanding the Technology: A basic understanding of blockchain technology and how Bitcoin works is recommended for investors. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering Bitcoin as part of their strategy to combat inflation, here are some actionable steps: Do Your Own Research: Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin, its technology, and its market dynamics. Don’t rely solely on performance data from a specific period. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is a volatile asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider Diversification: Bitcoin can be part of a diversified portfolio, but it may not be suitable as the sole hedge against inflation. Start Small: You don’t need to invest large sums. You can buy fractions of a Bitcoin. Secure Your Investment: Learn about secure storage options like hardware wallets. The Future Role of Cryptocurrency in Investment Portfolios Elliot Johnson’s perspective adds to the growing debate about the role of Cryptocurrency , specifically Bitcoin, in modern investment strategies. As fiat currencies continue to face inflationary pressures, the appeal of scarce, decentralized digital assets is likely to grow. While gold retains its historical significance, Bitcoin’s recent performance and unique characteristics position it as a powerful new tool in the investor’s arsenal against the silent tax of inflation. The shift in sentiment from traditional safe havens to digital alternatives like Bitcoin is a trend worth watching closely. It highlights a changing financial landscape where technology and decentralized systems are challenging long-held investment paradigms.

One such challenge often discussed in the realm of digital security is the rise of quantum computing. For holders and enthusiasts of the world’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , questions occasionally surface about whether this powerful new form of computation could one day break its formidable defenses. However, according to prominent figure Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, these fears surrounding the Quantum Computing Threat to Bitcoin are significantly overstated. Michael Saylor Bitcoin Stance: Downplaying Quantum Fears Michael Saylor, a well-known advocate for Bitcoin and head of a company that holds substantial amounts of the digital asset, recently weighed in on the debate. In an interview with Bloomberg, Saylor expressed a clear perspective: the threat posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin’s core security is not the immediate or paramount concern many might imagine. He characterized the fears as “overblown” and something the cryptocurrency industry can effectively manage should it ever materialize into a tangible risk. This isn’t to say quantum computing isn’t powerful, but rather that its application as a direct threat to Bitcoin’s fundamental cryptography isn’t as straightforward or imminent as some portray. Saylor’s view suggests that while quantum computing represents a significant technological leap, its potential impact on Bitcoin Security is often misunderstood or exaggerated in public discourse. Why Saylor Believes Others Are More Vulnerable One key point Saylor made is that if quantum computing were to become a threat capable of breaking current encryption methods, the targets far more likely to be attacked first would be traditional institutions and critical infrastructure, not necessarily Bitcoin’s decentralized network. He specifically mentioned: Banks and financial institutions Large technology firms Government systems and databases These centralized entities often hold vast amounts of sensitive data and control critical services, making them potentially higher-priority targets for anyone wielding advanced computing power. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and the specific way its cryptography is used in transactions offer certain protective layers that might make it a less attractive initial target compared to centralized honey pots of data. The Real Threat Today: Phishing and User Error In a dose of practical reality, Saylor highlighted what he sees as the much greater, present-day risk for individual Bitcoin users: phishing attacks. While futuristic quantum threats capture headlines, malicious actors are actively exploiting simpler vulnerabilities right now. Phishing involves tricking users into revealing their private keys, seed phrases, or login credentials through fake websites, emails, or messages. This type of social engineering doesn’t require breaking complex cryptography; it preys on human error and lack of awareness. Saylor’s emphasis on phishing serves as a crucial reminder that while we debate theoretical future threats, the most common ways people lose their Bitcoin today are through preventable security lapses directly related to how they handle their private information and wallet access. This is a significant aspect of personal Crypto Security that often gets overshadowed by more technical discussions. Understanding the Quantum Computing Threat to Bitcoin To appreciate Saylor’s perspective, it helps to understand what the potential quantum threat actually entails. Bitcoin relies on sophisticated cryptography for its security, primarily: SHA-256: Used for mining and generating addresses. Considered highly resistant, even to quantum attacks. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm): Used for creating digital signatures to authorize transactions. This is the part potentially vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm, which could theoretically derive a private key from a public key. The primary concern is related to the ECDSA signatures. When you send Bitcoin, you use your private key to create a signature that proves you own the funds. This signature, along with your public key (derived from your private key), is broadcast to the network. Currently, deriving the private key from the public key is computationally infeasible. A powerful enough quantum computer, however, could potentially make this feasible, allowing an attacker to steal funds from an address whose public key has been revealed (i.e., an address that has sent a transaction). It’s important to note that addresses that have received funds but never sent any transactions (and thus haven’t revealed their public key) are considered much safer from this specific quantum threat. Is Bitcoin Security Quantum-Proof? Not Yet, But Adaptable Saylor’s confidence stems from the belief that the blockchain industry is not static. According to reports like the one from Decrypt referencing his comments, Saylor is confident the industry can and will adapt if the quantum threat escalates from theoretical to practical. This adaptability could involve: Transitioning to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): Researchers are actively developing new cryptographic algorithms designed to be resistant to quantum computer attacks. Bitcoin’s protocol can be upgraded through soft or hard forks to incorporate these new algorithms. Changing Address Types: Encouraging or defaulting to address types (like SegWit or Taproot) that reveal the public key only when spending, minimizing the exposure window. Future upgrades could potentially use PQC for generating addresses and keys from the outset. Community Consensus: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means any significant protocol change requires broad consensus, which can be slow but ensures robustness and careful consideration of new threats and solutions. While Bitcoin’s current cryptography isn’t explicitly ‘quantum-proof’ in all aspects (specifically ECDSA after public key exposure), the ability of the open-source development community to identify threats and implement upgrades provides a path forward. Saylor’s point is that there is ample time and capability within the ecosystem to address this long before it becomes a catastrophic problem. Comparing Risks: Quantum vs. Phishing vs. Other Threats Let’s put the risks into perspective, as highlighted by Saylor: Threat Type Likelihood Today Potential Impact Primary Target Mitigation Quantum Computing Attack (on ECDSA) Very Low (requires massive, currently non-existent quantum computer) High (potential to steal funds from exposed public keys) Bitcoin addresses with exposed public keys; potentially other crypto/traditional systems first Future protocol upgrades (PQC), using newer address types, holding funds on unspent addresses Phishing/Social Engineering High (daily occurrence) High (direct loss of user funds) Individual users User education, hardware wallets, strong passwords, 2FA, verifying URLs Exchange Hacks Moderate (less frequent than phishing, but impactful) High (loss of funds held on exchange) Centralized exchanges Holding keys yourself (cold storage), using reputable exchanges, enabling exchange security features This comparison underscores Saylor’s point: while the Quantum Computing Threat is a fascinating long-term theoretical challenge, the immediate, practical threats like phishing pose a far greater risk to the average user’s Crypto Security today. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Holders Given Saylor’s perspective and the current landscape, what should Bitcoin holders focus on? Prioritize Present Security: Spend time learning about and implementing strong personal security practices against phishing, malware, and social engineering. Use hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of Bitcoin. Educate Yourself: Understand how Bitcoin transactions work and the difference between public and private keys. Be wary of unsolicited messages or requests for your seed phrase. Stay Informed on Protocol Developments: While not an immediate concern, keep an eye on discussions within the Bitcoin development community regarding post-quantum cryptography and potential future upgrades. Don’t Panic About Quantum: The quantum threat is a known challenge being researched. It’s not a sudden, unavoidable doom hanging over Bitcoin. The time scales for quantum computers capable of breaking Bitcoin’s ECDSA are still uncertain, providing a window for the protocol to evolve. Focusing on the fundamentals of securing your private keys and being vigilant against social attacks is the most impactful way to protect your Bitcoin Security right now. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Resilience vs. Real-World Risks Michael Saylor’s comments offer a reassuring perspective on a complex, futuristic threat. By calling the quantum computing risk to Bitcoin “overblown,” he correctly redirects attention to the more pressing, everyday security challenges faced by users, such as phishing. His confidence in the industry’s ability to adapt underscores the dynamic nature of the Bitcoin protocol and its underlying technology. While quantum computing is a powerful emerging field that warrants monitoring, it is not an immediate existential threat to Bitcoin. The network’s decentralized design, combined with the ongoing work of developers and the potential for future cryptographic upgrades, provides a strong foundation for long-term resilience. For now, the most effective way to maintain Crypto Security is through user education, vigilance, and robust personal security practices against the very real and present dangers that exist today.

Recent headlines often focus on market fluctuations, leading some to question their long-term value. However, a significant shift is quietly underway beneath the surface. Industry leaders like Charu Sethi, the Chief Marketing Officer at Unique Network – a company specializing in blockchain infrastructure specifically for NFTs – are championing a different narrative: NFTs are rapidly evolving into foundational components, becoming essential digital infrastructure for the next wave of digital innovation. Are We Underestimating the True Potential of NFTs? Charu Sethi’s perspective, shared in a recent opinion piece, challenges the prevailing view that the perceived ‘decline’ in the speculative NFT market signals the end of their relevance. Instead, she posits that this period marks a crucial transition. As the initial hype around profile pictures and collectibles cools, the focus is shifting towards the inherent capabilities and NFT Utility that these tokens offer. They are moving beyond being mere assets you trade and flip, becoming vital system primitives within decentralized environments. Think of it like the early internet. Initially, it might have seemed like just a place for static websites. But it quickly evolved into the fundamental layer upon which e-commerce, social media, streaming, and countless other services were built. Sethi argues that NFTs are undergoing a similar transformation, shedding their image purely as speculative items and establishing themselves as foundational elements for complex digital ecosystems. NFT Utility: More Than Just JPEGs The core of this evolution lies in expanding the concept of NFT Utility . What utility are we talking about? It’s about leveraging the unique, non-fungible nature of these tokens to represent ownership, identity, access rights, and complex digital states in a verifiable and decentralized manner. Sethi highlights that this utility is now extending into critical areas: Gaming: Moving beyond simple in-game items to representing player identity, progress, achievements, and even components of the game world itself. Artificial Intelligence (AI): Enabling AI agents to own assets, represent unique datasets, or even act as unique, tradable digital entities. Web3: Serving as the backbone for decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, digital property rights, and complex contractual logic within decentralized applications. This expanded utility is precisely what Sethi believes is replacing the reliance on speculative value. The intrinsic function and capability of the NFT become more important than its potential resale price on a secondary market. How Are NFTs Becoming Digital Infrastructure? To understand how NFTs function as digital infrastructure , consider their properties. Unlike fungible tokens (like Bitcoin or Ether, where one unit is identical to another), each NFT is unique. This uniqueness, combined with blockchain’s immutability and transparency, allows NFTs to serve as: Verifiable Ownership Records: A secure and transparent way to prove ownership of digital or even physical assets. Access Control Mechanisms: Granting or restricting access to digital content, events, or services based on NFT ownership. Representations of Identity: Acting as decentralized digital identities or verifiable credentials. Containers for Data and Logic: NFTs can store metadata, link to external data, and even embed or trigger specific smart contract logic. Sethi envisions a future where NFTs serve as fundamental layers for asset ownership, transaction logic, and even the representation of AI agents within decentralized systems. This positions them not just as items within an application, but as part of the underlying framework upon which applications are built – true Web3 Infrastructure . Web3 Infrastructure: The Role of NFTs in a Decentralized Future Web3 Infrastructure aims to build a more decentralized, user-controlled internet. NFTs are crucial to this vision because they provide a native digital primitive for representing unique things and relationships in a decentralized way. In Web3, NFTs can: Represent your decentralized identity and reputation. Tokenize real-world assets, allowing for fractional ownership and easier transfer. Manage digital rights and licenses for content creators. Enable decentralized governance by representing voting rights or membership in a DAO. Unique Network, as a blockchain infrastructure provider focused on NFTs , is directly contributing to building the foundational layers necessary for this future. By providing tools and protocols that make it easier to create, manage, and utilize complex NFTs, they are helping pave the way for NFTs to become seamless, invisible parts of the Web3 Infrastructure users interact with daily. The Transformation of Blockchain Gaming Through NFTs Perhaps one of the most visible areas where NFT Utility is flourishing is in Blockchain Gaming . Early play-to-earn models often focused heavily on the speculative value of in-game NFT assets. However, the space is maturing. Sethi’s perspective aligns with the evolving view in Blockchain Gaming , where NFTs are becoming integral to the core gameplay experience, not just an economic layer on top. Examples include: True Asset Ownership: Players genuinely own their in-game items, characters, and even virtual land, allowing them to trade, sell, or use them across different compatible games. Persistent Identity and Progress: NFTs can represent a player’s unique identity and track their progress or achievements across various gaming experiences. Dynamic and Evolving Assets: NFTs can change based on player actions, game events, or external data, adding depth and complexity to gameplay. Interoperability: While still nascent, the dream is for NFT assets to be usable across different games and platforms, creating a truly interconnected gaming metaverse. This integration moves NFTs from being just collectibles within a game to being fundamental components of the game’s economy, mechanics, and player identity, solidifying their role in Blockchain Gaming infrastructure. AI and NFTs: A Future Synergy? The intersection of AI and NFTs opens up fascinating possibilities, pushing the boundaries of both technologies. Sethi’s mention of NFTs serving as layers for AI agents hints at a future where AI entities can interact with the digital world in novel ways. Consider: AI Agent Ownership: An AI could own an NFT representing data, a digital asset, or even a stake in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Unique AI Creations: AI could generate unique digital art, music, or even code, which is then tokenized as an NFT, proving its origin and ownership. Data Tokenization: Specific datasets used to train AI models could be tokenized as NFTs, allowing for verifiable ownership, licensing, or fractional use. AI-Powered Dynamic NFTs: NFTs whose properties evolve based on AI analysis of data or interactions. The combination of AI and NFTs suggests a future where decentralized systems can incorporate intelligent, autonomous agents that own assets and participate in the digital economy, all verifiable and managed on the blockchain via NFTs. Benefits and Challenges of the NFT Evolution This shift towards NFTs as digital infrastructure brings significant benefits: True Digital Ownership: Empowering users with verifiable ownership over their digital assets. Enhanced Interoperability: The potential for assets and identities to move across different platforms and applications. New Economic Models: Enabling creator royalties, fractional ownership, and novel ways to monetize digital interactions and assets. Increased Transparency and Security: Leveraging blockchain’s inherent properties for secure and transparent record-keeping. Building Decentralized Ecosystems: Providing fundamental building blocks for a more decentralized internet. However, challenges remain: Scalability: Ensuring blockchain networks can handle the transaction volume required for widespread infrastructure use. User Experience: Making the technology accessible and easy to use for mainstream users. Regulatory Clarity: Navigating the evolving legal landscape surrounding digital assets. Technical Complexity: Developing robust and secure infrastructure layers and smart contracts. Shifting Perception: Overcoming the public perception of NFTs as purely speculative tools. Conclusion: The Unfolding Future of NFTs Charu Sethi’s insights from Unique Network offer a compelling look beyond the current market narrative surrounding NFTs . While speculation captured initial attention, the real, long-term value lies in their potential as fundamental digital infrastructure . As they evolve, NFTs are poised to become invisible yet essential components powering the future of Web3 , revolutionizing Blockchain Gaming , and enabling new synergies with AI and NFTs . This shift from speculative asset to utility-driven primitive is not just a trend; it’s the foundation for a more decentralized, owner-centric, and functionally rich digital world. The quiet work of building this infrastructure is happening now, laying the groundwork for the next phase of digital evolution.

The group will assess their impact on the state’s economy, legislation, and daily life. This resolution was introduced by Representative Mark Wright and passed during the 2025 Regular Session to set up the legislative subcommittee under the House Committee on Commerce. 🇺🇸 NEW: Louisiana will form a committee to study ""AI, blockchain and cryptocurrency"" The resolution states: ""WHEREAS One in five Americans owns cryptocurrency…it is in the interest of Louisiana [to] consider the benefits and challenges of these technologies."" pic.twitter.com/mxEfawa0su — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 10, 2025 Lawmakers form a team to study AI, blockchain, and crypto The subcommittee is required to begin its work no later than September 1, 2025. It will take several months to gather information and speak directly with experts to understand the benefits and risks of using these technologies in Louisiana’s economy and the government. The resolution states that the group must submit its full report to the House Committee on Commerce and the David R. Poynter Legislative Research Library by February 1, 2026. The report must explain the current use cases for AI, blockchain, and cryptocurrency in Louisiana. It should also examine how other states are managing these technologies. Finally, the group must recommend potential safeguards and determine whether Louisiana should introduce new laws to ensure their safe use in everyday life. The resolution doesn’t directly create any new laws. Still, it shows that the state is serious about bringing digital tools and assets into mainstream use and wants its leaders to understand how powerful and complex the tools are. Louisiana is one of the many states actively investigating AI, blockchain, and crypto. The leaders around the country are now waking up to the fact that if they wait too long to get the technology and the regulations around it right, people could end up vulnerable. The team will hold hearings and speak with experts before writing the report The House Resolution 317 says the subcommittee must actively go out, listen to the public, invite experts, and learn from people who understand how these technologies are being built, used, and regulated. The group must create open events where tech professionals, business owners, educators, students, or regular citizens share their concerns, insights, or experiences with AI tools, blockchain systems, or digital currencies. Lawmakers want the committee to hear from people who work closely with these tools and can explain their risks and potential in simple language. The subcommittee will examine state-level pilot programs, bills in Congress, and proposed national laws that deal with these technologies. This analysis will help Louisiana understand how it might improve its own rules from a detailed review of what other states and the federal government are doing. The resolution directs the study to focus on cybersecurity risks , digital privacy concerns, and the economic opportunities created by Web3 technologies and artificial intelligence. It will also examine regulatory challenges as well as education and workforce development issues. No individual members have been publicly named to the subcommittee, but the task force will comprise existing members of the House Commerce Committee and a chair of their choice.

This is where self-custodial wallet development plays a critical role, empowering users to hold their own keys and interact directly with blockchain networks. Recognizing the growing need for robust and accessible tools in this space, Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, has announced a significant step forward: the upcoming release of WDKv2. This isn’t just another update; it’s positioned as a game-changer for building the next generation of unstoppable digital wallets. What is Tether WDKv2 and Why Does it Matter? The announcement came directly from Paolo Ardoino Tether CEO, via a post on X (formerly Twitter). He revealed that WDKv2 is an enhanced version of their open-source Wallet Development Kit (WDK). At its core, a WDK is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation designed to simplify the process of creating cryptocurrency wallets. Why is this development from Tether noteworthy? While Tether is primarily known for USDT, its involvement in providing core infrastructure tools like a crypto wallet kit signals a broader strategic vision. It aims to contribute to the fundamental layers of the decentralized ecosystem, specifically by lowering the barrier to entry for developers building self-custodial solutions. The importance of self-custody cannot be overstated. Unlike centralized exchanges or custodial services where a third party holds your private keys, a self-custodial wallet gives you complete control. This aligns with the core ethos of blockchain and decentralization, putting financial sovereignty back in the hands of the individual. Exploring the Key Features of Tether WDKv2 Paolo Ardoino highlighted several key characteristics that set Tether WDKv2 apart. These features are designed to address some of the common challenges and limitations faced by developers building self-custodial wallets today. Fully Unstoppable: This feature suggests a design that is resistant to censorship or interference from external parties. In a truly decentralized system, a wallet should function regardless of network conditions or attempts to block access. This likely involves resilient network connectivity and transaction broadcasting mechanisms. Configurable: Developers need flexibility. A configurable kit allows builders to tailor the wallet’s features, user interface, and underlying blockchain interactions to specific use cases or user preferences. This moves beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. Uses P2P Swarms for Syncing and Broadcasting: This is a crucial technical detail. Relying on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks for syncing blockchain data and broadcasting transactions means the wallet doesn’t solely depend on centralized nodes or services. P2P swarms enhance resilience, privacy, and decentralization. This is a significant step towards truly decentralized infrastructure for wallets. These features collectively aim to provide developers with the building blocks for creating wallets that are not only secure and user-friendly but also robust against external pressures and highly adaptable. Who is Already Building with This Architecture? Early adoption is a strong indicator of a technology’s potential. According to the announcement, Rumble Wallet is already reportedly building on this new WDKv2 architecture. While details about Rumble Wallet are still emerging, its early adoption suggests that the kit is already functional and proving valuable to developers focused on self-custodial wallet development . This example provides a tangible case study for other developers considering using the crypto wallet kit . It demonstrates that the architecture is being put into practice to create real-world wallet solutions. What Support and Resources Will Be Available? A development kit is only as useful as the resources supporting it. Recognizing this, the WDKv2 release will include: Comprehensive Documentation: Essential for developers to understand how to use the kit effectively, including APIs, libraries, and best practices. Dedicated Support: Access to help and guidance from the Tether team or community contributors to resolve issues and navigate the development process. Example Implementations: Code examples and templates that developers can use as a starting point, accelerating the development cycle and demonstrating practical use cases for the kit’s features. These resources are vital for fostering adoption and building a community around the open-source crypto project. They lower the barrier for developers who might be new to building self-custodial solutions or working with P2P architectures. Why is Open-Source Important for Crypto Wallet Kits? The decision to make WDKv2 open-source crypto is highly significant, especially for tools related to financial sovereignty. Here’s why: Transparency and Security: Open-source code can be reviewed by anyone. This allows the community to audit the code for vulnerabilities, bugs, or malicious intent, increasing trust and security. Collaboration and Innovation: Developers globally can contribute to the kit, propose improvements, and build upon existing features, fostering rapid innovation. Avoids Vendor Lock-in: Developers are not tied to a proprietary system. They have the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the code, promoting decentralization within the development ecosystem itself. Community Building: An open-source project encourages the formation of a community around the kit, providing peer support and shared knowledge. For a project focused on enabling self-custodial wallet development , being open-source is almost a necessity to align with the core principles of decentralization and trust through verification rather than blind faith. What Does This Mean for the Future of Self-Custody? Tether’s entry into providing a robust crypto wallet kit like WDKv2 could have several positive ripple effects on the ecosystem: Accelerated Development: By providing a solid foundation, the kit can significantly speed up the time it takes for new teams to build and launch self-custodial wallets. Improved Quality and Security: A well-maintained open-source kit can lead to more secure and reliable wallets being developed across the board, reducing common errors. Greater Accessibility: As it becomes easier to build wallets, we might see more specialized wallets emerge catering to niche needs or specific blockchain networks. Increased Adoption: Ultimately, better and more accessible self-custodial options can encourage more users to take control of their private keys, reducing reliance on centralized entities. This move by Paolo Ardoino Tether and his team underscores a commitment to building foundational infrastructure for the decentralized web, extending beyond Tether’s primary stablecoin function. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the announcement is exciting, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Adoption Rate: Will developers readily adopt WDKv2 over existing libraries or building from scratch? The quality of documentation and support will be key. Maintenance and Updates: As an open-source project, its long-term success depends on consistent maintenance and updates from Tether and the community. Security Audits: Despite being open-source, thorough, independent security audits will be crucial for developers and users to trust wallets built with the kit. Competition: Other projects and companies also offer tools and libraries for wallet development. WDKv2 will need to demonstrate clear advantages. Navigating these challenges will be essential for WDKv2 to achieve its full potential in fostering widespread self-custodial wallet development . Conclusion: A Powerful Step for Decentralization The unveiling of Tether WDKv2 by Paolo Ardoino Tether is a significant development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By providing an open-source crypto crypto wallet kit focused on enabling robust, unstoppable, and configurable self-custodial wallet development using decentralized P2P swarms, Tether is contributing vital infrastructure. This initiative has the potential to accelerate the creation of more secure, resilient, and user-controlled wallets, moving the industry closer to the core ideals of decentralization and financial sovereignty. With comprehensive documentation, support, and examples planned, WDKv2 is poised to become a valuable resource for developers looking to build the future of digital asset management.

If so, you’ve likely seen Bitcoin making significant strides. A recent analysis shared on CNBC is turning heads, suggesting a remarkable target for the leading digital asset in the near future. Let’s dive into this intriguing Bitcoin price prediction . Who is Todd Gordon and What’s His CNBC Bitcoin Outlook? Todd Gordon, a respected contributor on CNBC and a seasoned market analyst, has offered a compelling outlook for Bitcoin. According to Gordon, based on his analysis of the weekly chart, Bitcoin is currently charting a course towards the significant $135,000 Fibonacci level. This isn’t just a random number; Fibonacci levels are technical analysis tools often used by traders to predict potential support and resistance areas or price targets based on mathematical sequences found in nature. Gordon’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin is poised for a potential breakthrough. He believes it is likely that Bitcoin will soon surpass its previous all-time high, paving the way for even stronger upward momentum in the market. This forecast provides an optimistic perspective for those invested in or watching the crypto space. Why is Bitcoin Shifting to a Strategic Hedge? Beyond a simple investment asset, Gordon suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being positioned as a strategic hedge. What does this mean? A hedge is typically an investment intended to offset potential losses in other investments. Traditionally, assets like gold or certain government bonds have served this purpose. Gordon’s view indicates a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential role in protecting wealth or diversifying portfolios against traditional market volatility or inflation. This shift in perception from a speculative gamble to a potential hedge highlights the evolving maturity and understanding of Bitcoin’s value proposition among some financial professionals. What’s Driving Bitcoin’s Recent Surge? Todd Gordon pointed to three primary factors underpinning Bitcoin’s recent upward trajectory. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the current market dynamics: Increased Institutional Buying Demand: Big players are entering the arena. Asset management firms, corporations, and other large institutions are allocating portions of their capital to Bitcoin. This influx of significant capital provides strong buying pressure and adds a layer of legitimacy to the asset class. Expanding Cryptocurrency ETF Market: The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets have been game-changers. These exchange-traded funds provide a more accessible and regulated way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This has opened the floodgates for new investment capital. Changes in the Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic conditions play a significant role. Factors like inflation concerns, monetary policy shifts by central banks, and geopolitical uncertainties can make traditional assets less appealing and drive investors towards alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. These three factors collectively create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin, supporting the kind of bullish outlook shared by analysts like Todd Gordon. Could Bitcoin Really Reach $135K Soon? While a $135,000 target in the near term might sound ambitious to some, it’s important to consider the context provided by Gordon’s analysis. His prediction is based on technical indicators (Fibonacci levels) and supported by fundamental shifts in the market (institutional adoption, ETFs, macro factors). The combination of technical analysis and fundamental drivers provides a more robust basis for the prediction than technicals alone. However, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Predictions, especially ambitious ones, are not guarantees. Market conditions can change rapidly, influenced by regulatory news, technological developments, or unforeseen global events. Actionable Insights for the Reader For those interested in this forecast, here are a few key takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market analysis from reputable sources like CNBC and analysts like Todd Gordon. Understand the Drivers: Recognize the importance of institutional flows and the impact of financial products like the crypto ETF market. Consider the Macro Picture: Pay attention to global economic trends and how they might influence asset allocation decisions towards Bitcoin. Do Your Own Research: Never rely solely on one prediction. Conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions. This analysis provides a compelling case for significant upside potential for Bitcoin, rooted in tangible market developments. Summary: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin In conclusion, the analysis from CNBC contributor Todd Gordon presents a powerful bullish case for Bitcoin, targeting an impressive $135,000 based on Fibonacci levels on the weekly chart. His perspective highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role as a potential strategic hedge and attributes its recent strength to increasing institutional Bitcoin demand, the expansion of the cryptocurrency ETF market, and favorable macroeconomic shifts. While the target is ambitious, the underlying drivers provide a solid foundation for the forecast. As always, navigating the crypto market requires diligence and a comprehensive understanding of the factors at play.

45782835,https://nulltx.com/?p=150365,1749621105,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Institutional Sell-Off Continues to Weigh on Lido DAO ($LDO) Token Price,https://nulltx.com/institutional-sell-off-continues-to-weigh-on-lido-dao-ldo-token-price/,"In the last month, there has been intensifying selling pressure on $LDO, the native token of Lido DAO . Most of this pressure has come from large institutional holders who have been on a sustained sell-off. Prominent investment firm Paradigm Capital has made some recent transactions that have brought further attention to this ongoing trend. On-chain data related to these transactions show that they have been moving a large amount of $LDO into exchange-linked wallets. The net effect of these concerted actions has been that $LDO has dropped 22% in value in just the last 30 days. Paradigm Capital Moves $8.4 Million in $LDO to Exchange Wallet Analysts working on the blockchain saw that just nine hours ago, Paradigm Capital shifted 10 million $LDO tokens—worth around $8.41 million—into the wallet address 0xC4Db, which is thought to be a front for a trading platform. This particular address has served as a funnel for several institutional wallets to route their LDO tokens to trading platforms. Given where the funds just went to, and given that this is the first use of the address reported by on-chain analysts, there isn’t good reason to think this is anything other than a trading platform in disguise. Interest has been piqued by Paradigm’s most recent transaction, as it hints at the firm potentially liquidating a fresh batch of its holdings. This wouldn’t be the first time Paradigm has seen gains from divesting a portion of its early investments. In 2020, Paradigm purchased 70 million $LDO tokens directly from Lido’s treasury at a considerable discount of just $0.76 per token. That set in motion a total investment of roughly $53.2 million. What we don’t know for certain is if, in the current timeframe, Paradigm is selling just what they bought in 2020 or if it’s in part selling what they’ve bought lately. In either case, it’s not looking good for Lido. In November last year, the firm sold off 50 million of those tokens at an average price of $1.31, bringing in a profit of around $27.5 million. With yesterday’s transfer of 10 million tokens to an unknown wallet, it appears Paradigm might be preparing to sell off half of its 20 million LDO tokens left in reserve—potentially continuing the wave of institutional selling that has affected LDO’s price trajectory. Alternately, LDO could also have been a donation to a charitable cause. Exchange-Linked Wallet Activity Signals Broader Institutional Exit Paradigm is not the only one. In the last month, a number of institutional wallets have moved a total of 48.48 million $LDO tokens—valued at about $45.6 million during the transfers—to various exchanges using the wallet 0xC4Db. Such concentrated movement into exchange addresses is generally interpreted as an intent to sell, rather than a repositioning of assets or a custodial move. 这机构的 $LDO 跟出不完似的，一个接一个。这最近一个月才有一个机构 (或团队) 出了 $5131 万枚 LDO ($48.66M)。 现在 Paradigm Capital 也要出：Paradigm Capital 地址在 7 小时前转出 1000 万枚 $LDO ($8.41M)，预计这些 LDO 也会在接下来被转进 Binance、OKX、Bybit、Gate。 Paradigm 是在 4… https://t.co/xSPsS7g47K pic.twitter.com/kb4XH8jZZu — 余烬 (@EmberCN) June 10, 2025 Although the specific names of the institutions associated with these extra transfers have not been completely revealed, the overall amount involved is large and gives more to an investigation’s concern. Retail investors and analysts have a burning sensation where these sell-off transfers touch on the ever-elusive trust factor. And eroded trust results in a very bad market sentiment. Price Performance and Market Outloo k The fallout from this selling spree is already clear in LDO’s market performance. The token has shed 22% of its value over the past month, while many other assets in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector have rallied. For a project that once stood at the very forefront of Ethereum staking infrastructure, this kind of downward momentum reflects awfully on liquidity, investor confidence, and possibly long-term institutional commitment. Lido DAO’s influence in the Ethereum atmosphere does stay present, especially for a company that has piped so far in the diluted staking department. But what’s going on with Lido? Well, Paradigm has started to dump; and with that, the questions have started to surface again about Lido’s prospects, governance, and the trajectory it’s on as an Ethereum development shop. In the next days and weeks, market participants will be watching wallet 0xC4Db to see what it does next. If Paradigm is indeed continuing to liquidate its last stake, or if other institutions do likewise, $LDO holders could be in for further downside. Currently, retail investors and the wider DeFi community are coming to terms with the implications of this institutional reshuffling and are left wondering whether Lido DAO can get through this storm without experiencing any further downturns.

The PI price currently stands at $0.6423 , down 77.13% from its all-time high of $2.98 , but recent on-chain activity hints at a potential turnaround. 200 Million PI Tokens Transferred — What Happened? A massive 200 million PI tokens were recently moved from a liquidity reserve to a private wallet , sparking widespread speculation. According to popular crypto analyst Moon Jeff , the movement appears to be an Over-the-Counter (OTC) purchase , a method often used by institutional investors to avoid market slippage. “This kind of quiet accumulation usually signals strong confidence from big players,” said Jeff on X. Why It Matters OTC deals bypass public exchanges and are typically done by large investors, suggesting institutional interest and strategic accumulation in Pi Network — even during a dull market phase. Pi Coin Price Analysis: A Volatile Journey On launch day, Feb 20 , PI closed at $0.86 . Between Feb 20–26 , it soared 2,889.30% . By March 31 , it had plummeted 81.47% from its peak. From May 7–13 , PI rebounded 114.28% , only to fall again by 48.10% starting May 14 . Over the last 14 days , it dropped 14.3% ; in the last 7 days , it’s down 1.6% .

Dr. Altcoin recently criticized the Pi Core Team for lack of progress and poor communication. Some KYC-verified users have even claimed they haven’t received their PI tokens , raising further concerns within the community. Pi2Day: Could Pi Network Binance Listing Be Announced? All eyes are now on June 28 , when the Pi Network celebrates Pi2Day — a date known for major updates and community events . According to community buzz, a Binance listing announcement might be on the horizon, though this remains unconfirmed. Such a development could drastically shift market momentum. Final Take: While PI remains far from its peak, the recent whale move and Pi2Day anticipation may act as a catalyst for a new price surge. Investors are watching closely to see whether the $1.2 resistance can be broken, or whether Pi Network’s ongoing issues will continue to stall its growth. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Just in the last few hours, a big whale in the world of crypto, Buddy Huang Licheng, also known as @machibigbrother, has helped to pump up the price of HYPE past the $40 mark. The recent price movements have underscored the burgeoning interest in the Hyperliquid ecosystem and the profit-taking strategies of veterans that have guided them to benefit from the Hyperliquid token rally over the past few weeks. Whale Spends Nearly $10 Million on HYPE Ahead of ATH A significant crypto whale is currently attracting much attention for a considerable buy of HYPE tokens. During the last 2 hours, this individual has executed an order to purchase approximately 259,367 HYPE, at a cost of about $9.976 million in USDC, for an average price of $38.46 per token. It seems likely that this HYPE buyer is acting with some conviction, given the not so small amount of money involved and the fact that the token is now approaching all-time high price levels. $HYPE continues to attract major purchases as it nears a new ATH! A whale spent $9.976M in $USDC to buy 259,367 $HYPE at an average price of $38.46 in the past 2 hours. This whale has realized over $10M in all-time profit on #Hyperliquid . Follow @spotonchain and monitor the… https://t.co/QAr4rIleqI pic.twitter.com/CA0o2FhtcK — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) June 10, 2025 This whale boasts an even more striking history on the Hyperliquid platform. On-chain data indicates that they’ve made over $10 million in profit from past trading activity around HYPE. This speaks to not only their profound knowledge of the token’s market dynamics but also their ability to time trades exceptionally well. Retail investors often see such massive purchases as very bullish signals. They tend to see these as instilling confidence in the price trend. With $HYPE trading above $40 and seemingly in a strong uptrend, the price trend has also been helped along by organic demand and some high-profile investors making themselves known. Buddy Huang Licheng Locks in Millions in Profit As a number of whales have begun to enter the market, a select few have also started to exit—reaping some pretty substantial profits after riding the recent bull wave. Buddy Huang Licheng, known online as @machibigbrother, has been one of the most closely followed participants in the HYPE ecosystem. He began building his position in May by purchasing 200,000 HYPE spot at a price of $29.40. As the price trajectory confirmed a bull pattern, he significantly increased his exposure by entering leveraged positions. 随着 $HYPE 价格上涨突破 $40，麻吉大哥黄立成 ( @machibigbrother ) 开始逐步平多 $HYPE 进行止盈，他目前在 HYPE 上浮盈 $650 万。 他在 5 月份以 $29.4 的价格购买了 20 万枚 HYPE 现货，然后又通过合约以 5x 杠杆做多了 65 万枚 HYPE，开仓均价 $35.6。 随着 $HYPE 价格上涨突破… https://t.co/lG6UornotP pic.twitter.com/EcHgHxEGRT — 余烬 (@EmberCN) June 10, 2025 Trading data reveal that Licheng established long positions on 650,000 HYPE tokens, utilizing 5x leverage at an average entry price of $35.60. His strategy has reaped fantastic rewards so far and, as of now, has netted him an unrealized profit of approximately $6.5 million, all thanks to HYPE’s rocket-like price ascent well above the $40 mark. Spotting a chance to lock in profits, Licheng has slowly begun to lessen his exposure. He has started to fold portions of his leveraged long position, turning virtual gains into actual ones. Even after trimming a bit, he still sits on 440,000 HYPE long contracts and has all 200,000 HYPE spot holdings left. This suggests he is still juiced to the gills with the HYPE, even if he is skimming a bit off the top. A Bullish Market Fueled by Confidence and Smart Positioning Investor confidence and sharp strategies from experienced market players are driving the current HYPE rally. The nearly-$10 million buy-in from a whale and the profit-taking by Buddy Huang Licheng—both illustrative of two distinct but complementary market dynamics—are driving HYPE higher. If HYPE’s rally is not yet in the bag, it is certainly highly probable. HYPE’s recent surge over $40 is a noteworthy psychological and technical event. The token continues its push toward its previous all-time high, but the move has been a little more sobering for most and slightly more euphoric for a few. While hype is indeed real, it’s also shorthand for something far less glamorous: the prospect of either unsustainable growth or the unsustainable emission of new HYPE tokens. The token’s future performance will likely hinge on the overarching market environment, the ongoing uptake of the Hyperliquid platform, and the question of whether large investor interest will continue to be evident in the wake of recent whale pushes. If the current bullish trend holds and profit-taking can be kept in balance, then HYPE seems positioned to set some fresh all-time highs. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The broader ecosystem that centers around @virtuals_io saw even better growth, with the $VIRTUAL token and its affiliated projects really taking off and driving the sector’s momentum as investor interest in the space seems to be expanding. On June 10th, 2025, the AI agent market achieved a total market cap of $10.42 billion, which was a gain of 8.76% in just 24 hours. The Virtuals ecosystem contributed greatly to this market surge with a quite impressive market cap increase of 11.26%, pushing its total valuation to $2.43 billion now. Daily gains over the past week have led $VIRTUAL to reach a new price of $1.969, resulting in an overall 10.98% increase today. Virtuals Ecosystem Gains Traction Amid Strong Rotation Investor confidence in AI-native infrastructure and agent-based platforms is clearly on the rise. The reason? Because the virtual ecosystem is performing quite strongly. Since Aug. 25, the market cap associated with $VIRTUAL has grown by a staggering 11.26%, which is right up there with the best performers in the virtual space. In fact, $2.00 is such a key level that you could argue it’s the last line of defense for weekend traders who want to keep $VIRTUAL below $2.00. In addition to the price movement, Virtuals experienced a substantial gain in mindshare — a metric that calculates market narrative attention. Mindshare climbed to 40.47%, which suggests a nearly singular focus by social media, developers, and investors on Virtuals-based projects. Meanwhile, the protocol continues to place itself at the very nexus of AI-agent development. Its current performance in the number metrics cements its status as a lead horse in this engine of rapid growth. This influx of capital into the Virtuals ecosystem comes during a much larger investment surge into AI agent protocols. This is being driven by newly emerging Echo cluster signals, which are early technical indicators of market interest and positioning by smart money. Top Performers Reflect Market Confidence A few projects that fall under the broader AI agent sector also had notable 24-hour performances, showing that capital is rotating into places beyond just the flagship protocols. By my calculations of the projects that had the best growth in market cap yesterday, the top five were BYTE (+122.4%), ARBUS (+42.21%), CALLS (+41.71%), WAKEAI (+41.07%), and POLY (+39.84%). Evidently, these projects are doing something right — but what, exactly? Virtuals Daily Update | June 10th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/8fc2eY4FDv — Graeme (@gkisokay) June 10, 2025 The performance of BYTE was particularly striking, more than doubling its fortune in a single day. It was likely in part due to speculation, but the project has been getting more and more interest lately for its machine-learning model integrations and autonomous protocol functionality. Likewise, ARBUS and CALLS had back-to-back gains as the attention clusters picked up on user growth and developer engagement. The use case diversity of these top gainers shows that we are in a maturing market. Capital is flowing toward real traction and protocol utility, not hype cycle nonsense. Sector Outlook: Echo Clusters and Strategic Rotation Signal More Upside The robust results from the Virtuals ecosystem and the AI agent universe indicate sustained enthusiasm in this part of the market. Both kinds of investors seem eager to position themselves for a future dominated by AI-native platforms. Buy signals based on two kinds of networks — Echo clusters and high-conviction clusters — have been in place for a while now. The market for AI agents, now valued at $10.42 billion, is one of the most vibrant stories in the world of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Virtuals enjoys a market cap and level of user engagement that puts it in a leading position over most of its rivals. With over 40% of the sector’s attention and engagement, it’s virtual protocols like this one that are pushing the cryptocurrency space into new areas of monetary and technological innovation. As capital keeps rotating and more players look to funnel their funds into the high-growth areas of Web3, the AI agent space—led by $VIRTUAL and its associated protocols—looks like it might sustain its upward momentum and, very possibly, lead the next leg of the growth in the digital asset market.

For the past couple of months, the performance of tokens native to five leading cryptocurrency exchanges—Binance, Bitget, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io—has swung a little wildly. A $10,000 hypothetical investment in each of these tokens offers a glimpse into some of the best and worst performing places for exchange-aligned capital during that same stretch. Since exchange tokens usually provide some kind of utility within their ecosystems—like trading discounts, governance, and staking—they mostly appeal to and attract long-term holders. Still, their value is also quite sensitive to broader market conditions, trading volumes, and any kind of development relating to the platform, good or bad. So how did a $10K position in each of the following tokens hold up over the past two months? Binance Leads With Strong Fundamentals Of the five platforms scrutinized, Binance’s homegrown token, $BNB, offered the fattest payback over the two-month window. It was up 10 percent. So, if you put $10,000 into $BNB two months back, you’d have $11,000 now. Yes, that’s hardly a moonshot compared to some of the more outrageous tokens out there—that’s your segue into Bored Apes or whatever other NFT might be tripping your trigger. But it’s a far sight better than the previous two-month stretch for $BNB when it was down 17 percent. For a long time, BNB has been seen as one of the most developed and sturdy tokens in the exchange ecosystem, enjoying the advantages that come with having a gigantic global user base and a varied product line, not to mention the simple fact that it has a gigantic global user base. It is, as we used to say, tokenomically a core part of the Binance empire. Users get discounts on trading fees, they can use BNB to participate in the launch of new tokens, and it is a very basic way that one can use to participate in the DeFi and payment ecosystem that is Binance. A gain of 10% indicates that investor confidence in Binance’s infrastructure and ongoing ability to generate volume remains intact—even in uncertain market conditions. Bitget and OKX Hold Steady, Delivering Moderate Gains Just behind BNB in terms of gains were Bitget’s $BGB and OKX’s $OKB tokens, which rose by 7% and 6%, respectively, over the same period. So, if you’d put $10,000 into BGB at the start of the year, it would now be worth $10,700, and a $10,000 investment in OKB would presently be hovering around $10,600. The $BGB token from Bitget not only saw some price appreciation, but it also really stood out because it delivered the highest yield farming rewards compared to everything else in our coverage group. That yield farming reward offering is likely to heighten investor interest. Yield farming remains a very popular strategy among crypto users who are looking for almost guaranteed passive income opportunities. $OKB token from OKX, on the other hand, saw somewhat less growth but did manage to maintain price stability. The integration of products that are really cutting-edge and the focus on a truly multichain world seem to be engaging investors and keeping them on board with this particular token. OKB is not making headlines for the high returns that some investors are looking for, but it has built up a very respectable reputation for being consistent. Bybit and Gate.io Fall Behind Conversely, on the performance spectrum’s opposite end, Bybit’s $MNT and Gate.io’s $GT tokens notched losses. $MNT slid 12% over two months, dragging a $10,000 investment down to $8,800. Gate.io’s $GT didn’t fare any better; it sank 13%, with the same $10,000 investment now worth $8,700. Holding $10K in Exchange Tokens: Who Came Out Ahead? Here’s how $10K in native tokens performed across 5 major exchanges over 2 months: • Binance $BNB : +10% • Bitget $BGB : +7% • OKX $OKB : +6% • Bybit $MNT : -12% • Gate io $GT : -13% $BNB , $BGB , and $OKB held up well… pic.twitter.com/baOzT07H6L — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 10, 2025 These shortfalls may stem from a multitude of causes, such as slower user growth, less effective ecosystem incentives, or just plain market skepticism about the platforms themselves. For $MNT, the token’s volatility and relatively newest-of-the-new market presence might account for that bigger swing. For $GT, a lack of any major “gotta have it now” kind of reasons for buying the token and just dwindling trading volume could be what’s behind the persistent price pressure. These tokens have likely caused their investors to weather greater drawdowns than they expected, thus underscoring the need to do platform-specific due diligence before sinking any capital into exchange tokens. Final Take: Exchange Token Exposure Requires Selectivity In general, the comparative performance of exchange tokens in the last couple of months shows that even if these tokens can provide some upward movement and be useful, they are not consistent in their returns. Binance’s BNB, for instance, might have been the best performer in this set, showcasing the underlying platform’s strength with solid double-digit returns. Bitget’s BGB, meanwhile, layered on top of its price appreciation the mixing in of attractive farming rewards, making it an appealing bet for holders focused on yield. OKX’s OKB? It held nice and steady, appealing to those who like a more measured approach. At the same time, investors in Bybit’s $MNT and Gate.io’s $GT experienced marked downturns, highlighting the reality that not all tokens associated with exchanges act similarly—even when they’re in the same sector. As ever, for those investing in exchange tokens, there’s no substitute for keeping a close watch on the platforms’ goings-on, given how rapidly the world of crypto finance can change.

33767162,[object Object],1749621608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"South Korea Moves Forward With Crypto Regulation, Eyes Stablecoin Oversight",https://bitcoinist.com/south-korea-moves-forward-with-crypto-regulation/,"A South Korean lawmaker has introduced a comprehensive bill aimed at establishing a more structured regulatory environment for crypto assets in the country. The proposed legislation, known as the Digital Asset Basic Act, was announced Tuesday by Min Byeong-deok, a member of the ruling Democratic Party. The bill is designed to complement the Virtual Asset Investor Protection Act, which took effect in July 2024, by going beyond investor safeguards to define a broader legal foundation for digital asset activity. Aligning with Global Stablecoin Trends At a press conference, Min described the bill as a step toward positioning South Korea as a global leader in the digital economy. A key feature of the legislation is the implementation of a licensing system for stablecoin issuers. Under the proposed rules, stablecoin operators would be required to hold a minimum of 500 million Korean won (approximately $367,890) in owner’s capital to qualify for a license. This requirement is intended to ensure financial accountability and support the government’s broader goal of promoting Korean won-denominated stablecoins. The stablecoin licensing provision appears to support the administration’s broader policy agenda under President Lee Jae-myung, who previously committed to enabling a domestic stablecoin market. Min, who led the digital asset committee during President Lee’s election campaign, indicated that the measure aims to curb capital flight through foreign-currency-based stablecoins and support a robust local digital financial system. The legislative push follows similar developments in other jurisdictions. In the United States, the Genius Act, which addresses stablecoin regulation, is gaining traction with support from President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Hong Kong recently enacted its own licensing framework for stablecoin issuers. These international examples appear to inform South Korea’s approach, as Min highlighted parallels with regulatory practices in the US, European Union, and Japan,particularly regarding the issuance, distribution, and trading of digital assets. Establishing Broader Oversight of Digital Assets Beyond stablecoins, the Digital Asset Basic Act seeks to provide legal clarity on digital asset classifications and the responsibilities of service providers operating within the ecosystem. The bill includes provisions for the creation of a Digital Asset Committee to be directly overseen by the Office of the President, emphasizing a centralized oversight mechanism. In addition to structural reforms, the proposed legislation outlines legal frameworks to address market misconduct. These include penalties for unfair trading practices such as price manipulation or the dissemination of false information, areas not directly addressed by prior laws . The bill also includes measures to standardize compliance procedures for exchanges and custodians operating in the country. If enacted, the Digital Asset Basic Act would mark a significant step in the evolution of South Korea’s crypto regulatory space. As jurisdictions around the world continue to develop their approaches to digital finance, South Korea’s proposed framework positions it among the countries seeking to balance innovation with oversight. The bill is expected to undergo further review and discussion in the National Assembly in the coming months.

Following the landmark approvals of spot Bitcoin ETF products earlier this year, the regulatory body has announced it is initiating a formal review of a novel application from Bitwise . This isn’t just another single-asset fund; Bitwise is proposing a first-of-its-kind Hybrid ETF that would combine exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single investment vehicle. What is the Bitwise Bitcoin Ethereum Hybrid ETF Proposal? At its core, the Bitwise application, filed by NYSE Arca, seeks to create an exchange-traded fund that holds two of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum . Unlike separate funds for each asset, this proposed ETF would offer investors exposure to both within a single product. Key details of the proposal include: Dual Asset Exposure: The fund would hold physical Bitcoin and Ethereum . Dynamic Allocation: The initial proposed asset allocation reflects the current market value shares of the two cryptocurrencies, approximately 83% Bitcoin and 17% Ethereum . While this initial allocation is based on market capitalization, the fund’s strategy for rebalancing or adjusting this mix over time will be a critical point of regulatory scrutiny and investor interest. Filed by NYSE Arca: The application is sponsored by Bitwise and listed on the NYSE Arca exchange, a common venue for ETF listings. This structure is particularly noteworthy because it moves beyond single-asset crypto ETFs, signaling a potential path for more complex, multi-asset crypto investment products in the future. Why is the SEC Reviewing This Hybrid ETF Now? The SEC ‘s decision to initiate a review is a standard procedural step for any new ETF application. However, the context surrounding this review is significant. The regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs in the U.S. has evolved rapidly: Caption: The SEC is reviewing the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum hybrid ETF proposal. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETF s set a precedent for physically-backed crypto funds. While the path for a spot Ethereum ETF is still uncertain, with the SEC currently reviewing multiple applications, the Bitwise hybrid proposal adds another layer of complexity. The SEC ‘s review process typically involves: Initial filing and public notice. Opportunity for public comments. Internal staff review regarding market manipulation concerns, investor protection, and custody arrangements. Potential extensions of the review period. Ultimately, an approval or disapproval order. Reviewing a Hybrid ETF requires the SEC to consider the regulatory implications of holding two distinct, albeit correlated, crypto assets within a single fund structure. This includes assessing the risks associated with each asset individually and the potential interactions or correlations between them. Potential Benefits of a Combined Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF For investors, a Hybrid ETF like the one proposed by Bitwise could offer several compelling advantages: Simplified Diversification: Gaining exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum , the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, is simplified into a single investment product, reducing the need for multiple accounts or trades. Convenience and Accessibility: Like other ETFs, it would trade on traditional stock exchanges (NYSE Arca), making it easily accessible to retail and institutional investors through standard brokerage accounts. Potential Cost Efficiency: A single fund might offer lower management fees compared to holding separate Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products, although this would depend on the final fee structure. Regulatory Clarity: An approved Hybrid ETF would operate under the regulated framework of traditional securities markets, potentially offering investors a greater sense of security and transparency compared to investing directly on crypto exchanges. Targeted Exposure: Investors bullish on the broader crypto market, specifically the foundational assets BTC and ETH, could use this fund for targeted exposure without needing to actively manage individual crypto wallets or exchange accounts. This type of product caters particularly to investors who see value in both the ‘digital gold’ narrative of Bitcoin and the smart contract/decentralized application ecosystem of Ethereum . Challenges and Considerations for the Bitwise Proposal Despite the potential benefits, the Bitwise Hybrid ETF proposal faces significant hurdles and raises important considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETF s are approved, the regulatory status of Ethereum as a commodity or security remains a point of discussion, particularly for proof-of-stake versions. The SEC ‘s stance on Ethereum will heavily influence the outcome for this hybrid fund. Correlation and Concentration Risk: While offering diversification relative to a single-asset fund, a fund holding only Bitcoin and Ethereum is still highly concentrated within the crypto market. Both assets are subject to high volatility and significant correlation, meaning a downturn in one could heavily impact the other. Allocation Management: Maintaining a specific target allocation (like 83/17) in highly volatile markets requires frequent rebalancing, which could incur trading costs and potential tracking errors against the underlying assets. Custody and Security: The fund would need secure and regulated custody solutions for both Bitcoin and Ethereum , which adds complexity compared to a single-asset fund. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC will scrutinize whether the underlying markets for both Bitcoin and Ethereum are sufficiently resistant to manipulation to protect ETF investors. These challenges are not unique to Bitwise but are inherent in creating regulated financial products based on nascent and volatile asset classes like cryptocurrencies. The Broader Impact: Hybrid ETFs and the Future of Crypto Regulation The SEC ‘s decision on the Bitwise Hybrid ETF could have far-reaching implications for the future of crypto investments in the U.S. An approval would: Set a precedent for multi-asset crypto ETFs. Signal increased regulatory comfort with combining different cryptocurrencies in regulated products. Potentially pave the way for ETFs including other large-cap altcoins or baskets of cryptocurrencies. A disapproval, on the other hand, could reinforce a cautious stance from the SEC regarding complex crypto products or highlight specific concerns related to the hybrid structure or the regulatory status of Ethereum . For investors, the review process itself provides valuable insight into the SEC ‘s evolving perspective on crypto. It underscores the ongoing maturation of the crypto market as it intersects with traditional finance. Keeping an eye on the public comments submitted to the SEC and the rationale behind their eventual decision will be crucial for understanding the future trajectory of crypto ETFs. Conclusion: Awaiting the SEC’s Verdict The SEC ‘s initiation of a review for the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum Hybrid ETF proposal marks a significant step in the evolution of crypto investment products in the U.S. This novel fund structure aims to offer investors simplified, regulated exposure to the two largest digital assets. While the potential benefits in terms of convenience and diversification are clear, the proposal faces complex regulatory hurdles related to the hybrid nature and the differing statuses of Bitcoin and Ethereum . The outcome of the SEC ‘s review will not only determine the fate of this specific fund but could also shape the future landscape for multi-asset crypto ETFs and the broader regulatory approach to digital assets.

OpenAI, a leader in AI research, has unveiled its latest creation: OpenAI o3-pro . This new model is positioned as a major leap forward in AI reasoning capabilities. What Makes OpenAI o3-pro a Breakthrough AI Reasoning Model? Unlike earlier generations of AI that often relied on pattern matching or simple data retrieval, the AI reasoning model architecture employed by o3-pro is designed to tackle problems more like a human might – step by step. This methodical approach allows the model to perform more reliably and accurately, particularly in complex fields. OpenAI highlights its strength in areas such as physics, mathematics, and coding, where precise, logical steps are crucial for finding correct solutions. O3-pro builds upon the foundation of the o3 model launched earlier this year, representing a ‘souped-up’ version with enhanced performance and features. OpenAI states that this makes o3-pro their most capable model released to date. Accessing the Power of OpenAI o3-pro Access to this advanced OpenAI model is rolling out in stages. Starting this week, ChatGPT Pro and Team users gained access, with o3-pro replacing the previous o1-pro model in the model picker. Enterprise and Edu users are slated to receive access the following week. Developers can also begin integrating o3-pro into their applications, as the model is now live in OpenAI’s developer API. For developers using the API, understanding the pricing is key. OpenAI o3-pro is priced based on token usage: Input tokens: $20 per million tokens Output tokens: $80 per million tokens A token is essentially a piece of a word, and OpenAI estimates that a million input tokens is roughly equivalent to 750,000 words. This tiered pricing structure means the cost will vary significantly depending on the complexity and length of the prompts and responses. How Does o3-pro Stack Up? Examining AI Capabilities and Benchmarks OpenAI claims that o3-pro demonstrates superior AI capabilities compared to its predecessors and even key competitors. According to internal testing, o3-pro achieves impressive scores on popular AI benchmarks. For instance, on the AIME 2024 benchmark, which specifically tests mathematical skills, o3-pro reportedly outperformed Google’s top model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. It also beat Anthropic’s recently released Claude 4 Opus on the GPQA Diamond test, a benchmark designed to assess PhD-level scientific knowledge. Beyond benchmarks, OpenAI emphasizes positive feedback from expert evaluators. Reviewers consistently preferred o3-pro over the base o3 model across various categories, particularly highlighting its strength in: Science and Education Programming Business applications Writing assistance Reviewers also rated o3-pro higher for clarity, comprehensiveness, instruction-following, and accuracy. Enhanced Features and Current Limitations A significant upgrade in o3-pro is its access to a suite of tools. This allows the model to perform actions beyond just generating text, including: Searching the web for up-to-date information Analyzing files provided by the user Reasoning about visual inputs Using Python for calculations or code execution Leveraging memory to personalize responses However, it’s important to note that o3-pro is not without its initial limitations. OpenAI has stated that temporary chats with the model in ChatGPT are currently disabled due to a technical issue they are working to resolve. Additionally, o3-pro cannot generate images, and it does not yet support Canvas, OpenAI’s AI-powered workspace feature. Another point noted by OpenAI is that while o3-pro’s responses are more robust, they typically take longer to generate compared to the older o1-pro model. Conclusion: A Step Forward in AI Reasoning The release of OpenAI o3-pro marks an important step in the evolution of AI, particularly in the domain of reasoning models. By focusing on step-by-step problem-solving, OpenAI aims to make AI more reliable and capable for complex tasks. While there are initial limitations and a longer response time, the reported improvements in benchmarks and expert evaluations suggest that o3-pro could significantly enhance the capabilities available to ChatGPT Pro users and developers, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in technical and creative fields.

In the past 24 hours, TRX climbed approximately 3.9%, reaching a trading value of $0.294. Despite these recent gains, Tron remains significantly below its all-time high of $0.43, set in December 2024, representing roughly a 31.8% decrease from that peak. This upward trajectory coincides with notable stablecoin activity on the Tron network, particularly involving Tether’s USDT token. Recently, a substantial minting event involving USDT occurred, signaling increased liquidity and potential market demand. Related Reading: TRON Surges Past 8 Million Daily Transactions as TRX Holds Above $0.27 Significant USDT Minting Event on Tron Amr Taha, an analyst from CryptoQuant’s QuickTake Platform, highlighted a significant event occurring on the Tron blockchain involving Tether’s stablecoin, USDT. According to Taha’s report titled “Tether Treasury mints $1 billion USDT on TRON prior to Bitcoin reaching $110,000,” the Tether Treasury recently issued 1 billion new USDT tokens on the Tron blockchain on June 9, 2025. This mint represents the largest single issuance of USDT on Tron for the month so far, emphasizing the network’s increasing relevance for stablecoin transactions. Taha noted that two primary factors likely drove this sizable minting event. First, it points toward elevated market demand for stablecoins, particularly within Tron’s ecosystem, known for low transaction fees and high-speed transfers. Second, the minting could signal significant institutional activity or preparations for substantial over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trades. Historically, such minting events tend to precede increased trading activity as investors leverage newly injected liquidity into the markets. The introduction of additional stablecoin liquidity typically boosts overall cryptocurrency market conditions, potentially providing support during periods when traditional financial markets are less robust. Divergent Trends: Rising TRX Price and Declining TVL Meanwhile, separate on-chain analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson noted a sharp decrease of nearly $2 billion in the total value locked (TVL) within lending protocols on Tron. This recent drop in TVL contrasts notably with the rising price of TRX, marking a divergence that raises intriguing questions for investors. Wedson pointed out that historically, reduced TVL in lending platforms on Tron has correlated with upward price movements for TRX, as previously observed in early 2024.

In a June 10 press release, Ripple announced that Guggenheim’s DCP would now be available on XRP ( XRP ) Ledger through the Zeconomy platform. Since its initial launch on Ethereum ( ETH ) in September 2024, the tokenized asset, which has been rated Prime-1 by Moody’s, has processed over $280 million in volume and offers custom maturities of up to 397 days. DCP, which boasts quicker settlement, reduced fees, and round-the-clock accessibility, has become the first native commercial paper issued on XRPL. It’s issued through a bankruptcy-remote SPV, ensuring investor protections, and aims to modernize traditional treasury operations by integrating digital debt into cross-border payment flows. Ripple will invest $10 million in DCP as part of the partnership, which may later include support for RLUSD purchases. RLUSD, Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin launched in December 2024, has already exceeded $350 million in circulating supply.

As reported by crypto . news on June 9, on-chain activity has been slipping, transaction and payment volumes have dropped, and active addresses have decreased between May and June. By introducing steady institutional flows into the network, this partnership may help to reverse that trend. The DCP expansion builds on Ripple’s growing push into real-world asset tokenization. The company has previously invested in similar tokenized treasury projects, including Ondo’s OUSG and Archax’s partnership with asset manager Abrdn. According to a recent Ripple-BCG report , bonds will drive the adoption of the tokenized RWA market, which is expected to grow from $600 million today to nearly $19 trillion by 2033. DCP is currently available exclusively to Qualified Institutional Buyers and Qualified Purchasers. The product offers a regulated, yield-bearing onchain asset that institutional traders can integrate into liquidity and collateral strategies, blending traditional fixed income with blockchain-native efficiencies.

The upgrade was announced on June 10 via Starknet’s ( STRK ) official X account. Staking v2 introduces block attestation and commission adjustments, two major features that will improve validator reliability and reward fairness. Under block attestation, validators must confirm randomly chosen blocks in each epoch to prove they’re online and tracking the network. Those who fail to do so will not receive rewards, and their delegators lose out as well. This ensures validators are active and prepares them for future consensus responsibilities expected by the end of 2025. 1/ We’re thrilled to announce that STRK Staking v2 is going live on Mainnet on June 17!

Under the new system, validators can commit to a maximum commission cap for a set period, up to one year. Although they are free to reduce fees whenever they want, they are unable to raise them above the stated cap until the commitment period is over. You might also like: Starknet launches Asset Runes to bring USDC and other tokens to Bitcoin During the upgrade, Starknet will temporarily pause staking contracts to facilitate a smooth transition. Delegators don’t need to do anything, but once Staking v2 goes live, they’ll be able to view validator performance data and switch validators at any time without delay. This marks the second phase of Starknet’s staking rollout. The first phase began in November 2024, allowing users with at least 20,000 STRK to stake and earn rewards. Full validator consensus will be introduced in a third phase scheduled for late 2025. The upgrade arrives alongside several major ecosystem developments, including Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine wallet support and a custom Bitcoin ( BTC ) bridge expected by the end of Q2. Bitcoin staking is also set to launch later this year. By upgrading its staking system while live, Starknet is one of the first Layer 2 networks to shift validator responsibilities toward greater decentralization. These changes support its push toward “Stage 1” decentralization, reducing dependence on centralized sequencers while improving network security, transparency, and fairness.

Having set its blocktime at one second, Unichain today delivers low-latency performance when compared with many of its peers. Still, that speed is forecasted to improve dramatically with the future integration of “Flashblocks”—sub-second, 250-millisecond block intervals designed to provide even faster confirmation times. The network’s roadmap continues to focus on both scalability and low-latency execution—aspect ratios of an increasingly competitive Layer 2 and modular ecosystem. Indeed, Unichain’s next updates may see latency drop significantly as it pushes toward and begins to achieve the goals laid out in its white paper. DEX Activity Surges as Incentives Drive Adoption Unichain’s recent growth has received a substantial boost from the rapid expansion of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on the network. The increase started in mid-April and was in time with the launch of an incentive program aimed at drawing in liquidity and traders. Since then, DEX volume on Unichain has catapulted to nearly $2 billion weekly, a stunning accomplishment considering how little memecoin action there is on the chain. In contrast to numerous other networks that see speculative tokens drive much of their trading volume, Unichain’s top liquidity pools are composed primarily of high-value, blue-chip asset pairs. Fully 97% of all fees earned by liquidity providers (LPs) in those pools come from trades involving either ETH-USD or Bitcoin-denominated pairs. That signals a trading environment that’s maturing and maturing fast, with far more focus on driving real, meaningful trade between legitimate, institutional-grade assets than on any trading patterns that could be described as “hype-driven.” At present, the majority of the volume is coming from Uniswap v4 pools. These are very advanced, highly functional and flexible pools that let you, as a liquidity provider, perform nearly any sort of money market strategy you can imagine (in fact, if you’re not into money market strategies, you probably have a good reason to steer clear of these pools). And yet, amongst these highly advanced pools, there is at least one pool that appears to be very basic. The USDC/USDT pool is operating with an almost comically low 0.003% fee. Unichain is currently generating ~$50k per week in REV, largely driven by priority fees. Unichain currently operates with 1 second blocktimes, but there are plans to integrate 250ms “Flashblocks” that provide fast confirmation times in the near future. pic.twitter.com/KRAaJ3cA0p — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) June 9, 2025 Throughput, Reverts, and Value Accrual Mechanics Currently, Unichain achieves a transaction throughput of 5 million gas per second (5mgas/s), with most of that activity coming from DEX trading. Although some observers have flagged the network’s high transaction revert rate, a closer look reveals that this is largely a non-issue for the kind of everyday users that most networks serve. In fact, if you discount the 88% of all reverts that come from just 60 addresses (most of which are associated with bot-driven arbitrage strategies), you find that the Unichain network serves up a pretty smooth experience for its human users. Unichain is now growing and changing the structure of its value accrual. Right now, the revenue net of the Optimism Collective’s revenue share goes to Unichain Labs. But this is set to change with the launch of UVN, or Unichain Validator Network, which will enable us to share revenue with holders of our governance token, the UNI token. Unichain seems to be carving a niche for itself in the realm of blockchain networks that are built for performance and that are friendly toward institutional players. Its secret? Focusing on three things quite resolutely: facilitating high-speed and high-volume trading; maintaining a design that ensures high throughput; and establishing a base of trading pairs that drive utility—no small achievement given that in many public markets, a high percentage of trading pairs do not seem to fulfill a useful purpose.

He added that the date was not set in stone and could change because Tesla was paranoid about safety. Musk indicated on June 11 that he was flying from Los Angeles to Austin, Texas, for the kickoff of the Robotaxi launch, which he previously predicted would occur sometime on June 12. However, he said the current plan was for June 22 and that the first driverless trip from the Tesla factory to a customer’s house would take place on his birthday, June 28. In May, Musk said that Tesla would launch its robotaxi service with around 10 vehicles in the first week before increasing it to 20, 30, or 40, and eventually thousands within a few months. He also plans to expand the robotaxi service to other cities, like San Francisco and San Antonio, although he has not provided a detailed timeline. However, the tech billionaire pointed out that the streets will change rapidly, and autonomous cars will be standard worldwide in two to three years. Musk says robotaxis will initially be ‘geo-fenced’ and remotely monitored BREAKING: First ever Tesla Model Y robotaxi with no-one in the drivers seat spotted testing on public roads in Austin, Texas! Tesla's new ""Robotaxi"" wordmark/logo is on the side of the vehicle. https://t.co/IhEzPx5PIb pic.twitter.com/zq4ZmiMqDg — Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) June 10, 2025 Musk said Tesla would “geofence” the service, limiting where the Model Y robotaxis could initially operate, and that employees would remotely monitor the fleet. He recently disclosed that Tesla will start with a very small rollout of robotaxis that will be fitted with a new “unsupervised” version of the company’s FSD or “Full Self-Driving” technology installed. The tests will involve the Model Y, not the futuristic-looking CyberCab that Tesla plans to produce next year. He shared a video showing that Tesla was testing driverless vehicles on the roads of Austin without a human safety supervisor behind the wheel. The eight-second clip showed the latest version of the Model Y SUV, painted black with a white/gold “Robotaxi” graffiti-style logo painted on it, navigating an intersection and pausing to allow pedestrians to pass over a crosswalk. “We are being super paranoid about safety.” – Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla The company has been testing self-driving Model Y SUVs that will be used in the initial phase of the operation. Model Ys with manufacturer plates and a person behind the wheel have been spotted driving around parts of Austin, including South Congress. However, it is unclear who will be the first users of the Robotaxi service, what app will be used, or how much rides will cost. Tesla gears up to compete against Waymo in Austin Musk suggested that Austin was a better city than Los Angeles to start its robotaxi service, although he did not specify why Austin was preferable. However, Texas generally has fewer regulations around autonomous vehicles and is far less dense than Los Angeles, with about a quarter of the population of the southern California city. Austin has become a sort of battleground for robotaxis, with Waymo offering autonomous rides through the Uber platform since March. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during the first-quarter earnings call in May that a fleet of about 100 Waymo robotaxis was busier than over 99% of all drivers in Austin in terms of complete daily trips. The California Public Utilities Commission data revealed that Waymo provided more than 5 million rides in three years. Waymo also increased the number of paid rides from about 12K in August 2023 to over 708K in March 2025. Musk said that the ramp-up for Tesla’s robotaxi service will be quick, adding that there will “probably” be 1,000 robotaxis within a few months. He also predicted that more than one million self-driving Teslas could be in the U.S. by the end of 2026. However, Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein previously said Musk’s 2026 guidance was “a bit optimistic,” pointing out that the billionaire investor often missed his own deadlines. Goldstein believed that Tesla would “get there” eventually but stressed that their FSD software would likely take more iterations than the Tesla team anticipated once they started testing the real robotaxi service.

At press time, Sui ( SUI ) is trading at $3.46, up 2.1% in the past 24 hours and rebounding from a weekly low of $2.92 on June 6. The dip had been driven by market fallout from the Cetus ( CETUS ) hack and broader macroeconomic pressures. SUI’s recovery, however, might be aided by fresh institutional momentum. With a 24-hour trading volume of $1.01 billion, up 300% from the day before, SUI’s market activity has significantly increased. As per Coinglass data , SUI’s derivatives volume rose 6.44% to $5.16 billion, while open interest climbed 3.53% to $1.52 billion, a sign that more traders are taking leveraged positions and expecting near-term volatility or movement. The surge coincides with a major development. According to a June 10 announcement by the Sui Foundation, Nasdaq has filed a 19b-4 with the SEC to list the 21Shares SUI ETF, officially kicking off the regulatory review process for a U.S. spot ETF based on the SUI token.

Institutional firms such as Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale have launched products on Sui since late 2024, reflecting its appeal as a high-performance Layer 1 chain. Looking at the technical picture, SUI appears to be eyeing a breakout from consolidation. Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten, and price action is hovering near the middle band at $3.38. At 52.5, the relative strength index confirms a neutral bias but still has room to rise before reaching overbought territory. SUI price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The MACD’s entry into positive territory could be a potential early indicator of bullish momentum. Although it’s still negative, the awesome oscillator is flattening, indicating a possible change in momentum. The estimated moving averages from 10 to 200 days are flashing buy, but the 30- and 50-day simple moving averages exhibit a slight bearish lag. If the price manages to close above $3.50 with confirmation through rising volume, SUI could test the previous local high near $3.80, and possibly push toward $4.20 if ETF optimism holds. Failure to break above resistance, however, could see SUI drift back to $3.20–$3.00 support, especially if broader risk sentiment weakens.

Saylor argued that Bitcoin has overcome its riskiest periods and is heading towards $1 million. Saylor said in an interview with Bloomberg anchors Katie Greifeld and Matt Miller: “The crypto winter will not return. We are past this phase. Bitcoin will not go to zero; it is going to $1 million. We have enough data to prove it.” According to Saylor, the support from the US government indicates Bitcoin’s long-term success. Noting the positive approach of cabinet members, former SEC officials and CFTC representatives towards digital assets, Saylor said, “Now banks will also store Bitcoin.” Related News: BREAKING: Rumors of Solana Spot ETF Approval Emerge, Could Stir Up the Market - Price Reacts Saylor also said that the supply of Bitcoin has become limited, and that only 450 Bitcoins are sold by miners per day, which corresponds to a daily sales volume of approximately $50 million. According to Saylor, this volume is enough for the market to move upwards: “Companies that hold Bitcoin treasuries are buying the daily natural supply alone. BlackRock and ETFs are also buying. Moreover, even governments are now entering this space.” Saylor said that when the price of Bitcoin reaches $500,000 or $1 million, a drop may be possible, but such a scenario is not possible at current price levels. He cited Trump Media’s $2.5 billion announcement, GameStop’s $500 million move and MicroStrategy’s multi-billion-dollar new fundraising as examples. *This is not investment advice.

45783268,https://nulltx.com/?p=150360,1749621966,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$KTA Faces Sharp Selloff Amid Allegations of Fake Testnet Activity,https://nulltx.com/kta-faces-sharp-selloff-amid-allegations-of-fake-testnet-activity/,"A newly launched Layer 1 blockchain project called $KTA saw the price of its token nosedive by almost 26% in just one day, following some quite serious claims that called into question the very authenticity of its testnet. KTA’s situation has sent investor confidence into quite the tailspin and, even though project backers are actively pushing the narrative that all is well, a pretty decent-sized wave of skepticism now seems to cover social media and the crypto communities. Doubt has suddenly descended on $KTA, which had only quite recently received a fair amount of positive attention for its ambitious plans and its not-inconsequential recent fundraising. The supporters of $KTA, in what is effectively its own PR campaign, paint the appearance of doubt as, um, dubious. And, really, with the way they tell it, who wouldn’t be wild about the plans $KTA is supposedly making for the $KTA blockchain? They aren’t just wild; they are, as promised, transparent in the way they paint a picture of the project. Allegations of a “Fake” Testnet Stir Concern The catalyst that first caused the price to drop was an analyst’s claim that the KTA testnet explorer—a tool for seeing what’s happening in a network—was being used to mislead people into thinking the KTA network was doing something. According to the allegations, the testnet explorer was showing a lot of transactions that, by the explorers’ own measures, weren’t real. And this was serious for the KTA network, because if, as the allegations suggested, it was using the testnet explorer to run a network that wasn’t doing any real KTA transactions, then KTA tokens were going to be virtually worthless. Such allegations are especially harmful in the cryptocurrency sector, where a working test network and a live network are basic standards used to judge a project’s worth. Many investors see the test network as a crucial proving ground for a project’s technical chops before it launches the main network and its tokens become more valuable. Even though there were claims to the contrary, project supporters pushed back strongly. They emphasized that the development team is now publicly known and, thus, accountable. They also pointed to the $17 million raise that the project has documented through SEC filings as more than enough evidence that institutional investors have properly vetted and backed the effort. For these folks, the development team’s public presence, the project’s SEC-registered funding, and the path from funding to project operation are clean as a whistle. Onchain Analyst Zachxbt Highlights Governance Red Flags Onchain analyst zachxbt has questioned the way the token’s supply is generated and how it is disbursed, and he’s not the only one. Shill capital does not speak well for a project’s governance, as it directly speaks to the project’s. Zachxbt’s remarks mirrored a wider doubt in the crypto analyst fraternity about the viability of projects whose marketing depends largely on engaging with influencers, as opposed to getting the kind of engagement that builders usually do. He stated, “When the most vociferous advocates (shills) for a project come not from its builders but from questionable KOLs, it usually means the project is underperforming in the tech department.” when the biggest shills for a project come from sketchy KOLs (Nekoz, etc) vs actual builders for a project it typically means the tech is underwhelming. nonetheless the supply control by them has so far been impressive L1s w/ token preproduct + large tax at launch for a… pic.twitter.com/6O0z5sW9ag — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 9, 2025 The analyst criticized the tokenomics model too, describing it as a Layer 1 project with a pre-product token and a large tax imposed at launch, which often leads to artificial price pumping followed by sharp corrections. This observation resonates with some investors who suspect the current hype may not be sustainable without real technical progress. Community Divided as Price Continues to Slide These disclosures have split the community of $KTA. Some holders maintain optimism, trusting in the team’s transparency and the potential for future development milestones that could prove the project’s legitimacy. Others have started to cut their losses, concerned about holding tokens that they see as tied to an overhyped or inadequately tested network. I am likely the first person ever to go on the Keeta testnet. TLDR it’s completely fake. The explorer is a Vercel vibe coded page posting fake transaction data. Swaps don't work. Keeta CTO – “There's a lot of network functionality that underlies the UI of this little demo but… pic.twitter.com/3T7NvU6vnk — MRG (@thespacecatjr) June 9, 2025 Market reaction has been swift and severe, with the token dropping nearly 26% in a single day—reflecting the intensity of concerns and the difficulty in dispelling doubts once they take hold in the crypto market. The episode highlights the risks associated with investing in early-stage Layer 1 projects, where technical proof points like functioning testnets are critical but sometimes overlooked in the rush of marketing and fundraising. The situation is still unfolding, and the team at $KTA is still trying to remain calm and focused. It’s likely that they’re feeling pressure and are under some duress to achieve what is very clearly a must-win outcome. That is, they need to produce evidence that is not only clear and convincing but also verifiably good news. So far, it seems they’ve come up with some basic demonstration of network functionality. The world of blockchain projects is constantly changing, but the trust of investors always comes down to two basic elements: proven technology and transparency. The saga of $KTA is a powerful reminder of the importance of these two elements. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While Bitcoin (BTC) set the tone, some assets seized the spotlight to deliver standout performances, and among them was Myria (MYRIA). Myria ( MYRIA ), the native token of the Ethereum-based Layer-2 gaming platform, emerged as one of the top gainers during the latest crypto market uptick, soaring by 50% yesterday and up 5% in the past 24 hours. The surge brought the token to $0.00184, marking a 199.2% increase from its yearly low of $0.000615 and pushing it to new multi-month highs. MYRIA’s price chart |Source: TradingView The rally was fueled by a sharp rise in trading activity. MYRIA’s 24-hour volume spiked by over 360%, propelling its market capitalization to approximately $59.5 million. The performance positioned MYRIA as a top-performing crypto asset, behind only a few others like PAYCOIN, which gained over 100%. However, the token soon began relinquishing its gains in an inability to maintain the positive momentum, losing nearly 20% of its gains within a brief period. MYRIA trades at $0.001779 at press time, and its value now marks an approximate 88% decline from its all-time high of $0.0147.

Bitcoin (BTC) led the charge with a 5% increase over 24 hours, briefly reclaiming the $110,000 level before dipping slightly to around $109,100. Altcoins including ETH , XRP , and SOL also rallied, posting gains between 4% and 8%. Memecoins joined the trend with stronger numbers, and tokens including BONK , PEPE , WIF notched up to 10% in gains. While, like MYRIA, the majority of the crypto assets have also retraced part of their gains, overall market sentiment remains positive, fueling hopes for a sustained recovery.

This upward movement was a welcome respite following last week’s Trump-Musk public spat that briefly dragged the top crypto asset close to $100,000. A market expert believes that the current rally “may have more room to run.” Bullish Trend Remains Intact Bitcoin has broken above its short-term downtrend after completing a bullish breakout from a consolidating triangle pattern typically associated with trend continuation. Prominent crypto analyst Markus Thielen noted that while he initially anticipated a quieter summer trading period, the strength of the current move suggests fresh capital is driving the rally as tariff concerns diminish. In the latest edition of Matrixport analysis , Thielen pointed to steady momentum despite expected upward pressure in this week’s Consumer Price Index data, which is considered unlikely to halt Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Markets have simultaneously reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year to just one, reflecting a more resilient US economy than previously forecasted. Thielen added that Bitcoin’s bullish trend remains intact, provided the cryptocurrency maintains levels above $105,075. This price point will now act as a critical technical threshold for continued upward movement. Reduced Selling Pressure Supporting this technical outlook, on-chain data provides additional evidence for the rally’s sustainability. According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, realized profit from long-term Bitcoin holders has experienced a dramatic decline, falling 89% from approximately $126 million to $13.6 million based on 24-hour simple moving averages. The data reveals that despite Bitcoin trading at similar price levels to the late-May peak, seasoned investors who have held their positions for over one year are demonstrating significantly reduced profit-taking activity. This sharp reduction in selling pressure from experienced holders suggests that this cohort of investors appears more reluctant to realize gains at current price levels compared to their activity during the previous rally period.

According to a DOJ statement released on June 9, Iurii Gugnin, the New York-based founder of crypto firm Evita is facing a a 22-count indictment for charges revolving around the use of his company to funnel more than $500 million in illicit funds. Prosecutors allege that Gugnin moved the funds through the U.S. financial system to support transactions for sanctioned Russian banks, defraud American financial institutions, and aid the export of controlled technology to the Russian government. The founder is also accused of deceiving banks and crypto exchanges by hiding the true nature of Evita’s business, falsely claiming that his company had no dealings with Russian entities or sanctioned organizations. Additionally, Evita failed to implement required anti-money laundering controls and did not report suspicious activity, enabling illegal transactions.

Iurii Gugnin’s charges come as the DOJ ramps up its crackdown on illicit crypto activities. Just days earlier, the agency filed to seize nearly $7.74 million tied to a similar laundering scheme run by North Korean cybercriminals. The funds, in that case, were linked to individuals and entities using false identities to gain employment in U.S.-based companies. The proceeds were then funneled through a coordinated laundering operation involving tactics like chain hopping and token swaps to obscure the origin of the funds. Commenting on Gugnin’s charges, Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division Roman Rozhavsky emphasized the commitment of U.S. law enforcement agencies to fishing out bad actors. “Let this serve notice that using cryptocurrency to hide illegal conduct will not prevent the FBI and our partners from holding you accountable,” he said.

The announcement came alongside disappointing first-quarter results that saw revenue fall 17% to $732.4m, down from $881.8m a year earlier. Shares slid 4.6% in after-hours trading.

No Bitcoin on the Balance Sheet. pic.twitter.com/IEA9X7ZISM — Han Akamatsu 赤松 (@Han_Akamatsu) June 10, 2025 Sales in its hardware and accessories segment, which includes new and pre-owned games, dropped 32%. Despite efforts to expand its e-commerce presence and digital offerings, the company has yet to offset the ongoing decline in brick-and-mortar sales meaningfully. Bitcoin Joins GameStop’s Long-Term Asset Playbook This is not GameStop’s first crypto experiment. In 2022, it launched a digital wallet aimed at tapping into the Web3 trend but shuttered the project a year later, citing regulatory uncertainty. Its latest foray, however, positions Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. In a statement, GameStop said it may use part of its cash reserves or proceeds from future debt or equity sales to expand its Bitcoin holdings. The move mirrors the high-profile strategy of MicroStrategy, which has famously accumulated large amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. More than 80 public companies have followed suit, including Trump Media. Crypto Pivot Highlights GameStop’s Struggle To Evolve GameStop’s embrace of Bitcoin appears to be both a financial bet and a signal to its retail investor base, which has historically shown strong interest in crypto-related plays. Yet, the market’s response has been cautious. GameStop’s stock fell nearly 20% in the days following the disclosure, suggesting skepticism among investors. While some view the Bitcoin purchase as a distraction from operational headwinds, others see it as a bold attempt to reposition the company as digital-first, even as the broader industry transitions to streaming and downloadable content. With national retailers shuttering stores and physical game sales declining, GameStop’s bet on Bitcoin may offer some financial diversification. Whether it can also help reverse its fortunes remains far less certain.

Released on June 10, the report positions digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, not just as speculative assets, but as fundamental building blocks for the future of money and global commerce. This isn’t just about tech startups anymore; the data points towards significant interest and implementation among established players, from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to the giants of the Fortune 500. What is Driving Stablecoin Adoption in Business? The Coinbase report provides compelling evidence that businesses are actively exploring and embracing crypto. One of the most striking findings relates to SMBs: a remarkable 81% of those already aware of cryptocurrency are reportedly interested in leveraging stablecoins. Why this strong interest? Stablecoins offer a unique value proposition for businesses compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether. Pegged typically to stable assets like the US dollar, they offer the benefits of digital currencies – speed, low transaction costs, and global reach – without the unpredictable price swings that make budgeting and everyday transactions difficult. For SMBs, this translates into practical advantages: Faster Payments: Sending and receiving payments, especially internationally, can be significantly quicker than traditional banking methods. Lower Fees: Cross-border transactions via stablecoins can often incur much lower fees than wire transfers. 24/7 Access: Unlike banks, stablecoin networks operate continuously, allowing for transactions anytime, anywhere. Enhanced Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a blockchain, offering a clear audit trail. This growing interest among SMBs signals a potential shift in how smaller enterprises manage their finances and interact with the global economy, making business crypto adoption a tangible reality for a vast segment of the market. Blockchain Adoption: Transforming Fortune 500 Operations It’s not just SMBs showing interest. The Coinbase report, supported by data from sources like Solid Intel on X, reveals a significant surge in crypto exploration among the world’s largest companies. The number of Fortune 500 companies actively exploring stablecoin use has reportedly tripled since the beginning of 2024. This indicates a strategic recognition at the highest levels that digital currencies could play a crucial role in corporate finance and operations. Furthermore, the report highlights broader blockchain adoption initiatives within these large corporations. According to the data cited from Solid Intel on X, a substantial 60% of Fortune 500 companies are currently working on dedicated blockchain projects. These projects go beyond just stablecoins and explore the decentralized ledger technology for various use cases: Supply Chain Management: Improving transparency and efficiency in tracking goods. Tokenization of Assets: Representing real-world assets (like real estate or art) or financial instruments on a blockchain. Enhanced Security and Data Integrity: Utilizing blockchain’s immutable nature for secure record-keeping. New Business Models: Exploring opportunities in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) or Web3 applications. The fact that such a high percentage of leading global companies are investing resources into blockchain technology underscores its perceived potential to drive innovation, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. This level of corporate engagement is a powerful validator for the long-term relevance of the technology. The Global Rise of Stablecoins and What it Means for the Future of Money The report also provides context on the overall growth of the stablecoin market. Globally, the total stablecoin supply has seen a robust 54% year-over-year growth. This expansion is mirrored by the increasing number of individuals and entities holding stablecoins, now exceeding 161 million worldwide. This significant growth in both supply and holders points to increasing trust and utility in stablecoins as a digital medium of exchange and store of value, distinct from the speculative market. This trend has profound implications for the future of money . Stablecoins offer a bridge between the traditional financial system and the burgeoning digital economy. They facilitate faster, cheaper, and more accessible transactions globally. For businesses, this means easier international payments, potential for programmable payments (smart contracts), and new ways to manage treasury and liquidity. The increasing stablecoin adoption isn’t just a crypto phenomenon; it’s a development that could reshape global financial infrastructure. Consider the potential impact: Feature Traditional Payments Stablecoin Payments Speed Often days (especially cross-border) Minutes to hours Cost Variable, can be high (especially cross-border) Generally lower, often fixed or negligible Availability Limited by banking hours/days 24/7/365 Transparency Can be opaque Public ledger (depending on blockchain) Programmability Limited High (via smart contracts) This table illustrates why businesses, seeking efficiency and cost savings, are increasingly looking at stablecoins as a viable alternative or complement to existing payment systems. The Coinbase report simply quantifies a trend that has been building momentum. Challenges and Considerations for Business Crypto Adoption While the report paints an optimistic picture, it’s important to acknowledge that significant challenges remain for widespread business crypto adoption . Regulatory clarity is still evolving in many jurisdictions, creating uncertainty for companies. Volatility in the broader crypto market, while less of a direct issue for stablecoins themselves (if properly managed), can still impact business confidence and perception of the asset class. Technical integration into existing legacy systems can also be complex and require specialized expertise. Furthermore, educating employees and customers about using crypto and stablecoins is a necessary step that requires time and resources. Despite these hurdles, the data suggests that the perceived benefits are increasingly outweighing the challenges for a growing number of businesses. Actionable Insights from the Coinbase Report What can businesses take away from this report? Explore Stablecoins: Even if not ready for full crypto adoption, understanding and potentially piloting stablecoin use for specific functions like international payments or treasury management could offer immediate benefits. Investigate Blockchain Use Cases: Companies should identify areas within their operations – supply chain, data management, customer loyalty – where blockchain’s unique properties could drive efficiency or innovation. Stay Informed on Regulation: Keeping abreast of regulatory developments is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape. Build Internal Expertise: Developing or acquiring talent with blockchain and crypto knowledge will be essential for successful implementation. The report serves as a clear signal that ignoring the developments in stablecoin adoption and blockchain adoption is no longer a viable strategy for businesses aiming to remain competitive and prepared for the future of money . Conclusion: Crypto’s Growing Footprint in the Economy The latest Coinbase report offers compelling evidence of the increasing integration of cryptocurrency into the mainstream economy, driven significantly by accelerating stablecoin adoption and diverse blockchain adoption initiatives. From SMBs finding practical use cases for stable payments to Fortune 500 companies strategically exploring transformative blockchain applications, the data underscores a clear trend: business crypto adoption is gaining serious momentum. While challenges persist, the report highlights a growing understanding and embrace of digital assets and decentralized technology as key components of the future of money . This isn’t a distant possibility; it’s a present reality shaping how businesses operate globally.

In its annual report released Tuesday in Cologne, the FIU stated that 8,711 crypto-related notifications were submitted in 2024 — marking an 8.2% increase from the previous year, Bloomberg reported . This occurred despite the total number of SARs dropping after the agency issued new guidance aimed at reducing irrelevant reports. The majority of the flagged transactions involved Bitcoin ( BTC ), followed by Ethereum ( ETH ), Tether ( USDT ), and Litecoin ( LTC ). These tokens were frequently linked to activity on trading platforms, mixing services , or online gambling. The FIU noted that these types of transactions are commonly used to obscure the origins of illicit funds, underscoring the increasing role of digital assets in money laundering schemes. You might also like: While crypto is gradually getting legalized, its money laundering use persists — what are the trends? Internationally, Germany’s trend mirrors growing concerns over the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. In the UK, the National Crime Agency reported that crypto exchanges were tied to 6.6% of all SARs in the 2023–24 period, as total filings rose slightly to approximately 872,000. The UK also noted a sharp increase in counter- terrorism financing reports and account-freezing actions. In the U.S., FinCEN received over 8,600 crypto-linked SARs in fiscal year 2023, a jump driven by a specific advisory issued in September that led to weekly filings spiking as high as 1,560. Overall, U.S. entities filed 4.6 million SARs during the year. Globally, the scale of crypto-related money laundering is also substantial. Chainalysis data shows laundered crypto volumes reached $31.5 billion in 2022 before falling to $22.2 billion in 2023 — though still well above pre-2021 levels. Chainalysis noted that in 2023, the overall crypto transaction volume declined by 15%, but the laundered crypto volume decreased by approximately 30%. It’s hard to say if there was a positive change since the total criminal use of crypto was more or less stable at around $50 billion per year in 2022, 2023, and 2024, according to Chainalaysis.

Of course, any Bitcoin rally is going to be very closely watched by not only investors but also many analysts trying to get a read on what might be happening in the more speculative corners of the crypto market. So, this rally is already under the microscope, and what we’re seeing is this: the signal we’re getting from the derivatives market is decidedly mixed. Even while Bitcoin’s spot price keeps surging in the wake of overall crypto market enthusiasm, the structure underlying the asset’s market tells a more complicated story. Data from on-chain and exchanges over the last day illuminate something that a lot of people who’ve been in crypto for any length of time have gotten used to: the reality that Bitcoin is back in the uptrend, again. Being in the uptrend is kind of comforting; it breaks my heart that so much of that comfort is built on the rise of gaze-based financial products. Spike in Short Liquidations Accompanies Price Rally One of the recent surge’s primary possible causes seems to be a sudden increase in the number of short positions being liquidated. Yesterday, Bitcoin futures short liquidations hit $5.74 million in a single day. This unwind of forced bearish bets added a lot of push to Bitcoin’s price. And as a result, we accelerated our way up to $110.3K. The 24-hour simple moving average (SMA) for short liquidations is currently at $768,252.14, indicating that the recent spike is above the norm by a wide margin. This is taken to suggest that there is a rush on to exit short positions, with traders in that camp quite apparently caught off-guard by a rapid upward price shift. Liquidations of this scale usually stoke short-term volatility, with the positions getting sold off at the market price coming right back into play. It’s sort of a “you kick, I kick” arrangement that can keep the market moving upward for a while and can even make it seem, to some, that we are in a bull market. But this reinflux of pieces that have been forced to the market can make the situation pretty fragile, especially if too many new long positions are being taken and not enough old ones are being reactivated. Long-Side Premiums and Open Interest Continue to Rise Concurrently, the premium for long positions has surged significantly over the past 12 hours, now standing at $270,480. This fact implies that traders are more and more keen to shell out a premium for the privilege of staying long, even as prices continue to move upward. In other words, paying a premium to be long is no longer an exclusive club—it’s something more and more traders are opting to do. Believe it or not, this is actually a good sign. It points yet again to the ever-increasing bullishness of the market. #Bitcoin price rose nearly 3.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $110.3K. Derivatives suggest potential overheating (rising short liquidations, increasing long-side premium, and growing open interest). However, funding rate uptick is only modest — glassnode (@glassnode) June 10, 2025 Total number of outstanding derivative contracts—open interest—has also increased in tandem, signaling that new capital is entering the market. Rising open interest can be a healthy sign of growing participation, but when combined with surging long premiums and liquidations, it may indicate a leverage build-up that could precipitate an instability event. Some risk indicators, however, do remain in check. One closely watched metric for evaluating whether overheating is occurring in the crypto derivatives space is the funding rate for perpetual futures contracts. This rate reflects the cost of holding a position and often spikes when leverage is extremely skewed. Funding Rates Still Moderate Despite Leverage Buildup Funding rate data, interestingly, suggests that while the market is clearly speculative, it hasn’t yet reached extreme levels. Across major exchanges, the perpetual futures funding rate for Bitcoin currently ranges from a low of 0.0003% to a high of 0.023%, with an average around 0.0016%. These values are higher than neutral but still well below the excessive levels that have historically preceded sharp reversals. The uptick we see here in funding is very modest, so what we’re signaling is that interest in holding long positions is growing, but still, traders aren’t being incentivized by upticks in funding to pay obnoxious carry rates to hold onto those long positions. That’s kind of a key distinction. The lack of exorbitant carry rates signals that we might have a bit more room to run before traders are forced to price in the interest mechanism if we keep going up. The present state is a classic crypto conundrum: although there is unmistakable momentum and enthusiasm behind the recent rally in Bitcoin, the data purportedly points to growing leverage and, uh, speculative bets that may need to be unwound. Without extreme funding rates or blowout open interest, though, the market looks to be in a heightened but not dangerously overheated state. Volatility spikes, long liquidations, and sudden changes in funding rates will be closely monitored by traders and analysts. Bitcoin, in the meantime, is trying to hold above a price point of $110,000. On a consolidated basis, it will start sending clearer signals regarding the persistence of its ongoing upward movement.

One such report recently surfaced, suggesting that Scott Bessent was being eyed as a strong contender for the pivotal role of Federal Reserve Chair . However, the White House has stepped in to address this speculation directly. According to an account on X (formerly Twitter) known for tracking economic news, the White House has explicitly stated that these reports are entirely ‘groundless’. This comes after a separate report, citing a source familiar with discussions within the Trump Administration , indicated movement towards potentially nominating Bessent for the top spot at the central bank. Why Does the Federal Reserve Chair Role Matter So Much? Before diving deeper into the specific rumor and denial, it’s crucial to understand just how significant the position of Federal Reserve Chair is. Often described as the second most powerful person in Washington D.C., the Fed Chair heads the United States’ central banking system. Their decisions and commentary have profound impacts not just on the U.S. economy but on global financial markets. Here’s a quick look at why this role is so influential: Monetary Policy: The Fed controls interest rates and the money supply, tools used to manage inflation and employment. The Chair is the primary spokesperson and often the driving force behind these critical decisions. Economic Stability: The Fed plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the financial system, acting as a lender of last resort during crises. Market Sentiment: The Chair’s words are closely watched by investors worldwide. Their outlook on the economy can trigger significant market movements. Global Influence: As the head of the world’s most influential central bank, the Fed Chair’s actions ripple across international economies and currency markets. Given this immense power and influence, speculation about who might hold this position, especially in the context of a potential future administration like the Trump Administration , naturally attracts significant attention. Who is Scott Bessent, and Why Was His Name Mentioned? Scott Bessent is a prominent figure in the financial world. He is a hedge fund manager and previously served as a key economic advisor during the first Trump Administration . While the initial report incorrectly referred to him as the current U.S. Treasury Secretary (that position is currently held by Janet Yellen), Bessent’s background in finance and his ties to former President Trump have made him a subject of speculation for potential high-level economic roles in a future administration, including Treasury Secretary or even Fed Chairman . His name likely surfaced due to ongoing discussions and jockeying for potential positions should Donald Trump return to the presidency. In political circles, speculation about potential cabinet members and agency heads begins well in advance of elections. The White House Response: What Does ‘Groundless’ Mean? The core of the news is the unequivocal denial from the White House . Calling the reports ‘groundless’ is a strong statement. It suggests that, from the current administration’s perspective, there is no basis in fact for the claim that Scott Bessent is being seriously considered as the next Federal Reserve Chair . Several reasons could be behind such a denial: The report is genuinely false, based on misinterpretation or faulty information. While discussions might occur, they are not at a stage where Bessent is a ‘strong candidate’ or that the administration is ‘moving to nominate’ him. The denial could be managing expectations or correcting premature reporting. The White House may wish to avoid unnecessary speculation or political distraction surrounding a critical, non-partisan role like the Fed Chair, especially if the rumor is tied to a potential future administration. It’s important to note the sources involved: Bloomberg initially reported the rumor (citing an unnamed source), and Walter Bloomberg (an economic news aggregator on X) reported the White House denial. Relying on official statements from the White House is key when evaluating such claims. Navigating Political Rumors and Economic Speculation This incident highlights the challenge of distinguishing between political speculation and confirmed news, especially concerning crucial economic roles like the Fed Chairman . For investors, market participants, and the general public, it serves as a reminder to: Verify Sources: Always look for official statements from the involved parties (like the White House or the Fed itself). Understand the Context: Consider the political climate and the nature of the source reporting the rumor. Treat Rumors with Caution: Unconfirmed reports, especially those citing anonymous sources, should be treated as speculation rather than fact. The process of selecting a Federal Reserve Chair is a significant event, involving careful consideration by the President and confirmation by the Senate. While names are often floated and discussed behind the scenes, official announcements are the only reliable indicators of who is being seriously considered or nominated. Challenges in Appointment and Market Impact The appointment of a Federal Reserve Chair is often a political tightrope walk. The candidate needs economic credibility, political acceptability, and the ability to command confidence from markets and the public. Challenges include: Finding a candidate who aligns with the administration’s broad economic philosophy but can also maintain the Fed’s crucial independence. Navigating the Senate confirmation process, which can be contentious. Ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in monetary policy. Market reactions to potential Fed Chair appointments can vary. A candidate perceived as more hawkish (leaning towards higher interest rates to control inflation) might cause jitters in markets, while a dovish candidate (leaning towards lower rates to stimulate growth) might be viewed positively, particularly by asset markets including cryptocurrencies, which can be sensitive to liquidity and interest rate environments. However, in this specific instance, the news is the *denial* of a rumor, which likely has minimal immediate market impact compared to a confirmed nomination or appointment. Concluding Thoughts on the Scott Bessent Rumor In summary, reports suggesting Scott Bessent is a leading candidate for Federal Reserve Chair have been firmly denied by the White House . While Bessent’s background and connection to the Trump Administration make him a name that might surface in future speculation regarding economic roles, the current official stance is clear: the reports are ‘groundless’. This serves as a valuable reminder in the current news environment to prioritize official confirmations over unverified rumors, particularly when they concern roles as critical as the head of the U.S. central bank.

Lawmakers on the House Agriculture Committee voted 47-6 on Tuesday to advance the bill, moving it one step closer to broader congressional review, with Committee Chair GT Thompson confirming it will now head to the full House and that members may submit counterarguments by the end of the week. As the House Agriculture Committee advanced the bill, the House Financial Services Committee held a concurrent session to consider amendments that could reshape key provisions within the bill. One proposed amendment, introduced by Representative French Hill, seeks to include specific protections for blockchain developers. At the time of publication, that amendment had not yet been brought to a vote. Tensions surfaced during the session as some lawmakers raised concerns about potential risks tied to crypto market regulation.

Neither amendment was adopted following voice votes. Committee Chair Hill pushed back on the criticisms, stating the bill is focused on “consistency” and not on bailouts. He said the legislation aims to clarify when a digital asset should be treated as a security under SEC oversight or as a commodity under the CFTC’s authority. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act was introduced in May and is part of a broader legislative push to create transparent and practical guidelines for digital asset firms operating in the U.S. It outlines a regulatory structure that distinguishes which assets fall under the SEC or CFTC jurisdiction, sets parameters for digital asset custody, and proposes rules for various asset classes, including stablecoins. During earlier hearings, the bill has sparked debate on whether non-custodial platform developers, those who do not directly manage user funds, should face liability. “We need to decide if developers still face potential questions of liability,” Congressman Tom Emmer, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said at the time, warning that unclear rules could discourage talent from building in the U.S. House Democrats, in the meantime, argued that the bill could dilute the SEC’s oversight of crypto markets, creating regulatory loopholes that would allow traditional financial firms to rebrand as crypto entities and evade stricter scrutiny.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization surged with renewed strength, and its move sparked widespread optimism across the broader altcoin space and revived hopes that a new altseason may be just around the corner. Although it is still too early to verify an altcoin cycle in full swing, Ethereum’s latest surge has already begun to alter market sentiment. Decentralized finance tokens have roared back, and traders are more frequently citing macro and regulatory reasons that could push $ETH out into the wild blue yonder of a sustained uptrend. Traders Turn Bullish as Ethereum Gains Strength The market’s revitalized energy seems to come from a mix of technical breakout patterns and optimistic developments regarding adoption by institutions and regulatory clarity. The prominent crypto trader and analyst @Pentosh1 captured the sentiment well, tweeting, “Day 1 of the breakout for $ETH — momentum & catalysts building from TradFi and the SEC.” The reference to both traditional finance (TradFi) and the SEC suggests that Ethereum is being seen as a benefactor of a fresh wave of legitimacy that’s coming from both regulatory and institutional directions. Yet another widely recognized voice within the Ethereum community, @iamDCinvestor, reverberated this bullish stance, stating, “$ETH season is here. DeFi leaders at the White House, not in jail. Barbell strategy: $ETH + ecosystem.” The tweet references an entirely different political climate today for Ethereum — one that is not necessarily more favorable, but is certainly more engaging. When discussing political engagement, these days a lot of people tend to bring up Elizabeth Warren, but leaders from across the political spectrum have been more frequently mentioning Ethereum and DeFi. At the same time, investor and podcast host @RyanSAdams highlighted what many view as a fundamental mispricing: “$ETH is cheaper than a year ago, despite major progress. It’s a miracle to buy under $3K.” This perception underscores a disconnect that many see between Ethereum’s continued development — including the rollout of Layer 2 solutions and increased staking activity — and its current price.

It's too early to declare altseason, but signs are emerging. If $ETH holds momentum,… pic.twitter.com/nraHjZhPDm — Followin (@followin_io) June 10, 2025 DeFi Rebounds as Altcoins Follow Ethereum’s Lead Ethereum’s gains have reignited interest in DeFi tokens. If the market wasn’t quite in a full-blown “altseason” yet, it might just now be starting to enter one. With the volume of trades and the speculative nature of the trading in this decentralized financial sector, a clear picture is starting to emerge that a number of DeFi protocols are picking up steam. And the altcoins themselves? Well, as was just suggested, they’re likely in the beginning stages of being picked up and rotated into across the market. Bullish patterns are being discovered in the charts by technical analysts. Trader @Thecryptolord_ remarked, “$ETH is forming an ascending triangle. The bias is bullish — worst case is boring chop.” In general, ascending triangles are interpreted as patterns that continue and lead to further upward movement. This gives more confidence to traders working in short- and medium-term timeframes who are looking for entry points. If Ethereum keeps on its breakout path, the effect on altcoins — especially those within its ecosystem — could be significant. Projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Lido, not to mention long-standing DeFi names like Aave and Uniswap, could see a renewed spotlight and incoming capital. Market Cautiously Watches for Confirmation Even with the increasing positive sentiment, confirmation is still needed before the start of a larger altcoin cycle can be declared. With regards to overall market confidence, Ethereum is a big key driver. It is, however, vital that it not only holds above the major resistance zones, but also that we see its new momentum maintained over several days before judging whether this particular altcoin is ready for liftoff. The next few weeks will be revealing. If $ETH confirms a breakout, it could unleash a huge wave of upward momentum for the altcoin market as a whole. Conversely, if $ETH gets turned back, it could lead to even more of a negative sideways slide for many of these altcoins in their current price ranges. Currently, Ethereum has sent a clear signal: the bulls are still in control. Whether this transitions into a complete altseason or is just a momentary pause in a turbulent year will rely on ongoing price action and the larger macro and regulatory context. But for the first time in what seems like ages, there is tangible optimism in the air — and traders are conversing once more about momentum trades, not just getting by.

This AI Token Could Prove You Wrong Again,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/this-ai-token-could-prove-you-wrong-again/,"The post Doubted Solana’s (SOL) Potential in the Early Days? This AI Token Could Prove You Wrong Again appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When Solana (SOL) was introduced, it faced skepticism from investors who doubted its ability to compete with other established blockchains.

Its miners include over 60,000 units hosted by Hut 8 in North America, and they deliver over 10 EH/s in hashrate. The firm holds its BTC with Coinbase Custody and plans to merge with Gryphon Digital Mining, with Eric Trump joining the board post-merger. Meanwhile, Bitcoin adoption by corporations is growing, and Michael Saylor even recently urged Apple to buy BTC instead of pursuing more stock buybacks. Global momentum is also building as GameStop, Metaplanet, and The Blockchain Group are all increasing Bitcoin reserves. Additionally, the Bank of Japan’s June 16–17 meeting could spur a Bitcoin rally if the central bank pivots back to QE. Trump Mining Firm Stacks Bitcoin American Bitcoin, the mining firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., quietly amassed a reserve of 215 Bitcoin since launching on April 1. This is according to a recent SEC filing . The company has made it clear that its core strategy centers on accumulating Bitcoin rather than treating it as a byproduct of mining. The stache is currently worth over $23 million, but was not previously disclosed. ABTC described its reserve as a strategic asset which goal is to enhance long-term shareholder value, with no fixed accumulation target in place. Instead, the company said it plans to continually evaluate market conditions to opportunistically raise capital and expand its holdings. Rather than owning physical infrastructure, ABTC directly invests in mining hardware. The firm operates more than 60,000 miners, primarily from Bitmain and MicroBT, which are hosted at facilities in New York, Alberta, and Texas managed by Hut 8 . These miners collectively generate a hashrate of 10.17 exahashes per second, with energy efficiency averaging 21.2 joules per terahash. By partnering with Hut 8, ABTC kept overhead costs low while maintaining the flexibility to scale production. The firm also contributes to mining pools like Foundry and Luxor, with rewards distributed according to hashrate contributions and pool fees kept below 1%. (Source: SEC filing ) ABTC follows a three-tiered approach: building cost-effective mining operations, expanding its Bitcoin reserves through strategic capital use, and engaging actively with the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. The firm’s Bitcoin is held securely in cold wallets with Coinbase Custody, and uses multifactor authentication and strict withdrawal protocols to safeguard assets. On May 12, ABTC revealed plans to go public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The transaction will be structured as a stock-for-stock deal, and will result in the combined entity operating under the American Bitcoin name. Eric Trump is set to join the board post-merger, while Hut 8, the majority shareholder, will maintain its role in managing infrastructure and operations. Once completed, current ABTC shareholders will own about 98% of the new company. Saylor Tells Apple to Buy Bitcoin Other companies are also being encouraged to embrace Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, urged Apple to consider buying Bitcoin as a strategic alternative to its underperforming stock buyback program. In a June 10 post on X , Saylor responded to CNBC host Jim Cramer’s critique of Apple’s buyback initiative, which was described as ineffective despite a $110 billion allocation disclosed in a May 2024 SEC filing. Cramer suggested the company reevaluate its approach because relying solely on buybacks may no longer be viable. Saylor’s suggestion is grounded in Bitcoin’s very impressive historical performance. While Apple shares climbed 137% over the past five years, Bitcoin soared more than 1,000%. Bitcoin also climbed 17% since the start of the year, while Apple faced an almost 17% drop. The implication is that a Bitcoin allocation could serve as a much better vehicle for shareholder value appreciation than continued stock repurchases. Apple YTD share price (Source: Google ) This call happened during a broader wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption. GameStop recently disclosed a $513 million Bitcoin purchase, and bought 4,710 BTC after a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. In Asia, Metaplanet has become the eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with its stock rising by more than 12% after announcing a $5.4 billion capital raise to expand its BTC holdings even more. Across Europe, Paris-based The Blockchain Group is planning to raise over $340 million for its Bitcoin treasury, shortly after acquiring $68 million worth of BTC. Bitcoin’s growing appeal to corporations is also encouraged by a rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF flows. After a brief two-day dip, funds recorded over $386 million in net inflows on June 9, which could mean that there is renewed institutional interest. Saylor’s suggestion that Apple follow suit taps into this momentum, as Bitcoin continues to stand out as a serious asset for corporate treasuries looking for long-term growth and diversification. BOJ Pivot Could Boost Bitcoin Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan’s upcoming monetary policy meeting on June 16–17 is being closely watched as a potential turning point for global risk assets, including Bitcoin and equities. Market participants, including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, believe the central bank could reintroduce quantitative easing (QE) measures and reverse its tightening stance. Hayes suggested in a June 10 post on X that if the BOJ delays its current quantitative tightening (QT) program and resumes targeted QE, it could trigger a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin. QE is a monetary policy tool that is used to inject liquidity into the economy through large-scale bond purchases. It tends to lower interest rates and fuel asset prices during economic uncertainty. Back in July of 2024, the Bank of Japan announced a plan to reduce its government bond purchases by 400 billion yen per quarter starting in August. This started a shift toward QT after years of ultra-loose monetary policy. However, sources that were referred to by Bloomberg indicate that the BOJ is now considering a more gradual reduction, with a revised plan to cut only 200 billion yen per quarter beginning in 2027. The central bank’s June meeting includes an interim assessment of this tightening program, making it a critical juncture for possible policy shifts. Bitcoin’s sensitivity to developments in Japan’s bond market became evident in May 2025, when the cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high of $112,000 just two days after 30-year Japanese bond yields spiked to a record 3.185%. The yield surge caused fears about Japan’s fiscal stability, which pushed investors to seek alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. According to André Dragosch , head of European research at Bitwise, these concerns about sovereign default risks strengthened the perception of Bitcoin as a hedge free from counterparty risk. As traditional safe-haven assets like government bonds become more volatile, Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge is gaining more and more traction.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-11 06:16:19

In a new video, trader Kevin Svenson tells his 83,200 YouTube followers that Bitcoin appears to be in the final stages of a parabolic trend that began in 2023. According to Svenson, Bitcoin could ignite a fresh leg up once it takes out its final resistance area at around $110,000. “It’s going to be a really epic next few months if we do get this breakout, because we are still following the parabolic trend to this day.” Svenson believes that a breakout will trigger a “blow-off top” for Bitcoin, where BTC will experience a period of rapid price increases before collapsing. “The next phase is the vertical phase, where you go into a potential blow-off top. A parabola is simply just an exponential trend and it gets steeper and steeper. And because of that, by definition, the parabolic trend it’s unsustainable… It’s a trade-off: it gets really, really bullish, and because of that, it’s unsustainable. Eventually, the trend just gives out just like Bitcoin in 2017, 2021. Eventually, the trend will shift back… But this next push could be until October.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will soar to $135,000 in the coming months.

Additionally, the bill mandates legal guardian verification for users under the age of 18, imposing protections for minors. Connecticut Falls Out of Bitcoin Reserve Race Following months of strategic Bitcoin reserve proposals from 27 states, New Hampshire , Arizona , and Texas have approved state-level Bitcoin reserve law. For instance, Texas has a “significant budget surplus” and a strategic Bitcoin reserve in that state “offers a forward-thinking investment opportunity,” Lee Bratcher, President of The Texas Blockchain Council, told Cryptonews . “Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value aligns with our state’s history of making smart, diversified investments in emerging assets,” he said at the time. However, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation this year, joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. The hesitance to embrace BTC comes amid concerns over its price volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve , a significant move, but, didn’t have concrete details, failing to excite traders.

The ETF's distributions are classified as return of capital, offering tax deferral benefits until the fund is sold, which can appeal to long-term investors. Risks include declining distributions, potential for the fund price to approach zero, and uncertainty about sustaining high yields in the future. I rate CONY a 'hold'—it may be suitable for income-focused investors, but COIN offers higher total return potential for growth-oriented investors. This may not be for everyone, but the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) currently pays a 175% annual yield with distributions paid monthly. This fund can be a great way to collect monthly income with such a high yield. The fund doesn't invest directly in Coinbase ( COIN ). CONY generates income for distributions by writing (selling) call options on Coinbase. Since COIN tends to be a volatile stock, the premiums sold can be high from the elevated implied volatility of the call options. Some investors may prefer to do their own covered call strategy. However, CONY provides the convenience of having professionals manage those options regularly in exchange for a reasonable fee (expense ratio) of 1.22%. Investors of CONY buy the fund and then enjoy the high monthly distributions without much effort. The expense ratio looks reasonable considering the high annual yield that investors can derive from CONY. Understanding CONY's Performance Stock Performance of COIN vs. CONY (Weekly Chart) Including Dividends ( TradingView ) The weekly chart above shows the performance of COIN's stock price with a comparison to CONY's performance, including the distribution payouts. Even with CONY's generous monthly payouts, COIN still outperformed. The reason for this is because CONY's price declined significantly since inception. The YieldMax ETFs tend to underperform the underlying stocks that they derive income from. So, some investors may prefer to own COIN instead of CONY. In that scenario, COIN holders could sell some shares when income is needed. I will point out that Coinbase is currently in an uptrend on the weekly chart. This is indicated with the purple RSI line (middle of the chart) above the 50 level and the blue MACD line (bottom of the chart) above the red signal line. The MACD's green rising histogram bars also reinforce COIN's uptrend. Defenders of CONY may point out that they are happy with a lower total return with the consistent convenience of collecting monthly income from it. Defenders of holding COIN instead of CONY may say that they prefer the higher total return, especially when CONY's expense ratio adds to its total underperformance. The price of CONY declined over the long term since its inception. However, CONY's high yield allows investors to receive more in distributions than what they invested into it in a relatively short period of time. At the current yield, it would take less than a year. Therefore, CONY could lose all of its value and investors could still be profitable from the high distributions. Of course, this assumes that YieldMax is consistently successful with producing strong income. CONY's Tax Benefit Another plus for CONY is that the distributions are taxed differently than regular dividends. Since income from CONY is essentially options income, it is considered return of capital when paid out. The return of capital reduces the adjusted cost basis. According to IRS rules , return of capital is not taxed in the year that you receive the income. It would only be taxed when the ETF is sold. Therefore, a long-term holder of the fund could enjoy multiple years of income from CONY without being taxed on it if they choose not to sell. It is important to note that if the price of CONY went to zero, future distributions would be taxed in the year that you receive them. It is possible that the fund would do a reverse split if the price approached zero. This would allow the fund to continue and for YieldMax to continue paying distributions. Distribution Payout History CONY's Distribution Payout History (Seeking Alpha) We can see from the table above that 2025 was the first year that the monthly distributions dropped below $1 per share. This is relative to the price of CONY. For example, back on December 7, 2023, the distribution of $2.4615 was a monthly yield of 10.7% based on CONY's price on that day of $23.04. Recently, on May 29, 2025, the distribution of $0.7351 was a monthly yield of 9.5% based on CONY's price of $7.75 on that day. While the monthly yield did drop, it didn't drop as drastically as the percentage change of the distribution payout. Investors can purchase more shares as CONY's price drops, which can increase their monthly returns. That can include reinvesting some of the distributions to purchase more shares. Risks for CONY I realize that it sounds cliche, but there is no guarantee that future results will be similar to the past. It is possible that YieldMax is not able to produce high distributions going forward the way they did in the past. The implied volatility of the options sold could change, which could produce different results for distribution payouts. CONY's underlying price could continue to drop and approach zero. So, investors need to realize that the distributions are what can make them money from this ETF. YieldMax would probably do a reverse split to increase the price of CONY if it dropped too low. YieldMax did a reverse split on TSLY back in February 2024. It is also possible that the monthly distributions are lowered significantly, making the total annual yield less attractive. This could also significantly increase the amount of time that it would take for investors to make back their initial investment in distributions. Final Thoughts on CONY I see CONY fit for investors who desire steady monthly payouts. Personally, I would strive to get the highest return on my money as possible. That means that I would prefer to own COIN, which tends to have a higher total return even when CONY's dividends are accounted for. Those who prefer COIN should keep an eye on Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) bull markets. The reason for this is because COIN tends to trend similar to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's bear markets can be brutal, and the same is true for COIN. CONY began trading in 2023. So, it hasn't been around during Bitcoin's last halving cycle. It is possible that CONY's opposite, the YieldMax Short COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( FIAT ) would be better to own after Bitcoin and COIN peak this cycle. However, there is not much history to gauge how CONY and FIAT would perform during a Bitcoin bear market. Overall, I'll rate CONY a 'hold' since it can act as a feasible way for investors to collect income on a monthly basis. I won't give it a higher rating because CONY's success depends on the skills of the fund managers. Plus, there is not much history for this ETF since it is only a couple of years old.",COIN|CONY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-11 07:07:29

With only 450 BTC mined daily, Saylor warns that $50M in buying pressure can drive prices sharply higher. Institutions, ETFs, and governments are accelerating Bitcoin accumulation. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, has dismissed speculation that a new crypto winter is on the horizon, doubling down on his bullish Bitcoin outlook. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday , Saylor stated, “Winter is not coming back. We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” His comments arrive amid a tightening Bitcoin supply and increased institutional interest. Saylor: Only 450 Bitcoin Mined Daily According to Saylor, just 450 BTC are available for sale each day from miners, amounting to roughly $50 million at Bitcoin’s current price of $109,859. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” he said, adding that public companies are now absorbing “the entire natural supply.” Strategy, which began accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, now holds 582,000 BTC—worth approximately $63.85 billion, according to Saylor Tracker. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn,” he noted. The billionaire also referenced broader market signals as validation for his aggressive forecast. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” Saylor said, pointing to traditional financial institutions preparing Bitcoin custody services and political support from key figures in Washington.

PARABOLIC SOON pic.twitter.com/Vv7qSRIgst — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) June 10, 2025 He cited President Donald Trump’s backing of Bitcoin, as well as support from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC Chair Paul Atkins. “Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected,” Saylor said. Saylor did acknowledge potential volatility at higher price levels, stating that if Bitcoin rises to $500,000 or $1 million, it would be realistic to expect it “crashing down by about $200,000 a coin.” His remarks come as other major players revise their own projections upward. In April, ARK Invest raised its “bull case” price target for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. ETF Providers Continue to Accumulate Bitcoin Meanwhile, ETF providers such as BlackRock continue to purchase Bitcoin on a daily basis, and some governments are stepping in as well. On May 28, Pakistan’s crypto council head Bilal Bin Saqib announced plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Notably, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

The earnings report, which was published on June 10th, shows that the company’s core business areas, from investing to wealth management and cryptocurrency offerings, have seen significant growth. Net contribution, or revenue after direct costs, increased 8% year-over-year to $217 million, driven by increased user activity across global markets. Net income under generally accepted accounting principles, which measures overall profitability after operating expenses and taxes, was $60 million. The company also posted $80 million in adjusted EBITDA, a metric that reflects operational earnings by excluding non-cash items and one-off expenses like marketing campaigns or acquisitions. Thanks to ongoing efforts to increase user acquisition and retention, funded accounts increased 14% from the previous year to 3.58 million. Assets under administration increased by 21% to $14.8 billion compared to Q1 2024. eToro ended the quarter with $736 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 climbed 0.5 percent by midmorning to 38,385.37, buoyed by data from the Bank of Japan showing wholesale inflation eased in May. That slowdown may reduce pressure on the central bank to lift interest rates at its next policy meeting. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng added 0.8 percent, reaching 24,364.77, while Shanghai’s main index rose 0.5 percent to 3,402.72. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 inched up 0.3 percent to 8,612.40, and South Korea’s Kospi was 0.6 percent higher at 2,889.88. Overnight in New York, US stocks extended their rally. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to close at 6,038.81, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent to 42,866.87, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6 percent, finishing at 19,714.99. This strength follows a drop of nearly 20 percent from record highs two months ago, triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of hefty tariffs that stoked fears of a recession. Much of the recent rebound has been driven by hopes that the White House will roll back duties after striking trade deals abroad. The S&P 500 now sits just 1.7 percent below its February peak. Still, some analysts say the latest talks produced more reaffirmation than fresh progress. After two days of meetings in London, officials in the late hours agreed on what had largely been outlined earlier. “So what did 48 hours of talks actually produce? Apparently, a reaffirmation to eventually do what they had already said they would do. If markets were expecting substance, they got process instead,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. Lutnick said the talks are going well, spiking optimism US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, speaking in London Tuesday evening, described discussions with Chinese counterparts as “going really, really well.” Both sides have suspended many of the tariffs they imposed on each other to keep negotiations on track. A survey released Tuesday showed that small-business optimism in the United States ticked up slightly in May. In individual stock moves, Tesla shares jumped 5.7 percent, recouping some ground after last week’s sell-off. The electric-car maker fell sharply when founder Elon Musk’s public spat with President Trump raised concerns about possible government retaliation against the company. Meanwhile, US–traded shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, rose 2.6 percent after the firm said its May revenue surged nearly 40 percent from a year earlier. On bond markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury eased to 4.48 percent from 4.47 percent late Tuesday. In commodities, benchmark US crude added eight cents to $65.06 a barrel, and Brent crude crept up two cents to $66.89 a barrel. In currency trading, the dollar strengthened slightly against the yen, trading at 145.08 yen versus 144.84 yen on Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.1418 from $1.1425.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-xrp-retail-investors-will-get-completely-priced-out-this-year-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Cobb took to X to comment on the changing dynamics of XRP’s market accessibility, highlighting a growing concern among long-time followers of the asset. In a brief but pointed statement, Cobb reflected on the diminishing purchasing power of retail investors by contrasting current and past valuations of XRP . “Remember when $100 used to get you 400 XRP,” Cobb wrote. “Now $100 only gets you 43 XRP. Only going to get worse, retail is going to get completely priced out this year.” Cobb’s remark underscores a significant appreciation in XRP’s value, paired with a growing unease about the affordability of accumulating the token. At the time of his post, $100 could only purchase approximately 43 XRP, reflecting a market price of $2.32 per token. Remember when $100 used to get you 400 XRP Now $100 only gets you 43 XRP Only going to get worse, retail is going get completely priced out this year — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 9, 2025 According to CoinMarketCap, XRP is up 1.23% over the last 24 hours, which further reinforces the trajectory Cobb is pointing to. The implication is clear: if XRP continues its current momentum, average investors could soon find themselves unable to buy meaningful quantities . XRP’s Fractional Nature Sparks Debate About Accessibility The commentary attracted responses from other users on the platform, each providing different perspectives on Cobb’s warning. Andrew Pearce responded by offering a counterpoint to Cobb’s concern, stating, “Don’t forget, there are 1000000 drops in each xrp, so we will never really be priced out of xrp. People might get ‘priced out’ in a certain cycle where they think the price has gone too high in the short term, but within another year or two they’ll be fomo’ing in at way higher prices.” Pearce’s comment references the divisibility of XRP into one million units called “drops,” which allows for fractional purchases even at high valuations. His response suggests that while the full coin may become more expensive, access to the asset in smaller increments will remain technically available, though possibly less psychologically or strategically appealing for retail buyers. Community Members Reflect on XRP’s Early Days Another user, LunarAngel, contributed to the historical context of XRP’s pricing, recalling an era of far lower valuations. “I can tell you there was a time it was 300 coin per dollar when it was open coming with a webwallet. During the XRapid era. I was there but then I missed the journey even till now,” the user wrote. Their comment points to a time when XRP could be acquired for as little as $0.0033, dramatically different from today’s pricing. It reflects the sentiment of early adopters who witnessed the coin’s journey through utility-focused initiatives such as the now-shelved xRapid product. Ongoing Price Appreciation Raises Barriers to Entry Cobb’s observation reflects a larger theme in crypto markets, where early access often translates into disproportionately greater rewards, while later entrants must navigate higher barriers. His claim that retail will be “completely priced out” this year hinges on the assumption that XRP’s value will continue to climb rapidly—an outcome that, while speculative, is supported by the asset’s current momentum. Cobb’s comment did not provide a specific target price or timeline, but it does emphasize his broader outlook: that the window for affordable retail accumulation may be closing soon.

The rally, marked by a V-shaped recovery from key support levels, is indicative of DOGE’s resilience as it attracts attention from both retail and institutional investors. News Background Dogecoin’s latest rally comes amid renewed interest in meme coins and growing speculation around a potential DOGE ETF. According to Polymarket data, traders now estimate a 51% chance of SEC approval for a DOGE ETF in 2025, a development that could bring substantial institutional inflows. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s integration with the Coinbase-backed Base network has enhanced its utility in DeFi applications, making it easier for users to engage with the token across multiple platforms. As geopolitical tensions and evolving trade policies continue to roil traditional markets, Dogecoin’s role as a speculative asset — and potential hedge — remains in focus. Institutional whale activity, along with sustained interest from high-volume traders, suggests the token could remain a key performer even amid broader market uncertainty. Price Action Dogecoin’s rally was highlighted by a dramatic price surge during the 11:00-13:00 window, where volume spiked to 541 million and 589 million units respectively — more than double the average. The surge established a strong high-volume resistance zone at $0.198-$0.199. DOGE’s price bounced decisively from $0.194 support, forming a V-shaped recovery pattern with renewed buyer interest. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE climbed from $0.189 to $0.199, a 4.8% gain. Significant volatility occurred during 11:00-13:00 UTC, with volumes of 541 million and 589 million. Resistance established at $0.198-$0.199, with support at $0.189. V-shaped recovery pattern formed in the final hour, with substantial buying interest at $0.194. Volume spikes at 01:56 UTC to 7.2 million and during the final 10 minutes confirmed strong buyer interest. Price established new resistance at $0.196, suggesting potential continuation of the uptrend.

As XRP basks in post-lawsuit clarity, Lightchain AI surges ahead with real-world traction and a $21m presale milestone. Table of Contents XRP stays in the spotlight amid ongoing developments Lightchain AI builds confidence through presale execution Lightchain AI is shaping the future of decentralized solutions While XRP gains attention through legal clarity, Lightchain AI is gaining something far more actionable, real-world momentum driven by strategic presale execution. With all 15 stages now completed and a Bonus Round currently live at a fixed price of $0.007, the project has already secured nearly $21 million in early support. But beyond the numbers, it’s Lightchain AI’s focused rollout that’s turning heads: a fully functional AI Virtual Machine, developer grant incentives, and transparent governance all designed to build long-term traction. As XRP clears courtroom hurdles, Lightchain AI is clearing the path to adoption, one strategic, infrastructure-backed milestone at a time. XRP stays in the spotlight amid ongoing developments XRP continues to be at the center of the cryptocurrency market as legal and regulatory battles rage on. After winning partially in a court in July 2023, which determined that XRP generally isn’t a security, Ripple Labs ended litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May 2025. Ripple has settled a protracted lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that started in December 2020, agreeing to pay a $50 million fine. The clarity provided by this resolution, on XRP, has also helped drive an increase in price as investors are now more confident. Still, the internal disagreement at the SEC over the terms of the settlement have underscored continuing disputes over the regulation of crypto. But XRP’s fate is also a litmus test for how the broader cryptocurrency industry will maintain its connection with U.S. regulators, at a time when the regulatory landscape around crypto is changing quickly. You might also like: Ethereum scales strong, but Lightchain AI leads presale with dev-first design Lightchain AI builds confidence through presale execution Lightchain AI is steadily building market confidence through its disciplined and transparent presale execution. With over $21 million raised across 15 carefully phased presale stages, the project has demonstrated consistency, clear communication, and a commitment to long-term value. Now in its fixed-price Bonus Round, Lightchain continues to attract strategic buyers by backing its momentum with real infrastructure, public GitHub repositories, a live Developer Portal, and decentralized validator and contributor nodes. Its tokenomics further boost confidence: the original 5% Team Allocation has been fully reallocated to grants and ecosystem growth, aligning incentives with builders. This structured, utility-first approach sends a clear message, Lightchain AI isn’t built on speculation, but on delivery. And that’s exactly what today’s serious investors are seeking. Lightchain AI is shaping the future of decentralized solutions Lightchain AI is turning ambition into action with its final Bonus Round, offering LCAI tokens at just $0.007125 ahead of the highly anticipated July 2025 mainnet launch. With over $21 million already raised, the project is taking a bold step by reallocating 5% of team tokens to empower developers and infrastructure partners. At launch, Lightchain AI will open its public repositories, inviting transparency and global collaboration. This game-changing initiative cements Lightchain AI as a leader in decentralized AI, driving innovation with purpose and precision.

The sidechain brings Ethereum smart contract compatibility to XRPL using wrapped XRP as gas. XRPL also expanded its stablecoin ecosystem with EURØP and USDB to strengthen regional adoption. The XRP Ledger is preparing to roll out an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain in Q2, marking a major step toward Ethereum compatibility. The development was confirmed by Ripple CTO David Schwartz at the Apex 2025 event in Singapore , with blockchain firm Peersyst helping lead the effort. The EVM sidechain is designed to combine the XRP Ledger’s low-cost, high-speed settlement layer with Ethereum’s robust smart contract capabilities. XRP Ledger’s EVM Sidechain is Live on Testnet Built using the evmOS software stack, the sidechain is currently live on testnet, with a mainnet launch expected later this quarter after further validator onboarding. Unlike Ethereum-native blockchains, the XRP Ledger does not currently support the EVM environment that powers most decentralized applications. The new sidechain aims to fill that gap while preserving XRP’s efficiency. A bridge will link the sidechain to the XRP Ledger mainnet, using Axelar as the sole provider for asset transfers. The one and only @JoelKatz and Ripple’s @jazzicoop announced the XRPL EVM is going live Q2 at Apex featuring some DeFi apps like @StrobeFinance @vertex_protocol , @SecurdLabs and @squidrouter building on it pic.twitter.com/EPhz1JcdiA — Peersyst Technology (@Peersyst) June 11, 2025 Wrapped XRP will act as the gas token on the EVM sidechain, enabling smart contract execution without leaving the broader XRP ecosystem. While the Flare Network already offers an EVM-compatible solution for XRP users, this move brings Ethereum integration directly under Ripple’s umbrella. In May, the XRP Ledger expanded its stablecoin offerings with the launch of two new region-specific assets, including EURØP, a MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin from Schuman Financial, and USDB, a dollar-pegged token issued by Brazil’s Braza Group. EURØP, backed by euros and safeguarded by major institutions like Societe Generale, marks the first fully MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin on XRPL. Meanwhile, Braza Group’s USDB stablecoin, backed by U.S. and Brazilian bonds, offers Brazilian users a secure digital asset for payments and hedging. XRP Faces Backlash as Ripple Aligns With Europe on Digital Euro Project As reported, serial entrepreneur and investor Gary Cardone has launched a scathing attack on XRP , accusing the digital asset of aligning itself with centralized governments in a bid to stay relevant. His remarks follow ongoing speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) may integrate the XRP Ledger into its digital euro infrastructure. While the ECB has not confirmed any formal partnership with Ripple or its XRP Ledger, rumors have circulated across crypto circles. Cardone went further, likening XRP’s influence in finance to a new virus, calling it “COVID-19 Part Two in finance.” He warned that continued support for the token amounts to voting for “European warmongers,” framing XRP’s ambitions as a threat to freedom rather than a step forward in financial innovation. The comments drew immediate backlash from the XRP community, which labeled the remarks as inflammatory and unfounded. Robert Doyle, known online as Crypto Sensei, countered Cardone’s statements by noting that “there is no official confirmation” that Ripple technology will be used for the digital euro. He emphasized that, while the ECB is exploring CBDCs, no final decision has been made regarding the technology stack.

According to Koch, Bitcoin has become indispensable not only for individual investors but also for the US government. Koch examined Donald Trump’s drastic change in attitude towards Bitcoin. Describing Bitcoin as a “valueless bubble” in 2019, Trump signed a decree in the White House declaring Bitcoin a “strategic state reserve” after his re-election in 2024. Koch argues that this change is not random but part of a deliberate plan. The economic part of this plan is that Trump’s family runs a crypto fund, invests in Bitcoin mining and makes millions with their own memecoins. But that’s not the real issue, Koch says. Alongside Trump, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also completely changed his view on Bitcoin over the years. While Fink once described Bitcoin as a “money laundering index,” he began to describe it as a “financial revolution” by 2023. Koch says that these changes in attitude are not so much about personal gain but rather an effort to maintain the US’s economic leadership. The US’s global supremacy is based on three pillars: the dollar being the global reserve currency, the high demand for US bonds and technological leadership. Bitcoin and crypto markets have the capacity to play a strategic role in all three of these areas. Since 2020, the US government debt has increased from $23 trillion to $36 trillion, while the money supply has increased from $1.8 trillion to $2.4 trillion. Koch says that this level of debt would have long ago bankrupted any other country, but the US has been able to carry the burden thanks to the dollar’s global position. Related News: Secret Bitcoin Activities of a Company Supported by Donald Trump in the US Have Been Revealed - Here Are the Details This is where the crypto market comes in. The stablecoin market is a huge liquidity pool with a size of around $250 billion. Large issuers like Tether back most of their reserves with US Treasury bonds. This gives the crypto sector an important role in indirect financing of US debt. Citing Standard Chartered’s analysis, Koch argues that the stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion by 2028, in which case stablecoin issuers alone would own 15% of U.S. bonds. According to Simeon Koch, Bitcoin and crypto markets in general have become not only an investment tool, but also a lifeline for the sustainability of the US economy. The shift towards crypto by both political and financial elites is not only due to individual interests, but also systemic needs. As a result, Koch says the U.S. needs Bitcoin more than ever to maintain its economic stability and global leadership: “This is no longer an option, it’s a necessity.” Just a few years ago, many US officials viewed the growing power of stablecoin issuers in the bond market as a threat to the national budget. But the picture has quickly changed. Today, the crypto industry is supported by regulatory frameworks and encouraged to grow, provided, of course, that major players like Tether and Circle remain loyal to the US and its dollar. To strengthen this connection, a new bill called the “GENIUS Act” is currently being discussed in the US Congress. According to the bill, stablecoin issuers will be required to back the majority of the digital assets they issue with US Treasury bonds. The idea behind this strategy is clear: The more bonds stablecoin companies buy, the more easily the US can finance its budget deficit. At the same time, the fact that these companies hold large amounts of dollar reserves allows excess liquidity to be drawn out of the system, giving the US Federal Reserve more leeway to stimulate the economy by printing new dollars. According to Koch, Trump and his team have a clear understanding that the crypto market is not only a “liquidity sponge” against inflation, but also a loyal buyer of US debt. Therefore, the government’s welcoming approach to the crypto market is a natural consequence of this conscious strategy. According to the analyst, Donald Trump’s goal of making the US a global crypto leader also fits perfectly with this equation. The stronger the blockchain, the more transactions are made in US dollars. This means more dollar reserves are drawn into the system. If the dollar’s dominance in the crypto market is maintained, the US could also offset potential losses in the petrodollar system. For decades, the dollar’s dominant role in oil trading has been a cornerstone of US economic dominance. Now, crypto has the potential to take on that role. But this new collaboration is a double-edged sword: the crypto market is both gaining more traction and demand, and increasing its reliance on US-centric monetary policies and bonds. According to Simeon Koch’s analysis, Trump’s call to “never sell your Bitcoin” stems not from a crypto belief, but from a cold-blooded geostrategic calculation. *This is not investment advice.

It enables the network to seamlessly support Ethereum-based smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), significantly broadening XRPL’s developer base. This positions XRP Ledger to attract projects and developers from Ethereum’s vast ecosystem, effectively bridging the gap between the two chains. Testnet Growth Signals High Potential The XRPL EVM sidechain testnet, which went live earlier this year, is already showing strong signs of momentum. According to Peersyst Technologies, the infrastructure partner behind the project, the testnet has attracted 87 new contributors, all previously unaffiliated with XRP, who are now actively building infrastructure, applications, and driving adoption. Peersyst described the upcoming mainnet launch as possibly “the biggest onboarding in XRP history,” suggesting this could mark a major milestone in expanding the utility and reach of the XRPL ecosystem. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News: First XRP ETF Approval Could Happen by June 25 , What This Means for XRP Price Once it goes live, the new EVM sidechain will make the XRP Ledger much more useful. It will let developers build apps like DeFi projects and NFT platforms, just like they do on Ethereum. Plus, they’ll be able to use Solidity, Ethereum’s most popular programming language. As more Layer 1 blockchains compete, Ripple’s move to support Ethereum-based tools, while keeping XRP Ledger’s fast speed and low costs, could help it stand out again in the growing blockchain world. With the full launch expected by the end of Q2, the crypto community is watching closely. If successful, this sidechain could bring in a new era for XRP, one that extends far beyond remittances. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A DeFi project is designed to run independently of any centralized authority. Today, Ethereum is the most popular network for decentralized applications (dApps) that power DeFi use cases. The main advantage that DeFi has over traditional finance is that it is faster. A financial transaction on a dApp can be completed in seconds at a lower cost compared to the legacy financial system. This is because there are no middlemen and associated costs. As a result, people can lend, borrow, earn interest, and trade on the blockchain. Another benefit is that anyone can access DeFi without the need for extensive paperwork. How DeFi Evolved There is no definitive event or time when DeFi began. Instead, the system has developed gradually as people have created more use cases for blockchain technology. It has emerged out of a need to solve existing problems in the financial world. In this article, we will explore the top DeFi projects you should consider adding to your portfolio in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an emerging DeFi project that has taken the crypto world by storm. So far, conservative estimates forecast that MUTM tokens, the native token of the ecosystem, could rise by as much as 2,569% once it goes live. How it Works Mutuum Finance (MUYM) is built for lenders, borrowers, and liquidators. On the platform, lenders deposit their assets to earn interest, while borrowers can take loans and pay interest on those assets. One of the unique features of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its liquidity management. Unlike existing projects, which allow any type of asset on their platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will restrict the protocol to a subset of assets, which are known to have high liquidity and low volatility. The protocol will also vet tokens to determine if they are fully decentralized or controlled by a single entity. Any assets that show signs of price manipulation will not be allowed on the platform. Advantages Of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A major advantage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its intense focus on liquidity management and protocol solvency. It is also laser-focused on security and recently completed its CertiK audit, where it currently has a token Scan Score of 80. The project will also implement address screening measures to ensure that wallet addresses previously associated with bad actors do not make it onto the platform. However, the third-party address screening service will not have access to private data like IP addresses or metadata. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to offer targeted liquidity mining rewards. By targeted, it means resources will be focused on high-value tokens that have high demand on the open market. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will occasionally adjust parameters in the lending protocol to protect the ecosystem from arbitrage-induced outflows. The team plans to make this ecosystem multi-chain. The Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. The presale is currently in phase 5, and over 30% of the tokens have already been sold, barely a week after the current phase launched. To date, over $10.3 million has been raised from more than 11,900 participants in the presale. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. Monero (XMR) Monero (XMR) is a project that was created out of a need for privacy in the crypto market. It combines multiple technologies for this task. As a result, Monero has become famous around privacy circles. Monero was created out of a need to improve privacy on Bitcoin. This is because there are various tools today that can be used to unmask those behind a transaction. However, the main challenge with Monero (XMR) is utility. The token is not listed on many leading exchanges, which makes it difficult to have real world utility. Additionally, most merchants do not accept Monero (XMR) as payment. As a result, the price of XMR has suffered, with the coin down 10% in the past week alone. Summary If you are looking for a DeFi project that can maximize your returns in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is your best bet. It is still in the presale and builds on the successes of previous DeFi projects to build a better, more refined ecosystem. You can be part of the exciting Mutuum Finance ecosystem at the low price of $0.03 per token in the ongoing presale.

It recently flashed a bullish golden cross on the daily chart – a signal that has many crypto analysts forecasting a potential new all-time high (ATH) in the near future. Ethereum Flashes Bullish Golden Cross In an X post published today, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that ETH has formed a golden cross on its daily chart. He shared the following chart and remarked that bullish momentum appears to be building for Ethereum. To explain, a golden cross is a bullish technical pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average (MA) – typically the 50-day – crosses above a long-term MA like the 200-day. It signals a potential shift in momentum and is often seen as an indicator of a sustained upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 – Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez commented on ETH’s recent price action. He noted that Ethereum has broken resistance on the 4-hour chart and could be setting up for a move as high as $2,920 in the coming days. Fellow market commentator Ted Pillows echoed a similar view. He stated that ETH is currently trading at a local range high, pushing against a key resistance level at $2,800. Pillows suggested that the digital asset might reach $4,000 later this month. Multiple technical indicators and market structure patterns are also hinting at near-term upside for ETH. For instance, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader observed a hidden bullish divergence on the 12-hour chart. A hidden bullish divergence occurs when price forms a higher low, while a momentum indicator – such as RSI or MACD – forms a lower low. This setup suggests that although momentum appears weak, the underlying trend remains intact, and a price continuation to the upside is likely. In a similar vein, digital assets analyst Crypto Caesar pointed out that Ethereum’s Wyckoff Accumulation pattern is “still playing out perfectly.” He shared a chart predicting that ETH may hit a new all-time high by August 2025. All Indicators Point To Further Upside Beyond the technical patterns, other on-chain and market indicators continue to support the bullish thesis. For instance, even after gaining over 11% in the past two weeks, Ethereum’s funding rates remain relatively neutral – a sign that the rally may still have room to grow.

Almost all of them—103 to be exact—said the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will hold rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50% during the June 17–18 meeting, the same range it’s been stuck in since the start of the year. The only reason? Inflation still hasn’t calmed down, and the labor market isn’t showing enough pain to force the Fed’s hand. The forecast comes at a time when economic stability is still on edge. Trade negotiations between the U.S. and China remain incomplete, and a July 9 deadline for a temporary 90-day tariff pause is fast approaching. That truce, first introduced in April, hasn’t led to much actual progress, and now economists are keeping their outlooks fragile. The White House, under President Donald Trump, has raised tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, and markets are starting to price in the cost of those decisions. On top of that, a massive new tax cut bill just passed by the House of Representatives is fueling more uncertainty, as it hasn’t yet passed through the Senate. Trump demands cuts as economists hold the line Despite pressure from Trump to lower rates by a full percentage point—he wants to see the fed funds rate drop to 3.25%–3.50%—the Fed is unmoved. The central bank is watching inflation expectations closely, and they’ve stayed high thanks to growing assumptions that the U.S. will keep erecting trade barriers. UBS Chief U.S. Economist Jonathan Pingle summed up the hesitation clearly: “As long as the labor market looks fine, we expect the FOMC to continue to stay on hold, and use rhetoric to bolster their inflation-fighting credibility. Until there is a cost, why signal otherwise?” Pingle also added, “At the moment ‘grey area’ seems more ‘charcoal’ … the Committee is facing a substantial amount of uncertainty.” Out of the 105 economists Reuters spoke to, 59 said they believe the Fed will begin cutting rates in the third quarter of 2025, most likely September, while 44 predicted the cuts won’t happen until Q4 or later. Another 20 said there would be no rate cuts at all this year. So while the majority still expect a move in a few months, a big chunk think it’ll be much longer. BNP Paribas Chief U.S. Economist James Egelhof believes the inflation problem isn’t going away. “High tariffs are here to stay, and they will produce elevated inflation that is sustained well into 2026,” he said. “The Fed will see little need to cut … the lesson we have from history is, if inflation becomes entrenched in the economy, it can be very hard and very costly to remove.” Debt concerns and spending bill drive uncertainty While inflation is a major concern, so is federal debt, which has now ballooned to $36.2 trillion. The new tax-and-spending package making its way through Congress is expected to pile on another $2.4 trillion, and the bond market is already reacting. The increased issuance of Treasuries is pushing up long-term interest rates, which directly affects lending costs for things like housing and business investment. Comerica Bank Chief Economist Bill Adams explained why the Fed won’t be rushing to help. “With more fiscal stimulus coming out of the tax and spending bill, the Fed sees less of a case for supporting the economy with lower interest rates,” Bill said. “The fiscal policy looks set to push the deficit (higher) … exerting continued upward pressure on long-term interest rates that will be a headwind for credit-intensive parts of the economy like the housing market and business capital spending.” The economy isn’t doing great either. U.S. GDP shrank by 0.2% last quarter, largely due to a growing trade deficit, and full-year growth is now expected to reach only 1.4%, down sharply from 2.8% in 2024. Next year’s forecast is just slightly better at 1.5%, and that projection hasn’t moved since May. Even as U.S. officials continue trade discussions in London with top Chinese representatives, there’s no strong indication of any deal materializing before the tariff pause expires. Meanwhile, both economists and everyday Americans are bracing for higher prices to stick around. Inflation expectations remain well above the Fed’s 2% target, and no one expects that to change until at least 2027. By the end of 2025, most economists—85 of them—think the fed funds rate will still be at 3.75% to 4.00% or even higher. Nobody has a clear view on exactly when that rate will finally drop. What’s obvious is that the Fed is in no mood to make a move unless something dramatic happens, and so far, nothing has.

While buying Bitcoin directly is one option, some prefer investing in Bitcoin mining stocks like MARA for several practical reasons, as explained by an analyst. Why Mining Stocks? Unlike holding Bitcoin, which requires managing private keys and digital wallets, mining stocks are traded like regular company shares on the stock market. This makes them easier for traditional investors to access. Plus, mining stocks come with fewer regulatory concerns compared to direct crypto investing and can even fit into retirement accounts. About Mara Holdings Founded in Florida in 2010, the company originally operated under the name Marathon Patent Group. It switched to Bitcoin mining in 2021 and later rebranded as Mara Holdings in 2024. Today, it’s one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, known for using renewable energy and advanced cooling systems to run its operations. As of early 2025, Mara’s mining power reached over 54 exahashes per second — meaning its machines can make over 54 quintillion guesses per second while mining Bitcoin. In simple terms, it’s one of the fastest and most powerful mining setups out there. A Unique Bitcoin Strategy In mid-2024, MARA announced a full “HODL” strategy, deciding not to sell any of its mined Bitcoin to cover expenses. Instead, it started aggressively buying more Bitcoin from the market. To support this plan, MARA launched several stock offerings, including a massive $2 billion stock sale in March 2025. Thanks to this strategy, Mara has built up a huge Bitcoin reserve. In the first three months of 2025 alone, it mined 2,286 BTC, increasing its total holdings to over 48,100 BTC — the second-highest stash among public companies after Michael Saylor’s firm. The Bigger Picture Mara’s decision to hold onto its Bitcoin rather than sell it could significantly increase the company’s value, especially as Bitcoin’s price rises. Many other mining firms are now following a similar strategy, showing growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

They went too far,” he said in a brief update. That line landed after nearly a week of public shots between the two men that started with Elon claiming Trump appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein files and ended with threats from the White House. The comments Elon referred to were two deleted posts from earlier that week. In the first, he claimed Trump was part of the sealed Epstein documents. In the second, he wrote that Trump wouldn’t have a shot at re-election if not for his support. Both posts were taken down, replaced with standard error pages on X that now read: “Hmm…this page doesn’t exist. Try searching for something else.” Elon didn’t say why he deleted the posts. But the consequences were instant. Trump responds with warning over Democrat support The fallout hit fast. On Thursday, Elon replied “yes” to a post that called for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance. That post was also deleted. As of Saturday, nothing remained from Elon’s week-long rant but the regret post. In a phone interview with NBC News, Donald Trump threatened Elon with consequences if he chooses to back Democrats in upcoming races. “If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that,” Trump told Kristen Welker. “He’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,” he added. He didn’t explain what those consequences would be. Trump also said he’s done with Elon. “I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened,” Trump said. “I gave him breaks in my first administration and saved his life in my first administration.” He added, “I have no intention of speaking to him.” When asked if the relationship was over, Trump said, “I would assume so.” He also accused Elon of being “disrespectful to the office of the president.” JD vance calls Musk ’emotional’ during podcast On Friday, JD Vance responded to Elon’s attacks during an interview on the This Past Weekend podcast with comedian Theo Von. “I think Elon’s making a huge mistake,” Vance said, attempting to cool tensions by describing Elon as “an emotional guy” who got frustrated. The tone was more forgiving, but the message was clear: Elon went too far. Less than two weeks earlier, Trump and Elon had publicly praised each other. Elon had just finished leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a Trump-created agency focused on cutting federal spending. Their partnership was strong enough to draw attention from investors tracking Elon’s businesses. Now, that alliance looks completely dead. According to CNBC, the fight escalated after Elon opposed Trump’s new legislative effort, widely known as the “big, beautiful bill.” Elon criticized the bill for ignoring policies he supported. The White House hit back through Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary. “This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,” she told CNN. The week of chaos triggered speculation about how the feud could affect Elon’s companies, especially Tesla and SpaceX, both of which benefitted from Trump’s first term. Elon’s role in the government helped shape federal policy around tech and budgeting. With that gone and public attacks stacking up, investors are watching closely.

Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $23.01 level by 2027 and above $45.41 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a corrective phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are losing value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained resistance around $8.66, negative sentiment took over the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.90, while the average price is expected to be around $9.08. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.8 and $7.5; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $47.22 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price. Recent news/opinions on Uniswap Network Uniswap Labs announced a major benefit with its newly launched UniswapX: users will no longer pay gas fees for failed transactions.

After launching its first digital debt product on Ethereum, Guggenheim Treasury Services is moving it to the XRP Ledger in partnership with Ripple. With the new move, the digital commercial paper product, fully collateralized by US Treasury bonds, will now be offered on Ripple’s public blockchain, the XRP Ledger. According to RippleX Senior Vice President Markus Infanger, Ripple will invest $10 million in the fixed-income asset. Additionally, Ripple is evaluating the possibility of using this product in payments and plans to make it available for purchase with the stablecoin developed by the company. Related News: BREAKING: GameStop Announces Another Bitcoin Purchase - Here's the Earnings Report The digital debt product, which launched on the Ethereum blockchain last September, has since raised over $280 million in issuance volume. Guggenheim is cementing its place among the companies tokenizing real-world assets, following in the footsteps of giants like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock. Similarly, billionaire investor Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is also in talks with regulators to tokenize its own shares. Excluding stablecoins, the XRP Ledger currently accounts for a small portion of the $23.4 billion global tokenized asset market, with around $117 million in assets tokenized. However, the XRP Ledger aims to grow its role in this space with projects such as connecting real estate titles directly to the blockchain. *This is not investment advice.

The deal will remove some restrictions on China’s rare earth exports and unwind a few recent U.S. export bans, but offers no actual resolution to the larger fight that’s been dragging both economies through hell. The meeting, which wrapped around midnight, was the first real movement since the failed Geneva agreement last month. That earlier deal got trashed after China refused to lift bans on critical minerals. In response, the Trump administration retaliated with new export controls, halting U.S. shipments of chip software, airplane equipment, and advanced chemicals. Rare earths back in play as export licenses resume U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that the new agreement puts “meat on the bones” of the Geneva talks. He said the framework clears a path for removing export restrictions “in a balanced way,” including on China’s rare earth magnets and minerals, but didn’t spell out what the U.S. will drop in return. “We have reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus and the call between the two presidents,” Howard said. “And if that is approved, we will then implement the framework.” China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang confirmed the same deal had been reached “in principle,” and said it would now go back to the leaders of both countries for review. So far, there’s no written agreement—just mutual paperwork to present to President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. Signs of a policy shift started to show almost immediately. Several Shenzhen-listed companies, including JL MAG Rare-Earth, Innuovo Technology, and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan, announced they had received fresh export licenses from Chinese authorities. Tariff hikes paused, but nothing is actually solved This deal doesn’t erase the deeper problem. The U.S. still sees China’s economic model as state-controlled and unfair. Trump’s team has never backed off its claim that Beijing manipulates trade using subsidies and closed-door rules. On the other hand, China continues to argue that Washington’s use of unilateral tariffs is illegal and reckless. No one gave up ground on that front. The so-called “framework” is just a stopgap to avoid more damage while they stall for time. That stall is short. August 10 is now the deadline for a bigger agreement. If nothing happens, tariff rates will explode again. The U.S. will jump from about 30% to 145%, and China will spike from 10% to 125%. It’s the same game of chicken all over again. The impact is already visible. China’s exports to the U.S. fell by 34.5% in May, the sharpest drop since COVID lockdowns. The numbers came straight from Chinese customs on Monday. Meanwhile, U.S. inflation hasn’t surged yet, but business confidence is falling and the dollar is getting weaker. Even the World Bank is waving a red flag. On Tuesday, it lowered its global growth outlook for 2025 by 0.4 percentage points, now expecting just 2.3%. It warned that higher tariffs and constant trade tension are dragging down nearly every major economy. Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, visited Beijing this week and said the current trade war could wreck more than just bilateral relations. “A resolution to the trade war may require policy adjustments from all countries to treat financial imbalances or otherwise greatly risk mutual economic damage,” she said. Other countries and industries are trying to put pressure on Trump to avoid another trade spike. The governments of Mexico, Japan, Canada, the European Union, and a long list of airlines and aerospace companies submitted formal complaints to the administration asking them not to add national security tariffs on commercial aircraft parts. No response yet from the White House. Still, Trump has no intention of backing off for now. Right after the framework deal was announced, a U.S. appeals court gave him the green light to keep one of his most aggressive tariffs—the 34% “reciprocal” duty—active while a lower court ruling that tried to kill it gets reviewed. That decision lets Trump hang on to one of his key trade weapons against China, even though it’s currently suspended. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Buying Bitcoin Cash with a credit card shouldn’t feel like solving a puzzle, here’s what actually works without the sky-high fees. Table of Contents Quick facts: Bitcoin Cash purchase options Why Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin? Real talk: Credit card vs. debit card for crypto Step-by-step: How to buy Bitcoin Cash The fee game: What users are really paying Payment methods that actually work Storage: Where to keep Bitcoin Cash Global access: Where this works Security without the paranoia Trading vs. holding What actually matters Bottom line Finding the best exchange to buy BCH with a credit card shouldn’t be this hard. Most platforms either charge crazy fees or make people jump through hoops just to buy Bitcoin Cash. After spending months testing different ways to purchase Bitcoin Cash, here’s what actually works. Quick facts: Bitcoin Cash purchase options Most people want to buy Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) fast without getting scammed on fees. Here are the only platforms worth considering if traders want to buy Bitcoin Cash instantly with a credit or debit card: Platform Fees Speed Card Types Why Use It ChicksX 0.5% Under 2 mins Visa, Mastercard Lowest fees anywhere Binance 2.8% + spread 5-10 mins Most cards High liquidity Coinbase 3.99% 1-3 mins All major Beginner friendly Kraken 3.75% + fees 10-15 mins Limited Good security CEX.io 3.5% + $2.99 5-30 mins Visa, Mastercard Multiple countries ChicksX wins by a mile with 0.5% fees. That’s less than what most companies charge for basic credit card processing. Everyone else is charging 3-4% which adds up fast when you’re trying to buy BCH regularly. Why Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin? Bitcoin Cash came from a hard fork in 2017 when Bitcoin got too slow and expensive. The current market price reflects what people actually want to use for payments. Key differences: Bitcoin Cash transactions cost pennies vs dollars for Bitcoin Faster confirmation times Better for actually spending money Current circulating supply around 19.6 million coins Total supply capped at 21 million like bitcoin The market cap shows Bitcoin Cash isn’t going anywhere. Companies that accept crypto for payments often prefer Bitcoin Cash because transactions don’t cost a fortune. Real talk: Credit card vs. debit card for crypto Banks often treats crypto purchases differently: Credit cards often: Charge cash advance fees Have higher interest rates Block crypto purchases randomly Offer better fraud protection Debit cards usually: Have lower fees Process faster Get blocked less often Take money directly from the bank account Using a debit card instantly often works better for buying Bitcoin Cash. Users need to just make sure their bank doesn’t block crypto transactions, some still do in 2025. Step-by-step: How to buy Bitcoin Cash The process varies between platforms, but here’s what works on most exchanges: Pick a platform – Compare fees first Sign up – Basic registration takes minutes Add payment method – Enter card details securely Verify account – Upload ID for larger purchases Buy Bitcoin Cash – Enter amount in USD, EUR, or other fiat currency Move to wallet – Don’t leave large amounts on exchanges Some platforms let users buy cryptocurrency without full verification for small amounts. This speeds things up but usually has lower limits. You might also like: Bitcoin Cash soars 30% to lead top coins amid market bounce The fee game: What users are really paying Here’s where most people get burned. Exchanges advertise low fees but hide costs in spreads and extra charges: Visible fees: What they show upfront (usually 1-4%) Hidden costs: Marked-up prices, conversion fees, withdrawal charges Card processing: Sometimes treated as cash advances Example: A trader wants to buy $1000 worth of Bitcoin Cash ChicksX: $5 in fees (0.5%) Coinbase: $39.90 + spread (4%+) Others: $30-50+ in total costs The math is simple: lower fees mean more Bitcoin Cash in the wallet. Payment methods that actually work Beyond credit or debit card purchases, these payment options can save money: Bank transfer: Cheapest but slower (1-3 days) PayPal: Available on limited platforms Apple Pay/Google Pay: Mobile convenience Wire transfer: For large purchases over $10,000 Most crypto veterans use bank transfers for big purchases and cards for quick buys. The convenience of instant purchases often justifies slightly higher card fees. Storage: Where to keep Bitcoin Cash After buying Bitcoin Cash, storage matters more than most realize: Exchange wallets: Easy but risky for large amounts Mobile wallets: Good for spending Bitcoin Cash daily Hardware wallets: Best security for long-term holding Desktop software: Balance of convenience and security Investors should start with small amounts on exchanges while learning. As their crypto assets grow, they can move them to wallets they control. Global access: Where this works Availability depends on where users live: North America: Most exchanges work, strict regulations Europe: Good options, can often use euros directly Asia: Varies by country, some restrictions Other regions: Growing but limited choices Some countries have better local options. Investors must research what works in their region before starting their crypto journey. You might also like: Bitcoin Cash price prediction: is it time for BCH to shine? Security without the paranoia Crypto security doesn’t have to be complicated: Account security: Use unique passwords Turn on two-factor authentication Verify website URLs before entering card details Transaction security: Start with small test purchases Double-check wallet addresses Keep records for taxes Most reputable exchanges have insurance and cold storage. The bigger risk is usually user error, not platform failure. Trading vs. holding Once users own Bitcoin Cash, they can decide what they’re doing with it: Hold long-term: Focus on secure storage and don’t stress about daily price movements. Active trading: Keep funds on exchanges, watch price charts, trade against other cryptocurrencies. Regular use: Keep some in mobile wallets for spending. Many people do a mix, it’s best to hold most Bitcoin Cash long-term but keep some available for trading or spending. What actually matters Fees kill returns : Paying 4% in fees means Bitcoin Cash needs to go up 4% just to break even. That’s why many users have switched to ChicksX, their 0.5% fee is unbeatable. Verification isn’t scary : Most platforms verify accounts in minutes, not days. Don’t overthink the current price : Trying to time markets is harder than it looks. Regular small purchases work better than waiting for the “perfect” moment. Start small and learn : Buy $50-100 worth first to understand the process before committing serious money. Every platform works differently. The Bitcoin Cash community focuses on real-world use cases, which sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies that are purely speculative. Companies actually accept it for payments, making it useful beyond just investment. Bottom line Most exchanges overcomplicate things and overcharge fees. It’s always best to find a platform with low costs, verify the account once, and start buying Bitcoin Cash regularly. The current market shows Bitcoin Cash has staying power. With major companies accepting it and low transaction costs, it serves the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash better than Bitcoin itself. But investors shouldn’t fall for platforms charging 4%+ fees when better options exist.

On Tuesday, Tate took to X (formerly Twitter) to flex a massive +138.5% return on an ETH long position using 25x leverage on Hyperliquid, a rising decentralized perpetuals exchange ( DEX ). His post included a Hyperliquid-branded trade screenshot and a referral link, an apparent attempt to capitalize on the buzz and drive affiliate signups. Andrew Tate’s now deleted tweet. Source: X But Tate may have underestimated the transparency of on-chain platforms. While centralized exchanges (CEXes) can obscure account identities, DEX trades are fully public, tied to wallet addresses. Crypto sleuths quickly traced the wallet behind his Hyperliquid trade, exposing a much less glamorous truth. According to data from portfolio tracker Hyperdash, the wallet currently shows a cumulative PnL of -$597,302.89, reflecting total losses across all past trades . In other words, Tate has burned through nearly $600K on Hyperliquid since he began trading there. Andrew Tate’s wallet. Source: HyperDash Tate is currently up 138% on ETH long In contrast, his flexed ETH long is a currently open position with $22,000 in unrealized profit, meaning this single trade is indeed up +138%, but the overall account is still deep in the red. The reaction was swift. Users shared screenshots of the findings across X and crypto forums. Within hours, Tate’s original post had mysteriously vanished. When pressed about the losses, Tate replied: “I’ll make it all back with one trade.” https://twitter.com/Cobratate/status/1932636022069674259 The episode highlights a key dynamic of modern DeFi: clout-chasing posts can backfire in a fully transparent ecosystem. On Hyperliquid and similar platforms, wallet histories are an open book, allowing the community to verify whether public wins match private records. Whether Tate can indeed trade his way back to green remains to be seen. For now, the blockchain remembers.
