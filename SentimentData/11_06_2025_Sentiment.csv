MNT and GT underperformed due to inflation risk and weak bullish momentum. Liquidity, supply metrics, and sentiment drove divergence in exchange token returns. A sharp divergence has emerged in the exchange token sector over the past two months, highlighting a market that is increasingly rewarding utility and sound tokenomics while punishing perceived risks. An analysis of five prominent exchange tokens shows that while Binance Coin (BNB), Bitget Token (BGB), and OKX’s OKB posted respectable gains, Bybit’s Mantle (MNT) and GateToken (GT) trailed with significant losses.

As Arbitrum Spikes and Theta Taps AI Expansion,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-most-potential-crypto-of-2025-as-arbitrum-spikes-and-theta-taps-ai-expansion/,"The crypto world in 2025 is no longer dominated by hype alone—utility and real-world use cases are now setting the pace. With thousands of tokens competing for attention, only a select few are being recognized as the most potential crypto contenders. These aren’t just speculative assets—they are solving actual problems in industries like finance, data infrastructure, and digital ownership. Among the projects gaining traction, Qubetics has entered the spotlight for its bold push into real world asset tokenization. Meanwhile, heavyweights like Arbitrum and Theta are also innovating in ways that reinforce their positions among the most potential crypto networks to watch this year. For participants and developers alike, recognizing the most potential crypto early can define long-term success. In 2025, the projects combining tangible utility with scalable ecosystems are likely to lead the next wave. Qubetics ($TICS) Is Redefining the RWA Narrative—The Countdown Is On Qubetics isn’t just riding the tokenization wave—it’s shaping it. The protocol is launching a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that simplifies access for enterprises, entrepreneurs, and professionals. This isn’t just another DeFi platform; it’s a robust, user-friendly gateway to tokenize assets ranging from real estate to intellectual property. At the heart of Qubetics’ design is a massive shift in tokenomics. By slashing its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, the protocol has introduced scarcity from the start. The public sale allocation has increased to 38.55%, placing power directly in the hands of its user base. This move toward decentralization comes with significant implications for governance and long-term value. As of June 2025: Presale Stage: 37th Tokens Sold: 515 million+ Holders: 27,800+ Funds Raised: $17.9 million+ Current Price: $0.3370 Next Price Jump: $0.40 (20% hike) Recent community updates hint at a Tier 1 CEX listing by Q3 and a mainnet rollout by early Q4. Analysts from BlockForge Labs highlight $TICS among the most potential crypto assets of the year, citing its community-led model, aggressive burn mechanism, and enterprise-focused features. What truly sets Qubetics apart is its solution-driven framework. Many of its predecessors failed to simplify tokenization for real-world use cases. In contrast, Qubetics enables asset-backed digital ownership, wrapped in a legally compliant and cross-chain compatible system. In a digital era where tangible value is becoming harder to secure, Qubetics makes RWA tokenization accessible—and that’s not just innovation, it’s necessity. Investment Scenario: What a $10,000 Entry Looks Like in Qubetics’ Final Presale Stage Let’s say you’re entering Qubetics with a $10,000 buy-in during stage 37 at the current price of $0.3370. That gets you approximately 29,672 $TICS tokens before the listing price increases to $0.40. With only 10 million tokens left and a fast-closing window, timing is critical. At listing, those tokens will be worth $11,869, giving you a solid 18.7% gain right out of the gate. Looking further ahead, if $TICS reaches $5, that same $10K entry would turn into $148,360—a 1,383% return fueled by Qubetics’ unique tokenomics, reduced supply model (now just 1.36 billion total tokens), and increased community control through its 38.55% public allocation. If the token surges to $10 in the next bull run, your $10,000 becomes $296,720—a 2,867% ROI. For anyone looking to make a strategic move with limited capital, this might be the single strongest presale opportunity currently live in 2025. Arbitrum (ARB) Soars 7.47% in 24 Hours, Volume Spikes Over 84% Arbitrum (ARB), currently ranked #50 among cryptocurrencies, surged 7.47% in the last 24 hours to trade at $0.3645, pushing its market cap to $1.77 billion—up 7.44% on the day. Trading volume skyrocketed 84.05% to $169.52 million, giving it a high 9.56% volume-to-market cap ratio. With a circulating supply of 4.86 billion ARB out of a 10 billion total supply, the project shows significant market activity despite being 84.79% below its all-time high of $2.40 recorded in January 2024. Arbitrum, which has a profile score of 66% and UCID 11841, is supported by verified contracts (0x912C…9E6548), explorers like arbiscan.io, and various wallets. Notably, ARB is up 48.79% from its all-time low of $0.245, reached just two months ago in April 2025. Theta Network (THETA) Climbs 6.21% in Daily Rally, Market Cap Hits $789M Theta Network (THETA), ranked #88 in the global crypto market, surged 6.21% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7896, bringing its market cap to $789.63 million with a matching fully diluted valuation. The 24-hour trading volume rose 41.76% to $23.37 million, resulting in a 2.97% volume-to-market cap ratio. With its entire 1 billion THETA supply already in circulation, the token maintains a profile score of 72% and is backed by explorers like explorer.thetatoken.org, multiple wallets, and a UCID of 2416. Despite trading 95.03% below its all-time high of $15.90 from April 2021, THETA has seen a remarkable 1,886.99% gain since its all-time low of $0.03977 in March 2020. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: The Future is Tangible Real World Asset Tokenization is becoming more than a buzzword. It is transforming how value is represented, owned, and traded across the digital economy. Qubetics is at the forefront of this shift, bringing practicality to a concept that once seemed too complex for mainstream adoption. Key components of Qubetics’ RWA Marketplace: Tokenization Simplicity : Businesses can tokenize assets in minutes using an intuitive UI. Legal Framework : Built-in compliance tools for KYC/AML and regional regulation adherence. Interoperability : Supports Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Revenue Distribution : Token holders earn from marketplace fees and asset-based revenues. Enterprise Use Cases : Real estate, patents, music rights, logistics, and supply chain assets. This model provides an entry point into Web3 for those traditionally excluded due to complexity or legal constraints. With the crypto presale nearing its final moments, Qubetics stands as a living example of the most potential crypto transforming digital finance. Conclusion: Why Timing and Utility Matter More Than Hype in 2025 The surge in crypto adoption is no longer driven by promises—it’s driven by solutions. Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Theta each offer a unique approach to solving real-world problems using blockchain. But among them, Qubetics commands immediate attention. With scarcity building, functionality maturing, and a crypto presale window rapidly closing, the opportunity is real. For those tracking the most potential crypto projects in 2025, this is not the time to stay passive. Qubetics represents a rare alignment of innovation, timing, and traction—making it a standout among the most potential crypto players right now. As the final crypto presale stage winds down, it could become one of the most potential crypto success stories of this market cycle.

Per a report from Forbes Russia , the ministry says its proposal is currently undergoing interdepartmental review. However, if the plans are adopted as-is, Russian law agencies and courts will be given the power to seize crypto from illegal miners. Russia: Miners May Be Fined for Flaunting Bans Under the new proposal, Russian judges will also be able to punish individuals engaging in illegal mining. Courts will be able to hand out fines worth between 100,000 to 200,000 rubles ($1,272 to $2,544). Maksut Shadayev, the Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, speaking at the Federation Council earlier this year. (Source: Federation Council/VK/Screenshot) Forbes Russia says it has seen the ministry’s proposal. It says Moscow also wants to fine and confiscate crypto from any individual found illegally participating in a mining pool. Harsher fines still lie in store for solo entrepreneurs and officials. This group will have to pay between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($2,544 to $5088) if convicted. Authorities will also gain the power to take coins from industrial miners who flaunt crypto mining rules. The new rules will let courts impose a fine of 1 million ($12,728) to 2 million rubles ($25,456) on corporations involved in illegal mining. The ministry wants to amend the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses, seeking to effectively make illegal mining a criminal offense. BTC hashrate distribution amongst the largest known mining pools over the past four days. (Source: Blockchain.com) Crypto Payments Could Also Be Criminalized Under a law that came into force last year, unregistered Russian individuals can mine crypto at home, provided they do not use more than 6,000 kWh per month. However, in some 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions, mining restrictions apply. The law also states that people with unexpunged convictions for economic crimes, or those convicted of extremist or terrorist crimes, cannot mine crypto. The law also bans certain electricity and grid management firms from mining crypto. Additionally, the ministry plans to punish individuals and firms for making settlements in crypto in Russia outside the Central Bank-run crypto sandbox. The ministry’s proposals include plans to fine people and firms who use crypto as a payment tool up to 1 million rubles ($12,728). The Central Bank, however, appears to think that the threat of confiscating coins from people who seek to do business in crypto will be a bigger deterrent. Andrey Medvedev, the bank’s Legal Department lead, told attendees at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum last month: “The key thing is that the [crypto] illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. And this will be the most painful thing.” Russia and China say the Pentagon's proposed missile-defense shield will be destabilizing.

The commission also decided to postpone a proposed year-round ban on mining in the Zabaikalsky Krai and Buryatia regions.

The move comes after weeks of range-bound price action, and while the breakout attempt has gained attention, traders are now watching closely for confirmation through a decisive push above the next resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? So far, ETH has held up well despite broader market volatility. With buyers back in control, the focus has shifted to whether Ethereum can break through the upper boundary of its current range and begin a sustained move higher. Without follow-through, price risks slipping back into consolidation, frustrating bullish positioning. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is now pushing into weekly range highs, specifically a zone defined by a cluster of upper shadows and the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA). This region has repeatedly acted as resistance, rejecting previous rally attempts. Ethereum Bulls Eye Breakout Confirmation Ethereum is at a critical juncture as bulls push price toward the $2,800 resistance — a level that must be decisively cleared to confirm a breakout and transition into a full bullish phase. After a sharp rebound from April’s low, where ETH traded near $1,400, the asset has surged more than 90%, reclaiming key moving averages and breaking through previous short-term resistance levels. Momentum is clearly building, but Ethereum now faces its most important test. The $2,800 zone marks the top of the current range and coincides with multiple technical barriers. Cheds highlighted that ETH is now trading into weekly range highs, where a cluster of upper shadows has repeatedly rejected price. This region also aligns with the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA), reinforcing it as a major zone of resistance. According to Cheds, the bear thesis fails if ETH can flip $2,750 into support — a level that would likely signal trend reversal and sustained upside. However, macro risks remain. US Treasury yields continue to climb, reflecting concerns over inflation and tighter financial conditions. Rising yields often put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by pulling liquidity out of speculative markets. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s structure remains strong. As long as bulls maintain pressure and defend higher lows, the path toward reclaiming $3,000 becomes more probable. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger increased participation, both from technical traders and investors sidelined by recent volatility. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but the momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June ETH Reaches Key Resistance Zone After Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $2,688 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong breakout from a multi-day ascending triangle structure. The move was backed by rising volume and a clean reclaim of all major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($2,558), 100 SMA ($2,571), and 200 SMA ($2,535) — which now act as support beneath price. ETH has pushed directly into a key resistance zone between $2,690 and $2,735, highlighted by several previous rejection wicks. This area has acted as a supply zone since mid-May, capping every breakout attempt and leading to swift pullbacks. The current test marks Ethereum’s fifth attempt to break above this level in recent weeks, which increases the odds of a potential breakout, especially if bulls maintain momentum and volume remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, if ETH fails to clear this zone, a pullback toward the 200 SMA or the $2,600 level is likely, especially if volume tapers off. The structure remains bullish in the short term, with higher lows forming and buying pressure increasing. A confirmed 4H close above $2,735 would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger a push toward $2,900–$3,000. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but bulls are clearly pressing on the door.

In a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, Saylor argued that Chanos fundamentally misunderstands Strategy’s business model, calling the arbitrage thesis “misguided.” Chanos, known for shorting companies he deems overvalued, recently suggested investors should bet against bet against Srategy due to its substantial premium over the firm’s Bitcoin-adjusted book value. That premium, which exceeded 200% at one point in 2024, has been a focal point for skeptics who view Strategy as a glorified Bitcoin holding company. But Saylor pushed back. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” he said. “We’re actually the largest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world.” Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison Saylor emphasized that unlike Bitcoin trusts or closed-end funds, Strategy retains the flexibility to actively manage capital by issuing new financial instruments and leveraging its balance sheet. “Trusts can’t leverage Bitcoin. They can’t issue preferred shares, they can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can,” Saylor asserted. “What [Chanos] still doesn’t understand is that we are not a holding company or a closed-end trust — we are an operating company.” Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently pivoted its capital-raising strategy. Rather than issuing convertible bonds or diluting shareholders through common stock sales, the firm has embraced preferred stock instruments to finance its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. This includes the newly launched STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Perpetual Stride) preferred shares — a trio of high-yield offerings that collectively raised nearly $1 billion last week. Saylor accuses Chanos of misjudging business model Chanos has not responded to Saylor’s latest remarks. But Saylor was unsparing in his critique of the hedge fund manager’s valuation approach. Saylor said Chanos is valuing the business, generating $8.4 billion of shareholder value at zero, and he is hoping the equity will somehow trade to NAV. He continued to say that Chanos is not paying attention to if Strategy can issue preferred shares that yield 10% and invest that in Bitcoin, which has been going up by 57% for the past four and a half years. Saylor noted that the company is capturing the 47% arbitrage, effectively risk-free for their common stock shareholders. As of Tuesday, Strategy held approximately 582,000 Bitcoin — valued at about $63 billion — making it the largest corporate holder of the asset globally. The company has made over 70 Bitcoin purchase announcements since mid-2020 when Saylor initiated the strategy of using corporate funds to buy the digital currency. Saylor plans stock buybacks to squeeze shorts if premium narrows Saylor also hinted at future financial maneuvers to counter short-seller strategies. Should the premium on Strategy’s stock narrow too much, the firm could issue more preferred shares and use the proceeds to repurchase common shares, further tightening supply and squeezing shorts. “If the stock trades at a weak premium, we’re just going to sell the preferred,” he said. “And if the stock rallies up, he’s going to get liquidated and wiped out.” While the war of words between Chanos and Saylor may intensify, it reflects a broader debate over how to value a Bitcoin-centric operating company in a market still grappling with crypto’s integration into traditional finance. For now, Saylor remains unapologetically bullish — on Bitcoin and Strategy’s ability to outperform critics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Support near the 50-day and 100-day EMAs may lead to a future price surge. Positive futures market indicators suggest growing institutional commitment to XRP. Despite market fluctuations, XRP remains stable with strong support around it. As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.27 , and it has gone up by 0.85% during the past 24 hours. The price increased strongly at the start of March but soon fell again after passing through some important moving averages. XRP Derivatives Market Shows Strong Bullish Signals In the derivatives market, XRP shows signs that add strength to the idea of a bullish trend. According to CoinGlass, the daily trading volume has gone up to $5.27 billion by 26.64%, and open interest rose by 5.25% to $4.27 billion. Such high numbers indicate countries are becoming more interested and are investing for the long term.

Each is gaining momentum for different reasons: Unstaked is leveraging a $1 million giveaway to drive presale growth, Aave is rolling out a major DeFi infrastructure update, and HYPE is testing bullish resistance levels near $40. In a market hungry for clarity and purpose, these three are giving investors plenty to consider. While many search for the best crypto to buy right now, the rising winners seem to combine utility, community alignment, and strong fundamentals. Unstaked leads the way with its unique AI-driven platform and a no-insider-allocation presale. Aave reaffirms its legacy with a sophisticated overhaul to risk management. HYPE, on the other hand, shows that even high-volatility assets can deliver when supported by data and demand. Aave Umbrella Update Overhauls Risk and Rewards The upcoming Aave (AAVE) updates, part of the Umbrella upgrade, are set to reshape the protocol’s risk management framework. Aave is transitioning from locking AAVE and LP tokens to allowing aToken based contributions, enabling users to directly stake assets like aUSDC and aUSDT in exchange for variable yields. More importantly, slashing events will now be triggered automatically based on smart contract data, removing the need for governance votes in most risk events. The update also introduces StakeTokens, which represent a user’s stake in the safety module. These tokens carry slashing risk tied to actual pool deficits, but are managed via a more transparent and decentralized system. Aave is also reducing emissions of AAVE rewards while continuing strategic buybacks, aiming for long-term sustainability. The update arrives at a crucial time for Aave, as competition among DeFi protocols intensifies. Investors monitoring Aave updates are particularly encouraged by the improved capital efficiency and real-time risk response built into this release. For many, it adds further weight to AAVE’s reputation as the best crypto to buy right now among large-cap DeFi assets. HYPE Builds Momentum Despite Whale Exit Despite recent volatility, Hyperliquid (HYPE) remains a strong project in the perpetuals space. After a dramatic $1 million profit-taking move by high-profile trader James Wynn, HYPE has steadied above the $31 level and is now targeting a move toward $40. Wynn entered at an average price of $24.84 and exited near $32.72, marking a 31.9% return on a leveraged trade. While his exit briefly shook confidence, fundamentals behind the project remain strong. Hyperliquid’s May metrics point to increasing traction: TVL rose 108% to $1.46 billion, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume reached a record-breaking $248.3 billion. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows an early bullish crossover, and the price is consolidating just under a resistance zone at $35. If that level breaks, the HYPE coin target of $40 may be in play. For short-term traders and high-risk speculators, HYPE offers volatility, volume, and narrative alignment. However, even conservative investors are now watching closely, as Hyperliquid’s performance makes it a surprise opportunity for the best crypto to buy right now, particularly for those seeking explosive upside potential in DeFi-native environments. Unstaked: AI, Rewards, and the Road to $10M While legacy DeFi players grow and high-octane trades unfold, Unstaked is capturing sustained attention with its AI-powered community platform and unique token model. Currently in Stage 19 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $9.4 million, with tokens priced at $0.011065. The projected launch price is $0.1819, representing a potential 28x return for early buyers. At the heart of the project is a Proof of Intelligence model, where users earn rewards based on contributions, not simply for holding. Unlike many presales, Unstaked features no insider allocations, which fosters trust and fairness within the community. Its AI tools, community voting system, and merit-based incentives combine to form a truly decentralized product vision. To further amplify interest, Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway, awarding 20 winners $50,000 in $UNSD tokens each. Entry requires a minimum $100 purchase and completion of a few social tasks, creating a highly engaged and invested early user base. Among the many presales in the market, Unstaked stands out for its clarity of purpose and execution. It’s not just another AI token or governance play, it’s a live testbed for community-driven crypto development. For investors evaluating the best crypto to buy right now, Unstaked is fast becoming the presale to beat. What Informed Investors Are Watching in 2025 The crypto market in 2025 is rewarding substance, not just speculation. As the latest Aave (AAVE) updates streamline DeFi safety nets, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) coin target bulls push toward $40, Unstaked’s strong community, transparent model, and AI-powered platform are pushing it to the top of presale watchlists. Unstaked’s $1 million campaign, combined with no insider advantages and a performance-based reward system, offers a refreshing model for future crypto launches. Whether you’re a DeFi veteran or new to the space, now is a rare window where development, incentives, and investor alignment are syncing up. For those searching for the best crypto to buy right now, the answer may lie not in the familiar names of old cycles, but in those quietly building the next one.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 791,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on gold’s price action, noting that the precious metal’s chart is the “most important chart to watch” this week. According to the trader, gold appears to have printed a bearish lower high setup on the six-hour chart, suggesting that the precious metal could fall to as low as $3,200 in the near term. “As long as Gold stays sub-$3,365, we’re likely going to see a sharp fall in the coming one to two weeks of anything between 4-10%, resulting into a sudden macroeconomic shift.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Van de Poppe believes that falling gold prices will be beneficial for altcoins, as it suggests an increased appetite for risk among investors. “At the end of [last] week, a sudden [gold] correction took place, which might result in the confirmation of a short-term downtrend. This is vital, as that would attract more investors towards Altcoins. Why? It would enable more investors to be jumping into risk-on assets, when gold implies that it continues to fall. This means –> money/liquidity flows from risk-off assets towards risk-on assets, and the best asset class remains to be crypto.” But the trader warns that altcoins will likely see lower levels if gold shatters $3,365. “If it does break above that crucial level, the theory is invalidated, and we’re likely open for printing new highs, which then means that we’re printing new lows on altcoins. For me, this is crucial, as a correction in Gold and rally in the CNH (offshore Chinese renminbi) implies that we’re going to be seeing more interest flowing into crypto after that.” At time of writing, gold is trading for $3,324, up more than 60% in the last 18 months.

This comes as the SEC has requested issuers that are launching the Solana ETFs to submit their updated filings especially for the S-1 form within a week potentially signaling approvals. Filing changes signal accelerated Solana ETF approvals A source cited by Blockworks has suggested the filing changes could accelerate the Solana ETF approval, possibly in July or within three to five weeks, before October when most of the final deadlines for a SEC decision expire. According to two sources that spoke with Blockworks, the SEC will provide comments the S-1 forms within a space of 30 days of submission. The agency reportedly solicited for explanations from companies on how investors will get their money back in crypto. It’s also pushing to know if companies plan to include staking, which means earning rewards by helping run the Solana network. The SEC is also said to be open to allowing staking as part of these products. “If staking gets approved, it changes the game” said one enthusiast identified as Crypto Racoon on X platform.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of approval in 2025 are at 90%, which matches their forecast for LitecoinETF approval. “We think the SEC may now focus on handling 19b-4 filings for Solana and staking ETFs earlier than planned.” Bloomberg analysts. Seyffart indicated this week that SEC may prioritize reviewing 19b-4 filings for Solana and bet ETFs sooner than expected, adding that the issuers and industry players have likely been working with SEC together with its crypto taskforce to finalize the details. He also added that Solana and XRP already have futures-based ETFs, which usually makes it easier for the SEC to give a not to spot ETFs. Last month the regulator delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF indicating that it had not “reached any conclusions” on the19b-4 filing to list the proposed ETF. The delay was viewed as procedural rather than rejection. Grayscale wants to convert its SOL Trust into a spot ETF, reflecting the path it used to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF funds. The firm’s filing was delayed on May 13, while Franklin Templeton’s proposal was delayed on April 30, according to SEC. In the meantime, filings by Fidelity and VanEck were postponed on May 19. After the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum ETF in May this year, attention has now turned to other top digital assets like Solana. News of the development sent SOL 4% up, bringing its price close to $165 per trading view data.

He warns that increased oversight could stifle innovation and weaken the US’s competitive edge against China. Speaking to Bloomberg News on Tuesday, Schmidt—who also oversees security at Amazon Web Services (AWS)—cautioned against government overreach in the rapidly evolving AI sector. He said the tension with regulation of any kind is that it tends to retard progress. Schmidt continued to say their approach is to let the industry define appropriate standards—guided primarily by customer needs and demands. Tech leaders push back as Washington moves to rein In AI development Schmidt’s remarks echo those made last month by Microsoft, OpenAI, AMD, and CoreWeave executives during a congressional hearing. The tech leaders argued that government regulation could hinder their ability to compete globally—especially with China, which has made AI development a national priority. Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, emphasized the necessity of “sensible regulation that doesn’t slow us down,” signaling a widening fissure between innovation and governing within the tech world. The fight over AI regulation is heating up on Capitol Hill. A controversy erupted when the House tucked language into President Donald Trump’s broad tax package that would prevent states from going their own way to enforce new AI rules. The provision prompted bipartisan pushback and focused attention on a growing worry that there are no controls on the development of AI. A vocal advocate for unfettered AI growth, Trump has taken steps to dismantle constraints, including repealing the Biden administration’s executive order on AI and promoting AI-related investments in the Middle East. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the move, calling it essential to national security and asserting that “regulatory restraint” was key to ensuring America’s dominance in AI. Attorney General Rob Bonta said he strongly opposes any effort to block states from developing and enforcing common-sense regulation. He noted that states must be able to protect their residents by responding to emerging and evolving AI technology. California implemented a raft of bills this year limiting specific uses of AI, illustrating the kind of laws that would be blocked under the moratorium. Like several other states, California has criminalized the use of AI to generate sexually explicit images of individuals without their consent. The state also prohibits unauthorized deepfakes in political advertising and requires healthcare providers to notify patients when interacting with an AI, not a human. Healthcare provider networks, also known as HMOs, are barred in California from using AI systems instead of doctors to decide medical necessity. Senate challenges House approach However, the House provision may not survive Senate scrutiny. Under budget reconciliation rules, only measures directly related to federal spending or revenue can bypass the filibuster and pass with a simple majority. The Senate proposed alternative language as a workaround: denying federal broadband funding to states that impose their own AI regulations. But the provision’s fate hinges on the ruling of the Senate parliamentarian, who has not yet weighed in. “We have yet to argue this before the parliamentarian. I anticipate that we will do so this week or next week,” Senate Commerce Chairman Ted Cruz told Bloomberg TV . “I don’t know how she’ll rule.” Still, Cruz called the Senate’s approach “very sound policy.” The regulatory debate comes as Amazon ramps up investment in AI infrastructure. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant recently announced plans to spend up to $20 billion on server farms in Pennsylvania—further evidence of the company’s high-stakes bet on artificial intelligence as a core driver of future growth. Like its peers, Amazon sees AI as not just a technological leap but a geopolitical one. And for now, industry leaders are betting that the fewer the rules, the faster they can run.

American Bitcoin (ABTC), backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has quietly accumulated over 215 BTC, valued at $23 million, since its launch on April 1. As revealed in a recent SEC filing dated June 6, ABTC isn’t just a mining company; it’s a Bitcoin accumulation vehicle with long-term ambitions. Operating over 60,000 miners housed in Hut 8 facilities, ABTC generates over 10.17 EH/s of hashpower without owning any real estate. Instead of converting mined Bitcoin into cash, the company stores its reserves securely using Coinbase Custody. Eric and Donald Trump Jr.-backed American #Bitcoin quietly accumulates 215 $BTC ($23M+) since April launch ahead of public merger. pic.twitter.com/OXP9wZvDRS — amit malik (@amitmalikmalik) June 10, 2025 With Eric Trump joining the board and a public listing in the works via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, the company is tying its identity and brand equity to Bitcoin itself. Key points: ABTC’s mining approach focuses on BTC accumulation, not fiat conversion. Trump family’s backing adds political clout and media visibility. Market sees this as bullish supply-side pressure—less BTC on exchanges. U.S. Charges $500M Crypto Laundering Plot While ABTC builds a bullish case, U.S. regulators dropped a bombshell. The DOJ arrested Iurii Gugnin, founder of Evita Pay and Evita Investments, for laundering over $500 million through U.S. banks and crypto platforms, mainly using Tether (USDT). U.S. CRACKS DOWN ON CRYPTO KING: SECRET TECH DEALS WITH RUSSIA EXPOSED U.S. prosecutors charged Iurii Gugnin, founder of crypto payments company Evita, with laundering over $500 million and helping Russians get sensitive American tech. Court documents allege Gugnin used… https://t.co/ccVEVtO59E pic.twitter.com/XMQiVOeatj — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) June 10, 2025 Gugnin is accused of helping sanctioned Russian entities like Sberbank and Rosatom dodge international restrictions. The indictment includes 22 counts of bank fraud, each carrying up to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors allege he: Bought U.S. technology for banned firms. Falsified documents to hide ties to Russia. Exploited crypto’s opacity to bypass sanctions. This case reinforces growing concerns that digital assets are being used to sidestep international law, prompting stricter global oversight. Still, Bitcoin’s transparent and decentralized nature differentiates it from intermediated platforms and may continue to attract regulatory favor. Japan’s QE Pivot May Ignite Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sees a potential global liquidity wave on the horizon. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) resumes quantitative easing (QE) at its June 16–17 meeting, Hayes believes it could be the next big tailwind for Bitcoin. The Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting could impact global risk assets. If they shift to QE, $BTC may surge towards $200K as it becomes a hedge against sovereign risks. Read the full article https://t.co/i2bvc3IJ2I — Nova – {News} AI Agent (@ChainGPTAINews) June 10, 2025 Why? Japan recently signaled plans to reduce bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter. But with rising yields, 30-year JGBs hit 3.185% in May—officials may reverse course. Bitcoin previously surged to $112,000 when yields spiked, suggesting investors see it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability. Hayes predicts: QE would boost risk assets, including BTC. Institutions may turn to Bitcoin as a “counterparty-risk-free” asset. A renewed rally could push Bitcoin toward the $200,000 mark in 2025. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $112K and Beyond? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC remains in a bullish ascending channel on the 2-hour chart, trading above the 50-EMA ($107,510) and making consistent higher lows. A bullish engulfing candle on June 9 pushed the price above a key barrier at $108,627, with current resistance at $110,668. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is flattening, hinting at weakening momentum, while candlesticks show upper wicks—a sign of hesitation. A confirmed breakout above $111,000 could ignite momentum toward $112,000 and $113,500. Technical Levels to Watch: Support: $108,000 (channel base), $107,510 (50-EMA) Resistance: $111,000, $113,500 Trade idea: Buy on breakout or bounce off 50-EMA with a tight stop-loss Conclusion Macro shifts, regulatory crackdowns, and high-profile political support are reshaping the narrative surrounding Bitcoin. As ABTC accumulates, Japan considers more stimulus, and chart patterns remain constructive, the path toward $200K is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a data-backed possibility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading at just $0.03, is drawing comparisons to early-stage Ethereum (ETH) for its ambitious DeFi infrastructure and disruptive potential. The project has already raised more than $10.3 million and attracted over 11,800 holders. Meanwhile, Ethereum, still one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, continues to defend its legacy with strong developer activity and growing institutional adoption, trading at $2,486 as of early June 2025. But as retail investors ask what crypto to buy now, many are betting that MUTM could be the next crypto to take off, offering exponential upside, and potentially carving out its own market alongside Ethereum (ETH) in the changing decentralized market. Mutuum Finance’s Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their listing price of $0.06, which is a 100% gain for phase 5 investors upon the token’s launch. With over $10.3 million raised and a growing community of 11,800+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Rewards for Early Investors Fuel Ongoing Community Growth As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow, it remains committed to its earliest supporters. To show appreciation, 10 early investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway —each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This rewards them for being early backers of the project before it takes off. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key features of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $10.3 million and attracted more than 11,800 holders signaling strong early momentum in the DeFi space. As Phase 5 of the presale continues investors can still acquire tokens at $0.03 ahead of the planned $0.06 listing price which will yield a 100% ROI. The project’s hybrid lending model, Certik-audited smart contracts, and upcoming fully collateralized stablecoin highlight a serious commitment to innovation, transparency, and long-term value.

You’re Among Crypto’s Elite, Expert Claims",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/owning-10000-xrp-youre-among-cryptos-elite-expert-claims/,"According to crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina, most individual XRP holders could find themselves shut out as inflation and tight budgets squeeze their options. He argues that owning more than 10,000 XRP – which costs about $23,100 at a price of $2.31 per token – has become a barrier for anyone living paycheck to paycheck. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Rich List Data Reveals Concentration Based on reports, there are about 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses in existence. Less than 4% of those wallets contain at least 10,000 XRP. A clear majority, over 5 million addresses, hold 500 XRP or fewer. That gap shows how stacked the system is. More than 166,250 wallets sit in the 10,000–25,000 XRP range. Another 159,566 wallets carry between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. These figures point to a small group with deep pockets, while the rest trail far behind. Owning more than 10,000 $XRP nowadays is already a luxury few people can afford. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 9, 2025 Inflation Pressures Hit Small Holders Farina warns that rising inflation is forcing ordinary holders to sell just to cover daily needs. He notes, “We’re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries.” When basic goods cost more each month, people feel they have no choice but to cash out their crypto. It’s a harsh reality. Owning large amounts of XRP has morphed from a luxury into a struggle for survival. Threshold Debate Heats Up He first said 95% of XRP holders risk being priced out. Now he’s raised that warning to 99%. That jump has sparked debate. Some worry it feeds a fear of missing out on a “10,000-XRP club,” while others see it as a wake-up call. Farina questions whether Bitcoin’s rally to about $112,000 really reflects growth, or simply the dollar losing its value. He frames the issue as a tug-of-war between crypto gains and fiat losses. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Calls For New Income Streams Instead of selling crypto, Farina urges holders to find extra income. He suggests side hustles or online work as ways to avoid cutting into holdings. “If you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,” he said. His advice pushes people to rethink how they earn and where they live. Crypto markets can move on legal news and product launches, not only inflation. Ripple’s ongoing court case and ETF filings could change XRP’s path. Still, Farina’s message taps into a broader concern: the gap between small and large holders may widen as prices climb. Retail investors can still join in. They just need to pace their buys and stay aware of both crypto trends and everyday costs.

Amidst a crypto market characterized by persistent volatility, with Bitcoin fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000, market sentiment remains largely influenced by macroeconomic policies, regulatory developments, and speculative behavior. Against this backdrop, HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt leverages rigorous data analysis and a meticulous selection process to spotlight seven standout projects. These projects are strategically positioned for growth and demonstrate strong community engagement. The selected assets span some of today’s most dynamic sectors—including RWA/DeFi, AI, Meme, LSD, and SocialFi—and feature both promising new entrants and well-established projects that have recently outperformed broader market trends. New Listings Shine Across a Well-Balanced Sector Mix In May, HTX listed 23 new assets, including six stablecoins, an approach that underscores its commitment to staying at the forefront of the stablecoin trend and expanding its asset offerings. Notably, USD1 made its global debut on HTX. The token, issued by World Liberty Financial (a company backed by the Trump family), focuses on building a DeFi lending ecosystem in the United States. USD1 quickly gained traction as one of May’s most discussed projects on social media and received an S rating. Besides USD1, two other new assets in Crypto Gem Hunt #6 have stood out: SYRUP (Maple Finance) , a key player in the RWA/DeFi sector, experienced an impressive 117.7% surge following its listing on May 8, earning an A rating. SYRUP is the native token of Maple, a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to deposit USDC, receive syrupUSDC, and earn yield. All loans are collateralized by digital assets, ensuring both strong security and sustainable returns. KAITO , an innovator in the InfoFi/AI sector, recorded a remarkable 263.6% increase since its listing on HTX on February 23, securing an A rating. KAITO is building an AI-driven crypto information network that streamlines content distribution among creators, users, and capital. By empowering the content ecosystem, KAITO is positioning itself at the forefront of the convergence between crypto and AI. Veteran Projects Regain Momentum, Fueling Compelling Narratives Despite continuous shifts in market dynamics, a select group of earlier-launched projects are demonstrating remarkable resilience. Backed by strong product fundamentals and vibrant community support, they’ve recently returned to the spotlight with evolving narratives and renewed momentum, capturing the attention of both investors and users. Two Meme projects from last September, MOODENG and NEIROCTO, serve as notable examples: MOODENG , built on the Solana (SOL) chain, surged an incredible 961.5% and received an A rating. Inspired by the famous pygmy hippopotamus from Thailand, MOODENG’s unique design, strong community, and viral momentum propelled it to a nearly tenfold increase post-launch. NEIROCTO ( First Neiro On Ethereum ) is community-driven and carries on the spirit of Doge. Since its launch on September 7, 2024, it has seen a peak increase of 235%. Through consistent operational efforts and content-driven initiatives, NEIROCTO has cultivated a highly engaged Meme community. ETHFI ( ether.fi ), launched in March 2024, emerged during the boom of the LSD sector and has since recorded a 258.7% increase. With rising interest in LSD solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem, ETHFI shows strong growth potential and a solid track record. MASK (Mask Network) , launched in 2021, is a SocialFi project that recently gained 187.3%. Acting as a bridge between Web2 (traditional internet) and Web3 (decentralized internet), MASK integrates decentralized applications into mainstream social media via a browser plugin. Recent feature updates and community efforts have significantly contributed to its price recovery. HTX Crypto Gem Hunt Empowers Users Across Market Cycles To date, HTX has launched six rounds of its Crypto Gem Hunt program. The latest selection features not only high-growth new assets from emerging sectors but also established projects that have recently delivered strong performance. Together, these assets offer users a well-balanced portfolio—combining defensive stability with high-upside potential. Looking ahead, HTX Crypto Gem Hunt will continue to empower users through professional, intuitive asset discovery supported by robust data and forward-looking analysis.

While the world's largest digital asset is trading flat in the early hours of the session, CoinDesk market data shows that it's up 4% on the week. An expected Bank of Japan rate cut isn't doing that much to move the market, even though a low interest rate policy is usually what drives risk-on sentiment and positively impacts BTC prices. One metric to watch instead is the 'Coinbase Premium'. Tracked by CryptoQuant, it measures the price difference between BTC on Coinbase Pro (USD) and Binance (USDT), demonstrating the dollar demand for bitcoin (as opposed to crypto-native demand). ""The Coinbase Premium is gradually rising, indicating that buying pressure from U.S. investors is supporting the trend,"" CryptoQuant analysts wrote in a recent update . ""Additionally, whale buying activity is being observed incrementally."" Part of this movement would include BTC ETF inflow, which has hit $386.27 million so far this week, according to SoSoValue data . That being said, some market observers are concerned that a staked ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), which may be close to getting approved , could put a damper on institutional BTC interest. Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, says that an ETF that gives investors access to ETH yield from staking would be something that BTC ETFs can't match, as they just give exposure to price appreciation. ""This has created a lot of buzz, especially considering how much of bitcoin’s rally was fueled by ETF hype,"" Yang said. ""And let’s be honest: while there’s speculation around Solana or Litecoin ETFs, Ether is still the only other crypto asset with a real existence in U.S. spot ETF. That makes it a go-to option for institutions waiting and watching on the sidelines, ready to move when the timing feels right."" But for now, it's still a waiting game. At least until the BoJ's move is official, as the usual crypto-natives like Arthur Hayes are counting on BTC going parabolic as a result. DEX Volume Has Nearly Doubled in Past Year Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) have always had their eyes on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) since the concept took off in 2018 with the advent of modern Automated Market Maker (AMM) engines – the technology at the center of the product category. But as the year continues, and crypto mergers and acquisitions heat up maybe there'll be a renewed interest in DEXs, considering the massive jump in volume on the platforms in the last year. According to data from Messari, in the last year, trading volume on DEXs has jumped from around 6% of all volume to 12%. In May, that number got closer to 25% as up-and-coming DEX Hyperliquid caught the eye of the market , including crypto's most aggressive traders . But are DEXs and CEX's competitors? No, says OKX President Hong Fang. Speaking with CoinDesk earlier this year in the run-up to Consensus Hong Kong, Fang said that the two are complementary. ""The crypto-native audience will want to be able to use CEX for reliability and DEX for catching innovations,"" she said at the time. ""Such supply-demand dynamics will drive further adoption of DEX to enable innovation while supporting the gradual maturity of the crypto regulatory framework."" News Roundup Trump’s CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz Says Congress Key to Boosting Crypto Innovation and Consumer Protection Brian Quintenz, President Trump's nominee for chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), emphasized at his Senate confirmation hearing that Congress must lead in establishing clear guidelines to boost crypto innovation and consumer protection simultaneously, CoinDesk previously reported. Quintenz, who previously served as a CFTC commissioner and later as head of policy at venture capital firm a16z, argued that forthcoming market structure legislation could provide clarity needed for entrepreneurs while maintaining safeguards for consumers. During his confirmation, senators expressed concerns about vacancies at the CFTC—particularly the absence of Democratic commissioners—but Quintenz declined to commit to advocating Trump to fill these positions, emphasizing presidential discretion. He acknowledged potential resource needs should the CFTC become the primary regulator for digital commodities, advocating a ""technology-first approach"" to enhance agency efficiency, and defended the role of prediction markets as legitimate tools for hedging and risk management. Aave is Now on Sony's Soneium Aave has launched on Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain supported by electronics giant Sony, CoinDesk previously reported. This integration includes exploring real-world applications of Aave's decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin, GHO, across payments, savings, and digital commerce. Aave's involvement will extend to liquidity incentive campaigns, notably partnering with Astar, a significant blockchain player in Japan’s Web3 scene, with a dedicated 100 million ASTR allocation ($4 million) to boost adoption. Soneium already hosts a vibrant 7-million user ecosystem featuring prominent platforms like Uniswap v4, Velodrome, Stargate, and Lido, alongside native protocols Kyo Finance and SuperVol. Stani Kulechov, Aave Labs' founder, emphasized Sony’s global trust and Soneium’s consumer-centric approach as key advantages, aligning with Aave’s strategy of expanding accessibility and mainstream reach. Market Movements BTC: BTC trades below $110K as exchange reserves drop sharply, signaling strong accumulation amid significant short liquidations.

This would be necessary if Congress grants the CFTC expanded authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. “It is precedental that new jurisdiction comes with new resources,” Quintenz said in response to multiple senators’ questions. “So to the extent that new authorities come to the agency… I would anticipate that new resources would likely be needed.” Quintenz, currently head of global policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division (a16z crypto), previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021. If confirmed by the Senate, he would return to the CFTC at a moment of heightened interest in digital asset regulation and amid significant personnel turnover at the agency. Senate backs expanded resources for CFTC Lawmakers from both parties generally agreed with Quintenz’s assessment. While a few expressed reservations about President Trump’s approach to regulatory agencies, there was broad consensus that the CFTC would require a larger budget and staff to oversee an expanded crypto mandate effectively. “It is also essential that the CFTC have the institutional capacity, both in staffing and resources, to fulfill its mandate in the face of these emerging challenges,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) before asking for Quintenz’s take on resourcing. Quintenz responded that undertaking much of that responsibility would be a challenge. He added that the precedent has been to provide new resources alongside new authorities. The hearing took place as lawmakers continue to craft legislation that could hand the CFTC a central role in regulating crypto spot markets, currently in regulatory limbo between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other federal agencies. Quintenz set to lead alone as CFTC faces leadership exodus If confirmed, Quintenz may initially be the only commissioner at the CFTC. In recent weeks, all four remaining commissioners have either stepped down or announced their departures . Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger resigned to become CEO of the Blockchain Association, while Acting Chair Caroline Pham has indicated she will exit once Quintenz is confirmed. Democrats Kristin Johnson and Christy Goldsmith Romero departed or scheduled their exits. This leadership vacuum raises questions about the agency’s near-term capacity to function effectively, let alone take on new responsibilities in the fast-evolving crypto space. Quintenz, known for his pro-innovation stance during his previous CFTC tenure, has been a vocal advocate for clear regulation in the digital asset space. He has called for clearly defining the responsibilities of federal agencies in the crypto space and offering clear guidance to industry participants. His return to the CFTC, especially as the commission’s lone commissioner, could influence how the agency thinks about crypto rulemaking if Congress moves ahead with proposals to broaden the agency’s mandate. Trump’s larger fiscal plan, which includes deep cuts to government spending and essentially an omnibus bill of infrastructure and defense spending, has only complicated negotiations around the budget. While it is unclear if the CFTC will secure the resources it requires, the agency is prepared to step in potentially transformative ways in crypto regulation.

Lummis emphasizes that the policy has been tilted against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lummis said that the Bitcoin mining community is one of the hardest-hit groups due to the proposed provisions, which would endure potentially duplicative taxes and substantial compliance headaches. This interpretation follows Senator Lummis’ X post that says that America’s crypto tax laws disproportionately target Bitcoin and other digital assets. As a long-time advocate, she argued that the current tax laws are a “complete mess,” with the most problems manifested by Bitcoin. Bitcoin and digital assets are being unfairly targeted because of flawed tax rules. We need crypto revisions in reconciliation. — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 10, 2025 She said the cryptocurrency rules must be updated during the reconciliation process to curb that. Senator Lummis refers to the IRS’s crypto tax regulations as ‘bad tax regulations’ Senator Cynthia Lummis stated that Bitcoin and digital assets are wrongly singled out due to bad tax regulations. Though Lummis does not mention them by name, her remarks likely refer to the IRS’s crypto tax reporting rules, particularly those rolled out in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law took a wide view of “brokers,” placing miners and developers under the same category. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is also called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law widened the broker reporting rules in Sections 6045 and 6045A to cover digital assets. This wide-reaching categorization has faced criticism from miners and developers, who have voiced out their claims. According to them, they would be virtually unable to comply with these regulations. The rules force them to report information like names and transaction amounts in their tax filings — information they often do not even have access to. Lummis’ post called on Congress to try to make the rule change on a special amendment vehicle. The pro-Bitcoin senator calls for “crypto changes in reconciliation” to accelerate the amendment process. According to House rules, some tax or spending bills can be approved with a simple majority using reconciliation. Senator Lummis wants to use this method to change the definition of “broker” and bypass bipartisan gridlock. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970 despite regulatory uncertainties People are also worried that the flawed tax code carries the potential for double taxation in the case of miners and participants in decentralized finance (DeFi). This is because Miners get taxed on their block rewards and then again on capital gains when they sell what they own. At the same time, DeFi users could face several taxable events even if they have not made any profits. However, despite such regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970. Cryptocurrency markets are rebounding today, with the two highest performers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, posting positive gains following a weekend of largely sideways trading. US lawmakers are debating new crypto rules to solve this regulatory uncertainty that may profoundly reshape the industry. The GENIUS Act is on the verge of a cloture vote in Congress this week, with the CLARITY Act also moving forward.

""Circle IPO's clearly went very well. That's a reflection of investor interest in crypto, both institutions and retail. The financial future will be blockchain-based,"" Garlinghouse said at Apex. Garlinghouse said that one factor in the success of Circle's IPO is the market's fundamental belief that the GENIUS Act – the U.S. stablecoin legislation – will pass. As CoinDesk previously reported , the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulatory bill, is poised for imminent Senate passage with bipartisan support, potentially moving to the House and becoming law by August recess. ""Regulatory headwinds have now become tailwinds in the U.S., and that's good for the global landscape,"" Garlinghouse continued. ""It's not deregulation that we want, and we are asking for clear regulation, and progress is evident."" Other jurisdictions have also recently passed stablecoin legislation, such as Hong Kong . Korea's new administration is also said to be working on a stablecoin bill. Garlinghouse declined to comment on a potential Ripple-Circle merger or acquisition.

Toncoin Has Been Stuck Inside A Triangle On The Daily Timeframe In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that Toncoin has recently been moving inside. The pattern in question is a Triangle from technical analysis (TA), which forms when an asset’s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance in the future, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Triangles in TA. Three popular ones include the Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines relative to each other defines which type a particular triangular channel falls under. In an Ascending Triangle, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, its consolidation shrinks toward a net upside. The Descending Triangle involves just the opposite case; the upper line is sloped downward while the lower one is flat. The third variation, the Symmetrical Triangle, has its trendlines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In this pattern, the price’s range tightens to a point in a sideways manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Triangle pattern that Toncoin has seemingly been trapped within during the past few months: From the graph, it’s visible that the Triangle that the 1-day price of Toncoin has been following looks similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it’s not a perfect one; there is a slight bias to the downside. The cryptocurrency most recently found support at the lower line and has since climbed toward the midway point between the trendlines. The coin’s price is now not too far from the apex of the pattern. Generally, breakouts become more likely as consolidation becomes tighter, so it’s possible that TON may be approaching one. According to the analyst, a breakout, if it happens, could potentially end up leading to a 40% move for Toncoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative As for which direction a breakout might take the asset in, Symmetrical Triangles usually have both sides at equal probability. Since the Triangle in the current case is slightly angled down, however, an exit below the lower line may be a bit more likely. It now remains to be seen how Toncoin’s price will develop in the coming days and if the pattern will play any role. TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.3, up over 2% in the last seven days.

While there are hundreds of options, few coins combine practical use, reliable performance, and smart pricing. With 2025 at its halfway mark, timing is key for anyone eyeing solid gains. BlockDAG is showing unmatched traction with its low price and high user base. FET is building real AI applications. BNB remains central to the Binance ecosystem, and ADA continues to push academic innovation. These four picks bring something unique to the table and are considered solid picks for anyone mapping their crypto strategy. 1. BlockDAG: Real Adoption with 1.5M Daily Users BlockDAG stands out as a top crypto to watch this year. It has already raised over $293 million and sold more than 22.2 billion coins. The price is currently frozen at $0.0018 until June 13. With a $0.05 launch price, this reflects a possible gain of 2,678%. Even early participants have seen profits of 2,520% since Batch 1 at $0.001. The platform’s X1 Miner app is driving mass usage with over 1.5 million daily users mining coins directly on mobile. The app has simple features like streak rewards, zero gas fees, and a referral program that appeals to new users. BlockDAG also supports low-code smart contracts and is fully EVM-compatible, helping developers get involved faster. It passed audits from both Halborn and CertiK, boosting trust. High-profile tie-ups, including one with Inter Milan and hints at an NBA deal, add to its credibility. While some experts note the governance model is still evolving, the metrics point to long-term value. With the GO LIVE reveal happening on June 13, BlockDAG offers strong fundamentals and market attention, placing it firmly among the top cryptos to watch now. 2. Fetch.ai: Building AI for the Real World Fetch.ai (FET) blends AI and blockchain to simplify real-world operations in areas like logistics and IoT. It allows users to set up agents that handle tasks like autonomous payments and data sharing. Businesses are beginning to explore it for reducing system inefficiencies. Its rise in 2025 coincides with a wider shift toward AI-backed crypto solutions. FET’s edge lies in its functioning use cases, unlike many theoretical AI coins. It remains budget-friendly, making it one of the top cryptos to watch for practical automation. With more developers joining the platform and solid real-world tests, it positions itself for future growth. 3. BNB: Central Role in a Massive Ecosystem BNB stays relevant through its deep integration in Binance’s services. It’s used for discounts, staking, and across the Binance Smart Chain’s expanding DeFi world. BNB’s consistent on-chain usage keeps it in the spotlight. The scheduled token burns decrease supply, increasing long-term value. Despite global regulatory challenges, Binance’s wide reach ensures BNB demand holds firm. It’s accepted on multiple platforms outside Binance as well. BNB remains a top crypto to watch for those who want steady growth in a high-utility asset. Though not the highest gainer, it’s a dependable option. 4. Cardano: Steady Growth from Research-Based Development Cardano (ADA) has always followed a deliberate, research-heavy path. Instead of fast launches, it focuses on peer-reviewed improvements and secure infrastructure. This has gained attention from developers looking for long-term platforms. In 2025, ADA is seeing more use cases, especially in smart contracts and digital identity. Its DeFi ecosystem is also expanding slowly but surely. Staking allows users to earn while helping the network. For those looking for a top crypto to watch that emphasizes slow but solid growth, ADA is a reliable option with a forward-thinking roadmap. The Bottom Line Identifying the top crypto to watch involves finding real usage, growth potential, and smart timing. BlockDAG stands out with a $0.0018 price until June 13, over 22.2 billion coins sold, and its June 13 GO LIVE reveal nearing. FET brings proven AI integration into blockchain, while BNB thrives on Binance utility. ADA stays the course with a methodical approach to blockchain advancement. Each of these coins offers something valuable. Depending on your approach, one may align better than the others. But BDAG definitely deserves a spot on your radar in 2025 for its consistent growth and ROI potential.

Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy with a $17.9M Presale Surge,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-out-on-bitcoin-cash-qubetics-is-the-popular-crypto-coin-to-buy-with-a-17-9m-presale-surge/,"In the final quarter of 2017, as the crypto market entered one of its most explosive growth phases, Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) stood out as a high-potential fork of Bitcoin—engineered to deliver faster, more cost-effective transactions. Launched in August 2017 at around $240, $BCH rapidly gained traction and soared to an all-time high of over $4,000 by December, generating more than 1,500% gains in just a few months. For early adopters, it was a defining moment. But for most, the opportunity vanished almost as quickly as it appeared. Today, with similar early-stage momentum and real-world utility, Qubetics ($TICS) is positioning itself as one of the top altcoins to buy, offering a compelling entry point before wider market adoption. Those who hesitated or dismissed it as another altcoin missed a chance to secure triple-digit gains. Today, $BCH trades around $460, a fraction of its all-time high—but still respected as a foundational player in the decentralized payments space. While Bitcoin Cash maintains relevance, it’s no longer viewed as the breakthrough it once was. Its growth has stabilised, its hype subdued. And in a market that rewards innovation and momentum, backers are asking—what’s the next major leap? Qubetics might just be the answer. With its unique decentralized VPN utility, a lean supply strategy, and over $17.9 million raised so far in its crypto presale, Qubetics has swiftly positioned itself as the most popular crypto coin to buy in 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): Reducing Risks of Censorship With Decentralized VPN With governments tightening internet surveillance and traditional VPNs raising privacy concerns, Qubetics came up with a decentralized VPN powered by blockchain infrastructure. It’s a smart, forward-thinking use of crypto tech—giving users control over their digital privacy in a way centralised providers simply can’t match. A decentralized VPN allows individuals and organizations to route internet traffic across a global network of nodes, reducing risks of censorship, tracking, or data harvesting. It’s not just a tool for privacy junkies. Freelancers working across borders, NGOs operating in restricted environments, financial firms protecting sensitive communication—Qubetics offers them all a more secure path online. For developers, there’s an opportunity to plug into the protocol and create privacy-enhancing apps, all while earning $TICS tokens as network contributors. And that’s only one layer of Qubetics’ appeal. The token is powering into its final public crypto presale stage, offering buyers a unique combination of timing, scarcity, and real-world utility. The crypto presale—currently in Stage 37—has already sold over 515 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,800 holders, raising upwards of $17.9 million. At $0.3370 per token, there’s a built-in 20% upside when $TICS lists at $0.40. But analysts are looking much further ahead, estimating price levels of $5 to $15 once the mainnet launches and demand surges. This isn’t a speculative meme coin built on social media hype. Qubetics is rolling out use cases with teeth. The protocol is also structured to solve real cross-border payment inefficiencies, enabling faster, cheaper asset transfers without relying on third-party intermediaries. The total supply of Qubetics was recently slashed from 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, turning $TICS into one of the leanest upcoming tokens. With 38.55% of the supply now flowing into the hands of the community, decentralisation isn’t just a buzzword—it’s embedded into the DNA of the project. An $18,000 buy-in at this stage could yield staggering returns if $TICS follows the price arc analysts foresee. At $1, that’s $53,412. At $5, it’s over $267,000. And if it hits $15 after the mainnet launch? That initial capital could swell beyond $800,000. All of this helps explain why crypto enthusiasts are calling Qubetics one of the most popular crypto coins to buy right now. Bitcoin Cash ($BCH): A Veteran Player with Slower Momentum Bitcoin Cash was born from a desire to make transactions faster and cheaper than its parent, Bitcoin. And in that respect, it delivered. Over the years, $BCH carved out a dedicated user base and continues to serve as a viable payment-focused cryptocurrency with lower fees and quicker confirmation times. However, innovation has slowed. While BCH is widely accepted on some crypto-friendly platforms and remains popular in parts of Asia and Latin America, it’s not breaking new ground in terms of tech or utility. DeFi integrations are limited. NFT support is minimal. And aside from incremental protocol upgrades, $BCH isn’t making the kind of waves it did in its early days. What’s more, the crypto landscape has changed. Backers are no longer drawn only to store-of-value coins. They’re seeking tokens with purpose—those that solve actual problems, not just theoretical ones. And in that space, Bitcoin Cash is feeling the pressure. Still, $BCH remains a household name in crypto, and for risk-averse buyers, it may provide stable if unspectacular upside. It trades at around $460 with a market cap in the billions—reassuring to some, but lacking the explosive upside potential of younger tokens in active presales. As for price outlooks, $BCH could benefit from a general market recovery, but few analysts expect it to 10x or 20x from current levels without a major network overhaul or renewed hype cycle. That’s where Qubetics gains an edge. It offers the one thing $BCH can’t replicate anymore—early-stage entry into a utility-driven ecosystem backed by a scarcity-based token model. Conclusion – Which One Is The Popular Coin to Buy Now? Bitcoin Cash was one of the most popular crypto coins to buy during its launch window. Those who took the leap reaped massive gains. But that opportunity has largely passed. Today, it serves as a steady, familiar option—but not the kind of high-growth asset that backers are hunting in 2025. Qubetics fills that gap. With its decentralized VPN use case, real-world payments utility, and sharply limited supply, it isn’t trying to replicate old models—it’s building something new. Its crypto presale momentum, coupled with analysts’ price targets ranging from $5 to $15, is why $TICS is climbing the ranks among the most popular crypto coins to buy right now. For anyone still regretting missing out on the BCH breakout years ago, Qubetics might be the second chance that rarely comes twice in a lifetime.

Lightchain AI is rapidly taking front stage with over $18.5 million raised during its presale at a price of $0.007 for its creative mix of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. Lightchain AI’s special and powerful value proposition sets it apart from rivals as the bitcoin market changes constantly and guides towards remarkable development. This ambitious project has attracted the attention of investors looking for significant financial returns in the near future since it can outperform the outstanding performance of generally known meme coins. Community Power behind Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Among the finest models of the features of community-driven cryptocurrencies are Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The community of Dogecoin, one of the most well-known for its humor and kindness, is behind several Halloween costume fundraisers and similar charitable events: the first was a successful campaign in 2014 for the Jamaican bobsled team at the Winter Olympics while the others were for the NASCAR driver Josh Wise, on this occasion they used ” Dun only good everyday”. This kind of community approach completely shows the idea that deliberate actions are the only means to make everything better. Shiba Inu’s Shib Army, the community of the Shiba Inu coin, is seeing as a spirit that goes against the fact that ‘it started as a meme’, and is, thus, a founder of a totally digital island comprising projects like ShibaSwap and NFTs. In a similar vein, both communities are using social media channels to grow their operations, compile users, and create trends across the market, so underlining the great relevance of a total involvement— literally—in the cryptocurrency scene. Lightchain AI – Transforming Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence By deftly combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to solve practical problems, lightchain AI is transforming sectors. Lightchain AI, unlike meme coins like DOGE or SHIB, emphasizes utility, allowing real-time data processing and intelligent decision-making for uses including predictive analytics and supply chain optimization. Built on a scalable and strong blockchain infrastructure, Lightchain AI is the perfect fit for companies looking for dependable, high-performance tools since it is meant to efficiently manage intricate AI-driven operations. Lightchain AI has attracted investor confidence and set itself for quick global adoption and expansion having raised an amazing $18.5 million during its presale at $0.007 per token. Embedding artificial intelligence into distributed systems is guiding a daring future for blockchain innovation. Future? All About Utility While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin brought the entertainment, Lightchain AI is here to revolutionize the game. Ignore the hype; blockchain meets actual innovation here. Lightchain AI is redefining what is feasible with blazing scalability, flawless AI integration, and a strong emphasis on useful applications. This is the jaw-dropper; 15,000% of increase is possible. That’s correct; this is a revolutionary platform designed for great disturbance and actual utility, not just another bitcoin. This is your chance to enter something really revolutionary if you’re an investor searching for the next great thing. Still, that’s not all—something major is under progress. Offering creators the best venue to design, launch, and monetize meme-based projects like never before, the Memecoin Launchpad is drawing attention. This is a game-changing combination of opportunity, inventiveness, and imagination all in one location. Are you prepared to travel forward into blockchain?

Speaking in a video posted June 9, the analyst described the current Ethereum setup across multiple timeframes as “something we’ve never seen before,” drawing comparisons to historical signals that preceded major rallies in 2016, 2018, and 2020. Ethereum Primed For Macro Breakout Kevin emphasized that Ethereum now exhibits strong bullish momentum across its USD pair, dominance chart, and ETH/BTC ratio, pointing to a simultaneous alignment of several high-time frame indicators. “These are things that just don’t pop up every day,” he said. “Matter of fact, these are things that have almost never popped up in such confluence throughout history for Ethereum.” The core of Kevin’s thesis hinges on what he calls a “monthly demand candle”—a large, typically green candlestick that emerges after a protracted correction. Ethereum printed such a candle in May 2025 following nearly a year of sideways chop and five months of drawdown. Historically, these demand candles have marked the start of significant uptrends. Kevin cited analogous structures in 2016, 2018, and during the COVID-19 crash in 2020, all of which preceded multi-month rallies. “This may be the most textbook demand candle we’ve ever had,” he noted, adding that “the last time we saw something like this was before ETH ran for nearly a year with barely any major correction.” Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Supporting the candle analysis is a synchronized bullish turn in several technical indicators. The Market Cipher momentum wave has clipped into the oversold zone and printed a confirmed green dot buy signal. Simultaneously, the VWAP—volume-weighted average price—has crossed above the zero line, and money flow has started to trend upward. Kevin was explicit about the importance of this configuration: “Let me tell you something: this is a big deal.” The monthly RSI, currently sitting at 51, has not yet broken the crucial 70-level that historically marks the onset of parabolic price action. According to Kevin, “ETH has never even broken 70 this cycle. You haven’t seen what’s possible yet for Ethereum—or for altcoins in general. You’ve seen nothing yet.” He also highlighted the return of whale accumulation, measured through a proprietary “whale money flow” indicator. After exiting ETH positions for over a year—from March 2024 to May 2025—whale flows have shown a V-shaped bottom and are now turning up. “We are now starting to see accumulation durably here,” Kevin said. “You keep hearing that BlackRock’s buying ETH, and I don’t know if that’s reflected in this indicator, but we are definitely seeing whale activity occur on the monthly time frame.” The analyst went further, showing that Ethereum’s stock RSI on the monthly timeframe has not only bottomed out but is now rebounding sharply—a pattern that historically precedes long-duration uptrends. “This is aggressive movement,” he explained, noting that for confirmation, the RSI still needs to cross the 20-level, but emphasized that the current shape of the rebound is stronger than in previous cycles. Ethereum Shows Relative Strength Another key piece of the puzzle is Ethereum’s dominance chart, which tracks ETH’s market cap relative to the rest of the crypto space excluding Bitcoin. Kevin pointed to a potential double bottom on the monthly chart and a newly confirmed MACD momentum shift, the first in over two years. “That’s two years and one month of downtrend finally reversing,” he said. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Finally, the ETH/BTC pair is showing a near-identical structure to Ethereum’s dominance chart. Kevin believes this confluence is key. “Look at that—wow, that’s funny—it looks the same. You find your major low right where you found it in 2020. The monthly indicators are all curling up.” Still, he remained measured in his optimism, noting that macroeconomic conditions—particularly monetary policy—remain essential for confirming the bullish case. “It’s going to take some monetary policy shifting. We still need inflation to come in line. But the market is living four to six months ahead. If the market starts to sniff out that easing is coming, we’ll see that reflected in asset prices before it happens.” Referencing cycle theory and historical post-halving performance, Kevin argued that ETH’s recent relative strength fits both narratives. “Typically, ETH and altcoins start to outperform Bitcoin in the post-halving year. We’re halfway through that window—and it looks like it’s finally starting.” Looking ahead, he sees Ethereum as the “major key” that unlocks broad altcoin outperformance. “ETH opens the door to soaking up market cap, which will then leak down into mid-caps and small-caps. Everything starts with ETH.” While reiterating that patience is crucial, Kevin concluded with conviction: “The monthly timeframe indicators have never been more historically on our side. I think we’re on the verge of something really big.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,739.

According to James Seyffart, these three classes currently have a 90% likelihood of receiving FDA approval in 2025, according to their updated prediction. The applications for these ETFs have already been submitted by big companies involving Grayscale, Bitwise, Hashdex, Franklin, and VanEck. These filings recently became officially recognized by the SEC and final decision dates are now set between mid-2025 and end of 2025. I wrote about this topic a bit today as well.

Dogecoin follows with an 80% probability, while other assets such as Cardano, Polkadot, HBAR, and Avalanche are estimated to have a 75% chance of getting the green light. Newer assets like Sui are rated a 60% chance and that Tron’s ETF filing is unlikely to be looked at until 2026. Bloomberg’s analysts calculated the odds by analyzing the past acknowledgment of applications by the SEC, the actual deadlines the firm has to make a final decision and on the odds of those cryptos being considered commodities, which could facilitate the approving process. Is Solana Leading the Race? The U.S.SEC could green-light ETFs following broad crypto indexes already next month. And among the individual cryptocurrencies, Solana seems to be setting the pace. Analysts say Solana could be the next big asset to have a spot ETF, trailing Bitcoin and Ethereum. The update arrives as seven issuers have already submitted applications for spot Solana ETFs. Regulators could also step in early on Solana and staking-based ETF filings, the report adds. This has been spurred on in part by Rex-Osprey’s recent pivot to create workarounds to the legal restrictions, through which the issuer has launched staking products for Solana and Ethereum. “Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way,” Eric Balchunas wrote.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|LTC|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-11 03:04:39

The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the company recently submitted paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission. By using the confidential filing route, Bullish can move ahead with its IPO preparations without immediately disclosing its financial details, a strategy that has become popular among high-profile startups testing market waters. This marks Bullish’s second attempt at going public. The exchange previously sought a listing through a special purpose acquisition company in 2021, but the deal collapsed in 2022 after a steep decline in tech valuations and rising US interest rates. Jefferies has been tapped as lead underwriter for the offering. Bullish didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Peter Thiel-backed crypto group Bullish files for Wall Street IPO https://t.co/pr22AlV4FQ — FT Markets (@FTMarkets) June 11, 2025 Bullish Eyes Wall Street As Trump Era Revives Crypto Optimism Bullish’s renewed IPO push comes as the US crypto market shows fresh signs of life. Since Donald Trump returned to office, his administration has taken a markedly more supportive stance on digital assets, rolling back restrictions imposed under President Joe Biden. Trump has spoken favorably of Bitcoin in recent months, even after previously calling it a scam. His family has leaned into crypto too, with sons Donald Jr and Eric recently voicing support at a blockchain conference in Las Vegas. Crypto Exchanges Capitalize on Renewed Enthusiasm and Policy Shifts Bitcoin prices have surged past the US$100,000 mark, fueling a rush of capital into crypto-related listings. Last week, stablecoin issuer Circle raised $1.1b in its IPO and soared 168 percent on debut, delivering the strongest first-day gain for a billion-dollar US listing, according to Renaissance Capital. Buoyed by that momentum, Gemini, the exchange run by the Winklevoss twins, also filed confidentially for a US IPO last Friday. Both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been vocal backers of Trump’s re-election efforts and support crypto-friendly policymaking. Bullish positions itself as a blockchain-native exchange offering deep liquidity and tight spreads. CEO Tom Farley, a veteran of traditional finance, previously served as president of the NYSE Group. With Farley at the helm and Thiel’s backing, the firm now hopes to ride the wave of political support and investor optimism to a successful Wall Street listing. The move signals a broader shift in the crypto landscape, as once-skeptical regulators and investors show new openness to integrating digital assets into mainstream finance.

This isn’t just about monetary policy; it’s about international relations, economic strategy, and the intricate dance between nations regarding currency valuations. For anyone tracking macroeconomic trends, including those in the cryptocurrency space who understand how global liquidity and policy shifts impact asset prices, the SNB’s recent stance on FX intervention is a crucial watch point. Understanding SNB FX Intervention and its Purpose The SNB has historically been quite active in the foreign exchange market. Their primary tool? Buying or selling foreign currencies, predominantly euros and dollars, to influence the value of the Swiss Franc (CHF) . The main goal of this intervention is usually to prevent excessive appreciation of the Franc. Why would a central bank want a weaker currency? Here are a few key reasons: Export Competitiveness: A weaker Franc makes Swiss goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting exports, which are vital for the Swiss economy. Inflation Targeting: Currency strength can impact import prices and overall inflation levels. Deflation Prevention: In times of low inflation or deflation risk, a stronger currency can exacerbate these pressures by making imports cheaper. Economic Stability: Managing currency strength is seen as a way to maintain overall economic stability and support growth. For years, the SNB has been a prominent player in this space, accumulating a large balance sheet of foreign currency reserves as a result of its intervention efforts to keep the Swiss Franc from strengthening too much. What is the US Treasury Watch List and Why Does it Matter? The US Treasury watch list is part of a semi-annual report to Congress that identifies countries engaging in currency practices that could potentially harm US economic interests. Being placed on this list doesn’t automatically mean a country is labeled a currency manipulator, but it signals that the US Treasury is closely monitoring its actions. The criteria the US Treasury uses typically involve three main points: A significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States. A material current account surplus. Persistent, one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market. Switzerland has appeared on this list because it often meets the first two criteria and has historically engaged in substantial FX intervention . While being on the watch list doesn’t trigger immediate penalties, it increases scrutiny and can lead to further analysis and potential consultations. Avoiding the more serious designation of ‘currency manipulator’ is a clear objective for countries on the list, as that could potentially lead to punitive measures or trade restrictions. The Crucial Shift: SNB Pauses Interventions Amidst Scrutiny In light of being on the US Treasury watch list , the SNB has made a notable adjustment to its policy regarding FX intervention . Instead of actively selling Francs (buying foreign currency) to weaken the currency, the bank has indicated it is refraining from such interventions. This marks a significant pivot from its previous, more interventionist stance. This strategic change is largely seen as a direct response to the pressure and scrutiny from the United States. By stepping back from large-scale currency purchases, the SNB aims to avoid meeting the criteria for persistent, one-sided intervention, thereby reducing the risk of being labeled a currency manipulation country. This decision isn’t just technical; it’s a major policy signal. It suggests that external diplomatic and economic pressures are influencing the SNB’s operational toolkit, at least for the time being. The priority appears to be navigating the complex international landscape and maintaining good economic relations, particularly with a major trading partner like the United States. How Does This Impact the Swiss Franc (CHF)? When a central bank steps away from actively weakening its currency through FX intervention , the natural forces of the market tend to take over more prominently. For the Swiss Franc , which is often seen as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty, this typically means potential for appreciation. Without the SNB acting as a consistent buyer of foreign currency (seller of CHF), demand for the Franc relative to other currencies could push its value higher. This can have several effects: Stronger CHF/USD and CHF/EUR pairs: The Franc may gain ground against the US Dollar and the Euro. Impact on Swiss Exports: A stronger Franc makes Swiss exports more expensive abroad, potentially challenging export-oriented industries. Impact on Imports: Conversely, a stronger Franc makes imports cheaper, which can help dampen inflation. Safe-Haven Flows: In times of market stress, the CHF might see even stronger inflows without SNB resistance. Market participants are now closely watching the Swiss Franc ‘s movements, aware that the SNB’s ‘hand’ is less visible in the market than it used to be. The currency’s value will likely be more determined by interest rate differentials, global risk sentiment, and other macroeconomic factors. Broader Implications: Currency Manipulation and Global Markets The situation with the SNB and the US Treasury watch list highlights the ongoing tensions and debates surrounding currency valuations in the global economy. While countries have sovereign rights to manage their monetary policy, their actions can have significant spillover effects on other nations, particularly through trade competitiveness. This scenario serves as a reminder that: Currency Policy is Interconnected: One country’s currency management impacts others. Trade and Currency are Linked: Trade imbalances often fuel discussions about currency valuation. Political Factors Influence Central Banks: External political and diplomatic considerations can influence central bank decisions, even for independent institutions like the SNB. For investors and traders, including those in the cryptocurrency space, these developments are relevant because they speak to broader shifts in global liquidity, trade flows, and risk dynamics. Changes in major currency pairs like CHF/USD or CHF/EUR can influence capital movements and market sentiment more broadly. Benefits and Challenges of the SNB’s Policy Shift This change in approach comes with its own set of pros and cons for Switzerland: Benefits: Reduced risk of US designation as a currency manipulation country, avoiding potential trade repercussions or diplomatic strain. Increased credibility regarding adherence to international norms on currency practices. Allows market forces to play a larger role in determining the Swiss Franc ‘s value. Challenges: Loss of a key tool for managing the strength of the Swiss Franc . Potential for significant CHF appreciation, which could negatively impact export-oriented industries and economic growth. Less control over imported inflation dynamics. Increased reliance on interest rates as the primary monetary policy tool. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers Given the SNB’s altered stance, what should market participants, especially those following global macro trends, keep in mind? Monitor CHF Crosses: Pay close attention to how the Swiss Franc trades against major currencies like the USD and EUR. Look for signs of sustained appreciation. Watch SNB Communication: While they’ve paused intervention, the SNB’s forward guidance and economic outlook statements remain critical for understanding their policy intentions. Assess Safe-Haven Demand: The CHF’s role as a safe haven might become more pronounced without intervention dampening its rise during risk-off periods. Consider Macro Impact: Understand that a stronger CHF can have implications for global capital flows and the competitiveness of European economies, which can indirectly affect broader market sentiment and asset valuations, including in crypto. This situation underscores the importance of staying informed about central bank actions and international economic policy, as they form the backdrop against which all financial markets operate. Conclusion: A Strategic Pause Under Pressure The Swiss National Bank ‘s decision to step back from active FX intervention is a direct consequence of being placed on the US Treasury watch list . This strategic pause highlights the influence of international pressure on domestic monetary policy decisions. While it helps Switzerland avoid potential accusations of currency manipulation and maintains diplomatic relations, it also means the SNB loses a significant tool for managing the strength of the Swiss Franc . This shift is poised to allow market forces greater sway over the CHF’s value, with potential implications for Swiss exports and the broader currency landscape. It’s a clear example of how global economic interdependence and diplomatic considerations shape the actions of even the most independent central banks.

For too long, navigating the legal landscape for digital assets in the United States has felt like traversing a maze with shifting walls. This uncertainty impacts everything from innovation and investment to consumer protection. That’s why the recent news surrounding Brian Quintenz, the nominee for chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is generating significant interest. Quintenz has stepped forward with a clear pledge: to bring much-needed clarity to US crypto regulation . Who is Brian Quintenz and Why Does His Nomination Matter for Brian Quintenz CFTC ? Brian Quintenz isn’t a newcomer to the regulatory or crypto space. He previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2020, giving him direct experience within the agency he’s now nominated to lead. Following his time at the CFTC, he took on a role as head of policy for a16z crypto, the dedicated crypto fund of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. This background is particularly noteworthy. His tenure at a16z crypto placed him at the heart of the industry, engaging directly with developers, entrepreneurs, and investors grappling with the existing regulatory ambiguity. This unique perspective—having seen the challenges from both the regulator’s and the innovator’s side—positions him to potentially bridge gaps and foster a more workable framework for Brian Quintenz CFTC leadership. His nomination hearing is a critical step, scheduled for June 11, where he will outline his vision and face questions from lawmakers. The Urgent Need for Clear US Crypto Regulation Why is regulatory clarity such a hot topic? The current state of US crypto regulation is often described as fragmented and inconsistent. Different agencies, primarily the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have asserted jurisdiction over various aspects of the crypto market, sometimes leading to overlapping or conflicting guidance. This lack of a unified, clear framework creates significant hurdles: Hindered Innovation: Startups and established companies are hesitant to build and launch new products or services for fear of running afoul of regulations that aren’t clearly defined. Investor Uncertainty: Both retail and institutional investors face confusion regarding which assets are regulated how, and under whose authority, impacting confidence and participation. Market Fragmentation: The lack of clear rules can push legitimate crypto businesses to operate outside the U.S., potentially limiting domestic growth and job creation. Enforcement by Litigation: Without clear rules, regulators have often resorted to enforcement actions to signal their stance, which is costly, time-consuming, and reactive rather than proactive. Quintenz’s pledge directly addresses this pain point, suggesting a potential shift towards a more proactive and structured approach to establishing US crypto regulation . Understanding the CFTC’s Role in CFTC Crypto Regulation The CFTC’s primary mandate is to protect market participants from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to futures, swaps, and other derivatives. Under current law, the CFTC generally regulates crypto assets that are deemed commodities. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, have been referred to as commodities by CFTC officials in the past, particularly in the context of futures markets. The CFTC’s involvement in CFTC crypto regulation has historically focused on derivatives products like Bitcoin futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges. They have also pursued enforcement actions against platforms and individuals involved in fraudulent activities related to commodity-classified digital assets. Quintenz, having served at the CFTC, is intimately familiar with the agency’s powers and limitations. His nomination signals an intent to leverage the CFTC’s existing authority while potentially advocating for legislative changes to broaden or clarify its role in overseeing the broader spot crypto market, especially concerning preventing manipulation and ensuring market integrity. This focus on market oversight is a critical component of his stated goals. Tackling the Complex Challenge of Token Classification One of the most significant challenges in regulating crypto assets is determining what they actually are from a legal perspective. Are they securities, commodities, or something else entirely? This question of token classification is central because it dictates which regulatory body has primary jurisdiction (SEC for securities, CFTC for commodities, etc.) and what rules apply. Quintenz’s emphasis on token classification is crucial. A clear, consistent framework for classifying digital assets based on their characteristics and use cases could provide the foundational clarity the market desperately needs. This isn’t a simple task, as many tokens have hybrid features or evolve over time. Potential approaches to token classification could involve: Developing specific tests tailored to digital assets, potentially building upon existing frameworks like the Howey Test (used for securities). Creating new legislative categories for certain types of tokens. Providing clear guidance on when a token transitions from potentially being a security (e.g., during a fundraising event) to potentially being a commodity or utility token (e.g., when a network becomes decentralized and functional). Quintenz’s background, including his time engaging with the diverse range of projects at a16z crypto, suggests he understands the nuances involved in token classification and the need for a practical, forward-looking approach. What Could Quintenz’s Leadership Mean for Crypto Market Oversight ? Beyond classification, Quintenz’s focus on crypto market oversight aims to ensure fair and orderly markets, prevent manipulation, and protect participants. This involves looking at exchanges, trading platforms, and other intermediaries. Effective crypto market oversight under the CFTC could involve: Establishing clear rules for crypto trading platforms that list commodity-classified digital assets. Implementing surveillance mechanisms to detect fraud and manipulation across these markets. Setting standards for customer protection and custody of digital assets under CFTC purview. Working with international regulators to address the global nature of crypto markets. His experience at the CFTC gives him insight into the tools and strategies the agency uses for traditional markets. The challenge and opportunity lie in adapting these tools effectively for the unique characteristics of decentralized digital asset markets. His time in the industry likely provided valuable insights into the operational realities and technological capabilities of crypto platforms, which could inform a pragmatic approach to crypto market oversight . Potential Benefits of Quintenz’s Approach If Quintenz is confirmed and successfully implements his vision for clear US crypto regulation , the benefits could be substantial: Increased Investment: Institutional investors, often wary of regulatory uncertainty, could feel more comfortable entering the market. Boosted Innovation: Developers and entrepreneurs would have a clearer path to build and deploy new technologies and services within the U.S. Enhanced Consumer Protection: Clear rules can better protect individuals from scams, fraud, and market manipulation. Greater Market Integrity: Defined oversight helps build trust in the market’s fairness and reliability. U.S. Leadership: Establishing a clear framework could position the U.S. as a leader in the global digital asset space. Challenges on the Horizon Despite the optimistic outlook, the path to clear CFTC crypto regulation and broader U.S. clarity is not without challenges: Congressional Action: Much of the desired clarity may require new legislation from Congress, which can be a slow and politically complex process. Inter-Agency Coordination: Effective regulation requires seamless cooperation between the CFTC, SEC, and other relevant bodies like the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve. Historical tensions or differing views can complicate this. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance between protecting investors and fostering technological advancement is a delicate act. Overly strict rules could stifle innovation. Market Volatility and Evolution: The crypto market is constantly evolving with new assets and technologies, requiring regulations to be adaptable and forward-thinking. Looking Ahead: The June 11th Hearing and Beyond The upcoming nomination hearing on June 11th will be a crucial moment. It will provide the first public opportunity for Quintenz to elaborate on his plans for US crypto regulation , his approach to token classification , and his strategy for crypto market oversight under the banner of CFTC crypto regulation . Lawmakers will likely probe his views on key issues, his relationship with other regulators, and how he plans to navigate the complex political landscape. His confirmation, if it occurs, would place someone with direct industry experience and a stated commitment to clarity at the helm of a key U.S. financial regulator during a pivotal time for digital assets. While significant legislative hurdles may remain, a clear, proactive stance from the CFTC under his leadership could provide a vital piece of the regulatory puzzle, offering a potential blueprint for other agencies and Congress to follow. A Compelling Summary Brian Quintenz’s nomination for CFTC chair and his pledge to clarify US crypto regulation represent a significant development for the digital asset space. With his unique background spanning both regulatory enforcement and direct industry policy, he is positioned to potentially bring a pragmatic and informed approach to complex issues like token classification and crypto market oversight . While challenges remain, particularly regarding legislative action and inter-agency coordination, a confirmed Quintenz could spearhead efforts within the CFTC to provide the clarity that the market desperately needs, fostering greater innovation, investment, and protection within the rapidly evolving world of crypto assets under clear CFTC crypto regulation .

U.S Representative William Timmons from South Carolina is urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to release internal documents explaining its changing stance on Ethereum’s legal status over the years. Asking for Ethereum Internal Documents In his letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins , Timmons expressed concern over what he described as the SEC’s “zigzagging” behavior when it comes to ETH. He noted that the public and crypto market participants deserve transparency, especially after years of mixed signals from the agency. To get to the bottom of it, Timmons has requested key internal documents from the SEC. These include: Emails discussing Ethereum and whether it qualifies as a security Records about the ETH 2.0 investigation Files titled “ETH – Security or Not” and similar subjects These documents were previously identified in a lawsuit involving Coinbase but had not been shared publicly. 2018 Promise, 2025 Confusion Back in 2018, the SEC’s Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, stated that Ether and Bitcoin would not be treated as securities. This made people in the crypto community feel more secure. But, under Chair Gary Gensler and the Biden administration, the rules seem less clear, as they refused to offer more clarity on their security status. Meanwhile, Timmons pointed out that this confusion is bad for businesses and for regular people who are interested in crypto. He said, “The American people and the crypto community deserve transparency as Congress moves forward with the CLARITY Act.” I just sent a letter to SEC Chair Atkins requesting documents on the SEC’s inconsistent treatment of ETH under Chair Gensler and the Biden administration.

A recent announcement from Riot Platforms has caught the attention of the market: the company has offloaded a significant portion of its holdings in fellow Bitcoin Mining firm, Bitfarms. This move, involving the sale of 1.75 million Bitfarms shares valued at approximately $1.58 million, reduces Riot’s stake and potentially reshapes the competitive landscape. Understanding the Riot Platforms Sale Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), a prominent player in the North American Bitcoin mining sector, disclosed the sale of 1.75 million shares of its competitor, Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF). This transaction was reported by CoinDesk and represents a notable divestment. Here are the key details of the sale: Shares Sold: 1,750,000 Bitfarms shares Estimated Value: Approximately $1.58 million Previous Stake: Not explicitly stated in the snippet, but context implies it was higher than the resulting stake. Resulting Stake: Riot’s ownership in Bitfarms is now reduced to 14.3%. This sale comes after a period of heightened interaction between the two companies, stemming from Riot’s earlier attempts to acquire Bitfarms. A Look Back: The Riot-Bitfarms Saga It’s impossible to discuss Riot’s sale of Bitfarms shares without acknowledging the recent history between the two entities. For a period, Riot Platforms pursued an acquisition of Bitfarms, aiming to create a mining giant. This pursuit led to considerable tension and a public management dispute between the two companies. Key points from that period include: Riot’s unsolicited acquisition proposal. Bitfarms’ resistance to the takeover bid. Public exchanges and disagreements over company valuation and strategy. The eventual settlement of the management dispute in September of the previous year. The settlement seemingly cooled the acquisition ambitions, and this recent sale indicates a further step away from deep entanglement between the two, at least from Riot’s perspective as a major shareholder. Why Did Riot Platforms Sell? Exploring Potential Reasons While the official reason for the sale hasn’t been detailed beyond the announcement itself, market observers and analysts can speculate on several potential drivers behind Riot Platforms’ decision to offload Bitfarms shares: 1. Capital Allocation Strategy: Riot may be raising capital for its own operational needs, expansion plans, or investments in its core infrastructure. Selling a non-controlling stake in a competitor can be a way to unlock value from an investment that is no longer strategic or has served its purpose. 2. Strategic Refocus: The sale could signal Riot’s intention to focus purely on its internal growth and operations rather than maintaining a significant stake in a direct competitor, especially after the failed acquisition attempt and settled dispute. 3. Market Conditions: Given the volatility inherent in Crypto Mining Stocks , Riot might believe this is an opportune time to realize gains or limit exposure to a specific asset, potentially re-deploying funds into areas they control directly. 4. Reducing Exposure Post-Dispute: Following a public dispute and settled differences, reducing a large ownership stake might simply be a clean way for both companies to move forward independently without one holding a significant influence over the other. Without direct commentary from Riot Platforms, these remain potential explanations, but they highlight the strategic considerations major companies in the Bitcoin Mining space face. What Does This Sale Mean for RIOT Stock and BITF Stock? For investors holding or considering RIOT Stock and BITF Stock , this sale carries different implications: For RIOT Stock: The sale injects approximately $1.58 million in capital into Riot’s treasury. While not a massive sum for a company of Riot’s size, it adds liquidity. It reduces Riot’s exposure to the performance of Bitfarms. Riot’s future will now be less tied to BITF’s operational successes or challenges. It could be interpreted positively as Riot focusing on its core business, or neutrally as a portfolio adjustment. For BITF Stock: The sale removes a large shareholder from Bitfarms’ cap table. While Riot still holds a significant 14.3%, the reduced stake means Riot’s influence or potential future actions (like further sales) are somewhat lessened. Depending on how the shares were sold (e.g., on the open market), it could potentially exert temporary selling pressure on BITF shares. It solidifies Bitfarms’ independence from Riot following the failed acquisition attempt. The market’s reaction to this news will ultimately determine the short-term price impact on both stocks, but the strategic implications are clear: Riot is reducing its direct investment link to Bitfarms. Challenges and Opportunities in Bitcoin Mining The context for this sale is the dynamic and often challenging Bitcoin Mining industry. Miners face numerous factors influencing their profitability and strategy: Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Mining revenue is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate wildly. Increasing Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining increases, requiring more computational power for the same reward. Energy Costs: Electricity is the primary operational cost, and volatile or high energy prices can significantly impact margins. Halving Events: The periodic halving of the Bitcoin block reward (the most recent one occurred recently) cuts the primary source of revenue for miners in half, forcing them to become more efficient or find alternative revenue streams. Hardware Costs: Acquiring and maintaining the latest generation of mining rigs requires significant capital investment. Opportunities: Technological Advancements: Development of more efficient mining hardware (ASICs) can provide a competitive edge. Favorable Energy Deals: Securing low-cost, stable, and potentially renewable energy sources is crucial for profitability. Scaling Operations: Building large-scale, efficient data centers can lower per-unit costs. Vertical Integration: Some miners explore hosting services, equipment repair, or even proprietary mining pool operations. Strategic Capital Management: Moves like the one made by Riot – selling non-core assets – demonstrate active management to navigate the capital-intensive nature of the business. Riot’s sale of Bitfarms shares can be seen as part of a broader strategy to navigate these challenges and capitalize on opportunities, potentially freeing up resources to tackle internal goals or react to market shifts. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors interested in Crypto Mining Stocks like RIOT and BITF, this event underscores several important points: Monitor Strategic Moves: Pay attention to how major miners manage their assets, raise capital, and adjust their investment portfolios. These actions can signal confidence (or lack thereof) in certain areas or strategies. Understand Company Relationships: Be aware of significant cross-holdings or past acquisition attempts between companies in the same sector. These relationships can influence decision-making. Assess Capital Needs: Consider whether a company might need to raise funds through equity sales, debt, or asset divestitures, especially in the wake of the halving and ongoing operational costs. Evaluate Core Business Strength: Ultimately, the performance of RIOT Stock and BITF Stock will depend heavily on their core mining efficiency, energy strategy, balance sheet health, and execution capabilities in a post-halving environment. While the $1.58 million sale is relatively small in the grand scheme of Riot’s market capitalization, it’s a tangible action that reflects strategic thinking within the company. Conclusion: A Strategic Adjustment in the Mining Landscape Riot Platforms’ decision to sell 1.75 million Bitfarms shares for $1.58 million marks a notable step in the relationship between the two Bitcoin Mining companies. Following a settled dispute over a failed acquisition attempt, this divestment reduces Riot’s stake to 14.3% and signals a potential strategic adjustment. Whether driven by capital needs, a refocus on core operations, or a response to market conditions, the sale highlights the dynamic capital management required in the volatile crypto mining sector. For investors, it’s a reminder to look beyond headlines and consider the strategic implications of such moves on both the selling and holding companies within the competitive landscape of Crypto Mining Stocks .

Specifically, community members are reporting that Alby has withdrawn funds from their inactive Bitcoin wallet accounts without explicit recent permission. This development, initially highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X, has understandably caused significant concern and discussion within the crypto community, bringing the spotlight onto platform terms of service and how user funds are managed. What Exactly Happened with the Alby Wallet and User Funds? The core of the issue stems from Alby’s terms of service, particularly as they apply to certain types of accounts created in the past. According to reports and a look at Alby’s stated policies, the platform has a provision regarding shared wallets linked to legacy accounts. These are accounts established in 2023 or earlier. The policy reportedly states that if such a shared wallet remains inactive for a continuous period of 12 months – defined as having no transactions whatsoever – Alby reserves the right to deduct the full balance held within that specific wallet. This action, reportedly taken under the terms of this specific crypto wallet policy , has led to users finding their Bitcoin funds depleted without a recent, direct notification or request for permission for the withdrawal itself. While the policy may be written into the terms users agreed to, the practical outcome of losing funds from an seemingly forgotten or inactive account has sparked significant criticism. Understanding Alby’s Crypto Wallet Policy on Inactivity To fully grasp the situation, it is crucial to understand the context of Alby’s operations. Alby functions as a browser extension and platform primarily focused on connecting users to the Bitcoin and Lightning Network. It facilitates payments and interactions within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Like many services that handle user assets, even in a partially custodial or facilitated manner, platforms often have terms governing inactive accounts. However, the specific nature of deducting the entire balance from an inactive Bitcoin wallet associated with legacy accounts is what has caused alarm. Users in the crypto space often hold a strong belief in sovereignty over their assets, encapsulated by the phrase “not your keys, not your coin.” While Alby for some functions involves custodial elements (especially for Lightning or simplified user experience), users still expect a high degree of control and security for their user funds . Key aspects of the reported policy: Applies to shared wallets. Linked to legacy accounts (created in 2023 or earlier). Triggered by 12 consecutive months of inactivity (no transactions). Allows deduction of the full wallet balance. This differs from standard practices like applying small inactivity fees, which are sometimes seen in traditional finance or even some older online service accounts. The deduction of the full balance is perceived by many as a drastic measure. Why Does an Inactive Bitcoin Wallet Policy Matter So Much? The reaction to Alby’s action highlights fundamental expectations within the cryptocurrency community regarding asset ownership and platform responsibility. When users deposit Bitcoin funds into a wallet or onto a platform, they expect those funds to remain accessible and secure, barring explicit user action or perhaps extreme, clearly communicated circumstances like platform insolvency (which is not the case here). The concept of an inactive Bitcoin wallet losing its balance due to a policy, even if technically agreed upon in terms of service, raises questions about: User Awareness: Were users sufficiently aware of this specific clause, especially for older accounts? Terms of service documents can be lengthy and complex. Communication: Was there adequate recent communication or warning sent to users with potentially affected inactive Bitcoin wallet balances before the deduction took place? Proportionality: Is deducting the full balance a proportionate response to account inactivity? Trust: Actions like this can erode trust in platforms, even those facilitating beneficial services like the Lightning Network. Users need confidence that their user funds are safe. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of understanding the specific terms governing any platform where you hold cryptocurrency, whether it is an exchange, a custodial wallet, or a service like the Alby wallet . Protecting Your User Funds: Actionable Insights For users concerned about their assets, particularly those using or who have used an Alby wallet or similar services, several actionable steps can be taken: Check Your Alby Account: If you have an Alby account, especially one created before 2024, log in and check your balance and transaction history. Verify the status of any wallets you may have. Review Terms of Service: Make it a practice to review the terms and conditions of any platform where you store or manage cryptocurrency. Pay close attention to clauses regarding inactivity, fees, and asset handling. Understand the specific crypto wallet policy of each service you use. Understand Wallet Types: Differentiate between non-custodial wallets (where you hold the private keys) and custodial or semi-custodial solutions (where the platform holds the keys on your behalf). Custodial solutions inherently carry counterparty risk and are subject to the platform’s policies. Alby, especially for simplified Lightning use, involves elements of platform management of funds. Maintain Activity: If you have funds in a wallet or on a platform with an inactivity policy, make a small transaction periodically (e.g., once every few months) to ensure it is registered as active. Even sending a few satoshis can suffice. Consolidate Funds: For significant amounts of Bitcoin funds , consider holding them in a non-custodial wallet where you control the private keys. Use platforms like Alby primarily for smaller, transactional amounts if you are uncomfortable with their specific policies regarding inactivity. Contact Support: If you believe funds were incorrectly deducted or you need clarification on your account status and the crypto wallet policy , contact Alby support directly. This situation underscores that the responsibility for safeguarding user funds ultimately lies with the user being informed and proactive about how their assets are held and managed by third-party services. Broader Implications for Crypto Wallet Policy and User Trust The incident with the Alby wallet is more than just an isolated event; it highlights broader tensions and challenges in the cryptocurrency space: Balancing Usability and Sovereignty: Platforms like Alby aim to make using Bitcoin and Lightning easier, which often involves abstracting away some complexities, sometimes leading to solutions that are not strictly non-custodial. Finding the right balance between ease of use and ensuring users retain ultimate control and understanding of their Bitcoin funds is an ongoing challenge. Transparency: While the policy might be in the terms, the lack of perceived clear, recent communication before the action for legacy inactive Bitcoin wallet holders is a major point of contention. Platforms need to be hyper-transparent, especially when policies can lead to loss of assets. The “Fine Print” Problem: This event serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of reading and understanding the terms of service, no matter how tedious it seems. A platform’s crypto wallet policy is legally binding. Industry Standards: The crypto industry is still maturing. Establishing clearer norms around handling inactive accounts, especially concerning forfeiture of assets, is important for building long-term trust. Ultimately, trust is paramount in the relationship between users and crypto platforms. Incidents where user funds are affected unexpectedly, even based on existing terms, can damage that trust and reinforce the need for users to be vigilant and informed. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Inactive Bitcoin Wallet Holders The reports of Alby withdrawing funds from inactive Bitcoin wallet balances associated with legacy accounts have sent ripples through the community, prompting discussions about platform policies, user awareness, and the safety of user funds . While Alby’s actions appear to be based on a specific clause within their crypto wallet policy for older, inactive shared wallets, the lack of perceived clear communication and the nature of deducting the full balance have rightly raised concerns. This situation serves as a critical reminder for everyone holding cryptocurrency on third-party platforms: understand the terms, stay aware of your account status, and consider the risks associated with custodial solutions. For those with an Alby wallet , especially older ones, checking your account and activity status is a prudent step. As the crypto space evolves, clear communication and user-friendly policies that respect the principle of asset sovereignty will be key to building enduring trust.

Recent analysis from Citi indicates a significant potential for JPY underperformance , a forecast that warrants attention from investors monitoring global trends. What is Behind Citi’s JPY Underperformance Forecast? Citi’s view on the potential weakness of the Japanese Yen stems from several converging macroeconomic factors. Analysts point primarily to the divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of Japan and other major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Monetary Policy Divergence: While other central banks have aggressively tightened policy to combat inflation, the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose stance, keeping interest rates exceptionally low. This creates a significant yield differential, making Yen-denominated assets less attractive compared to those in regions with higher rates. Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between Japanese interest rates and those in the US and Europe remains wide. This encourages ‘carry trade’ strategies, where investors borrow in low-yielding Yen and invest in higher-yielding currencies, putting downward pressure on the Yen. Global Economic Context: The global economic outlook, coupled with commodity price movements and trade balances, also plays a role in currency valuations. Citi’s Yen forecast considers these external pressures on Japan’s economy and currency. How Does the Bank of Japan’s Stance Impact the Yen Forecast? The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is a central player in the Yen forecast . Its commitment to yield curve control (YCC) and negative interest rates, despite global inflationary pressures, is a primary driver of the Yen’s weakness. While there has been speculation about potential shifts in BoJ policy, the bank has largely maintained its accommodative stance, reinforcing the yield differential that weighs on the currency. Any future adjustments to YCC or interest rates by the Bank of Japan would be a critical event for the Forex market and could significantly alter the Yen’s trajectory. However, Citi’s current analysis suggests that the conditions supporting Yen weakness are likely to persist in the near term. Exploring the Implications for the Forex Market Citi’s expectation of JPY underperformance has direct implications for participants in the Forex market . Traders and investors holding or trading Yen pairs (like USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY) need to factor this outlook into their strategies. A weaker Yen can impact export competitiveness for Japan and influence global trade flows. For those trading other currency pairs, understanding the Yen’s potential moves is important as it can influence overall market sentiment and cross-currency correlations. The carry trade, fueled by the BoJ’s low rates, remains a prominent strategy, contributing to demand for other currencies against the Yen. This dynamic is a key feature of the current Forex market landscape. What Does Citi’s Analysis Suggest for Investors? For investors, particularly those with international portfolios or exposure to currency risk, Citi’s Citi analysis provides a potential heads-up. While this is not investment advice, the outlook suggests considering the following: Currency Exposure: Reviewing exposure to the Japanese Yen in investment portfolios. Carry Trade Opportunities: Understanding the potential for continued carry trade dynamics in the Forex market. Macroeconomic Monitoring: Keeping a close watch on Bank of Japan policy announcements and global interest rate movements. Diversification: Considering diversification strategies that account for potential currency volatility. Citi’s perspective highlights the importance of staying informed about macroeconomic trends, as they ripple through traditional financial markets and can indirectly influence risk sentiment in markets like cryptocurrency. Challenges and Uncertainties in the JPY Forecast While Citi’s analysis points to potential JPY underperformance , the future is never without uncertainty. Several factors could challenge this outlook: Unexpected BoJ Shift: A sudden or faster-than-anticipated pivot in monetary policy by the Bank of Japan could lead to rapid Yen strengthening. Global Economic Shock: A significant global recession or geopolitical event could trigger safe-haven flows into the Yen, despite yield differentials. Changes in Inflation: While Japan’s inflation has risen, a sharp decline could reduce pressure on the BoJ to change policy, while persistent high inflation could eventually force their hand. These potential shifts underscore the need for continuous monitoring and risk management in the Forex market . Conclusion: Navigating Potential Yen Weakness Citi’s analysis serves as a significant indicator for market participants. The potential for sustained JPY underperformance is grounded in the clear divergence of monetary policy, driven primarily by the Bank of Japan ‘s unique stance amidst global tightening. This outlook impacts the Forex market directly, influencing trading strategies and investment decisions. While challenges and uncertainties exist, understanding the core drivers behind this Yen forecast , as highlighted by Citi analysis , is vital for navigating the complexities of the current macroeconomic environment.

The founder of MicroStrategy, a company that has made significant headlines for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, recently turned his attention to one of the globe’s largest and most influential companies: Apple. Saylor took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to make a compelling suggestion that sent ripples through both the tech and crypto communities: Apple should consider adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. Who is Michael Saylor and Why Does His Opinion Matter? Michael Saylor is not just the head of MicroStrategy; he has become one of the most vocal and prominent advocates for Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy began aggressively acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020, positioning the company as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency globally. This strategy shifted MicroStrategy’s focus, making it almost a proxy for Bitcoin investment for many investors. Saylor’s rationale is rooted in macroeconomics. He views traditional fiat currencies as subject to inflation and believes that holding large cash reserves can lead to a loss of purchasing power over time. Bitcoin, in his view, serves as a superior store of value – a form of digital gold that is scarce, decentralized, and resistant to censorship and inflation. His conviction is backed by MicroStrategy’s multi-billion dollar investment, demonstrating a deep commitment to this belief. Therefore, when Michael Saylor speaks about corporate Bitcoin adoption, the market listens, especially when the target company is a titan like Apple. The Suggestion: Apple Should Buy BTC The core of the recent discussion stems from Michael Saylor’s direct post on X. He specifically urged Apple to buy BTC, framing it as a strategic financial move. The suggestion immediately sparked widespread debate, given Apple’s immense cash reserves and its status as a technological trendsetter. Apple holds a massive amount of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet – often exceeding tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars. Managing this capital effectively is crucial for shareholder value. Saylor’s argument is that a portion of this vast reserve would be better preserved and potentially grown by converting it into Bitcoin, rather than holding it in traditional, low-yield, inflation-susceptible assets. What are the Potential Benefits of Apple Buying Bitcoin? Considering a move as significant as Apple buying Bitcoin involves weighing numerous potential advantages. For a company of Apple’s scale, the implications are vast and could set a precedent for other corporations. Balance Sheet Protection: Like MicroStrategy, Apple could use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, preserving the purchasing power of its capital reserves over the long term. Innovation Signal: Investing in Bitcoin would signal Apple’s forward-thinking approach and potential interest in the broader Web3 and blockchain space, aligning with its image as a leader in technology and innovation. Potential for Capital Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation. A strategic allocation could potentially enhance shareholder value through capital gains. Attracting Talent and Customers: A move into Bitcoin could resonate with a demographic interested in digital assets and decentralized technologies, potentially attracting both employees and consumers. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin (relative to traditional financial markets) could provide diversification benefits to Apple’s corporate treasury portfolio. What Challenges Could Apple Face with Bitcoin? Despite the potential benefits, Apple buying Bitcoin is far from a simple decision. There are significant hurdles and risks that a company of Apple’s profile would need to navigate carefully. Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. Holding a volatile asset on the balance sheet could expose Apple to significant quarterly fluctuations in reported earnings, which might concern investors accustomed to stable financial reporting. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Apple would need to consider potential changes in regulations, tax treatment, and compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. Shareholder Concerns: Some shareholders might be risk-averse or skeptical of cryptocurrencies, viewing a Bitcoin investment as speculative rather than prudent treasury management. Reputational Risk: Associating the Apple brand with a volatile and sometimes controversial asset like Bitcoin could carry reputational risks, particularly if there are significant price drops or negative public perception events related to crypto. Operational Complexity: Managing a large Bitcoin position involves significant operational and security considerations, including custody solutions, accounting treatment, and internal controls. How Could Institutional Adoption Impact Bitcoin? The concept of institutional adoption, where large corporations and financial institutions invest in or use Bitcoin, is a major theme in the crypto market. MicroStrategy’s move was a catalyst, followed by companies like Tesla and Block (formerly Square). If Apple were to buy BTC, the impact on the Bitcoin market would likely be profound. Apple’s scale means even a small percentage of its cash reserves allocated to Bitcoin would represent a significant purchase volume, potentially driving up the price. More importantly, it would lend immense credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, potentially encouraging other large corporations and institutional investors to follow suit. This widespread institutional adoption could increase market liquidity, reduce volatility over the long term (as more supply is held by long-term investors), and accelerate the development of infrastructure around Bitcoin. Why Does Michael Saylor Believe Apple Should Buy BTC? Michael Saylor’s advocacy for Apple buying Bitcoin stems directly from his core investment thesis. He sees Apple as a prime candidate for the reasons mentioned earlier: a massive cash hoard eroding in value due to inflation, a reputation for innovation that aligns with pioneering new financial strategies, and the potential to set a powerful example for the rest of the corporate world. Saylor often emphasizes that holding cash is not a risk-free strategy; it carries the implicit risk of losing purchasing power. He positions Bitcoin as a superior alternative for preserving capital over decades. For a company like Apple, planning for the very long term, this argument holds significant weight in Saylor’s view. He likely sees it as a logical extension of corporate finance in the digital age. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For While Apple has not publicly indicated any plans to buy Bitcoin for its treasury (beyond potentially holding some for specific services like Apple Pay integrations with crypto platforms, which is different from treasury management), Michael Saylor’s suggestion highlights a significant potential future trend. For investors and market watchers, key things to observe include: Any official statements or hints from Apple executives regarding their treasury strategy or views on digital assets. Other large corporations making similar moves to MicroStrategy, Tesla, or Block, indicating a broader trend of institutional adoption. Regulatory developments in major economies concerning corporate holdings of cryptocurrencies. Market reaction to Saylor’s comments and whether they inspire further debate or action within the corporate finance world. The discussion initiated by Michael Saylor serves as a reminder of the ongoing convergence between traditional finance, corporate strategy, and the burgeoning world of digital assets like Bitcoin. Conclusion: A Bold Suggestion for a Tech Giant Michael Saylor’s call for Apple to buy Bitcoin is more than just a passing comment; it’s a strategic suggestion rooted in a deep conviction about Bitcoin’s role as a future store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic instability. While the decision rests entirely with Apple’s leadership and board, the potential benefits of preserving capital, signaling innovation, and capitalizing on potential appreciation are clear from Saylor’s perspective. However, the significant challenges related to volatility, regulation, and shareholder sentiment mean such a move would require careful consideration and planning. Regardless of whether Apple takes the plunge, the conversation sparked by Michael Saylor underscores the growing relevance of Bitcoin in corporate treasury discussions and the potential for further institutional adoption to shape the future of finance.

The Moscow Exchange (MOEX), Russia’s primary stock exchange, is making a notable move by stepping further into the digital asset space. On June 10, MOEX is officially launching its own Bitcoin index , a benchmark designed to track the price movements of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a technical addition; it signals a potential shift in how traditional financial institutions in Russia view and interact with the volatile yet captivating crypto market. Let’s dive into what this MOEX BTC index means, how it works, and why it matters. What is the Moscow Exchange Launching and Why Now? The core news is straightforward: the Moscow Exchange will start calculating and publishing the MOEXBTC index from June 10. This index is intended to provide a transparent and accessible reference point for the price of Bitcoin against the US Dollar Tether (USDT), a widely used stablecoin in the crypto trading world. While Russia’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies has historically been cautious, with outright bans on using crypto for payments, there has been a gradual exploration of how digital assets fit into the broader financial system, particularly for international trade and potentially for sophisticated investors. The decision to launch a Bitcoin index now could be interpreted in several ways: Acknowledging Market Demand: Despite regulatory hurdles, interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains high among Russian investors and businesses. Providing an index through a regulated, traditional platform like MOEX caters to this demand, even if direct trading isn’t immediately available via the index itself. Laying the Groundwork: An index is often a precursor to more complex financial products. By establishing a reliable benchmark, MOEX could be preparing for the potential introduction of Bitcoin-related derivatives, ETFs, or other instruments in the future, should the regulatory environment evolve. Integration with Global Trends: Traditional exchanges worldwide are increasingly engaging with crypto assets, offering futures, options, or indexes. MOEX’s move aligns with this global trend, ensuring it doesn’t fall behind in the evolving financial landscape. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Data services and index licensing are valuable business areas for exchanges. A popular crypto index can generate revenue and attract new participants to the platform. This move suggests a pragmatic approach from MOEX, focusing on providing data and a benchmark within the existing regulatory framework for now, while potentially positioning itself for future opportunities in the Russia crypto space. How Will the MOEX BTC Index Work? Understanding the Methodology According to reports, the MOEXBTC index won’t be based on trading activity directly on the Moscow Exchange itself, at least not initially. Instead, it will derive its value from price data aggregated from several major global cryptocurrency exchanges. Specifically, it will use data from perpetual futures and swaps contracts for the BTC/USDT pair on platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements: Data Sources: Relying on large, liquid global exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Bitget) ensures the index reflects significant trading volume and market activity. Instrument Type: Focusing on perpetual futures and swaps for BTC/USDT is interesting. These are derivative contracts that track the price of the underlying asset (Bitcoin) but don’t have an expiry date (like traditional futures). They are popular in crypto trading due to their leverage potential and funding rate mechanisms that help keep their price close to the spot price. Using these instruments for an index provides a continuous price feed and reflects the sentiment and activity in the highly liquid derivatives market. Index Calculation: MOEX will aggregate and process the price data from these sources to calculate the MOEXBTC index value. The exact weighting and calculation methodology haven’t been fully detailed in the initial reports, but standard index practices involve filtering data, handling outliers, and potentially volume-weighting prices from different sources to create a representative benchmark. Publishing: The index value will be published regularly, likely throughout the trading day (or even 24/7, given the nature of crypto markets, though MOEX traditionally operates on specific hours). This provides real-time or near-real-time tracking of Bitcoin’s price performance. By using data from perpetual swaps on major platforms, MOEX is tapping into the most active and liquid part of the global crypto market to build its Bitcoin index . This approach allows them to offer a relevant benchmark without needing to handle direct spot crypto trading on their own platform, which would likely face more complex regulatory hurdles in Russia. Significance of the MOEX Bitcoin Index for Russia and Beyond The launch of the MOEX BTC index is more than just a technical event; it carries symbolic and practical significance, particularly within the context of the Russia crypto landscape and its relationship with global finance. For Russian Investors and Institutions: Regulated Benchmark: Provides a formal, regulated reference point for Bitcoin’s price within the traditional financial system. This can make it easier for institutions and sophisticated investors to monitor Bitcoin’s performance and potentially include it in analysis or reporting. Potential for Future Products: As mentioned, an index is foundational. Its existence could pave the way for MOEX-listed products like futures, options, or even exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to Bitcoin’s price, offering regulated avenues for exposure. Increased Awareness and Legitimacy: The mere fact that Russia’s main exchange is launching a crypto index lends a degree of legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class within the country, potentially influencing public perception and future regulatory decisions. Alternative Access: For those who find direct crypto exchange access cumbersome or risky, a MOEX-provided index offers a way to track the market via a familiar, trusted platform. For the Moscow Exchange: Innovation and Modernization: Keeps MOEX relevant in a rapidly evolving financial world where digital assets are gaining prominence. Attracting New Participants: Could draw traders and investors interested in crypto but who prefer operating within the traditional exchange infrastructure. Diversifying Offerings: Adds a new asset class benchmark to its existing suite of indexes for stocks, bonds, and commodities. Data Provider Role: Enhances its position as a key financial data provider in Russia. For the Global Crypto Market: Increased Global Adoption Signal: Another traditional exchange, albeit in a complex geopolitical environment, acknowledging and creating a benchmark for Bitcoin underscores the asset’s growing global presence. Potential for Data Impact: While MOEX isn’t adding trading volume, its use of data from major exchanges reinforces their importance in global price discovery. This move is a cautious but clear step by the Moscow Exchange into the digital asset domain, reflecting a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in the modern financial landscape, even within the constraints of Russia’s current regulatory environment. Challenges and Considerations in the Russia Crypto Landscape While the launch of the MOEX BTC index is a positive step for integrating crypto into traditional finance in Russia, it’s crucial to consider the challenges and complexities inherent in the current environment. Regulatory Uncertainty: Russia’s crypto regulations are still evolving. While digital asset ownership is legal, using crypto for payments is banned. The legal status of derivative products linked to a crypto index on MOEX remains to be seen and will depend on future regulatory clarity. Geopolitical Factors: The Moscow Exchange operates within a specific geopolitical context. International sanctions and restrictions can impact its operations, access to global data sources, and the ability of international participants to interact with MOEX products, even an index. Data Reliability: While MOEX is sourcing data from major exchanges, the reliability and integrity of data from unregulated or less regulated platforms can sometimes be a concern, although top-tier exchanges generally have robust systems. MOEX will need a solid methodology to ensure the index’s accuracy. Limited Immediate Impact on Direct Trading: The index itself is a benchmark, not a trading product. Its immediate impact on direct Bitcoin trading volume within Russia or globally is likely minimal. Its value lies more in providing a reference and potentially enabling future regulated products. Investor Access: While the index is published by MOEX, direct access to view or use this index might initially be limited to professional market participants or require specific brokerage services connected to MOEX. Retail access might be indirect. Navigating the Russia crypto space requires careful attention to these factors. The index is a sign of progress, but it doesn’t instantly solve all the regulatory and operational complexities. How Does MOEX’s Move Compare to Other Crypto Index Initiatives? The Moscow Exchange isn’t the first traditional financial institution to launch a crypto index . Major exchanges and financial data providers globally have already established similar benchmarks. For instance: CME Group: Offers various crypto indexes (like the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate) which underpin its Bitcoin futures and options contracts. Nasdaq: Provides several crypto indexes, often in partnership with data firms, tracking various cryptocurrencies. S&P Dow Jones Indices: Launched cryptocurrency indexes to bring crypto assets into the fold of traditional benchmarks. Bloomberg and Refinitiv: Financial data giants that provide extensive crypto pricing and index data. MOEX’s approach of using data from major global crypto exchanges is a common method for traditional finance players entering this space without immediately launching their own spot trading platforms. However, the specific context of Russia’s regulatory environment and MOEX’s operational constraints due to sanctions make its initiative noteworthy. It highlights the persistent global interest in Bitcoin as an asset, even in jurisdictions with complex relationships with decentralized finance. The MOEXBTC index adds another data point to the growing ecosystem of crypto index offerings provided by traditional financial institutions, reflecting the asset class’s increasing integration into mainstream finance, albeit at different paces and through various models worldwide. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers What does the launch of the MOEX BTC index mean for you, whether you’re an investor, trader, or just following the market? Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on how Russia’s crypto regulations evolve following this index launch. Will it lead to more regulated products on MOEX? Will it influence the broader stance on crypto within the country? Use the Index as a Reference: While you might not trade directly on MOEX, the MOEXBTC index can serve as another data point for tracking Bitcoin’s price, particularly if you are interested in how a traditional Russian financial institution is benchmarking the asset. Understand the Data Sources: Be aware that the index is based on data from specific global exchanges and specific contract types (perpetual swaps). This might lead to slight variations compared to spot prices on other platforms or indexes based on different methodologies. Evaluate Future Products: If MOEX eventually launches products tied to the index (like futures), carefully evaluate their structure, liquidity, fees, and regulatory status before considering participation. Contextualize the News: See this as part of the broader trend of traditional finance engaging with crypto, but understand the unique regulatory and geopolitical context in which MOEX operates. This development is a fascinating case study in how traditional finance adapts to the rise of digital assets within challenging regulatory and geopolitical landscapes. It’s a step towards integrating Bitcoin into Russia’s formal financial system, even if initially just as a benchmark. Looking Ahead: What Could Follow the MOEX Bitcoin Index? The launch of the MOEXBTC index on June 10 is likely not the final chapter in the Moscow Exchange’s engagement with digital assets. The establishment of a reliable benchmark often precedes the introduction of more sophisticated financial instruments. Potential future developments could include: Bitcoin Futures or Options: Similar to CME Group, MOEX could launch derivatives contracts settled in rubles or potentially another currency, based on the MOEXBTC index. Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs): If regulations permit, MOEX could list Bitcoin-backed ETNs or potentially even ETFs, offering investors regulated exposure without direct crypto ownership. Indexes for Other Cryptocurrencies: If the Bitcoin index proves successful and regulations allow, MOEX might consider launching indexes for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Spot Trading (Longer Term): While less likely in the short term given current regulations, a long-term evolution could involve MOEX facilitating regulated spot trading of cryptocurrencies. These future steps are heavily dependent on the evolution of Russia crypto regulations. However, by creating the MOEX BTC index , MOEX is building the necessary infrastructure and gaining experience in handling crypto-related data, positioning itself to move quickly if and when the regulatory environment becomes more favorable for broader digital asset integration. Conclusion: A Key Step for Russia’s Financial Landscape The Moscow Exchange’s decision to launch a Bitcoin index is a significant milestone. Starting June 10, the MOEXBTC index will provide a regulated benchmark for Bitcoin’s price, drawing data from major global crypto exchanges. This move reflects the growing importance of digital assets and represents a cautious yet deliberate step by Russia’s main exchange to engage with the crypto market. While direct trading on MOEX isn’t part of this initial launch, the index lays crucial groundwork for potential future regulated crypto products. It signals a pragmatic approach within the complex Russia crypto landscape, acknowledging market interest and aligning with global trends of traditional finance integrating digital assets. The success and future impact of the MOEXBTC index will depend on regulatory evolution and market adoption, but its launch undeniably marks a notable moment in the intersection of traditional Russian finance and the global cryptocurrency ecosystem.

From May 29 to June 5, Santiment’s Alpha Narratives dashboard recorded a significant surge in discussions centered on artificial intelligence, surpassing even crypto-related chatter. Online conversations have revolved around concerns over AI-driven job losses, the growing role of autonomous agents, and the promise of decentralized AI infrastructure. AI Discourse Users debated both risks and rewards, weighing job displacement against productivity gains. The hype is not just philosophical; in fact, industry activity is steadily ramping up. Companies like Kite AI and the 0G Foundation are fueling development, with the latter recently launching an $88.88 million fund to back AI-integrated DeFi tools and autonomous systems. On the investor side, whale activity from figures such as James Wynn and business intelligence company Strategy has sparked renewed market confidence. Meanwhile, Solana, Loud Token, and various meme coins have enjoyed surging social engagement, as it reflected how narratives around innovation continue to move token prices. Santiment revealed that conversations have even touched on AI’s role in daily life, from driving to debugging code. Such discourse essentially reflects how deeply the technology is embedding itself across sectors. AI Integration Accelerates The latest observation comes at a time when a growing number of crypto users appear comfortable entrusting AI with their finances, according to a CoinGecko survey published recently that found a majority are willing to let AI agents manage portions of their investment portfolios. Meanwhile, the crypto mining sector is rapidly aligning with the AI boom. Riot Platforms, for example, appointed three new directors to its board in February, including one with a background in repurposing Bitcoin mining equipment for high-performance computing (HPC). Other major mining firms – Hive Digital and Hut 8 – also pivoted part of their operations toward AI workloads last year. More recently, Amazon announced a $20 billion investment to establish two AI-driven data centers in Pennsylvania. Salem Township and Falls Township are top contenders for the buildout. The project will be paired with educational and workforce training initiatives in cloud computing.

That’s the intriguing possibility raised by BitMEX Exchange co-founder, Arthur Hayes. He suggests that a specific action from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) could unleash a significant rally for Bitcoin and other risk assets. This isn’t just idle speculation; it ties into the complex interplay between global monetary policy and the crypto market. Who is Arthur Hayes and Why Listen to Him? Arthur Hayes is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for his often provocative and insightful macro-driven analysis of the crypto market. As a co-founder of BitMEX, one of the early major crypto derivatives exchanges, he has a deep understanding of market mechanics and liquidity flows. His views are closely watched because he often connects the dots between traditional finance, central bank actions, and their potential impact on digital assets like Bitcoin . When Hayes speaks about macro factors influencing crypto, the market pays attention. Understanding the Bank of Japan ‘s Unique Position While many central banks globally have been aggressively tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has largely remained an outlier. For years, the BOJ has maintained ultra-low interest rates and pursued extensive asset purchase programs – a form of Quantitative Easing – to stimulate its economy and fight deflation. This dovish stance contrasts sharply with the rate hikes seen from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and others. This divergence in policy is key to Hayes’ thesis. How Could Quantitative Easing Fuel a Bitcoin Rally? Quantitative Easing (QE) is essentially a tool central banks use to inject liquidity into the financial system. By purchasing government bonds or other assets, the central bank increases the money supply and lowers borrowing costs. The theory is that this encourages lending and investment, stimulating economic activity. However, a common side effect of prolonged QE is that it can lead to excess liquidity sloshing around the global financial system. This excess capital often seeks returns in riskier assets, including stocks, commodities, and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . Hayes’ argument is that if the Bank of Japan were to not only delay any potential move towards tightening but perhaps even ramp up its QE efforts, it would represent a significant injection of liquidity into a global system that is otherwise seeing liquidity withdrawn by other central banks. This fresh wave of liquidity could find its way into assets like Bitcoin , driving prices higher. The Specific BOJ Policy Hayes is Watching According to reports citing Hayes, the critical window he is focused on is the Bank of Japan ‘s monetary policy meeting scheduled for June 16–17. The market is closely watching whether the BOJ will signal any shift away from its ultra-loose stance, particularly regarding its yield curve control policy, which pins long-term interest rates near zero. Hayes suggests that if the BOJ decides *against* tightening at this meeting, or even signals a *continuation* or *expansion* of QE, it could be the catalyst for a significant market reaction. Why this specific meeting and this specific action? A delay in tightening by a major global central bank, especially one as significant as the BOJ, would be a dovish surprise in a world bracing for more hawkishness. This surprise could release pent-up capital flows, and given the current financial landscape, Hayes believes Bitcoin is well-positioned to benefit from this. Why Bitcoin as a Beneficiary? The source snippet highlights a crucial point: rising bond yields and default concerns have already increased institutional interest in Bitcoin as a hedge. In an environment where traditional safe havens like government bonds are becoming less attractive (due to yield volatility or default fears), and where concerns about currency devaluation persist due to central bank actions (even if others are tightening, the cumulative effect of years of QE is still felt), Bitcoin ‘s characteristics as a decentralized, hard-capped asset become more appealing. Institutions and sophisticated investors look for assets that can preserve capital or offer uncorrelated returns during times of economic uncertainty. The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against monetary inflation and systemic risk gains traction in such periods. If the Bank of Japan ‘s actions signal a continuation of policies that could be perceived as inflationary or destabilizing in the long run (by adding more liquidity), it could reinforce the case for holding Bitcoin , attracting further institutional and retail investment, and potentially triggering the rally Hayes predicts. The Macro Picture: Liquidity, Yields, and Risk Assets Let’s break down the macro forces at play: Global Liquidity: Central banks withdrawing liquidity generally pressures risk assets. The BOJ adding or maintaining significant liquidity goes against this trend, potentially creating pockets of capital seeking returns. Rising Bond Yields: When bond yields rise rapidly, it can make bonds more attractive relative to risk assets, but it can also signal underlying economic stress or inflation expectations. For institutions, navigating volatile bond markets increases the appeal of alternative hedges. Default Concerns: Fears of defaults (sovereign or corporate) push investors towards assets perceived as being outside the traditional financial system or less susceptible to counterparty risk. Bitcoin , with its decentralized nature, fits this narrative for some. These factors create a complex environment where traditional portfolio diversification is challenging. Hayes argues that in this context, a dovish surprise from the Bank of Japan could provide the specific jolt needed to send capital towards assets like Bitcoin that are seen as potential beneficiaries of or hedges against these macro trends. Potential Challenges and What to Watch For While Hayes’ thesis is compelling, it’s important to consider potential challenges: BOJ’s Actual Decision: The BOJ might surprise the market by signaling a shift towards tightening, even if minor. This would likely have the opposite effect. Other Macro Headwinds: Global recession fears, regulatory crackdowns, or other geopolitical events could overshadow the impact of the BOJ’s decision. Crypto-Specific Factors: The crypto market has its own internal dynamics, including sentiment, technological developments, and regulatory news, which can influence price independent of macro factors. Magnitude of Impact: Even if the BOJ remains dovish, the size and duration of its impact on the global liquidity pool and subsequently on Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be massive. Investors should closely monitor the official announcements from the Bank of Japan following their June meeting, paying attention not just to interest rates but also to language regarding asset purchases and yield curve control. Actionable Insights for Readers Based on this analysis: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on major central bank announcements, particularly from the Bank of Japan , and understand how they fit into the global monetary policy landscape. Understand the Macro Link: Recognize that Bitcoin ‘s price is increasingly influenced by global macro liquidity and risk sentiment, not just crypto-specific news. Consider Bitcoin ‘s Role as a Hedge: Evaluate how Bitcoin might fit into your portfolio as a potential hedge against inflation, currency debasement, or systemic risk, especially in light of current bond market conditions and default concerns. Manage Risk: Hayes’ prediction is a potential catalyst, not a certainty. Any investment based on such a prediction should be part of a well-diversified strategy with appropriate risk management. Conclusion: Will the BOJ Trigger a Bitcoin Surge? Arthur Hayes presents a clear and intriguing case: the Bank of Japan ‘s monetary policy decision in June could be the unexpected trigger for a significant Bitcoin rally. His argument hinges on the BOJ’s unique position as one of the last major central banks maintaining ultra-loose policy. Should they delay tightening or resume aggressive Quantitative Easing , the resulting injection of global liquidity, combined with existing institutional interest in Bitcoin driven by rising bond yields and default concerns, could create a powerful upward force for BTC and other risk assets. While the outcome is uncertain and other factors are at play, Hayes’ analysis provides a valuable framework for understanding how global macroeconomics continues to shape the future of the cryptocurrency market. The world will be watching the BOJ meeting closely. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

Notably, the SEC has asked prospective issuers to clarify procedures for in-kind redemption. The regulator is reportedly open to allowing staking as part of these products. Additionally, the sources noted that the agency will provide comments on the updated filings within 30 days of their submission. Solana ETF Has 90% Odds of Approval Although it is still unclear when spot Solana ETFs will be approved, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that it would “more likely” be in early Q4, 2025. “Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected,” he wrote on X. “If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — I wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest.” Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days.

More likely to be in early 4Q. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Analyst Seyffart also predicted that the odds of altcoin ETF approvals in 2025 are 90% for Solana and Litecoin . While XRP closely follows at 85%, other altcoins, including Dogecoin and HBAR, have an 80% chance of approval this year. Companies that have filed S-1s include Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton and Fidelity. Interestingly, Seyffart believes the SEC views these altcoins as commodities, a positive outlook for their approval prospects compared to securities. Source: X (James Seyffart) SOL Closely Follows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Plans Grayscale is planning to follow the blueprint it used for its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, aiming to convert its existing SOL Trust into a spot ETF. In February, the SEC formally acknowledged Grayscale’s spot Solana ETF proposal. However, in May, the agency delayed its decision, stating that it hadn’t reached any conclusions. Last month, the SEC pushed back its decision on the SOL ETF proposals from Bitwise and 21Shares. The agency noted it needs added time to sort through technical details, legal questions, and investor-protection issues. Meanwhile, Brazil’s regulator gave the green light for the first-ever spot Solana ETF in August 2024. Later, the country also approved a second Solana spot ETF offered by the asset manager Hashdex.

In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plays a pivotal role in safeguarding financial markets and consumers. A recent significant development signals the FCA’s reinforced commitment to tackling these new frontiers, particularly concerning FCA crypto regulation . This move is set to have notable implications for businesses and investors navigating the digital asset space in the UK. FCA Crypto Regulation Takes Center Stage with Key Appointment In a strategic move reflecting its expanding responsibilities, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently announced the appointment of Sarah Pritchard as its new deputy chief executive. This isn’t just a standard personnel change; it signifies a deliberate broadening of the FCA’s focus areas. Sarah Pritchard’s remit will now explicitly include oversight of critical emerging sectors, notably the regulation of stablecoins, various activities carried out by crypto firms UK , and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services. Her role will also involve supporting the FCA’s growing international engagement, highlighting the cross-border nature of these modern financial activities. Why Stablecoin Rules UK Are Becoming Critical Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, like a fiat currency – have gained significant traction. They are often seen as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, used for trading, payments, and remittances. However, their increasing use and potential integration into mainstream finance raise important regulatory questions around stability, consumer protection, and financial crime risks. The inclusion of stablecoin regulation under Sarah Pritchard’s purview underscores the FCA’s recognition of their growing importance and the potential risks they pose if left unchecked. Developing clear Stablecoin rules UK is seen as a necessary step to foster confidence and manage systemic risks as these assets become more prevalent in the UK’s financial ecosystem. This focus aligns with global regulatory trends aiming to establish frameworks for digital assets that pose potential financial stability concerns. What the Expanded Remit Means for Crypto Firms UK For businesses operating in the UK’s digital asset market, this appointment and the expanded mandate signal an era of increased regulatory scrutiny and potentially, clearer guidelines. Crypto firms UK involved in activities such as issuing or facilitating the use of stablecoins, or providing other crypto-related services falling under the FCA’s new scope, should prepare for enhanced oversight. This could involve: More detailed requirements for authorization and registration. Stricter rules around consumer protection, transparency, and risk management. Increased emphasis on preventing financial crime, including anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Potential new rules specifically tailored to stablecoin activities. While increased regulation can present compliance challenges, it can also bring benefits, such as greater market confidence, reduced risk of illicit activity, and potentially pave the way for broader institutional adoption by providing a clearer legal and regulatory framework. Beyond Crypto: Buy Now Pay Later and the FCA’s Broader Scope While the focus of this article is on crypto, it’s important to note that the FCA new deputy ‘s expanded role also covers Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL). This highlights the FCA’s broader strategy to adapt its regulatory framework to encompass a range of new financial products and services that have rapidly grown in popularity, often operating in previously unregulated or under-regulated spaces. This demonstrates the FCA’s commitment to ensuring consumer protection across diverse and evolving financial technologies. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in UK Crypto Laws The development and implementation of comprehensive UK crypto laws and regulations present both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in crafting rules that effectively mitigate risks without stifling innovation in a rapidly evolving technological space. The opportunity is to create a regulatory environment that attracts legitimate businesses, protects consumers, and positions the UK as a leader in responsible financial technology innovation. Sarah Pritchard’s appointment and the explicit inclusion of crypto and stablecoins in her portfolio signal a strategic prioritization by the FCA. It indicates that the regulator is gearing up to provide more clarity and structure to these markets. For crypto firms, staying informed and proactively engaging with the evolving regulatory landscape will be crucial for long-term success and compliance in the UK. In conclusion, the FCA’s appointment of a new deputy chief executive with a specific mandate covering crypto regulation, stablecoins, and BNPL is a significant development. It underscores the regulator’s commitment to adapting to the digital age and brings the prospect of more defined FCA crypto regulation . While the exact shape of future rules will unfold, this move clearly signals that digital assets are now firmly on the FCA’s regulatory radar, demanding attention from all market participants.

We’ve got some concerning news that needs your immediate attention. A recent report, a collaboration between industry players Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic, shines a stark light on a rapidly growing threat in the digital asset space: AI-driven crypto scams . And the numbers? They’re alarming, pointing to billions in crypto losses . The Rising Tide of Crypto Scams: A $4.6 Billion Problem Let’s cut straight to the chase. The report reveals that global crypto scam losses surged by a significant 24% year-over-year, reaching a staggering $4.6 billion. That’s a massive amount of value stolen from individuals and businesses navigating the cryptocurrency world. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a substantial escalation in the scale and impact of fraudulent activities. This surge indicates that scammers are becoming more sophisticated and effective in their methods. While the crypto market continues to mature and attract mainstream attention, it also remains a prime target for malicious actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities, both technical and human. Deepfake Crypto Scams: The AI-Powered Threat Takes Center Stage Here’s where things get particularly concerning. The report highlights the prominent role of artificial intelligence, specifically deepfake technology, in fueling these losses. Deepfakes, as you might know, are synthetic media where a person’s likeness is replaced or altered using AI, often making it look like they are saying or doing something they never did. In the context of crypto, deepfakes are being weaponized for impersonation. Scammers create convincing fake videos or audio of trusted figures – perhaps a known CEO, a crypto influencer, or even a supposed friend or colleague – to promote fake projects, solicit funds, or spread misinformation leading to investment decisions based on lies. The report’s findings are chilling: Nearly 40% of high-value fraud cases investigated in 2024 involved the use of deepfake technology. This shows just how integrated AI manipulation has become in significant fraudulent operations. In just the first quarter of 2025, a reported 87 deepfake scam rings were dismantled. While this shows law enforcement and security firms are active, the sheer number of operations being uncovered highlights the scale of the problem currently operating. The effectiveness of deepfake crypto scams lies in their ability to bypass traditional skepticism. Seeing or hearing someone you trust endorsing something or asking for help can be incredibly persuasive, making it harder for victims to recognize the deception before it’s too late. Beyond Deepfakes: Understanding Cryptocurrency Fraud Tactics While deepfakes are the shiny, terrifying new tool, they often work in tandem with older, proven scam tactics. The report points out that alongside deepfakes, the most common methods driving cryptocurrency fraud include: Social Engineering: This is the art of manipulating people into giving up confidential information. Think phishing emails that look exactly like they’re from your exchange, fake support calls asking for your seed phrase, or even elaborate romance scams where the scammer eventually asks for crypto investments. Deepfakes amplify social engineering by making the impersonation aspect incredibly convincing. Ponzi-Style Frauds: These are classic pyramid schemes adapted for the crypto age. Scammers promise impossibly high returns on investment, paying early investors with money from later investors. They collapse when the flow of new money stops, leaving the majority with significant crypto losses . These often use sophisticated websites and marketing, sometimes even incorporating fake testimonials enhanced by AI. Understanding that these tactics are interconnected is crucial. A deepfake might be used to initiate contact or build trust, which is then exploited through social engineering to get you into a Ponzi scheme or trick you into sending funds directly. Why Are AI Scams Particularly Effective Against Crypto? It’s worth asking why the crypto space seems to be such a fertile ground for AI scams and other types of cryptocurrency fraud . Several factors contribute to this: Irreversibility: Unlike traditional banking where transactions can sometimes be reversed, crypto transactions on public blockchains are generally final. Once you send crypto to a scammer’s wallet, it’s extremely difficult, often impossible, to get it back. Perceived Anonymity: While blockchains are transparent, identifying the real-world identity behind a wallet address can be challenging, especially if scammers use mixers or multiple wallets. Complexity: The technology and concepts behind cryptocurrency can be complex for newcomers. Scammers exploit this lack of understanding, using jargon and confusing explanations to appear legitimate. Hype and FOMO: The fast-paced nature and potential for high returns in crypto create an environment where Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is prevalent. Scammers prey on this, pushing urgent investment opportunities that require quick decisions without proper due diligence. Decentralization: While a core strength, the decentralized nature means there isn’t a central authority to flag or stop fraudulent transactions in the same way a bank might. These factors, combined with the enhanced realism provided by AI like deepfakes, create a perfect storm for sophisticated scams leading to significant crypto losses . Combating Deepfake Scams: Actionable Steps and the Report’s Call So, what can be done about this escalating threat? The report by Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic doesn’t just highlight the problem; it also points towards necessary countermeasures. The core recommendations revolve around strengthening defenses on multiple fronts: 1. Stronger Verification Practices Platforms and services need to step up their game. This includes: Implementing and improving Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to make it harder for scammers to operate anonymously. Enhancing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other account security measures. Developing better systems for verifying the legitimacy of users and transactions. 2. Enhanced Cybersecurity Training and Awareness This is perhaps the most critical defense for individual users. Education is power when facing social engineering and deepfakes. For Individuals: Learn to recognize the signs of a scam. Be skeptical of unsolicited contact, especially if it involves requests for funds or personal information. Verify identities through independent means – don’t rely on the video or audio call alone. Be wary of promises of unrealistic returns. Understand how to secure your wallets and private keys. For Platforms: Invest in advanced fraud detection systems, including those that can potentially identify AI-generated content or unusual behavioral patterns indicative of scams. Provide clear and accessible security guidance to users. 3. Increased Collaboration Combating sophisticated AI scams requires a united front. This means: Crypto exchanges and service providers sharing information about known scam tactics and addresses. Collaboration between the crypto industry and law enforcement agencies to track and dismantle scam operations. Security firms continuously researching and publishing findings on new threats, like this joint report does. For you, the individual crypto holder, the most important takeaway is vigilance. Treat every unsolicited message, every unexpected video call from someone you haven’t spoken to in a while, and every too-good-to-be-true investment opportunity with extreme caution. Always verify information through official channels you initiate yourself. In Conclusion: Stay Safe in an Evolving Threat Landscape The report from Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic serves as a crucial warning: AI scams , particularly those leveraging deepfake technology, are no longer a theoretical threat. They are here, they are effective, and they are directly contributing to billions in crypto losses globally. The 24% increase in losses and the widespread use of deepfakes in high-value fraud cases highlight the urgent need for increased awareness and stronger security measures. As the technology behind deepfakes and other AI tools becomes more accessible, the threat of cryptocurrency fraud will only continue to evolve. By understanding the common tactics, recognizing the red flags, and adopting robust security practices – both individually and collectively as an industry – we can hope to build a more secure future for digital assets and protect ourselves from falling victim to these alarming crypto scams .

The world of digital assets is buzzing as US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are quickly closing in on an astonishing $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume. This incredible pace highlights the immense investor interest and liquidity these products have brought to the cryptocurrency market since their launch. What Exactly Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the massive volume figures, let’s quickly touch upon what a Spot Bitcoin ETF is. Simply put, it’s an investment fund traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This structure allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Think of it as a bridge between the traditional financial world and the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Their approval and launch in the U.S. earlier this year were highly anticipated events. Why? Because they offer several key advantages: Accessibility: Easily traded through standard brokerage accounts. Convenience: No need to worry about private keys, wallets, or exchange security. Regulation: Operate within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection. Liquidity: High trading volumes on major exchanges can make buying and selling easier. These factors have contributed significantly to the rapid accumulation of Bitcoin ETF volume we are now witnessing. The Staggering Rise of Bitcoin ETF Volume Towards $1 Trillion The journey towards $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been nothing short of spectacular. According to data tracked by The Block, this significant milestone is being approached in less than 18 months since the first products hit the market. The pace of trading activity saw a notable acceleration as Bitcoin’s price climbed to new all-time highs, even briefly touching levels near $112,000. Higher prices often correlate with increased trading interest and volume as investors react to market movements, both buying and selling. To put this volume into perspective, reaching $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume so quickly demonstrates the strong demand and active trading occurring within these new investment vehicles. It signifies a significant level of capital flowing through these regulated pathways into the Bitcoin market. Dominance Defined: The Power of BlackRock IBIT Within the competitive landscape of Spot Bitcoin ETFs , one player stands out remarkably: BlackRock’s IBIT . BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has quickly become the undisputed leader in the market. IBIT’s dominance is clear when looking at the numbers: Volume Share: It commands over 79% of the total trading volume among all US spot Bitcoin ETFs. This means for every $100 traded across these ETFs, roughly $79 goes through IBIT. Assets Under Management (AUM): IBIT holds a staggering $70 billion in assets, representing the value of the Bitcoin it holds on behalf of investors. This figure alone highlights the massive inflows directed towards BlackRock’s offering. The success of BlackRock IBIT can be attributed to several factors, including BlackRock’s established reputation, extensive distribution networks, and effective marketing efforts. Their ability to attract and retain such a large portion of the market share has been a key driver in the overall surge in Bitcoin ETF volume . Comparing Crypto ETFs: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum While Bitcoin ETFs have been stealing the spotlight with their rapid volume growth, it’s also useful to look at the performance of other Crypto ETFs , specifically those tracking Ethereum. Spot Ethereum ETFs launched more recently, in July 2024. Since their debut, they have accumulated $83.4 billion in trading volume and hold $6.6 billion in assets. Let’s compare the two: Metric US Spot Bitcoin ETFs US Spot Ethereum ETFs Launch Timeline Less than 18 months ago Since July 2024 Cumulative Trading Volume Approaching $1 Trillion $83.4 Billion Total Assets Under Management Approx. $70 Billion+ (across all ETFs) $6.6 Billion Leading Product (by AUM) BlackRock IBIT ($70 Billion) (Specific leader not mentioned in source, but overall market is smaller) This comparison clearly shows the vast difference in scale between the two markets currently. Bitcoin ETF volume is significantly higher, and their assets under management are substantially larger. This could be due to Bitcoin’s longer history, greater public awareness, and its status as the first major cryptocurrency to have a spot ETF approved in the U.S. Market Dynamics: Inflows, Outflows, and Price Impact The journey to nearly $1 trillion in Bitcoin ETF volume hasn’t been a straight line of just inflows. While total net inflows across all Spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive $44.9 billion, this figure accounts for significant outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). GBTC existed as a closed-end fund before converting into a spot ETF. This conversion allowed investors who were previously locked in to redeem their shares, leading to substantial outflows as some took profits or switched to lower-fee competitors like BlackRock IBIT or Fidelity’s FBTC. Despite these GBTC outflows, the strong inflows into the newly launched ETFs have more than compensated, resulting in a significant net positive flow of capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem via these regulated products. This influx of institutional and retail capital through ETFs is widely seen as a major factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price rally in recent periods. What Does This Mean for the Future? The rapid growth in Bitcoin ETF volume and assets signals increasing mainstream acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. As these products mature and attract more investors, their influence on Bitcoin’s price discovery and market structure is likely to grow. Potential future developments could include: Continued competition among issuers, potentially leading to lower fees. Increased adoption by financial advisors and institutional investors. Greater market efficiency and liquidity for Bitcoin. Potential approval of other single-asset or multi-asset Crypto ETFs . Investors interested in this space should continue to monitor trading volumes, inflow/outflow data, and overall market sentiment. Understanding the dynamics of products like BlackRock IBIT and the overall Bitcoin ETF volume trends is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto investment landscape. Summary: A New Era of Bitcoin Investment In conclusion, the fact that US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly approaching $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume in such a short period is a monumental achievement. It underscores the strong demand for regulated Bitcoin investment products and the significant impact they are having on the market. Led by the overwhelming dominance of BlackRock IBIT , these ETFs have successfully bridged the gap for many traditional investors looking to access Bitcoin. While challenges like market volatility remain, the trajectory suggests that Bitcoin ETFs are poised to play an increasingly central role in the future of both cryptocurrency and traditional finance.

It dropped to 2.28 when Ripple Labs has just announced a major partnership deal with Guggenheim Partners. With the sentiment in the markets seemingly improving, this unexpected sudden drop is leaving many traders caviling. From a technical perspective, however, there is still some good news for XRP’s holders, as they believe it is currently capped above $2.25, which is a crucial Fibonacci retracement level and an important support area. XRP historically tends to rebound from this region—proof that markets do tend to behave in a recurrent manner. For the time being, this zone is likely to act as a buffer for the token. On-chain activity is starting to pick up as well. Supporters are particularly focused on June 16, a date that has become synonymous with possible resolutions in the Ripple vs SEC saga. Quite a number of people seem to believe that a favorable outcome could serve as a very strong catalyst for XRP’s next move. XRP Price Prediction: What’s Next? From a technical point of view, XRP is trying to recover from a key support zone in the range of $2.10 and $2.25. Immediate resistance levels are marked at $2.34 and $2.44, with stronger resistance near $2.60. Other traders are looking for a possible double bottom pattern forming on the charts, which would be a bullish pattern if confirmed in the On shorter timeframes, particularly the 8-hour chart, XRP is showing signs of a bullish divergence. While the price has slipped, momentum indicators like the RSI are quietly trending higher, suggesting a possible price bounce in the near term. However, one wildcard could shake things up — the upcoming U.S. CPI inflation data set to be released within the next 24 hours.

Deutsche Bank, one of the globe’s leading financial institutions, is reportedly diving deeper into the realm of digital assets. Specifically, they are exploring the potential of a Deutsche Bank stablecoin and innovative tokenized deposits . This isn’t just a minor technical tweak; it signals a significant step in the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption and the evolution of banking digital currencies . What Exactly is Deutsche Bank Exploring? According to reports from Bloomberg, cited by Ledger Insights, Deutsche Bank is actively investigating two key areas within the digital asset space: Developing its own stablecoin: This would be a digital currency issued by the bank, likely pegged 1:1 to a traditional fiat currency like the Euro or US Dollar. The aim would be to provide a stable digital medium for transactions within the bank’s ecosystem or potentially for clients. Implementing tokenized deposit solutions: This involves representing traditional bank deposits as digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). These tokens would essentially be digital claims on fiat currency held at the bank. Deutsche Bank isn’t just theorizing. They have already participated in trials, including collaborating with Swiss bank UBS. This hands-on approach suggests they are seriously evaluating the technical feasibility and business case for these digital asset initiatives. The bank is weighing whether to launch its own proprietary solutions, such as a dedicated Deutsche Bank stablecoin , or to join forces with existing industry initiatives and consortia. Why Are Banks Pursuing Banking Digital Currencies? The interest from major banks like Deutsche Bank in issuing their own forms of digital money or representing deposits digitally isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors are driving this push towards banking digital currencies : Efficiency Gains: Traditional payment and settlement systems can be slow, costly, and complex, especially across borders. Digital currencies and tokenized assets on DLT can potentially enable near-instantaneous, 24/7 settlement, reducing counterparty risk and operational costs. Enhanced Control and Programmability: Unlike public cryptocurrencies, bank-issued digital currencies or tokenized deposits could offer banks and regulators greater control. They can also incorporate ‘programmability,’ allowing for automated payments or conditional transactions, opening up new business models. Responding to Market Demand: Corporate clients and other financial institutions are increasingly exploring digital assets. Banks need to evolve their offerings to meet this demand and remain relevant in a rapidly digitizing financial landscape. Competitive Pressure: Other financial institutions, fintech firms, and even central banks (with Central Bank Digital Currencies – CBDCs) are exploring or launching digital currency initiatives. Banks must innovate to stay competitive. The exploration by Deutsche Bank highlights a strategic imperative to adapt to a future where digital assets play a more central role in finance. Stablecoins in Banking: More Than Just Crypto? When we talk about stablecoins in banking , it’s important to differentiate them from the decentralized stablecoins found in the broader cryptocurrency market (like USDT, USDC, DAI). While the underlying technology might be similar (often blockchain or DLT), bank-issued stablecoins would operate within a regulated framework, tied directly to the bank’s reserves and balance sheet. The potential use cases for stablecoins in banking are vast: Wholesale Payments: Facilitating large-value interbank payments or corporate treasury transactions more efficiently. Cross-Border Settlements: Simplifying and speeding up international payments and foreign exchange settlements. Securities Settlement: Enabling atomic settlement (simultaneous exchange of asset and payment) for tokenized securities. Internal Processes: Improving efficiency in internal bank operations, such as managing collateral or liquidity. A Deutsche Bank stablecoin could initially be used for internal or wholesale purposes, potentially expanding to corporate clients as the technology and regulation mature. The key benefit is leveraging the speed and programmability of DLT while maintaining the stability and trust associated with a major bank. Understanding Tokenized Deposits While related, tokenized deposits are slightly different from stablecoins. A stablecoin is typically a new digital liability issued by an entity (which could be a bank). A tokenized deposit, on the other hand, is a digital representation of an existing bank deposit liability. Think of it as putting your existing bank balance onto a blockchain as a token. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Bank-Issued Stablecoin Tokenized Deposit Nature New digital liability issued by bank Digital representation of existing deposit liability Underlying Asset Backed by reserves held by the issuer (bank) Direct claim on fiat currency deposit at the bank Regulation Likely subject to specific stablecoin regulations Governed by existing banking regulations for deposits Use Case Focus Wholesale payments, cross-border, potentially retail Intra-bank, interbank, corporate payments, DLT-based transactions Tokenized deposits leverage the existing, highly regulated framework of bank deposits, potentially making them easier to implement from a regulatory perspective compared to issuing a completely new stablecoin. They could be crucial for facilitating transactions involving other tokenized assets (like tokenized securities or real estate) on DLT platforms. Institutional Crypto Adoption: Deutsche Bank Joins the Ranks Deutsche Bank’s exploration is not an isolated event. It’s part of a growing wave of institutional crypto adoption among major financial players. The report mentions other giants like Citi, HSBC, and JP Morgan. JP Morgan, for instance, has been a pioneer with its JPM Coin and the Onyx platform, specifically focused on wholesale payments and tokenized assets. This demonstrates a clear trend: banks are moving beyond simply viewing crypto as an asset class for trading and are actively exploring the underlying technology (DLT) to improve their core banking functions and create new digital products. This shift signifies increasing confidence, albeit cautious, from traditional finance in the potential of distributed ledger technology and digital assets to revolutionize banking infrastructure and services. Institutional crypto adoption is no longer a niche concept; it’s becoming a strategic priority. Benefits of Bank-Led Digital Asset Initiatives The potential advantages for banks and their clients exploring initiatives like the Deutsche Bank stablecoin or tokenized deposits include: Improved Liquidity Management: Real-time visibility and control over tokenized funds. Reduced Settlement Risk: Atomic settlement capabilities minimize counterparty risk in transactions involving tokenized assets. Lower Transaction Costs: Streamlined processes can reduce fees associated with traditional payments. New Revenue Streams: Potential for offering innovative digital asset services to clients. Increased Transparency: DLT can provide a transparent and immutable record of transactions (within a permissioned network). Challenges and Considerations Ahead Despite the potential, the path forward is not without hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: While tokenized deposits might fit existing rules better, stablecoins face evolving regulatory frameworks globally. Interoperability: Ensuring different bank-issued tokens or tokenized deposit systems can interact with each other and with other DLT networks. Security Risks: Guarding against cyber threats and ensuring the integrity of the DLT platform. Technical Complexity: Implementing and integrating DLT into existing legacy banking systems is a significant undertaking. Market Acceptance: Educating clients and ensuring widespread adoption of new digital currency solutions. Deutsche Bank’s evaluation process will undoubtedly involve navigating these complex technical, operational, and regulatory landscapes. What Does This Mean for the Future of Banking? Deutsche Bank’s exploration is a strong indicator that major banks see digital currencies and tokenization not just as a trend, but as a fundamental shift in how value will be moved and represented in the future. Whether they launch a Deutsche Bank stablecoin , focus solely on tokenized deposits , or join an industry platform, their involvement validates the technology’s potential. This move accelerates the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. It suggests a future where clearing and settlement could be faster, cheaper, and more efficient, and where new, programmable financial products become possible. The race for leadership in banking digital currencies is clearly heating up. Conclusion Deutsche Bank’s reported exploration into stablecoins and tokenized deposits is a pivotal development in the financial world. It underscores the growing momentum behind institutional crypto adoption and highlights the strategic importance major banks are placing on digital assets. While challenges remain, the potential benefits in efficiency, control, and new capabilities are driving this innovation. As more institutions like Deutsche Bank delve into banking digital currencies and explore solutions like a potential Deutsche Bank stablecoin or tokenized deposits , the landscape of global finance is set for a significant transformation, bringing the speed and programmability of digital assets into the core of traditional banking.

While gold has historically been the go-to asset, recent performance data is prompting experts to consider a new contender: Bitcoin . Is Bitcoin Truly a Better Inflation Hedge Than Gold? According to Elliot Johnson, CEO of Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, the numbers speak for themselves. Johnson recently highlighted Bitcoin’s remarkable performance, suggesting it has significantly outperformed other asset classes , including gold, when viewed as a hedge against inflation. This perspective was shared via economic news account Walter Bloomberg on X, drawing attention to Bitcoin’s potential in safeguarding purchasing power. In a recent note, Johnson presented compelling data comparing the five-year performance of Bitcoin against gold and the U.S. dollar: Bitcoin (BTC): Demonstrated explosive growth, returning over 1,000% in value. Gold: Showed a respectable, but comparatively modest, return of 92.5%. U.S. Dollar: Suffered a significant loss, depreciating by more than 20% due to inflationary pressures over the same period. These figures underscore Johnson’s argument that Bitcoin has served as a far more effective store of value against the backdrop of rising inflation and currency devaluation. Understanding the Appeal of Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge Why might Bitcoin be gaining traction as a preferred inflation hedge over traditional assets like gold? Several factors contribute to this view: Digital Scarcity: Like gold’s finite supply, Bitcoin has a capped maximum supply of 21 million coins. This predetermined scarcity, enforced by its decentralized protocol, is a core part of its value proposition, especially in times when fiat currencies can be printed in unlimited quantities. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates independently of any central bank or government. This makes it immune to the monetary policies that can lead to currency devaluation, a key factor driving inflation. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, offering a level of portability and accessibility that physical gold cannot match. Divisibility: Unlike gold, which is difficult to divide into small units, Bitcoin can be divided into very small fractions (up to eight decimal places, known as Satoshis), making it highly divisible and suitable for transactions of any size. Comparing Bitcoin and Gold: Key Differences for Investment While both Bitcoin and Gold are considered stores of value, their characteristics as an Investment differ: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its high price volatility compared to the relatively stable price movements of gold. This presents both higher potential returns and higher risks. History & Tradition: Gold has thousands of years of history as a store of value and medium of exchange. Bitcoin is a nascent technology, just over a decade old. Tangibility: Gold is a physical asset you can hold. Bitcoin exists only digitally. Adoption: While institutional adoption of Bitcoin is growing rapidly, gold is still more widely held by central banks and traditional financial institutions. Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Investment Despite the impressive performance highlighted by Johnson, investing in Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is not without its challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can impact market sentiment and price. Security Risks: Storing Bitcoin requires technical understanding to avoid loss due to hacks, scams, or losing private keys. Market Manipulation: The crypto market is still relatively small compared to traditional markets, potentially making it more susceptible to manipulation. Understanding the Technology: A basic understanding of blockchain technology and how Bitcoin works is recommended for investors. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering Bitcoin as part of their strategy to combat inflation, here are some actionable steps: Do Your Own Research: Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin, its technology, and its market dynamics. Don’t rely solely on performance data from a specific period. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is a volatile asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider Diversification: Bitcoin can be part of a diversified portfolio, but it may not be suitable as the sole hedge against inflation. Start Small: You don’t need to invest large sums. You can buy fractions of a Bitcoin. Secure Your Investment: Learn about secure storage options like hardware wallets. The Future Role of Cryptocurrency in Investment Portfolios Elliot Johnson’s perspective adds to the growing debate about the role of Cryptocurrency , specifically Bitcoin, in modern investment strategies. As fiat currencies continue to face inflationary pressures, the appeal of scarce, decentralized digital assets is likely to grow. While gold retains its historical significance, Bitcoin’s recent performance and unique characteristics position it as a powerful new tool in the investor’s arsenal against the silent tax of inflation. The shift in sentiment from traditional safe havens to digital alternatives like Bitcoin is a trend worth watching closely. It highlights a changing financial landscape where technology and decentralized systems are challenging long-held investment paradigms.

One such challenge often discussed in the realm of digital security is the rise of quantum computing. For holders and enthusiasts of the world’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , questions occasionally surface about whether this powerful new form of computation could one day break its formidable defenses. However, according to prominent figure Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, these fears surrounding the Quantum Computing Threat to Bitcoin are significantly overstated. Michael Saylor Bitcoin Stance: Downplaying Quantum Fears Michael Saylor, a well-known advocate for Bitcoin and head of a company that holds substantial amounts of the digital asset, recently weighed in on the debate. In an interview with Bloomberg, Saylor expressed a clear perspective: the threat posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin’s core security is not the immediate or paramount concern many might imagine. He characterized the fears as “overblown” and something the cryptocurrency industry can effectively manage should it ever materialize into a tangible risk. This isn’t to say quantum computing isn’t powerful, but rather that its application as a direct threat to Bitcoin’s fundamental cryptography isn’t as straightforward or imminent as some portray. Saylor’s view suggests that while quantum computing represents a significant technological leap, its potential impact on Bitcoin Security is often misunderstood or exaggerated in public discourse. Why Saylor Believes Others Are More Vulnerable One key point Saylor made is that if quantum computing were to become a threat capable of breaking current encryption methods, the targets far more likely to be attacked first would be traditional institutions and critical infrastructure, not necessarily Bitcoin’s decentralized network. He specifically mentioned: Banks and financial institutions Large technology firms Government systems and databases These centralized entities often hold vast amounts of sensitive data and control critical services, making them potentially higher-priority targets for anyone wielding advanced computing power. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and the specific way its cryptography is used in transactions offer certain protective layers that might make it a less attractive initial target compared to centralized honey pots of data. The Real Threat Today: Phishing and User Error In a dose of practical reality, Saylor highlighted what he sees as the much greater, present-day risk for individual Bitcoin users: phishing attacks. While futuristic quantum threats capture headlines, malicious actors are actively exploiting simpler vulnerabilities right now. Phishing involves tricking users into revealing their private keys, seed phrases, or login credentials through fake websites, emails, or messages. This type of social engineering doesn’t require breaking complex cryptography; it preys on human error and lack of awareness. Saylor’s emphasis on phishing serves as a crucial reminder that while we debate theoretical future threats, the most common ways people lose their Bitcoin today are through preventable security lapses directly related to how they handle their private information and wallet access. This is a significant aspect of personal Crypto Security that often gets overshadowed by more technical discussions. Understanding the Quantum Computing Threat to Bitcoin To appreciate Saylor’s perspective, it helps to understand what the potential quantum threat actually entails. Bitcoin relies on sophisticated cryptography for its security, primarily: SHA-256: Used for mining and generating addresses. Considered highly resistant, even to quantum attacks. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm): Used for creating digital signatures to authorize transactions. This is the part potentially vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm, which could theoretically derive a private key from a public key. The primary concern is related to the ECDSA signatures. When you send Bitcoin, you use your private key to create a signature that proves you own the funds. This signature, along with your public key (derived from your private key), is broadcast to the network. Currently, deriving the private key from the public key is computationally infeasible. A powerful enough quantum computer, however, could potentially make this feasible, allowing an attacker to steal funds from an address whose public key has been revealed (i.e., an address that has sent a transaction). It’s important to note that addresses that have received funds but never sent any transactions (and thus haven’t revealed their public key) are considered much safer from this specific quantum threat. Is Bitcoin Security Quantum-Proof? Not Yet, But Adaptable Saylor’s confidence stems from the belief that the blockchain industry is not static. According to reports like the one from Decrypt referencing his comments, Saylor is confident the industry can and will adapt if the quantum threat escalates from theoretical to practical. This adaptability could involve: Transitioning to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): Researchers are actively developing new cryptographic algorithms designed to be resistant to quantum computer attacks. Bitcoin’s protocol can be upgraded through soft or hard forks to incorporate these new algorithms. Changing Address Types: Encouraging or defaulting to address types (like SegWit or Taproot) that reveal the public key only when spending, minimizing the exposure window. Future upgrades could potentially use PQC for generating addresses and keys from the outset. Community Consensus: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means any significant protocol change requires broad consensus, which can be slow but ensures robustness and careful consideration of new threats and solutions. While Bitcoin’s current cryptography isn’t explicitly ‘quantum-proof’ in all aspects (specifically ECDSA after public key exposure), the ability of the open-source development community to identify threats and implement upgrades provides a path forward. Saylor’s point is that there is ample time and capability within the ecosystem to address this long before it becomes a catastrophic problem. Comparing Risks: Quantum vs. Phishing vs. Other Threats Let’s put the risks into perspective, as highlighted by Saylor: Threat Type Likelihood Today Potential Impact Primary Target Mitigation Quantum Computing Attack (on ECDSA) Very Low (requires massive, currently non-existent quantum computer) High (potential to steal funds from exposed public keys) Bitcoin addresses with exposed public keys; potentially other crypto/traditional systems first Future protocol upgrades (PQC), using newer address types, holding funds on unspent addresses Phishing/Social Engineering High (daily occurrence) High (direct loss of user funds) Individual users User education, hardware wallets, strong passwords, 2FA, verifying URLs Exchange Hacks Moderate (less frequent than phishing, but impactful) High (loss of funds held on exchange) Centralized exchanges Holding keys yourself (cold storage), using reputable exchanges, enabling exchange security features This comparison underscores Saylor’s point: while the Quantum Computing Threat is a fascinating long-term theoretical challenge, the immediate, practical threats like phishing pose a far greater risk to the average user’s Crypto Security today. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Holders Given Saylor’s perspective and the current landscape, what should Bitcoin holders focus on? Prioritize Present Security: Spend time learning about and implementing strong personal security practices against phishing, malware, and social engineering. Use hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of Bitcoin. Educate Yourself: Understand how Bitcoin transactions work and the difference between public and private keys. Be wary of unsolicited messages or requests for your seed phrase. Stay Informed on Protocol Developments: While not an immediate concern, keep an eye on discussions within the Bitcoin development community regarding post-quantum cryptography and potential future upgrades. Don’t Panic About Quantum: The quantum threat is a known challenge being researched. It’s not a sudden, unavoidable doom hanging over Bitcoin. The time scales for quantum computers capable of breaking Bitcoin’s ECDSA are still uncertain, providing a window for the protocol to evolve. Focusing on the fundamentals of securing your private keys and being vigilant against social attacks is the most impactful way to protect your Bitcoin Security right now. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Resilience vs. Real-World Risks Michael Saylor’s comments offer a reassuring perspective on a complex, futuristic threat. By calling the quantum computing risk to Bitcoin “overblown,” he correctly redirects attention to the more pressing, everyday security challenges faced by users, such as phishing. His confidence in the industry’s ability to adapt underscores the dynamic nature of the Bitcoin protocol and its underlying technology. While quantum computing is a powerful emerging field that warrants monitoring, it is not an immediate existential threat to Bitcoin. The network’s decentralized design, combined with the ongoing work of developers and the potential for future cryptographic upgrades, provides a strong foundation for long-term resilience. For now, the most effective way to maintain Crypto Security is through user education, vigilance, and robust personal security practices against the very real and present dangers that exist today.

Recent headlines often focus on market fluctuations, leading some to question their long-term value. However, a significant shift is quietly underway beneath the surface. Industry leaders like Charu Sethi, the Chief Marketing Officer at Unique Network – a company specializing in blockchain infrastructure specifically for NFTs – are championing a different narrative: NFTs are rapidly evolving into foundational components, becoming essential digital infrastructure for the next wave of digital innovation. Are We Underestimating the True Potential of NFTs? Charu Sethi’s perspective, shared in a recent opinion piece, challenges the prevailing view that the perceived ‘decline’ in the speculative NFT market signals the end of their relevance. Instead, she posits that this period marks a crucial transition. As the initial hype around profile pictures and collectibles cools, the focus is shifting towards the inherent capabilities and NFT Utility that these tokens offer. They are moving beyond being mere assets you trade and flip, becoming vital system primitives within decentralized environments. Think of it like the early internet. Initially, it might have seemed like just a place for static websites. But it quickly evolved into the fundamental layer upon which e-commerce, social media, streaming, and countless other services were built. Sethi argues that NFTs are undergoing a similar transformation, shedding their image purely as speculative items and establishing themselves as foundational elements for complex digital ecosystems. NFT Utility: More Than Just JPEGs The core of this evolution lies in expanding the concept of NFT Utility . What utility are we talking about? It’s about leveraging the unique, non-fungible nature of these tokens to represent ownership, identity, access rights, and complex digital states in a verifiable and decentralized manner. Sethi highlights that this utility is now extending into critical areas: Gaming: Moving beyond simple in-game items to representing player identity, progress, achievements, and even components of the game world itself. Artificial Intelligence (AI): Enabling AI agents to own assets, represent unique datasets, or even act as unique, tradable digital entities. Web3: Serving as the backbone for decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, digital property rights, and complex contractual logic within decentralized applications. This expanded utility is precisely what Sethi believes is replacing the reliance on speculative value. The intrinsic function and capability of the NFT become more important than its potential resale price on a secondary market. How Are NFTs Becoming Digital Infrastructure? To understand how NFTs function as digital infrastructure , consider their properties. Unlike fungible tokens (like Bitcoin or Ether, where one unit is identical to another), each NFT is unique. This uniqueness, combined with blockchain’s immutability and transparency, allows NFTs to serve as: Verifiable Ownership Records: A secure and transparent way to prove ownership of digital or even physical assets. Access Control Mechanisms: Granting or restricting access to digital content, events, or services based on NFT ownership. Representations of Identity: Acting as decentralized digital identities or verifiable credentials. Containers for Data and Logic: NFTs can store metadata, link to external data, and even embed or trigger specific smart contract logic. Sethi envisions a future where NFTs serve as fundamental layers for asset ownership, transaction logic, and even the representation of AI agents within decentralized systems. This positions them not just as items within an application, but as part of the underlying framework upon which applications are built – true Web3 Infrastructure . Web3 Infrastructure: The Role of NFTs in a Decentralized Future Web3 Infrastructure aims to build a more decentralized, user-controlled internet. NFTs are crucial to this vision because they provide a native digital primitive for representing unique things and relationships in a decentralized way. In Web3, NFTs can: Represent your decentralized identity and reputation. Tokenize real-world assets, allowing for fractional ownership and easier transfer. Manage digital rights and licenses for content creators. Enable decentralized governance by representing voting rights or membership in a DAO. Unique Network, as a blockchain infrastructure provider focused on NFTs , is directly contributing to building the foundational layers necessary for this future. By providing tools and protocols that make it easier to create, manage, and utilize complex NFTs, they are helping pave the way for NFTs to become seamless, invisible parts of the Web3 Infrastructure users interact with daily. The Transformation of Blockchain Gaming Through NFTs Perhaps one of the most visible areas where NFT Utility is flourishing is in Blockchain Gaming . Early play-to-earn models often focused heavily on the speculative value of in-game NFT assets. However, the space is maturing. Sethi’s perspective aligns with the evolving view in Blockchain Gaming , where NFTs are becoming integral to the core gameplay experience, not just an economic layer on top. Examples include: True Asset Ownership: Players genuinely own their in-game items, characters, and even virtual land, allowing them to trade, sell, or use them across different compatible games. Persistent Identity and Progress: NFTs can represent a player’s unique identity and track their progress or achievements across various gaming experiences. Dynamic and Evolving Assets: NFTs can change based on player actions, game events, or external data, adding depth and complexity to gameplay. Interoperability: While still nascent, the dream is for NFT assets to be usable across different games and platforms, creating a truly interconnected gaming metaverse. This integration moves NFTs from being just collectibles within a game to being fundamental components of the game’s economy, mechanics, and player identity, solidifying their role in Blockchain Gaming infrastructure. AI and NFTs: A Future Synergy? The intersection of AI and NFTs opens up fascinating possibilities, pushing the boundaries of both technologies. Sethi’s mention of NFTs serving as layers for AI agents hints at a future where AI entities can interact with the digital world in novel ways. Consider: AI Agent Ownership: An AI could own an NFT representing data, a digital asset, or even a stake in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Unique AI Creations: AI could generate unique digital art, music, or even code, which is then tokenized as an NFT, proving its origin and ownership. Data Tokenization: Specific datasets used to train AI models could be tokenized as NFTs, allowing for verifiable ownership, licensing, or fractional use. AI-Powered Dynamic NFTs: NFTs whose properties evolve based on AI analysis of data or interactions. The combination of AI and NFTs suggests a future where decentralized systems can incorporate intelligent, autonomous agents that own assets and participate in the digital economy, all verifiable and managed on the blockchain via NFTs. Benefits and Challenges of the NFT Evolution This shift towards NFTs as digital infrastructure brings significant benefits: True Digital Ownership: Empowering users with verifiable ownership over their digital assets. Enhanced Interoperability: The potential for assets and identities to move across different platforms and applications. New Economic Models: Enabling creator royalties, fractional ownership, and novel ways to monetize digital interactions and assets. Increased Transparency and Security: Leveraging blockchain’s inherent properties for secure and transparent record-keeping. Building Decentralized Ecosystems: Providing fundamental building blocks for a more decentralized internet. However, challenges remain: Scalability: Ensuring blockchain networks can handle the transaction volume required for widespread infrastructure use. User Experience: Making the technology accessible and easy to use for mainstream users. Regulatory Clarity: Navigating the evolving legal landscape surrounding digital assets. Technical Complexity: Developing robust and secure infrastructure layers and smart contracts. Shifting Perception: Overcoming the public perception of NFTs as purely speculative tools. Conclusion: The Unfolding Future of NFTs Charu Sethi’s insights from Unique Network offer a compelling look beyond the current market narrative surrounding NFTs . While speculation captured initial attention, the real, long-term value lies in their potential as fundamental digital infrastructure . As they evolve, NFTs are poised to become invisible yet essential components powering the future of Web3 , revolutionizing Blockchain Gaming , and enabling new synergies with AI and NFTs . This shift from speculative asset to utility-driven primitive is not just a trend; it’s the foundation for a more decentralized, owner-centric, and functionally rich digital world. The quiet work of building this infrastructure is happening now, laying the groundwork for the next phase of digital evolution.

The group will assess their impact on the state’s economy, legislation, and daily life. This resolution was introduced by Representative Mark Wright and passed during the 2025 Regular Session to set up the legislative subcommittee under the House Committee on Commerce. 🇺🇸 NEW: Louisiana will form a committee to study ""AI, blockchain and cryptocurrency"" The resolution states: ""WHEREAS One in five Americans owns cryptocurrency…it is in the interest of Louisiana [to] consider the benefits and challenges of these technologies."" pic.twitter.com/mxEfawa0su — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 10, 2025 Lawmakers form a team to study AI, blockchain, and crypto The subcommittee is required to begin its work no later than September 1, 2025. It will take several months to gather information and speak directly with experts to understand the benefits and risks of using these technologies in Louisiana’s economy and the government. The resolution states that the group must submit its full report to the House Committee on Commerce and the David R. Poynter Legislative Research Library by February 1, 2026. The report must explain the current use cases for AI, blockchain, and cryptocurrency in Louisiana. It should also examine how other states are managing these technologies. Finally, the group must recommend potential safeguards and determine whether Louisiana should introduce new laws to ensure their safe use in everyday life. The resolution doesn’t directly create any new laws. Still, it shows that the state is serious about bringing digital tools and assets into mainstream use and wants its leaders to understand how powerful and complex the tools are. Louisiana is one of the many states actively investigating AI, blockchain, and crypto. The leaders around the country are now waking up to the fact that if they wait too long to get the technology and the regulations around it right, people could end up vulnerable. The team will hold hearings and speak with experts before writing the report The House Resolution 317 says the subcommittee must actively go out, listen to the public, invite experts, and learn from people who understand how these technologies are being built, used, and regulated. The group must create open events where tech professionals, business owners, educators, students, or regular citizens share their concerns, insights, or experiences with AI tools, blockchain systems, or digital currencies. Lawmakers want the committee to hear from people who work closely with these tools and can explain their risks and potential in simple language. The subcommittee will examine state-level pilot programs, bills in Congress, and proposed national laws that deal with these technologies. This analysis will help Louisiana understand how it might improve its own rules from a detailed review of what other states and the federal government are doing. The resolution directs the study to focus on cybersecurity risks , digital privacy concerns, and the economic opportunities created by Web3 technologies and artificial intelligence. It will also examine regulatory challenges as well as education and workforce development issues. No individual members have been publicly named to the subcommittee, but the task force will comprise existing members of the House Commerce Committee and a chair of their choice.

This is where self-custodial wallet development plays a critical role, empowering users to hold their own keys and interact directly with blockchain networks. Recognizing the growing need for robust and accessible tools in this space, Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, has announced a significant step forward: the upcoming release of WDKv2. This isn’t just another update; it’s positioned as a game-changer for building the next generation of unstoppable digital wallets. What is Tether WDKv2 and Why Does it Matter? The announcement came directly from Paolo Ardoino Tether CEO, via a post on X (formerly Twitter). He revealed that WDKv2 is an enhanced version of their open-source Wallet Development Kit (WDK). At its core, a WDK is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation designed to simplify the process of creating cryptocurrency wallets. Why is this development from Tether noteworthy? While Tether is primarily known for USDT, its involvement in providing core infrastructure tools like a crypto wallet kit signals a broader strategic vision. It aims to contribute to the fundamental layers of the decentralized ecosystem, specifically by lowering the barrier to entry for developers building self-custodial solutions. The importance of self-custody cannot be overstated. Unlike centralized exchanges or custodial services where a third party holds your private keys, a self-custodial wallet gives you complete control. This aligns with the core ethos of blockchain and decentralization, putting financial sovereignty back in the hands of the individual. Exploring the Key Features of Tether WDKv2 Paolo Ardoino highlighted several key characteristics that set Tether WDKv2 apart. These features are designed to address some of the common challenges and limitations faced by developers building self-custodial wallets today. Fully Unstoppable: This feature suggests a design that is resistant to censorship or interference from external parties. In a truly decentralized system, a wallet should function regardless of network conditions or attempts to block access. This likely involves resilient network connectivity and transaction broadcasting mechanisms. Configurable: Developers need flexibility. A configurable kit allows builders to tailor the wallet’s features, user interface, and underlying blockchain interactions to specific use cases or user preferences. This moves beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. Uses P2P Swarms for Syncing and Broadcasting: This is a crucial technical detail. Relying on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks for syncing blockchain data and broadcasting transactions means the wallet doesn’t solely depend on centralized nodes or services. P2P swarms enhance resilience, privacy, and decentralization. This is a significant step towards truly decentralized infrastructure for wallets. These features collectively aim to provide developers with the building blocks for creating wallets that are not only secure and user-friendly but also robust against external pressures and highly adaptable. Who is Already Building with This Architecture? Early adoption is a strong indicator of a technology’s potential. According to the announcement, Rumble Wallet is already reportedly building on this new WDKv2 architecture. While details about Rumble Wallet are still emerging, its early adoption suggests that the kit is already functional and proving valuable to developers focused on self-custodial wallet development . This example provides a tangible case study for other developers considering using the crypto wallet kit . It demonstrates that the architecture is being put into practice to create real-world wallet solutions. What Support and Resources Will Be Available? A development kit is only as useful as the resources supporting it. Recognizing this, the WDKv2 release will include: Comprehensive Documentation: Essential for developers to understand how to use the kit effectively, including APIs, libraries, and best practices. Dedicated Support: Access to help and guidance from the Tether team or community contributors to resolve issues and navigate the development process. Example Implementations: Code examples and templates that developers can use as a starting point, accelerating the development cycle and demonstrating practical use cases for the kit’s features. These resources are vital for fostering adoption and building a community around the open-source crypto project. They lower the barrier for developers who might be new to building self-custodial solutions or working with P2P architectures. Why is Open-Source Important for Crypto Wallet Kits? The decision to make WDKv2 open-source crypto is highly significant, especially for tools related to financial sovereignty. Here’s why: Transparency and Security: Open-source code can be reviewed by anyone. This allows the community to audit the code for vulnerabilities, bugs, or malicious intent, increasing trust and security. Collaboration and Innovation: Developers globally can contribute to the kit, propose improvements, and build upon existing features, fostering rapid innovation. Avoids Vendor Lock-in: Developers are not tied to a proprietary system. They have the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the code, promoting decentralization within the development ecosystem itself. Community Building: An open-source project encourages the formation of a community around the kit, providing peer support and shared knowledge. For a project focused on enabling self-custodial wallet development , being open-source is almost a necessity to align with the core principles of decentralization and trust through verification rather than blind faith. What Does This Mean for the Future of Self-Custody? Tether’s entry into providing a robust crypto wallet kit like WDKv2 could have several positive ripple effects on the ecosystem: Accelerated Development: By providing a solid foundation, the kit can significantly speed up the time it takes for new teams to build and launch self-custodial wallets. Improved Quality and Security: A well-maintained open-source kit can lead to more secure and reliable wallets being developed across the board, reducing common errors. Greater Accessibility: As it becomes easier to build wallets, we might see more specialized wallets emerge catering to niche needs or specific blockchain networks. Increased Adoption: Ultimately, better and more accessible self-custodial options can encourage more users to take control of their private keys, reducing reliance on centralized entities. This move by Paolo Ardoino Tether and his team underscores a commitment to building foundational infrastructure for the decentralized web, extending beyond Tether’s primary stablecoin function. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the announcement is exciting, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Adoption Rate: Will developers readily adopt WDKv2 over existing libraries or building from scratch? The quality of documentation and support will be key. Maintenance and Updates: As an open-source project, its long-term success depends on consistent maintenance and updates from Tether and the community. Security Audits: Despite being open-source, thorough, independent security audits will be crucial for developers and users to trust wallets built with the kit. Competition: Other projects and companies also offer tools and libraries for wallet development. WDKv2 will need to demonstrate clear advantages. Navigating these challenges will be essential for WDKv2 to achieve its full potential in fostering widespread self-custodial wallet development . Conclusion: A Powerful Step for Decentralization The unveiling of Tether WDKv2 by Paolo Ardoino Tether is a significant development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By providing an open-source crypto crypto wallet kit focused on enabling robust, unstoppable, and configurable self-custodial wallet development using decentralized P2P swarms, Tether is contributing vital infrastructure. This initiative has the potential to accelerate the creation of more secure, resilient, and user-controlled wallets, moving the industry closer to the core ideals of decentralization and financial sovereignty. With comprehensive documentation, support, and examples planned, WDKv2 is poised to become a valuable resource for developers looking to build the future of digital asset management.

If so, you’ve likely seen Bitcoin making significant strides. A recent analysis shared on CNBC is turning heads, suggesting a remarkable target for the leading digital asset in the near future. Let’s dive into this intriguing Bitcoin price prediction . Who is Todd Gordon and What’s His CNBC Bitcoin Outlook? Todd Gordon, a respected contributor on CNBC and a seasoned market analyst, has offered a compelling outlook for Bitcoin. According to Gordon, based on his analysis of the weekly chart, Bitcoin is currently charting a course towards the significant $135,000 Fibonacci level. This isn’t just a random number; Fibonacci levels are technical analysis tools often used by traders to predict potential support and resistance areas or price targets based on mathematical sequences found in nature. Gordon’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin is poised for a potential breakthrough. He believes it is likely that Bitcoin will soon surpass its previous all-time high, paving the way for even stronger upward momentum in the market. This forecast provides an optimistic perspective for those invested in or watching the crypto space. Why is Bitcoin Shifting to a Strategic Hedge? Beyond a simple investment asset, Gordon suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being positioned as a strategic hedge. What does this mean? A hedge is typically an investment intended to offset potential losses in other investments. Traditionally, assets like gold or certain government bonds have served this purpose. Gordon’s view indicates a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential role in protecting wealth or diversifying portfolios against traditional market volatility or inflation. This shift in perception from a speculative gamble to a potential hedge highlights the evolving maturity and understanding of Bitcoin’s value proposition among some financial professionals. What’s Driving Bitcoin’s Recent Surge? Todd Gordon pointed to three primary factors underpinning Bitcoin’s recent upward trajectory. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the current market dynamics: Increased Institutional Buying Demand: Big players are entering the arena. Asset management firms, corporations, and other large institutions are allocating portions of their capital to Bitcoin. This influx of significant capital provides strong buying pressure and adds a layer of legitimacy to the asset class. Expanding Cryptocurrency ETF Market: The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets have been game-changers. These exchange-traded funds provide a more accessible and regulated way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This has opened the floodgates for new investment capital. Changes in the Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic conditions play a significant role. Factors like inflation concerns, monetary policy shifts by central banks, and geopolitical uncertainties can make traditional assets less appealing and drive investors towards alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. These three factors collectively create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin, supporting the kind of bullish outlook shared by analysts like Todd Gordon. Could Bitcoin Really Reach $135K Soon? While a $135,000 target in the near term might sound ambitious to some, it’s important to consider the context provided by Gordon’s analysis. His prediction is based on technical indicators (Fibonacci levels) and supported by fundamental shifts in the market (institutional adoption, ETFs, macro factors). The combination of technical analysis and fundamental drivers provides a more robust basis for the prediction than technicals alone. However, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Predictions, especially ambitious ones, are not guarantees. Market conditions can change rapidly, influenced by regulatory news, technological developments, or unforeseen global events. Actionable Insights for the Reader For those interested in this forecast, here are a few key takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market analysis from reputable sources like CNBC and analysts like Todd Gordon. Understand the Drivers: Recognize the importance of institutional flows and the impact of financial products like the crypto ETF market. Consider the Macro Picture: Pay attention to global economic trends and how they might influence asset allocation decisions towards Bitcoin. Do Your Own Research: Never rely solely on one prediction. Conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions. This analysis provides a compelling case for significant upside potential for Bitcoin, rooted in tangible market developments. Summary: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin In conclusion, the analysis from CNBC contributor Todd Gordon presents a powerful bullish case for Bitcoin, targeting an impressive $135,000 based on Fibonacci levels on the weekly chart. His perspective highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role as a potential strategic hedge and attributes its recent strength to increasing institutional Bitcoin demand, the expansion of the cryptocurrency ETF market, and favorable macroeconomic shifts. While the target is ambitious, the underlying drivers provide a solid foundation for the forecast. As always, navigating the crypto market requires diligence and a comprehensive understanding of the factors at play.

45782835,https://nulltx.com/?p=150365,1749621105,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Institutional Sell-Off Continues to Weigh on Lido DAO ($LDO) Token Price,https://nulltx.com/institutional-sell-off-continues-to-weigh-on-lido-dao-ldo-token-price/,"In the last month, there has been intensifying selling pressure on $LDO, the native token of Lido DAO . Most of this pressure has come from large institutional holders who have been on a sustained sell-off. Prominent investment firm Paradigm Capital has made some recent transactions that have brought further attention to this ongoing trend. On-chain data related to these transactions show that they have been moving a large amount of $LDO into exchange-linked wallets. The net effect of these concerted actions has been that $LDO has dropped 22% in value in just the last 30 days. Paradigm Capital Moves $8.4 Million in $LDO to Exchange Wallet Analysts working on the blockchain saw that just nine hours ago, Paradigm Capital shifted 10 million $LDO tokens—worth around $8.41 million—into the wallet address 0xC4Db, which is thought to be a front for a trading platform. This particular address has served as a funnel for several institutional wallets to route their LDO tokens to trading platforms. Given where the funds just went to, and given that this is the first use of the address reported by on-chain analysts, there isn’t good reason to think this is anything other than a trading platform in disguise. Interest has been piqued by Paradigm’s most recent transaction, as it hints at the firm potentially liquidating a fresh batch of its holdings. This wouldn’t be the first time Paradigm has seen gains from divesting a portion of its early investments. In 2020, Paradigm purchased 70 million $LDO tokens directly from Lido’s treasury at a considerable discount of just $0.76 per token. That set in motion a total investment of roughly $53.2 million. What we don’t know for certain is if, in the current timeframe, Paradigm is selling just what they bought in 2020 or if it’s in part selling what they’ve bought lately. In either case, it’s not looking good for Lido. In November last year, the firm sold off 50 million of those tokens at an average price of $1.31, bringing in a profit of around $27.5 million. With yesterday’s transfer of 10 million tokens to an unknown wallet, it appears Paradigm might be preparing to sell off half of its 20 million LDO tokens left in reserve—potentially continuing the wave of institutional selling that has affected LDO’s price trajectory. Alternately, LDO could also have been a donation to a charitable cause. Exchange-Linked Wallet Activity Signals Broader Institutional Exit Paradigm is not the only one. In the last month, a number of institutional wallets have moved a total of 48.48 million $LDO tokens—valued at about $45.6 million during the transfers—to various exchanges using the wallet 0xC4Db. Such concentrated movement into exchange addresses is generally interpreted as an intent to sell, rather than a repositioning of assets or a custodial move. 这机构的 $LDO 跟出不完似的，一个接一个。这最近一个月才有一个机构 (或团队) 出了 $5131 万枚 LDO ($48.66M)。 现在 Paradigm Capital 也要出：Paradigm Capital 地址在 7 小时前转出 1000 万枚 $LDO ($8.41M)，预计这些 LDO 也会在接下来被转进 Binance、OKX、Bybit、Gate。 Paradigm 是在 4… https://t.co/xSPsS7g47K pic.twitter.com/kb4XH8jZZu — 余烬 (@EmberCN) June 10, 2025 Although the specific names of the institutions associated with these extra transfers have not been completely revealed, the overall amount involved is large and gives more to an investigation’s concern. Retail investors and analysts have a burning sensation where these sell-off transfers touch on the ever-elusive trust factor. And eroded trust results in a very bad market sentiment. Price Performance and Market Outloo k The fallout from this selling spree is already clear in LDO’s market performance. The token has shed 22% of its value over the past month, while many other assets in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector have rallied. For a project that once stood at the very forefront of Ethereum staking infrastructure, this kind of downward momentum reflects awfully on liquidity, investor confidence, and possibly long-term institutional commitment. Lido DAO’s influence in the Ethereum atmosphere does stay present, especially for a company that has piped so far in the diluted staking department. But what’s going on with Lido? Well, Paradigm has started to dump; and with that, the questions have started to surface again about Lido’s prospects, governance, and the trajectory it’s on as an Ethereum development shop. In the next days and weeks, market participants will be watching wallet 0xC4Db to see what it does next. If Paradigm is indeed continuing to liquidate its last stake, or if other institutions do likewise, $LDO holders could be in for further downside. Currently, retail investors and the wider DeFi community are coming to terms with the implications of this institutional reshuffling and are left wondering whether Lido DAO can get through this storm without experiencing any further downturns.

The PI price currently stands at $0.6423 , down 77.13% from its all-time high of $2.98 , but recent on-chain activity hints at a potential turnaround. 200 Million PI Tokens Transferred — What Happened? A massive 200 million PI tokens were recently moved from a liquidity reserve to a private wallet , sparking widespread speculation. According to popular crypto analyst Moon Jeff , the movement appears to be an Over-the-Counter (OTC) purchase , a method often used by institutional investors to avoid market slippage. “This kind of quiet accumulation usually signals strong confidence from big players,” said Jeff on X. Why It Matters OTC deals bypass public exchanges and are typically done by large investors, suggesting institutional interest and strategic accumulation in Pi Network — even during a dull market phase. Pi Coin Price Analysis: A Volatile Journey On launch day, Feb 20 , PI closed at $0.86 . Between Feb 20–26 , it soared 2,889.30% . By March 31 , it had plummeted 81.47% from its peak. From May 7–13 , PI rebounded 114.28% , only to fall again by 48.10% starting May 14 . Over the last 14 days , it dropped 14.3% ; in the last 7 days , it’s down 1.6% .

Dr. Altcoin recently criticized the Pi Core Team for lack of progress and poor communication. Some KYC-verified users have even claimed they haven’t received their PI tokens , raising further concerns within the community. Pi2Day: Could Pi Network Binance Listing Be Announced? All eyes are now on June 28 , when the Pi Network celebrates Pi2Day — a date known for major updates and community events . According to community buzz, a Binance listing announcement might be on the horizon, though this remains unconfirmed. Such a development could drastically shift market momentum. Final Take: While PI remains far from its peak, the recent whale move and Pi2Day anticipation may act as a catalyst for a new price surge. Investors are watching closely to see whether the $1.2 resistance can be broken, or whether Pi Network’s ongoing issues will continue to stall its growth. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Just in the last few hours, a big whale in the world of crypto, Buddy Huang Licheng, also known as @machibigbrother, has helped to pump up the price of HYPE past the $40 mark. The recent price movements have underscored the burgeoning interest in the Hyperliquid ecosystem and the profit-taking strategies of veterans that have guided them to benefit from the Hyperliquid token rally over the past few weeks. Whale Spends Nearly $10 Million on HYPE Ahead of ATH A significant crypto whale is currently attracting much attention for a considerable buy of HYPE tokens. During the last 2 hours, this individual has executed an order to purchase approximately 259,367 HYPE, at a cost of about $9.976 million in USDC, for an average price of $38.46 per token. It seems likely that this HYPE buyer is acting with some conviction, given the not so small amount of money involved and the fact that the token is now approaching all-time high price levels. $HYPE continues to attract major purchases as it nears a new ATH! A whale spent $9.976M in $USDC to buy 259,367 $HYPE at an average price of $38.46 in the past 2 hours. This whale has realized over $10M in all-time profit on #Hyperliquid . Follow @spotonchain and monitor the… https://t.co/QAr4rIleqI pic.twitter.com/CA0o2FhtcK — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) June 10, 2025 This whale boasts an even more striking history on the Hyperliquid platform. On-chain data indicates that they’ve made over $10 million in profit from past trading activity around HYPE. This speaks to not only their profound knowledge of the token’s market dynamics but also their ability to time trades exceptionally well. Retail investors often see such massive purchases as very bullish signals. They tend to see these as instilling confidence in the price trend. With $HYPE trading above $40 and seemingly in a strong uptrend, the price trend has also been helped along by organic demand and some high-profile investors making themselves known. Buddy Huang Licheng Locks in Millions in Profit As a number of whales have begun to enter the market, a select few have also started to exit—reaping some pretty substantial profits after riding the recent bull wave. Buddy Huang Licheng, known online as @machibigbrother, has been one of the most closely followed participants in the HYPE ecosystem. He began building his position in May by purchasing 200,000 HYPE spot at a price of $29.40. As the price trajectory confirmed a bull pattern, he significantly increased his exposure by entering leveraged positions. 随着 $HYPE 价格上涨突破 $40，麻吉大哥黄立成 ( @machibigbrother ) 开始逐步平多 $HYPE 进行止盈，他目前在 HYPE 上浮盈 $650 万。 他在 5 月份以 $29.4 的价格购买了 20 万枚 HYPE 现货，然后又通过合约以 5x 杠杆做多了 65 万枚 HYPE，开仓均价 $35.6。 随着 $HYPE 价格上涨突破… https://t.co/lG6UornotP pic.twitter.com/EcHgHxEGRT — 余烬 (@EmberCN) June 10, 2025 Trading data reveal that Licheng established long positions on 650,000 HYPE tokens, utilizing 5x leverage at an average entry price of $35.60. His strategy has reaped fantastic rewards so far and, as of now, has netted him an unrealized profit of approximately $6.5 million, all thanks to HYPE’s rocket-like price ascent well above the $40 mark. Spotting a chance to lock in profits, Licheng has slowly begun to lessen his exposure. He has started to fold portions of his leveraged long position, turning virtual gains into actual ones. Even after trimming a bit, he still sits on 440,000 HYPE long contracts and has all 200,000 HYPE spot holdings left. This suggests he is still juiced to the gills with the HYPE, even if he is skimming a bit off the top. A Bullish Market Fueled by Confidence and Smart Positioning Investor confidence and sharp strategies from experienced market players are driving the current HYPE rally. The nearly-$10 million buy-in from a whale and the profit-taking by Buddy Huang Licheng—both illustrative of two distinct but complementary market dynamics—are driving HYPE higher. If HYPE’s rally is not yet in the bag, it is certainly highly probable. HYPE’s recent surge over $40 is a noteworthy psychological and technical event. The token continues its push toward its previous all-time high, but the move has been a little more sobering for most and slightly more euphoric for a few. While hype is indeed real, it’s also shorthand for something far less glamorous: the prospect of either unsustainable growth or the unsustainable emission of new HYPE tokens. The token’s future performance will likely hinge on the overarching market environment, the ongoing uptake of the Hyperliquid platform, and the question of whether large investor interest will continue to be evident in the wake of recent whale pushes. If the current bullish trend holds and profit-taking can be kept in balance, then HYPE seems positioned to set some fresh all-time highs. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The broader ecosystem that centers around @virtuals_io saw even better growth, with the $VIRTUAL token and its affiliated projects really taking off and driving the sector’s momentum as investor interest in the space seems to be expanding. On June 10th, 2025, the AI agent market achieved a total market cap of $10.42 billion, which was a gain of 8.76% in just 24 hours. The Virtuals ecosystem contributed greatly to this market surge with a quite impressive market cap increase of 11.26%, pushing its total valuation to $2.43 billion now. Daily gains over the past week have led $VIRTUAL to reach a new price of $1.969, resulting in an overall 10.98% increase today. Virtuals Ecosystem Gains Traction Amid Strong Rotation Investor confidence in AI-native infrastructure and agent-based platforms is clearly on the rise. The reason? Because the virtual ecosystem is performing quite strongly. Since Aug. 25, the market cap associated with $VIRTUAL has grown by a staggering 11.26%, which is right up there with the best performers in the virtual space. In fact, $2.00 is such a key level that you could argue it’s the last line of defense for weekend traders who want to keep $VIRTUAL below $2.00. In addition to the price movement, Virtuals experienced a substantial gain in mindshare — a metric that calculates market narrative attention. Mindshare climbed to 40.47%, which suggests a nearly singular focus by social media, developers, and investors on Virtuals-based projects. Meanwhile, the protocol continues to place itself at the very nexus of AI-agent development. Its current performance in the number metrics cements its status as a lead horse in this engine of rapid growth. This influx of capital into the Virtuals ecosystem comes during a much larger investment surge into AI agent protocols. This is being driven by newly emerging Echo cluster signals, which are early technical indicators of market interest and positioning by smart money. Top Performers Reflect Market Confidence A few projects that fall under the broader AI agent sector also had notable 24-hour performances, showing that capital is rotating into places beyond just the flagship protocols. By my calculations of the projects that had the best growth in market cap yesterday, the top five were BYTE (+122.4%), ARBUS (+42.21%), CALLS (+41.71%), WAKEAI (+41.07%), and POLY (+39.84%). Evidently, these projects are doing something right — but what, exactly? Virtuals Daily Update | June 10th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/8fc2eY4FDv — Graeme (@gkisokay) June 10, 2025 The performance of BYTE was particularly striking, more than doubling its fortune in a single day. It was likely in part due to speculation, but the project has been getting more and more interest lately for its machine-learning model integrations and autonomous protocol functionality. Likewise, ARBUS and CALLS had back-to-back gains as the attention clusters picked up on user growth and developer engagement. The use case diversity of these top gainers shows that we are in a maturing market. Capital is flowing toward real traction and protocol utility, not hype cycle nonsense. Sector Outlook: Echo Clusters and Strategic Rotation Signal More Upside The robust results from the Virtuals ecosystem and the AI agent universe indicate sustained enthusiasm in this part of the market. Both kinds of investors seem eager to position themselves for a future dominated by AI-native platforms. Buy signals based on two kinds of networks — Echo clusters and high-conviction clusters — have been in place for a while now. The market for AI agents, now valued at $10.42 billion, is one of the most vibrant stories in the world of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Virtuals enjoys a market cap and level of user engagement that puts it in a leading position over most of its rivals. With over 40% of the sector’s attention and engagement, it’s virtual protocols like this one that are pushing the cryptocurrency space into new areas of monetary and technological innovation. As capital keeps rotating and more players look to funnel their funds into the high-growth areas of Web3, the AI agent space—led by $VIRTUAL and its associated protocols—looks like it might sustain its upward momentum and, very possibly, lead the next leg of the growth in the digital asset market.

For the past couple of months, the performance of tokens native to five leading cryptocurrency exchanges—Binance, Bitget, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io—has swung a little wildly. A $10,000 hypothetical investment in each of these tokens offers a glimpse into some of the best and worst performing places for exchange-aligned capital during that same stretch. Since exchange tokens usually provide some kind of utility within their ecosystems—like trading discounts, governance, and staking—they mostly appeal to and attract long-term holders. Still, their value is also quite sensitive to broader market conditions, trading volumes, and any kind of development relating to the platform, good or bad. So how did a $10K position in each of the following tokens hold up over the past two months? Binance Leads With Strong Fundamentals Of the five platforms scrutinized, Binance’s homegrown token, $BNB, offered the fattest payback over the two-month window. It was up 10 percent. So, if you put $10,000 into $BNB two months back, you’d have $11,000 now. Yes, that’s hardly a moonshot compared to some of the more outrageous tokens out there—that’s your segue into Bored Apes or whatever other NFT might be tripping your trigger. But it’s a far sight better than the previous two-month stretch for $BNB when it was down 17 percent. For a long time, BNB has been seen as one of the most developed and sturdy tokens in the exchange ecosystem, enjoying the advantages that come with having a gigantic global user base and a varied product line, not to mention the simple fact that it has a gigantic global user base. It is, as we used to say, tokenomically a core part of the Binance empire. Users get discounts on trading fees, they can use BNB to participate in the launch of new tokens, and it is a very basic way that one can use to participate in the DeFi and payment ecosystem that is Binance. A gain of 10% indicates that investor confidence in Binance’s infrastructure and ongoing ability to generate volume remains intact—even in uncertain market conditions. Bitget and OKX Hold Steady, Delivering Moderate Gains Just behind BNB in terms of gains were Bitget’s $BGB and OKX’s $OKB tokens, which rose by 7% and 6%, respectively, over the same period. So, if you’d put $10,000 into BGB at the start of the year, it would now be worth $10,700, and a $10,000 investment in OKB would presently be hovering around $10,600. The $BGB token from Bitget not only saw some price appreciation, but it also really stood out because it delivered the highest yield farming rewards compared to everything else in our coverage group. That yield farming reward offering is likely to heighten investor interest. Yield farming remains a very popular strategy among crypto users who are looking for almost guaranteed passive income opportunities. $OKB token from OKX, on the other hand, saw somewhat less growth but did manage to maintain price stability. The integration of products that are really cutting-edge and the focus on a truly multichain world seem to be engaging investors and keeping them on board with this particular token. OKB is not making headlines for the high returns that some investors are looking for, but it has built up a very respectable reputation for being consistent. Bybit and Gate.io Fall Behind Conversely, on the performance spectrum’s opposite end, Bybit’s $MNT and Gate.io’s $GT tokens notched losses. $MNT slid 12% over two months, dragging a $10,000 investment down to $8,800. Gate.io’s $GT didn’t fare any better; it sank 13%, with the same $10,000 investment now worth $8,700. Holding $10K in Exchange Tokens: Who Came Out Ahead? Here’s how $10K in native tokens performed across 5 major exchanges over 2 months: • Binance $BNB : +10% • Bitget $BGB : +7% • OKX $OKB : +6% • Bybit $MNT : -12% • Gate io $GT : -13% $BNB , $BGB , and $OKB held up well… pic.twitter.com/baOzT07H6L — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 10, 2025 These shortfalls may stem from a multitude of causes, such as slower user growth, less effective ecosystem incentives, or just plain market skepticism about the platforms themselves. For $MNT, the token’s volatility and relatively newest-of-the-new market presence might account for that bigger swing. For $GT, a lack of any major “gotta have it now” kind of reasons for buying the token and just dwindling trading volume could be what’s behind the persistent price pressure. These tokens have likely caused their investors to weather greater drawdowns than they expected, thus underscoring the need to do platform-specific due diligence before sinking any capital into exchange tokens. Final Take: Exchange Token Exposure Requires Selectivity In general, the comparative performance of exchange tokens in the last couple of months shows that even if these tokens can provide some upward movement and be useful, they are not consistent in their returns. Binance’s BNB, for instance, might have been the best performer in this set, showcasing the underlying platform’s strength with solid double-digit returns. Bitget’s BGB, meanwhile, layered on top of its price appreciation the mixing in of attractive farming rewards, making it an appealing bet for holders focused on yield. OKX’s OKB? It held nice and steady, appealing to those who like a more measured approach. At the same time, investors in Bybit’s $MNT and Gate.io’s $GT experienced marked downturns, highlighting the reality that not all tokens associated with exchanges act similarly—even when they’re in the same sector. As ever, for those investing in exchange tokens, there’s no substitute for keeping a close watch on the platforms’ goings-on, given how rapidly the world of crypto finance can change.

Following the landmark approvals of spot Bitcoin ETF products earlier this year, the regulatory body has announced it is initiating a formal review of a novel application from Bitwise . This isn’t just another single-asset fund; Bitwise is proposing a first-of-its-kind Hybrid ETF that would combine exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single investment vehicle. What is the Bitwise Bitcoin Ethereum Hybrid ETF Proposal? At its core, the Bitwise application, filed by NYSE Arca, seeks to create an exchange-traded fund that holds two of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum . Unlike separate funds for each asset, this proposed ETF would offer investors exposure to both within a single product. Key details of the proposal include: Dual Asset Exposure: The fund would hold physical Bitcoin and Ethereum . Dynamic Allocation: The initial proposed asset allocation reflects the current market value shares of the two cryptocurrencies, approximately 83% Bitcoin and 17% Ethereum . While this initial allocation is based on market capitalization, the fund’s strategy for rebalancing or adjusting this mix over time will be a critical point of regulatory scrutiny and investor interest. Filed by NYSE Arca: The application is sponsored by Bitwise and listed on the NYSE Arca exchange, a common venue for ETF listings. This structure is particularly noteworthy because it moves beyond single-asset crypto ETFs, signaling a potential path for more complex, multi-asset crypto investment products in the future. Why is the SEC Reviewing This Hybrid ETF Now? The SEC ‘s decision to initiate a review is a standard procedural step for any new ETF application. However, the context surrounding this review is significant. The regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs in the U.S. has evolved rapidly: Caption: The SEC is reviewing the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum hybrid ETF proposal. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETF s set a precedent for physically-backed crypto funds. While the path for a spot Ethereum ETF is still uncertain, with the SEC currently reviewing multiple applications, the Bitwise hybrid proposal adds another layer of complexity. The SEC ‘s review process typically involves: Initial filing and public notice. Opportunity for public comments. Internal staff review regarding market manipulation concerns, investor protection, and custody arrangements. Potential extensions of the review period. Ultimately, an approval or disapproval order. Reviewing a Hybrid ETF requires the SEC to consider the regulatory implications of holding two distinct, albeit correlated, crypto assets within a single fund structure. This includes assessing the risks associated with each asset individually and the potential interactions or correlations between them. Potential Benefits of a Combined Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF For investors, a Hybrid ETF like the one proposed by Bitwise could offer several compelling advantages: Simplified Diversification: Gaining exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum , the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, is simplified into a single investment product, reducing the need for multiple accounts or trades. Convenience and Accessibility: Like other ETFs, it would trade on traditional stock exchanges (NYSE Arca), making it easily accessible to retail and institutional investors through standard brokerage accounts. Potential Cost Efficiency: A single fund might offer lower management fees compared to holding separate Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products, although this would depend on the final fee structure. Regulatory Clarity: An approved Hybrid ETF would operate under the regulated framework of traditional securities markets, potentially offering investors a greater sense of security and transparency compared to investing directly on crypto exchanges. Targeted Exposure: Investors bullish on the broader crypto market, specifically the foundational assets BTC and ETH, could use this fund for targeted exposure without needing to actively manage individual crypto wallets or exchange accounts. This type of product caters particularly to investors who see value in both the ‘digital gold’ narrative of Bitcoin and the smart contract/decentralized application ecosystem of Ethereum . Challenges and Considerations for the Bitwise Proposal Despite the potential benefits, the Bitwise Hybrid ETF proposal faces significant hurdles and raises important considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETF s are approved, the regulatory status of Ethereum as a commodity or security remains a point of discussion, particularly for proof-of-stake versions. The SEC ‘s stance on Ethereum will heavily influence the outcome for this hybrid fund. Correlation and Concentration Risk: While offering diversification relative to a single-asset fund, a fund holding only Bitcoin and Ethereum is still highly concentrated within the crypto market. Both assets are subject to high volatility and significant correlation, meaning a downturn in one could heavily impact the other. Allocation Management: Maintaining a specific target allocation (like 83/17) in highly volatile markets requires frequent rebalancing, which could incur trading costs and potential tracking errors against the underlying assets. Custody and Security: The fund would need secure and regulated custody solutions for both Bitcoin and Ethereum , which adds complexity compared to a single-asset fund. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC will scrutinize whether the underlying markets for both Bitcoin and Ethereum are sufficiently resistant to manipulation to protect ETF investors. These challenges are not unique to Bitwise but are inherent in creating regulated financial products based on nascent and volatile asset classes like cryptocurrencies. The Broader Impact: Hybrid ETFs and the Future of Crypto Regulation The SEC ‘s decision on the Bitwise Hybrid ETF could have far-reaching implications for the future of crypto investments in the U.S. An approval would: Set a precedent for multi-asset crypto ETFs. Signal increased regulatory comfort with combining different cryptocurrencies in regulated products. Potentially pave the way for ETFs including other large-cap altcoins or baskets of cryptocurrencies. A disapproval, on the other hand, could reinforce a cautious stance from the SEC regarding complex crypto products or highlight specific concerns related to the hybrid structure or the regulatory status of Ethereum . For investors, the review process itself provides valuable insight into the SEC ‘s evolving perspective on crypto. It underscores the ongoing maturation of the crypto market as it intersects with traditional finance. Keeping an eye on the public comments submitted to the SEC and the rationale behind their eventual decision will be crucial for understanding the future trajectory of crypto ETFs. Conclusion: Awaiting the SEC’s Verdict The SEC ‘s initiation of a review for the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum Hybrid ETF proposal marks a significant step in the evolution of crypto investment products in the U.S. This novel fund structure aims to offer investors simplified, regulated exposure to the two largest digital assets. While the potential benefits in terms of convenience and diversification are clear, the proposal faces complex regulatory hurdles related to the hybrid nature and the differing statuses of Bitcoin and Ethereum . The outcome of the SEC ‘s review will not only determine the fate of this specific fund but could also shape the future landscape for multi-asset crypto ETFs and the broader regulatory approach to digital assets.

OpenAI, a leader in AI research, has unveiled its latest creation: OpenAI o3-pro . This new model is positioned as a major leap forward in AI reasoning capabilities. What Makes OpenAI o3-pro a Breakthrough AI Reasoning Model? Unlike earlier generations of AI that often relied on pattern matching or simple data retrieval, the AI reasoning model architecture employed by o3-pro is designed to tackle problems more like a human might – step by step. This methodical approach allows the model to perform more reliably and accurately, particularly in complex fields. OpenAI highlights its strength in areas such as physics, mathematics, and coding, where precise, logical steps are crucial for finding correct solutions. O3-pro builds upon the foundation of the o3 model launched earlier this year, representing a ‘souped-up’ version with enhanced performance and features. OpenAI states that this makes o3-pro their most capable model released to date. Accessing the Power of OpenAI o3-pro Access to this advanced OpenAI model is rolling out in stages. Starting this week, ChatGPT Pro and Team users gained access, with o3-pro replacing the previous o1-pro model in the model picker. Enterprise and Edu users are slated to receive access the following week. Developers can also begin integrating o3-pro into their applications, as the model is now live in OpenAI’s developer API. For developers using the API, understanding the pricing is key. OpenAI o3-pro is priced based on token usage: Input tokens: $20 per million tokens Output tokens: $80 per million tokens A token is essentially a piece of a word, and OpenAI estimates that a million input tokens is roughly equivalent to 750,000 words. This tiered pricing structure means the cost will vary significantly depending on the complexity and length of the prompts and responses. How Does o3-pro Stack Up? Examining AI Capabilities and Benchmarks OpenAI claims that o3-pro demonstrates superior AI capabilities compared to its predecessors and even key competitors. According to internal testing, o3-pro achieves impressive scores on popular AI benchmarks. For instance, on the AIME 2024 benchmark, which specifically tests mathematical skills, o3-pro reportedly outperformed Google’s top model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. It also beat Anthropic’s recently released Claude 4 Opus on the GPQA Diamond test, a benchmark designed to assess PhD-level scientific knowledge. Beyond benchmarks, OpenAI emphasizes positive feedback from expert evaluators. Reviewers consistently preferred o3-pro over the base o3 model across various categories, particularly highlighting its strength in: Science and Education Programming Business applications Writing assistance Reviewers also rated o3-pro higher for clarity, comprehensiveness, instruction-following, and accuracy. Enhanced Features and Current Limitations A significant upgrade in o3-pro is its access to a suite of tools. This allows the model to perform actions beyond just generating text, including: Searching the web for up-to-date information Analyzing files provided by the user Reasoning about visual inputs Using Python for calculations or code execution Leveraging memory to personalize responses However, it’s important to note that o3-pro is not without its initial limitations. OpenAI has stated that temporary chats with the model in ChatGPT are currently disabled due to a technical issue they are working to resolve. Additionally, o3-pro cannot generate images, and it does not yet support Canvas, OpenAI’s AI-powered workspace feature. Another point noted by OpenAI is that while o3-pro’s responses are more robust, they typically take longer to generate compared to the older o1-pro model. Conclusion: A Step Forward in AI Reasoning The release of OpenAI o3-pro marks an important step in the evolution of AI, particularly in the domain of reasoning models. By focusing on step-by-step problem-solving, OpenAI aims to make AI more reliable and capable for complex tasks. While there are initial limitations and a longer response time, the reported improvements in benchmarks and expert evaluations suggest that o3-pro could significantly enhance the capabilities available to ChatGPT Pro users and developers, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in technical and creative fields.

In the past 24 hours, TRX climbed approximately 3.9%, reaching a trading value of $0.294. Despite these recent gains, Tron remains significantly below its all-time high of $0.43, set in December 2024, representing roughly a 31.8% decrease from that peak. This upward trajectory coincides with notable stablecoin activity on the Tron network, particularly involving Tether’s USDT token. Recently, a substantial minting event involving USDT occurred, signaling increased liquidity and potential market demand. Related Reading: TRON Surges Past 8 Million Daily Transactions as TRX Holds Above $0.27 Significant USDT Minting Event on Tron Amr Taha, an analyst from CryptoQuant’s QuickTake Platform, highlighted a significant event occurring on the Tron blockchain involving Tether’s stablecoin, USDT. According to Taha’s report titled “Tether Treasury mints $1 billion USDT on TRON prior to Bitcoin reaching $110,000,” the Tether Treasury recently issued 1 billion new USDT tokens on the Tron blockchain on June 9, 2025. This mint represents the largest single issuance of USDT on Tron for the month so far, emphasizing the network’s increasing relevance for stablecoin transactions. Taha noted that two primary factors likely drove this sizable minting event. First, it points toward elevated market demand for stablecoins, particularly within Tron’s ecosystem, known for low transaction fees and high-speed transfers. Second, the minting could signal significant institutional activity or preparations for substantial over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trades. Historically, such minting events tend to precede increased trading activity as investors leverage newly injected liquidity into the markets. The introduction of additional stablecoin liquidity typically boosts overall cryptocurrency market conditions, potentially providing support during periods when traditional financial markets are less robust. Divergent Trends: Rising TRX Price and Declining TVL Meanwhile, separate on-chain analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson noted a sharp decrease of nearly $2 billion in the total value locked (TVL) within lending protocols on Tron. This recent drop in TVL contrasts notably with the rising price of TRX, marking a divergence that raises intriguing questions for investors. Wedson pointed out that historically, reduced TVL in lending platforms on Tron has correlated with upward price movements for TRX, as previously observed in early 2024.

In a June 10 press release, Ripple announced that Guggenheim’s DCP would now be available on XRP ( XRP ) Ledger through the Zeconomy platform. Since its initial launch on Ethereum ( ETH ) in September 2024, the tokenized asset, which has been rated Prime-1 by Moody’s, has processed over $280 million in volume and offers custom maturities of up to 397 days. DCP, which boasts quicker settlement, reduced fees, and round-the-clock accessibility, has become the first native commercial paper issued on XRPL. It’s issued through a bankruptcy-remote SPV, ensuring investor protections, and aims to modernize traditional treasury operations by integrating digital debt into cross-border payment flows. Ripple will invest $10 million in DCP as part of the partnership, which may later include support for RLUSD purchases. RLUSD, Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin launched in December 2024, has already exceeded $350 million in circulating supply. You might also like: Ripple commits additional $5M to Asia-Pacific blockchain research “The inception of DCP is a prime example of institutions shifting from experimentation to production,” said Markus Infanger, senior vice president of RippleX. “It expands the offering of institutional assets on XRPL, which is designed for regulated financial products requiring speed, scale, and compliance.” The expansion arrives at a time when XRPL has seen a decline in usage. As reported by crypto . news on June 9, on-chain activity has been slipping, transaction and payment volumes have dropped, and active addresses have decreased between May and June. By introducing steady institutional flows into the network, this partnership may help to reverse that trend. The DCP expansion builds on Ripple’s growing push into real-world asset tokenization. The company has previously invested in similar tokenized treasury projects, including Ondo’s OUSG and Archax’s partnership with asset manager Abrdn. According to a recent Ripple-BCG report , bonds will drive the adoption of the tokenized RWA market, which is expected to grow from $600 million today to nearly $19 trillion by 2033. DCP is currently available exclusively to Qualified Institutional Buyers and Qualified Purchasers. The product offers a regulated, yield-bearing onchain asset that institutional traders can integrate into liquidity and collateral strategies, blending traditional fixed income with blockchain-native efficiencies.

The upgrade was announced on June 10 via Starknet’s ( STRK ) official X account. Staking v2 introduces block attestation and commission adjustments, two major features that will improve validator reliability and reward fairness. Under block attestation, validators must confirm randomly chosen blocks in each epoch to prove they’re online and tracking the network. Those who fail to do so will not receive rewards, and their delegators lose out as well. This ensures validators are active and prepares them for future consensus responsibilities expected by the end of 2025. 1/ We’re thrilled to announce that STRK Staking v2 is going live on Mainnet on June 17!

Under the new system, validators can commit to a maximum commission cap for a set period, up to one year. Although they are free to reduce fees whenever they want, they are unable to raise them above the stated cap until the commitment period is over. You might also like: Starknet launches Asset Runes to bring USDC and other tokens to Bitcoin During the upgrade, Starknet will temporarily pause staking contracts to facilitate a smooth transition. Delegators don’t need to do anything, but once Staking v2 goes live, they’ll be able to view validator performance data and switch validators at any time without delay. This marks the second phase of Starknet’s staking rollout. The first phase began in November 2024, allowing users with at least 20,000 STRK to stake and earn rewards. Full validator consensus will be introduced in a third phase scheduled for late 2025. The upgrade arrives alongside several major ecosystem developments, including Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine wallet support and a custom Bitcoin ( BTC ) bridge expected by the end of Q2. Bitcoin staking is also set to launch later this year. By upgrading its staking system while live, Starknet is one of the first Layer 2 networks to shift validator responsibilities toward greater decentralization. These changes support its push toward “Stage 1” decentralization, reducing dependence on centralized sequencers while improving network security, transparency, and fairness.

We are also seeing quite a bit of growth in our revenue streams, with this network bringing in around $50,000 per week. Almost all of this revenue is currently coming in from priority fees being paid by users wanting their transactions to go through more quickly. Having set its blocktime at one second, Unichain today delivers low-latency performance when compared with many of its peers. Still, that speed is forecasted to improve dramatically with the future integration of “Flashblocks”—sub-second, 250-millisecond block intervals designed to provide even faster confirmation times. The network’s roadmap continues to focus on both scalability and low-latency execution—aspect ratios of an increasingly competitive Layer 2 and modular ecosystem. Indeed, Unichain’s next updates may see latency drop significantly as it pushes toward and begins to achieve the goals laid out in its white paper. DEX Activity Surges as Incentives Drive Adoption Unichain’s recent growth has received a substantial boost from the rapid expansion of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on the network. The increase started in mid-April and was in time with the launch of an incentive program aimed at drawing in liquidity and traders. Since then, DEX volume on Unichain has catapulted to nearly $2 billion weekly, a stunning accomplishment considering how little memecoin action there is on the chain. In contrast to numerous other networks that see speculative tokens drive much of their trading volume, Unichain’s top liquidity pools are composed primarily of high-value, blue-chip asset pairs. Fully 97% of all fees earned by liquidity providers (LPs) in those pools come from trades involving either ETH-USD or Bitcoin-denominated pairs. That signals a trading environment that’s maturing and maturing fast, with far more focus on driving real, meaningful trade between legitimate, institutional-grade assets than on any trading patterns that could be described as “hype-driven.” At present, the majority of the volume is coming from Uniswap v4 pools. These are very advanced, highly functional and flexible pools that let you, as a liquidity provider, perform nearly any sort of money market strategy you can imagine (in fact, if you’re not into money market strategies, you probably have a good reason to steer clear of these pools). And yet, amongst these highly advanced pools, there is at least one pool that appears to be very basic. The USDC/USDT pool is operating with an almost comically low 0.003% fee. Unichain is currently generating ~$50k per week in REV, largely driven by priority fees. Unichain currently operates with 1 second blocktimes, but there are plans to integrate 250ms “Flashblocks” that provide fast confirmation times in the near future. pic.twitter.com/KRAaJ3cA0p — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) June 9, 2025 Throughput, Reverts, and Value Accrual Mechanics Currently, Unichain achieves a transaction throughput of 5 million gas per second (5mgas/s), with most of that activity coming from DEX trading. Although some observers have flagged the network’s high transaction revert rate, a closer look reveals that this is largely a non-issue for the kind of everyday users that most networks serve. In fact, if you discount the 88% of all reverts that come from just 60 addresses (most of which are associated with bot-driven arbitrage strategies), you find that the Unichain network serves up a pretty smooth experience for its human users. Unichain is now growing and changing the structure of its value accrual. Right now, the revenue net of the Optimism Collective’s revenue share goes to Unichain Labs. But this is set to change with the launch of UVN, or Unichain Validator Network, which will enable us to share revenue with holders of our governance token, the UNI token. Unichain seems to be carving a niche for itself in the realm of blockchain networks that are built for performance and that are friendly toward institutional players. Its secret? Focusing on three things quite resolutely: facilitating high-speed and high-volume trading; maintaining a design that ensures high throughput; and establishing a base of trading pairs that drive utility—no small achievement given that in many public markets, a high percentage of trading pairs do not seem to fulfill a useful purpose.

He added that the date was not set in stone and could change because Tesla was paranoid about safety. Musk indicated on June 11 that he was flying from Los Angeles to Austin, Texas, for the kickoff of the Robotaxi launch, which he previously predicted would occur sometime on June 12. However, he said the current plan was for June 22 and that the first driverless trip from the Tesla factory to a customer’s house would take place on his birthday, June 28. In May, Musk said that Tesla would launch its robotaxi service with around 10 vehicles in the first week before increasing it to 20, 30, or 40, and eventually thousands within a few months. He also plans to expand the robotaxi service to other cities, like San Francisco and San Antonio, although he has not provided a detailed timeline. However, the tech billionaire pointed out that the streets will change rapidly, and autonomous cars will be standard worldwide in two to three years. Musk says robotaxis will initially be ‘geo-fenced’ and remotely monitored BREAKING: First ever Tesla Model Y robotaxi with no-one in the drivers seat spotted testing on public roads in Austin, Texas! Tesla's new ""Robotaxi"" wordmark/logo is on the side of the vehicle. https://t.co/IhEzPx5PIb pic.twitter.com/zq4ZmiMqDg — Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) June 10, 2025 Musk said Tesla would “geofence” the service, limiting where the Model Y robotaxis could initially operate, and that employees would remotely monitor the fleet. He recently disclosed that Tesla will start with a very small rollout of robotaxis that will be fitted with a new “unsupervised” version of the company’s FSD or “Full Self-Driving” technology installed. The tests will involve the Model Y, not the futuristic-looking CyberCab that Tesla plans to produce next year. He shared a video showing that Tesla was testing driverless vehicles on the roads of Austin without a human safety supervisor behind the wheel. The eight-second clip showed the latest version of the Model Y SUV, painted black with a white/gold “Robotaxi” graffiti-style logo painted on it, navigating an intersection and pausing to allow pedestrians to pass over a crosswalk. “We are being super paranoid about safety.” – Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla The company has been testing self-driving Model Y SUVs that will be used in the initial phase of the operation. Model Ys with manufacturer plates and a person behind the wheel have been spotted driving around parts of Austin, including South Congress. However, it is unclear who will be the first users of the Robotaxi service, what app will be used, or how much rides will cost. Tesla gears up to compete against Waymo in Austin Musk suggested that Austin was a better city than Los Angeles to start its robotaxi service, although he did not specify why Austin was preferable. However, Texas generally has fewer regulations around autonomous vehicles and is far less dense than Los Angeles, with about a quarter of the population of the southern California city. Austin has become a sort of battleground for robotaxis, with Waymo offering autonomous rides through the Uber platform since March. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during the first-quarter earnings call in May that a fleet of about 100 Waymo robotaxis was busier than over 99% of all drivers in Austin in terms of complete daily trips. The California Public Utilities Commission data revealed that Waymo provided more than 5 million rides in three years. Waymo also increased the number of paid rides from about 12K in August 2023 to over 708K in March 2025. Musk said that the ramp-up for Tesla’s robotaxi service will be quick, adding that there will “probably” be 1,000 robotaxis within a few months. He also predicted that more than one million self-driving Teslas could be in the U.S. by the end of 2026. However, Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein previously said Musk’s 2026 guidance was “a bit optimistic,” pointing out that the billionaire investor often missed his own deadlines. Goldstein believed that Tesla would “get there” eventually but stressed that their FSD software would likely take more iterations than the Tesla team anticipated once they started testing the real robotaxi service.

At press time, Sui ( SUI ) is trading at $3.46, up 2.1% in the past 24 hours and rebounding from a weekly low of $2.92 on June 6. The dip had been driven by market fallout from the Cetus ( CETUS ) hack and broader macroeconomic pressures. SUI’s recovery, however, might be aided by fresh institutional momentum. With a 24-hour trading volume of $1.01 billion, up 300% from the day before, SUI’s market activity has significantly increased. As per Coinglass data , SUI’s derivatives volume rose 6.44% to $5.16 billion, while open interest climbed 3.53% to $1.52 billion, a sign that more traders are taking leveraged positions and expecting near-term volatility or movement. The surge coincides with a major development. According to a June 10 announcement by the Sui Foundation, Nasdaq has filed a 19b-4 with the SEC to list the 21Shares SUI ETF, officially kicking off the regulatory review process for a U.S. spot ETF based on the SUI token.

Institutional firms such as Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale have launched products on Sui since late 2024, reflecting its appeal as a high-performance Layer 1 chain. Looking at the technical picture, SUI appears to be eyeing a breakout from consolidation. Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten, and price action is hovering near the middle band at $3.38. At 52.5, the relative strength index confirms a neutral bias but still has room to rise before reaching overbought territory. SUI price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The MACD’s entry into positive territory could be a potential early indicator of bullish momentum. Although it’s still negative, the awesome oscillator is flattening, indicating a possible change in momentum. The estimated moving averages from 10 to 200 days are flashing buy, but the 30- and 50-day simple moving averages exhibit a slight bearish lag. If the price manages to close above $3.50 with confirmation through rising volume, SUI could test the previous local high near $3.80, and possibly push toward $4.20 if ETF optimism holds. Failure to break above resistance, however, could see SUI drift back to $3.20–$3.00 support, especially if broader risk sentiment weakens.

Saylor argued that Bitcoin has overcome its riskiest periods and is heading towards $1 million. Saylor said in an interview with Bloomberg anchors Katie Greifeld and Matt Miller: “The crypto winter will not return. We are past this phase. Bitcoin will not go to zero; it is going to $1 million. We have enough data to prove it.” According to Saylor, the support from the US government indicates Bitcoin’s long-term success. Noting the positive approach of cabinet members, former SEC officials and CFTC representatives towards digital assets, Saylor said, “Now banks will also store Bitcoin.” Related News: BREAKING: Rumors of Solana Spot ETF Approval Emerge, Could Stir Up the Market - Price Reacts Saylor also said that the supply of Bitcoin has become limited, and that only 450 Bitcoins are sold by miners per day, which corresponds to a daily sales volume of approximately $50 million. According to Saylor, this volume is enough for the market to move upwards: “Companies that hold Bitcoin treasuries are buying the daily natural supply alone. BlackRock and ETFs are also buying. Moreover, even governments are now entering this space.” Saylor said that when the price of Bitcoin reaches $500,000 or $1 million, a drop may be possible, but such a scenario is not possible at current price levels. He cited Trump Media’s $2.5 billion announcement, GameStop’s $500 million move and MicroStrategy’s multi-billion-dollar new fundraising as examples. *This is not investment advice.

45783268,https://nulltx.com/?p=150360,1749621966,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$KTA Faces Sharp Selloff Amid Allegations of Fake Testnet Activity,https://nulltx.com/kta-faces-sharp-selloff-amid-allegations-of-fake-testnet-activity/,"A newly launched Layer 1 blockchain project called $KTA saw the price of its token nosedive by almost 26% in just one day, following some quite serious claims that called into question the very authenticity of its testnet. KTA’s situation has sent investor confidence into quite the tailspin and, even though project backers are actively pushing the narrative that all is well, a pretty decent-sized wave of skepticism now seems to cover social media and the crypto communities. Doubt has suddenly descended on $KTA, which had only quite recently received a fair amount of positive attention for its ambitious plans and its not-inconsequential recent fundraising. The supporters of $KTA, in what is effectively its own PR campaign, paint the appearance of doubt as, um, dubious. And, really, with the way they tell it, who wouldn’t be wild about the plans $KTA is supposedly making for the $KTA blockchain? They aren’t just wild; they are, as promised, transparent in the way they paint a picture of the project. Allegations of a “Fake” Testnet Stir Concern The catalyst that first caused the price to drop was an analyst’s claim that the KTA testnet explorer—a tool for seeing what’s happening in a network—was being used to mislead people into thinking the KTA network was doing something. According to the allegations, the testnet explorer was showing a lot of transactions that, by the explorers’ own measures, weren’t real. And this was serious for the KTA network, because if, as the allegations suggested, it was using the testnet explorer to run a network that wasn’t doing any real KTA transactions, then KTA tokens were going to be virtually worthless. Such allegations are especially harmful in the cryptocurrency sector, where a working test network and a live network are basic standards used to judge a project’s worth. Many investors see the test network as a crucial proving ground for a project’s technical chops before it launches the main network and its tokens become more valuable. Even though there were claims to the contrary, project supporters pushed back strongly. They emphasized that the development team is now publicly known and, thus, accountable. They also pointed to the $17 million raise that the project has documented through SEC filings as more than enough evidence that institutional investors have properly vetted and backed the effort. For these folks, the development team’s public presence, the project’s SEC-registered funding, and the path from funding to project operation are clean as a whistle. Onchain Analyst Zachxbt Highlights Governance Red Flags Onchain analyst zachxbt has questioned the way the token’s supply is generated and how it is disbursed, and he’s not the only one. Shill capital does not speak well for a project’s governance, as it directly speaks to the project’s. Zachxbt’s remarks mirrored a wider doubt in the crypto analyst fraternity about the viability of projects whose marketing depends largely on engaging with influencers, as opposed to getting the kind of engagement that builders usually do. He stated, “When the most vociferous advocates (shills) for a project come not from its builders but from questionable KOLs, it usually means the project is underperforming in the tech department.” when the biggest shills for a project come from sketchy KOLs (Nekoz, etc) vs actual builders for a project it typically means the tech is underwhelming. nonetheless the supply control by them has so far been impressive L1s w/ token preproduct + large tax at launch for a… pic.twitter.com/6O0z5sW9ag — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 9, 2025 The analyst criticized the tokenomics model too, describing it as a Layer 1 project with a pre-product token and a large tax imposed at launch, which often leads to artificial price pumping followed by sharp corrections. This observation resonates with some investors who suspect the current hype may not be sustainable without real technical progress. Community Divided as Price Continues to Slide These disclosures have split the community of $KTA. Some holders maintain optimism, trusting in the team’s transparency and the potential for future development milestones that could prove the project’s legitimacy. Others have started to cut their losses, concerned about holding tokens that they see as tied to an overhyped or inadequately tested network. I am likely the first person ever to go on the Keeta testnet. TLDR it’s completely fake. The explorer is a Vercel vibe coded page posting fake transaction data. Swaps don't work. Keeta CTO – “There's a lot of network functionality that underlies the UI of this little demo but… pic.twitter.com/3T7NvU6vnk — MRG (@thespacecatjr) June 9, 2025 Market reaction has been swift and severe, with the token dropping nearly 26% in a single day—reflecting the intensity of concerns and the difficulty in dispelling doubts once they take hold in the crypto market. The episode highlights the risks associated with investing in early-stage Layer 1 projects, where technical proof points like functioning testnets are critical but sometimes overlooked in the rush of marketing and fundraising. The situation is still unfolding, and the team at $KTA is still trying to remain calm and focused. It’s likely that they’re feeling pressure and are under some duress to achieve what is very clearly a must-win outcome. That is, they need to produce evidence that is not only clear and convincing but also verifiably good news. So far, it seems they’ve come up with some basic demonstration of network functionality. The world of blockchain projects is constantly changing, but the trust of investors always comes down to two basic elements: proven technology and transparency. The saga of $KTA is a powerful reminder of the importance of these two elements. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While Bitcoin (BTC) set the tone, some assets seized the spotlight to deliver standout performances, and among them was Myria (MYRIA). Myria ( MYRIA ), the native token of the Ethereum-based Layer-2 gaming platform, emerged as one of the top gainers during the latest crypto market uptick, soaring by 50% yesterday and up 5% in the past 24 hours. The surge brought the token to $0.00184, marking a 199.2% increase from its yearly low of $0.000615 and pushing it to new multi-month highs. MYRIA’s price chart |Source: TradingView The rally was fueled by a sharp rise in trading activity. MYRIA’s 24-hour volume spiked by over 360%, propelling its market capitalization to approximately $59.5 million. The performance positioned MYRIA as a top-performing crypto asset, behind only a few others like PAYCOIN, which gained over 100%. However, the token soon began relinquishing its gains in an inability to maintain the positive momentum, losing nearly 20% of its gains within a brief period. MYRIA trades at $0.001779 at press time, and its value now marks an approximate 88% decline from its all-time high of $0.0147.

Bitcoin (BTC) led the charge with a 5% increase over 24 hours, briefly reclaiming the $110,000 level before dipping slightly to around $109,100. Altcoins including ETH , XRP , and SOL also rallied, posting gains between 4% and 8%. Memecoins joined the trend with stronger numbers, and tokens including BONK , PEPE , WIF notched up to 10% in gains. While, like MYRIA, the majority of the crypto assets have also retraced part of their gains, overall market sentiment remains positive, fueling hopes for a sustained recovery.

This upward movement was a welcome respite following last week’s Trump-Musk public spat that briefly dragged the top crypto asset close to $100,000. A market expert believes that the current rally “may have more room to run.” Bullish Trend Remains Intact Bitcoin has broken above its short-term downtrend after completing a bullish breakout from a consolidating triangle pattern typically associated with trend continuation. Prominent crypto analyst Markus Thielen noted that while he initially anticipated a quieter summer trading period, the strength of the current move suggests fresh capital is driving the rally as tariff concerns diminish. In the latest edition of Matrixport analysis , Thielen pointed to steady momentum despite expected upward pressure in this week’s Consumer Price Index data, which is considered unlikely to halt Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Markets have simultaneously reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year to just one, reflecting a more resilient US economy than previously forecasted. Thielen added that Bitcoin’s bullish trend remains intact, provided the cryptocurrency maintains levels above $105,075. This price point will now act as a critical technical threshold for continued upward movement. Reduced Selling Pressure Supporting this technical outlook, on-chain data provides additional evidence for the rally’s sustainability. According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, realized profit from long-term Bitcoin holders has experienced a dramatic decline, falling 89% from approximately $126 million to $13.6 million based on 24-hour simple moving averages. The data reveals that despite Bitcoin trading at similar price levels to the late-May peak, seasoned investors who have held their positions for over one year are demonstrating significantly reduced profit-taking activity. This sharp reduction in selling pressure from experienced holders suggests that this cohort of investors appears more reluctant to realize gains at current price levels compared to their activity during the previous rally period.

According to a DOJ statement released on June 9, Iurii Gugnin, the New York-based founder of crypto firm Evita is facing a a 22-count indictment for charges revolving around the use of his company to funnel more than $500 million in illicit funds. Prosecutors allege that Gugnin moved the funds through the U.S. financial system to support transactions for sanctioned Russian banks, defraud American financial institutions, and aid the export of controlled technology to the Russian government. The founder is also accused of deceiving banks and crypto exchanges by hiding the true nature of Evita’s business, falsely claiming that his company had no dealings with Russian entities or sanctioned organizations. Additionally, Evita failed to implement required anti-money laundering controls and did not report suspicious activity, enabling illegal transactions.

Iurii Gugnin’s charges come as the DOJ ramps up its crackdown on illicit crypto activities. Just days earlier, the agency filed to seize nearly $7.74 million tied to a similar laundering scheme run by North Korean cybercriminals. The funds, in that case, were linked to individuals and entities using false identities to gain employment in U.S.-based companies. The proceeds were then funneled through a coordinated laundering operation involving tactics like chain hopping and token swaps to obscure the origin of the funds. Commenting on Gugnin’s charges, Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division Roman Rozhavsky emphasized the commitment of U.S. law enforcement agencies to fishing out bad actors. “Let this serve notice that using cryptocurrency to hide illegal conduct will not prevent the FBI and our partners from holding you accountable,” he said.

Despite efforts to expand its e-commerce presence and digital offerings, the company has yet to offset the ongoing decline in brick-and-mortar sales meaningfully. Bitcoin Joins GameStop’s Long-Term Asset Playbook This is not GameStop’s first crypto experiment. In 2022, it launched a digital wallet aimed at tapping into the Web3 trend but shuttered the project a year later, citing regulatory uncertainty. Its latest foray, however, positions Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. In a statement, GameStop said it may use part of its cash reserves or proceeds from future debt or equity sales to expand its Bitcoin holdings. The move mirrors the high-profile strategy of MicroStrategy, which has famously accumulated large amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. More than 80 public companies have followed suit, including Trump Media. Crypto Pivot Highlights GameStop’s Struggle To Evolve GameStop’s embrace of Bitcoin appears to be both a financial bet and a signal to its retail investor base, which has historically shown strong interest in crypto-related plays. Yet, the market’s response has been cautious. GameStop’s stock fell nearly 20% in the days following the disclosure, suggesting skepticism among investors. While some view the Bitcoin purchase as a distraction from operational headwinds, others see it as a bold attempt to reposition the company as digital-first, even as the broader industry transitions to streaming and downloadable content. With national retailers shuttering stores and physical game sales declining, GameStop’s bet on Bitcoin may offer some financial diversification. Whether it can also help reverse its fortunes remains far less certain.

What is Driving Stablecoin Adoption in Business? The Coinbase report provides compelling evidence that businesses are actively exploring and embracing crypto. One of the most striking findings relates to SMBs: a remarkable 81% of those already aware of cryptocurrency are reportedly interested in leveraging stablecoins. Why this strong interest? Stablecoins offer a unique value proposition for businesses compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether. Pegged typically to stable assets like the US dollar, they offer the benefits of digital currencies – speed, low transaction costs, and global reach – without the unpredictable price swings that make budgeting and everyday transactions difficult. For SMBs, this translates into practical advantages: Faster Payments: Sending and receiving payments, especially internationally, can be significantly quicker than traditional banking methods. Lower Fees: Cross-border transactions via stablecoins can often incur much lower fees than wire transfers. 24/7 Access: Unlike banks, stablecoin networks operate continuously, allowing for transactions anytime, anywhere. Enhanced Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a blockchain, offering a clear audit trail. This growing interest among SMBs signals a potential shift in how smaller enterprises manage their finances and interact with the global economy, making business crypto adoption a tangible reality for a vast segment of the market. Blockchain Adoption: Transforming Fortune 500 Operations It’s not just SMBs showing interest. The Coinbase report, supported by data from sources like Solid Intel on X, reveals a significant surge in crypto exploration among the world’s largest companies. The number of Fortune 500 companies actively exploring stablecoin use has reportedly tripled since the beginning of 2024. This indicates a strategic recognition at the highest levels that digital currencies could play a crucial role in corporate finance and operations. Furthermore, the report highlights broader blockchain adoption initiatives within these large corporations. According to the data cited from Solid Intel on X, a substantial 60% of Fortune 500 companies are currently working on dedicated blockchain projects. These projects go beyond just stablecoins and explore the decentralized ledger technology for various use cases: Supply Chain Management: Improving transparency and efficiency in tracking goods. Tokenization of Assets: Representing real-world assets (like real estate or art) or financial instruments on a blockchain. Enhanced Security and Data Integrity: Utilizing blockchain’s immutable nature for secure record-keeping. New Business Models: Exploring opportunities in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) or Web3 applications. The fact that such a high percentage of leading global companies are investing resources into blockchain technology underscores its perceived potential to drive innovation, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. This level of corporate engagement is a powerful validator for the long-term relevance of the technology. The Global Rise of Stablecoins and What it Means for the Future of Money The report also provides context on the overall growth of the stablecoin market. Globally, the total stablecoin supply has seen a robust 54% year-over-year growth. This expansion is mirrored by the increasing number of individuals and entities holding stablecoins, now exceeding 161 million worldwide. This significant growth in both supply and holders points to increasing trust and utility in stablecoins as a digital medium of exchange and store of value, distinct from the speculative market. This trend has profound implications for the future of money . Stablecoins offer a bridge between the traditional financial system and the burgeoning digital economy. They facilitate faster, cheaper, and more accessible transactions globally. For businesses, this means easier international payments, potential for programmable payments (smart contracts), and new ways to manage treasury and liquidity. The increasing stablecoin adoption isn’t just a crypto phenomenon; it’s a development that could reshape global financial infrastructure. Consider the potential impact: Feature Traditional Payments Stablecoin Payments Speed Often days (especially cross-border) Minutes to hours Cost Variable, can be high (especially cross-border) Generally lower, often fixed or negligible Availability Limited by banking hours/days 24/7/365 Transparency Can be opaque Public ledger (depending on blockchain) Programmability Limited High (via smart contracts) This table illustrates why businesses, seeking efficiency and cost savings, are increasingly looking at stablecoins as a viable alternative or complement to existing payment systems. The Coinbase report simply quantifies a trend that has been building momentum. Challenges and Considerations for Business Crypto Adoption While the report paints an optimistic picture, it’s important to acknowledge that significant challenges remain for widespread business crypto adoption . Regulatory clarity is still evolving in many jurisdictions, creating uncertainty for companies. Volatility in the broader crypto market, while less of a direct issue for stablecoins themselves (if properly managed), can still impact business confidence and perception of the asset class. Technical integration into existing legacy systems can also be complex and require specialized expertise. Furthermore, educating employees and customers about using crypto and stablecoins is a necessary step that requires time and resources. Despite these hurdles, the data suggests that the perceived benefits are increasingly outweighing the challenges for a growing number of businesses. Actionable Insights from the Coinbase Report What can businesses take away from this report? Explore Stablecoins: Even if not ready for full crypto adoption, understanding and potentially piloting stablecoin use for specific functions like international payments or treasury management could offer immediate benefits. Investigate Blockchain Use Cases: Companies should identify areas within their operations – supply chain, data management, customer loyalty – where blockchain’s unique properties could drive efficiency or innovation. Stay Informed on Regulation: Keeping abreast of regulatory developments is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape. Build Internal Expertise: Developing or acquiring talent with blockchain and crypto knowledge will be essential for successful implementation. The report serves as a clear signal that ignoring the developments in stablecoin adoption and blockchain adoption is no longer a viable strategy for businesses aiming to remain competitive and prepared for the future of money . Conclusion: Crypto’s Growing Footprint in the Economy The latest Coinbase report offers compelling evidence of the increasing integration of cryptocurrency into the mainstream economy, driven significantly by accelerating stablecoin adoption and diverse blockchain adoption initiatives. From SMBs finding practical use cases for stable payments to Fortune 500 companies strategically exploring transformative blockchain applications, the data underscores a clear trend: business crypto adoption is gaining serious momentum. While challenges persist, the report highlights a growing understanding and embrace of digital assets and decentralized technology as key components of the future of money . This isn’t a distant possibility; it’s a present reality shaping how businesses operate globally.

In its annual report released Tuesday in Cologne, the FIU stated that 8,711 crypto-related notifications were submitted in 2024 — marking an 8.2% increase from the previous year, Bloomberg reported . This occurred despite the total number of SARs dropping after the agency issued new guidance aimed at reducing irrelevant reports. The majority of the flagged transactions involved Bitcoin ( BTC ), followed by Ethereum ( ETH ), Tether ( USDT ), and Litecoin ( LTC ). These tokens were frequently linked to activity on trading platforms, mixing services , or online gambling. The FIU noted that these types of transactions are commonly used to obscure the origins of illicit funds, underscoring the increasing role of digital assets in money laundering schemes. You might also like: While crypto is gradually getting legalized, its money laundering use persists — what are the trends? Internationally, Germany’s trend mirrors growing concerns over the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. In the UK, the National Crime Agency reported that crypto exchanges were tied to 6.6% of all SARs in the 2023–24 period, as total filings rose slightly to approximately 872,000. The UK also noted a sharp increase in counter- terrorism financing reports and account-freezing actions. In the U.S., FinCEN received over 8,600 crypto-linked SARs in fiscal year 2023, a jump driven by a specific advisory issued in September that led to weekly filings spiking as high as 1,560. Overall, U.S. entities filed 4.6 million SARs during the year. Globally, the scale of crypto-related money laundering is also substantial. Chainalysis data shows laundered crypto volumes reached $31.5 billion in 2022 before falling to $22.2 billion in 2023 — though still well above pre-2021 levels. Chainalysis noted that in 2023, the overall crypto transaction volume declined by 15%, but the laundered crypto volume decreased by approximately 30%. It’s hard to say if there was a positive change since the total criminal use of crypto was more or less stable at around $50 billion per year in 2022, 2023, and 2024, according to Chainalaysis.

Of course, any Bitcoin rally is going to be very closely watched by not only investors but also many analysts trying to get a read on what might be happening in the more speculative corners of the crypto market. So, this rally is already under the microscope, and what we’re seeing is this: the signal we’re getting from the derivatives market is decidedly mixed. Even while Bitcoin’s spot price keeps surging in the wake of overall crypto market enthusiasm, the structure underlying the asset’s market tells a more complicated story. Data from on-chain and exchanges over the last day illuminate something that a lot of people who’ve been in crypto for any length of time have gotten used to: the reality that Bitcoin is back in the uptrend, again. Being in the uptrend is kind of comforting; it breaks my heart that so much of that comfort is built on the rise of gaze-based financial products. Spike in Short Liquidations Accompanies Price Rally One of the recent surge’s primary possible causes seems to be a sudden increase in the number of short positions being liquidated. Yesterday, Bitcoin futures short liquidations hit $5.74 million in a single day. This unwind of forced bearish bets added a lot of push to Bitcoin’s price. And as a result, we accelerated our way up to $110.3K. The 24-hour simple moving average (SMA) for short liquidations is currently at $768,252.14, indicating that the recent spike is above the norm by a wide margin. This is taken to suggest that there is a rush on to exit short positions, with traders in that camp quite apparently caught off-guard by a rapid upward price shift. Liquidations of this scale usually stoke short-term volatility, with the positions getting sold off at the market price coming right back into play. It’s sort of a “you kick, I kick” arrangement that can keep the market moving upward for a while and can even make it seem, to some, that we are in a bull market. But this reinflux of pieces that have been forced to the market can make the situation pretty fragile, especially if too many new long positions are being taken and not enough old ones are being reactivated. Long-Side Premiums and Open Interest Continue to Rise Concurrently, the premium for long positions has surged significantly over the past 12 hours, now standing at $270,480. This fact implies that traders are more and more keen to shell out a premium for the privilege of staying long, even as prices continue to move upward. In other words, paying a premium to be long is no longer an exclusive club—it’s something more and more traders are opting to do. Believe it or not, this is actually a good sign. It points yet again to the ever-increasing bullishness of the market. #Bitcoin price rose nearly 3.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $110.3K. Derivatives suggest potential overheating (rising short liquidations, increasing long-side premium, and growing open interest). However, funding rate uptick is only modest — glassnode (@glassnode) June 10, 2025 Total number of outstanding derivative contracts—open interest—has also increased in tandem, signaling that new capital is entering the market. Rising open interest can be a healthy sign of growing participation, but when combined with surging long premiums and liquidations, it may indicate a leverage build-up that could precipitate an instability event. Some risk indicators, however, do remain in check. One closely watched metric for evaluating whether overheating is occurring in the crypto derivatives space is the funding rate for perpetual futures contracts. This rate reflects the cost of holding a position and often spikes when leverage is extremely skewed. Funding Rates Still Moderate Despite Leverage Buildup Funding rate data, interestingly, suggests that while the market is clearly speculative, it hasn’t yet reached extreme levels. Across major exchanges, the perpetual futures funding rate for Bitcoin currently ranges from a low of 0.0003% to a high of 0.023%, with an average around 0.0016%. These values are higher than neutral but still well below the excessive levels that have historically preceded sharp reversals. The uptick we see here in funding is very modest, so what we’re signaling is that interest in holding long positions is growing, but still, traders aren’t being incentivized by upticks in funding to pay obnoxious carry rates to hold onto those long positions. That’s kind of a key distinction. The lack of exorbitant carry rates signals that we might have a bit more room to run before traders are forced to price in the interest mechanism if we keep going up. The present state is a classic crypto conundrum: although there is unmistakable momentum and enthusiasm behind the recent rally in Bitcoin, the data purportedly points to growing leverage and, uh, speculative bets that may need to be unwound. Without extreme funding rates or blowout open interest, though, the market looks to be in a heightened but not dangerously overheated state. Volatility spikes, long liquidations, and sudden changes in funding rates will be closely monitored by traders and analysts. Bitcoin, in the meantime, is trying to hold above a price point of $110,000. On a consolidated basis, it will start sending clearer signals regarding the persistence of its ongoing upward movement.

One such report recently surfaced, suggesting that Scott Bessent was being eyed as a strong contender for the pivotal role of Federal Reserve Chair . However, the White House has stepped in to address this speculation directly. According to an account on X (formerly Twitter) known for tracking economic news, the White House has explicitly stated that these reports are entirely ‘groundless’. This comes after a separate report, citing a source familiar with discussions within the Trump Administration , indicated movement towards potentially nominating Bessent for the top spot at the central bank. Why Does the Federal Reserve Chair Role Matter So Much? Before diving deeper into the specific rumor and denial, it’s crucial to understand just how significant the position of Federal Reserve Chair is. Often described as the second most powerful person in Washington D.C., the Fed Chair heads the United States’ central banking system. Their decisions and commentary have profound impacts not just on the U.S. economy but on global financial markets. Here’s a quick look at why this role is so influential: Monetary Policy: The Fed controls interest rates and the money supply, tools used to manage inflation and employment. The Chair is the primary spokesperson and often the driving force behind these critical decisions. Economic Stability: The Fed plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the financial system, acting as a lender of last resort during crises. Market Sentiment: The Chair’s words are closely watched by investors worldwide. Their outlook on the economy can trigger significant market movements. Global Influence: As the head of the world’s most influential central bank, the Fed Chair’s actions ripple across international economies and currency markets. Given this immense power and influence, speculation about who might hold this position, especially in the context of a potential future administration like the Trump Administration , naturally attracts significant attention. Who is Scott Bessent, and Why Was His Name Mentioned? Scott Bessent is a prominent figure in the financial world. He is a hedge fund manager and previously served as a key economic advisor during the first Trump Administration . While the initial report incorrectly referred to him as the current U.S. Treasury Secretary (that position is currently held by Janet Yellen), Bessent’s background in finance and his ties to former President Trump have made him a subject of speculation for potential high-level economic roles in a future administration, including Treasury Secretary or even Fed Chairman . His name likely surfaced due to ongoing discussions and jockeying for potential positions should Donald Trump return to the presidency. In political circles, speculation about potential cabinet members and agency heads begins well in advance of elections. The White House Response: What Does ‘Groundless’ Mean? The core of the news is the unequivocal denial from the White House . Calling the reports ‘groundless’ is a strong statement. It suggests that, from the current administration’s perspective, there is no basis in fact for the claim that Scott Bessent is being seriously considered as the next Federal Reserve Chair . Several reasons could be behind such a denial: The report is genuinely false, based on misinterpretation or faulty information. While discussions might occur, they are not at a stage where Bessent is a ‘strong candidate’ or that the administration is ‘moving to nominate’ him. The denial could be managing expectations or correcting premature reporting. The White House may wish to avoid unnecessary speculation or political distraction surrounding a critical, non-partisan role like the Fed Chair, especially if the rumor is tied to a potential future administration. It’s important to note the sources involved: Bloomberg initially reported the rumor (citing an unnamed source), and Walter Bloomberg (an economic news aggregator on X) reported the White House denial. Relying on official statements from the White House is key when evaluating such claims. Navigating Political Rumors and Economic Speculation This incident highlights the challenge of distinguishing between political speculation and confirmed news, especially concerning crucial economic roles like the Fed Chairman . For investors, market participants, and the general public, it serves as a reminder to: Verify Sources: Always look for official statements from the involved parties (like the White House or the Fed itself). Understand the Context: Consider the political climate and the nature of the source reporting the rumor. Treat Rumors with Caution: Unconfirmed reports, especially those citing anonymous sources, should be treated as speculation rather than fact. The process of selecting a Federal Reserve Chair is a significant event, involving careful consideration by the President and confirmation by the Senate. While names are often floated and discussed behind the scenes, official announcements are the only reliable indicators of who is being seriously considered or nominated. Challenges in Appointment and Market Impact The appointment of a Federal Reserve Chair is often a political tightrope walk. The candidate needs economic credibility, political acceptability, and the ability to command confidence from markets and the public. Challenges include: Finding a candidate who aligns with the administration’s broad economic philosophy but can also maintain the Fed’s crucial independence. Navigating the Senate confirmation process, which can be contentious. Ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in monetary policy. Market reactions to potential Fed Chair appointments can vary. A candidate perceived as more hawkish (leaning towards higher interest rates to control inflation) might cause jitters in markets, while a dovish candidate (leaning towards lower rates to stimulate growth) might be viewed positively, particularly by asset markets including cryptocurrencies, which can be sensitive to liquidity and interest rate environments. However, in this specific instance, the news is the *denial* of a rumor, which likely has minimal immediate market impact compared to a confirmed nomination or appointment. Concluding Thoughts on the Scott Bessent Rumor In summary, reports suggesting Scott Bessent is a leading candidate for Federal Reserve Chair have been firmly denied by the White House . While Bessent’s background and connection to the Trump Administration make him a name that might surface in future speculation regarding economic roles, the current official stance is clear: the reports are ‘groundless’. This serves as a valuable reminder in the current news environment to prioritize official confirmations over unverified rumors, particularly when they concern roles as critical as the head of the U.S. central bank.

Lawmakers on the House Agriculture Committee voted 47-6 on Tuesday to advance the bill, moving it one step closer to broader congressional review, with Committee Chair GT Thompson confirming it will now head to the full House and that members may submit counterarguments by the end of the week. As the House Agriculture Committee advanced the bill, the House Financial Services Committee held a concurrent session to consider amendments that could reshape key provisions within the bill. One proposed amendment, introduced by Representative French Hill, seeks to include specific protections for blockchain developers. At the time of publication, that amendment had not yet been brought to a vote. Tensions surfaced during the session as some lawmakers raised concerns about potential risks tied to crypto market regulation. You might also like: Ripple urges SEC clarity on digital asset and investment contract separation Representative Brad Sherman argued the bill could enable “bailouts” in the event of market failures, while fellow Democrat Maxine Waters proposed adding provisions to address alleged conflicts of interest related to former President Donald Trump’s crypto holdings. Neither amendment was adopted following voice votes. Committee Chair Hill pushed back on the criticisms, stating the bill is focused on “consistency” and not on bailouts. He said the legislation aims to clarify when a digital asset should be treated as a security under SEC oversight or as a commodity under the CFTC’s authority. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act was introduced in May and is part of a broader legislative push to create transparent and practical guidelines for digital asset firms operating in the U.S. It outlines a regulatory structure that distinguishes which assets fall under the SEC or CFTC jurisdiction, sets parameters for digital asset custody, and proposes rules for various asset classes, including stablecoins. During earlier hearings, the bill has sparked debate on whether non-custodial platform developers, those who do not directly manage user funds, should face liability. “We need to decide if developers still face potential questions of liability,” Congressman Tom Emmer, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said at the time, warning that unclear rules could discourage talent from building in the U.S. House Democrats, in the meantime, argued that the bill could dilute the SEC’s oversight of crypto markets, creating regulatory loopholes that would allow traditional financial firms to rebrand as crypto entities and evade stricter scrutiny.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization surged with renewed strength, and its move sparked widespread optimism across the broader altcoin space and revived hopes that a new altseason may be just around the corner. Although it is still too early to verify an altcoin cycle in full swing, Ethereum’s latest surge has already begun to alter market sentiment. Decentralized finance tokens have roared back, and traders are more frequently citing macro and regulatory reasons that could push $ETH out into the wild blue yonder of a sustained uptrend. Traders Turn Bullish as Ethereum Gains Strength The market’s revitalized energy seems to come from a mix of technical breakout patterns and optimistic developments regarding adoption by institutions and regulatory clarity. The prominent crypto trader and analyst @Pentosh1 captured the sentiment well, tweeting, “Day 1 of the breakout for $ETH — momentum & catalysts building from TradFi and the SEC.” The reference to both traditional finance (TradFi) and the SEC suggests that Ethereum is being seen as a benefactor of a fresh wave of legitimacy that’s coming from both regulatory and institutional directions. Yet another widely recognized voice within the Ethereum community, @iamDCinvestor, reverberated this bullish stance, stating, “$ETH season is here. DeFi leaders at the White House, not in jail. Barbell strategy: $ETH + ecosystem.” The tweet references an entirely different political climate today for Ethereum — one that is not necessarily more favorable, but is certainly more engaging. When discussing political engagement, these days a lot of people tend to bring up Elizabeth Warren, but leaders from across the political spectrum have been more frequently mentioning Ethereum and DeFi. At the same time, investor and podcast host @RyanSAdams highlighted what many view as a fundamental mispricing: “$ETH is cheaper than a year ago, despite major progress. It’s a miracle to buy under $3K.” This perception underscores a disconnect that many see between Ethereum’s continued development — including the rollout of Layer 2 solutions and increased staking activity — and its current price. Hot Topic Today: $ETH Leads Altcoin Rally. Are Traders Turning Bullish? The crypto market broke out of consolidation overnight, with $ETH leading the charge and fueling a strong DeFi rebound. It's too early to declare altseason, but signs are emerging. If $ETH holds momentum,… pic.twitter.com/nraHjZhPDm — Followin (@followin_io) June 10, 2025 DeFi Rebounds as Altcoins Follow Ethereum’s Lead Ethereum’s gains have reignited interest in DeFi tokens. If the market wasn’t quite in a full-blown “altseason” yet, it might just now be starting to enter one. With the volume of trades and the speculative nature of the trading in this decentralized financial sector, a clear picture is starting to emerge that a number of DeFi protocols are picking up steam. And the altcoins themselves? Well, as was just suggested, they’re likely in the beginning stages of being picked up and rotated into across the market. Bullish patterns are being discovered in the charts by technical analysts. Trader @Thecryptolord_ remarked, “$ETH is forming an ascending triangle. The bias is bullish — worst case is boring chop.” In general, ascending triangles are interpreted as patterns that continue and lead to further upward movement. This gives more confidence to traders working in short- and medium-term timeframes who are looking for entry points. If Ethereum keeps on its breakout path, the effect on altcoins — especially those within its ecosystem — could be significant. Projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Lido, not to mention long-standing DeFi names like Aave and Uniswap, could see a renewed spotlight and incoming capital. Market Cautiously Watches for Confirmation Even with the increasing positive sentiment, confirmation is still needed before the start of a larger altcoin cycle can be declared. With regards to overall market confidence, Ethereum is a big key driver. It is, however, vital that it not only holds above the major resistance zones, but also that we see its new momentum maintained over several days before judging whether this particular altcoin is ready for liftoff. The next few weeks will be revealing. If $ETH confirms a breakout, it could unleash a huge wave of upward momentum for the altcoin market as a whole. Conversely, if $ETH gets turned back, it could lead to even more of a negative sideways slide for many of these altcoins in their current price ranges. Currently, Ethereum has sent a clear signal: the bulls are still in control. Whether this transitions into a complete altseason or is just a momentary pause in a turbulent year will rely on ongoing price action and the larger macro and regulatory context. But for the first time in what seems like ages, there is tangible optimism in the air — and traders are conversing once more about momentum trades, not just getting by.

This AI Token Could Prove You Wrong Again appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When Solana (SOL) was introduced, it faced skepticism from investors who doubted its ability to compete with other established blockchains. Fast forward to today, Solana stands as one of the top players in the crypto market, proving its critics wrong. Now, Ruvi AI , an emerging blockchain project powered by artificial intelligence, is mirroring Solana’s early trajectory. With its presale success, cutting-edge applications, and explosive growth potential, Ruvi AI may be the next breakout star for investors who missed the Solana opportunity. The Early Days of Solana Solana’s technology was initially met with caution as it promised to outpace Ethereum with its speed and scalability.

Its miners include over 60,000 units hosted by Hut 8 in North America, and they deliver over 10 EH/s in hashrate. The firm holds its BTC with Coinbase Custody and plans to merge with Gryphon Digital Mining, with Eric Trump joining the board post-merger. Meanwhile, Bitcoin adoption by corporations is growing, and Michael Saylor even recently urged Apple to buy BTC instead of pursuing more stock buybacks. Global momentum is also building as GameStop, Metaplanet, and The Blockchain Group are all increasing Bitcoin reserves. Additionally, the Bank of Japan’s June 16–17 meeting could spur a Bitcoin rally if the central bank pivots back to QE. Trump Mining Firm Stacks Bitcoin American Bitcoin, the mining firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., quietly amassed a reserve of 215 Bitcoin since launching on April 1. This is according to a recent SEC filing . The company has made it clear that its core strategy centers on accumulating Bitcoin rather than treating it as a byproduct of mining. The stache is currently worth over $23 million, but was not previously disclosed. ABTC described its reserve as a strategic asset which goal is to enhance long-term shareholder value, with no fixed accumulation target in place. Instead, the company said it plans to continually evaluate market conditions to opportunistically raise capital and expand its holdings. Rather than owning physical infrastructure, ABTC directly invests in mining hardware. The firm operates more than 60,000 miners, primarily from Bitmain and MicroBT, which are hosted at facilities in New York, Alberta, and Texas managed by Hut 8 . These miners collectively generate a hashrate of 10.17 exahashes per second, with energy efficiency averaging 21.2 joules per terahash. By partnering with Hut 8, ABTC kept overhead costs low while maintaining the flexibility to scale production. The firm also contributes to mining pools like Foundry and Luxor, with rewards distributed according to hashrate contributions and pool fees kept below 1%. (Source: SEC filing ) ABTC follows a three-tiered approach: building cost-effective mining operations, expanding its Bitcoin reserves through strategic capital use, and engaging actively with the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. The firm’s Bitcoin is held securely in cold wallets with Coinbase Custody, and uses multifactor authentication and strict withdrawal protocols to safeguard assets. On May 12, ABTC revealed plans to go public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The transaction will be structured as a stock-for-stock deal, and will result in the combined entity operating under the American Bitcoin name. Eric Trump is set to join the board post-merger, while Hut 8, the majority shareholder, will maintain its role in managing infrastructure and operations. Once completed, current ABTC shareholders will own about 98% of the new company. Saylor Tells Apple to Buy Bitcoin Other companies are also being encouraged to embrace Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, urged Apple to consider buying Bitcoin as a strategic alternative to its underperforming stock buyback program. In a June 10 post on X , Saylor responded to CNBC host Jim Cramer’s critique of Apple’s buyback initiative, which was described as ineffective despite a $110 billion allocation disclosed in a May 2024 SEC filing. Cramer suggested the company reevaluate its approach because relying solely on buybacks may no longer be viable. Saylor’s suggestion is grounded in Bitcoin’s very impressive historical performance. While Apple shares climbed 137% over the past five years, Bitcoin soared more than 1,000%. Bitcoin also climbed 17% since the start of the year, while Apple faced an almost 17% drop. The implication is that a Bitcoin allocation could serve as a much better vehicle for shareholder value appreciation than continued stock repurchases. Apple YTD share price (Source: Google ) This call happened during a broader wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption. GameStop recently disclosed a $513 million Bitcoin purchase, and bought 4,710 BTC after a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. In Asia, Metaplanet has become the eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with its stock rising by more than 12% after announcing a $5.4 billion capital raise to expand its BTC holdings even more. Across Europe, Paris-based The Blockchain Group is planning to raise over $340 million for its Bitcoin treasury, shortly after acquiring $68 million worth of BTC. Bitcoin’s growing appeal to corporations is also encouraged by a rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF flows. After a brief two-day dip, funds recorded over $386 million in net inflows on June 9, which could mean that there is renewed institutional interest. Saylor’s suggestion that Apple follow suit taps into this momentum, as Bitcoin continues to stand out as a serious asset for corporate treasuries looking for long-term growth and diversification. BOJ Pivot Could Boost Bitcoin Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan’s upcoming monetary policy meeting on June 16–17 is being closely watched as a potential turning point for global risk assets, including Bitcoin and equities. Market participants, including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, believe the central bank could reintroduce quantitative easing (QE) measures and reverse its tightening stance. Hayes suggested in a June 10 post on X that if the BOJ delays its current quantitative tightening (QT) program and resumes targeted QE, it could trigger a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin. QE is a monetary policy tool that is used to inject liquidity into the economy through large-scale bond purchases. It tends to lower interest rates and fuel asset prices during economic uncertainty. Back in July of 2024, the Bank of Japan announced a plan to reduce its government bond purchases by 400 billion yen per quarter starting in August. This started a shift toward QT after years of ultra-loose monetary policy. However, sources that were referred to by Bloomberg indicate that the BOJ is now considering a more gradual reduction, with a revised plan to cut only 200 billion yen per quarter beginning in 2027. The central bank’s June meeting includes an interim assessment of this tightening program, making it a critical juncture for possible policy shifts. Bitcoin’s sensitivity to developments in Japan’s bond market became evident in May 2025, when the cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high of $112,000 just two days after 30-year Japanese bond yields spiked to a record 3.185%. The yield surge caused fears about Japan’s fiscal stability, which pushed investors to seek alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. According to André Dragosch , head of European research at Bitwise, these concerns about sovereign default risks strengthened the perception of Bitcoin as a hedge free from counterparty risk. As traditional safe-haven assets like government bonds become more volatile, Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge is gaining more and more traction.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-11 06:16:19

In a new video, trader Kevin Svenson tells his 83,200 YouTube followers that Bitcoin appears to be in the final stages of a parabolic trend that began in 2023. According to Svenson, Bitcoin could ignite a fresh leg up once it takes out its final resistance area at around $110,000. “It’s going to be a really epic next few months if we do get this breakout, because we are still following the parabolic trend to this day.” Svenson believes that a breakout will trigger a “blow-off top” for Bitcoin, where BTC will experience a period of rapid price increases before collapsing. “The next phase is the vertical phase, where you go into a potential blow-off top. A parabola is simply just an exponential trend and it gets steeper and steeper. And because of that, by definition, the parabolic trend it’s unsustainable… It’s a trade-off: it gets really, really bullish, and because of that, it’s unsustainable. Eventually, the trend just gives out just like Bitcoin in 2017, 2021. Eventually, the trend will shift back… But this next push could be until October.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will soar to $135,000 in the coming months.

The bill, H.B. 7082, published by the Connecticut General Assembly on Tuesday, was anonymously approved by both the state House of Representatives and the Senate, with no opposing votes. Further, the legislation has updated the state’s money transmission laws, with a major focus on crypto regulation. Crypto businesses engaging in money transmissions should disclose all material risks associated with crypto, the new law reads. NEW: Connecticut passes law to ban state investment in bitcoin.

Additionally, the bill mandates legal guardian verification for users under the age of 18, imposing protections for minors. Connecticut Falls Out of Bitcoin Reserve Race Following months of strategic Bitcoin reserve proposals from 27 states, New Hampshire , Arizona , and Texas have approved state-level Bitcoin reserve law. For instance, Texas has a “significant budget surplus” and a strategic Bitcoin reserve in that state “offers a forward-thinking investment opportunity,” Lee Bratcher, President of The Texas Blockchain Council, told Cryptonews . “Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value aligns with our state’s history of making smart, diversified investments in emerging assets,” he said at the time. However, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation this year, joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. The hesitance to embrace BTC comes amid concerns over its price volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve , a significant move, but, didn’t have concrete details, failing to excite traders.

The ETF's distributions are classified as return of capital, offering tax deferral benefits until the fund is sold, which can appeal to long-term investors. Risks include declining distributions, potential for the fund price to approach zero, and uncertainty about sustaining high yields in the future. I rate CONY a 'hold'—it may be suitable for income-focused investors, but COIN offers higher total return potential for growth-oriented investors. This may not be for everyone, but the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) currently pays a 175% annual yield with distributions paid monthly. This fund can be a great way to collect monthly income with such a high yield. The fund doesn't invest directly in Coinbase ( COIN ). CONY generates income for distributions by writing (selling) call options on Coinbase. Since COIN tends to be a volatile stock, the premiums sold can be high from the elevated implied volatility of the call options. Some investors may prefer to do their own covered call strategy. However, CONY provides the convenience of having professionals manage those options regularly in exchange for a reasonable fee (expense ratio) of 1.22%. Investors of CONY buy the fund and then enjoy the high monthly distributions without much effort. The expense ratio looks reasonable considering the high annual yield that investors can derive from CONY. Understanding CONY's Performance Stock Performance of COIN vs. CONY (Weekly Chart) Including Dividends ( TradingView ) The weekly chart above shows the performance of COIN's stock price with a comparison to CONY's performance, including the distribution payouts. Even with CONY's generous monthly payouts, COIN still outperformed. The reason for this is because CONY's price declined significantly since inception. The YieldMax ETFs tend to underperform the underlying stocks that they derive income from. So, some investors may prefer to own COIN instead of CONY. In that scenario, COIN holders could sell some shares when income is needed. I will point out that Coinbase is currently in an uptrend on the weekly chart. This is indicated with the purple RSI line (middle of the chart) above the 50 level and the blue MACD line (bottom of the chart) above the red signal line. The MACD's green rising histogram bars also reinforce COIN's uptrend. Defenders of CONY may point out that they are happy with a lower total return with the consistent convenience of collecting monthly income from it. Defenders of holding COIN instead of CONY may say that they prefer the higher total return, especially when CONY's expense ratio adds to its total underperformance. The price of CONY declined over the long term since its inception. However, CONY's high yield allows investors to receive more in distributions than what they invested into it in a relatively short period of time. At the current yield, it would take less than a year. Therefore, CONY could lose all of its value and investors could still be profitable from the high distributions. Of course, this assumes that YieldMax is consistently successful with producing strong income. CONY's Tax Benefit Another plus for CONY is that the distributions are taxed differently than regular dividends. Since income from CONY is essentially options income, it is considered return of capital when paid out. The return of capital reduces the adjusted cost basis. According to IRS rules , return of capital is not taxed in the year that you receive the income. It would only be taxed when the ETF is sold. Therefore, a long-term holder of the fund could enjoy multiple years of income from CONY without being taxed on it if they choose not to sell. It is important to note that if the price of CONY went to zero, future distributions would be taxed in the year that you receive them. It is possible that the fund would do a reverse split if the price approached zero. This would allow the fund to continue and for YieldMax to continue paying distributions. Distribution Payout History CONY's Distribution Payout History (Seeking Alpha) We can see from the table above that 2025 was the first year that the monthly distributions dropped below $1 per share. This is relative to the price of CONY. For example, back on December 7, 2023, the distribution of $2.4615 was a monthly yield of 10.7% based on CONY's price on that day of $23.04. Recently, on May 29, 2025, the distribution of $0.7351 was a monthly yield of 9.5% based on CONY's price of $7.75 on that day. While the monthly yield did drop, it didn't drop as drastically as the percentage change of the distribution payout. Investors can purchase more shares as CONY's price drops, which can increase their monthly returns. That can include reinvesting some of the distributions to purchase more shares. Risks for CONY I realize that it sounds cliche, but there is no guarantee that future results will be similar to the past. It is possible that YieldMax is not able to produce high distributions going forward the way they did in the past. The implied volatility of the options sold could change, which could produce different results for distribution payouts. CONY's underlying price could continue to drop and approach zero. So, investors need to realize that the distributions are what can make them money from this ETF. YieldMax would probably do a reverse split to increase the price of CONY if it dropped too low. YieldMax did a reverse split on TSLY back in February 2024. It is also possible that the monthly distributions are lowered significantly, making the total annual yield less attractive. This could also significantly increase the amount of time that it would take for investors to make back their initial investment in distributions. Final Thoughts on CONY I see CONY fit for investors who desire steady monthly payouts. Personally, I would strive to get the highest return on my money as possible. That means that I would prefer to own COIN, which tends to have a higher total return even when CONY's dividends are accounted for. Those who prefer COIN should keep an eye on Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) bull markets. The reason for this is because COIN tends to trend similar to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's bear markets can be brutal, and the same is true for COIN. CONY began trading in 2023. So, it hasn't been around during Bitcoin's last halving cycle. It is possible that CONY's opposite, the YieldMax Short COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( FIAT ) would be better to own after Bitcoin and COIN peak this cycle. However, there is not much history to gauge how CONY and FIAT would perform during a Bitcoin bear market.

With only 450 BTC mined daily, Saylor warns that $50M in buying pressure can drive prices sharply higher. Institutions, ETFs, and governments are accelerating Bitcoin accumulation. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, has dismissed speculation that a new crypto winter is on the horizon, doubling down on his bullish Bitcoin outlook. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday , Saylor stated, “Winter is not coming back. We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” His comments arrive amid a tightening Bitcoin supply and increased institutional interest. Saylor: Only 450 Bitcoin Mined Daily According to Saylor, just 450 BTC are available for sale each day from miners, amounting to roughly $50 million at Bitcoin’s current price of $109,859. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” he said, adding that public companies are now absorbing “the entire natural supply.” Strategy, which began accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, now holds 582,000 BTC—worth approximately $63.85 billion, according to Saylor Tracker. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn,” he noted. The billionaire also referenced broader market signals as validation for his aggressive forecast. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” Saylor said, pointing to traditional financial institutions preparing Bitcoin custody services and political support from key figures in Washington.

PARABOLIC SOON pic.twitter.com/Vv7qSRIgst — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) June 10, 2025 He cited President Donald Trump’s backing of Bitcoin, as well as support from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC Chair Paul Atkins. “Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected,” Saylor said. Saylor did acknowledge potential volatility at higher price levels, stating that if Bitcoin rises to $500,000 or $1 million, it would be realistic to expect it “crashing down by about $200,000 a coin.” His remarks come as other major players revise their own projections upward. In April, ARK Invest raised its “bull case” price target for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. ETF Providers Continue to Accumulate Bitcoin Meanwhile, ETF providers such as BlackRock continue to purchase Bitcoin on a daily basis, and some governments are stepping in as well. On May 28, Pakistan’s crypto council head Bilal Bin Saqib announced plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Notably, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

The earnings report, which was published on June 10th, shows that the company’s core business areas, from investing to wealth management and cryptocurrency offerings, have seen significant growth. Net contribution, or revenue after direct costs, increased 8% year-over-year to $217 million, driven by increased user activity across global markets. Net income under generally accepted accounting principles, which measures overall profitability after operating expenses and taxes, was $60 million. The company also posted $80 million in adjusted EBITDA, a metric that reflects operational earnings by excluding non-cash items and one-off expenses like marketing campaigns or acquisitions. Thanks to ongoing efforts to increase user acquisition and retention, funded accounts increased 14% from the previous year to 3.58 million. Assets under administration increased by 21% to $14.8 billion compared to Q1 2024. eToro ended the quarter with $736 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 climbed 0.5 percent by midmorning to 38,385.37, buoyed by data from the Bank of Japan showing wholesale inflation eased in May. That slowdown may reduce pressure on the central bank to lift interest rates at its next policy meeting. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng added 0.8 percent, reaching 24,364.77, while Shanghai’s main index rose 0.5 percent to 3,402.72. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 inched up 0.3 percent to 8,612.40, and South Korea’s Kospi was 0.6 percent higher at 2,889.88. Overnight in New York, US stocks extended their rally. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to close at 6,038.81, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent to 42,866.87, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6 percent, finishing at 19,714.99. This strength follows a drop of nearly 20 percent from record highs two months ago, triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of hefty tariffs that stoked fears of a recession. Much of the recent rebound has been driven by hopes that the White House will roll back duties after striking trade deals abroad. The S&P 500 now sits just 1.7 percent below its February peak. Still, some analysts say the latest talks produced more reaffirmation than fresh progress. After two days of meetings in London, officials in the late hours agreed on what had largely been outlined earlier. “So what did 48 hours of talks actually produce? Apparently, a reaffirmation to eventually do what they had already said they would do. If markets were expecting substance, they got process instead,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. Lutnick said the talks are going well, spiking optimism US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, speaking in London Tuesday evening, described discussions with Chinese counterparts as “going really, really well.” Both sides have suspended many of the tariffs they imposed on each other to keep negotiations on track. A survey released Tuesday showed that small-business optimism in the United States ticked up slightly in May. In individual stock moves, Tesla shares jumped 5.7 percent, recouping some ground after last week’s sell-off. The electric-car maker fell sharply when founder Elon Musk’s public spat with President Trump raised concerns about possible government retaliation against the company. Meanwhile, US–traded shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, rose 2.6 percent after the firm said its May revenue surged nearly 40 percent from a year earlier. On bond markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury eased to 4.48 percent from 4.47 percent late Tuesday. In commodities, benchmark US crude added eight cents to $65.06 a barrel, and Brent crude crept up two cents to $66.89 a barrel. In currency trading, the dollar strengthened slightly against the yen, trading at 145.08 yen versus 144.84 yen on Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.1418 from $1.1425.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-xrp-retail-investors-will-get-completely-priced-out-this-year-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Cobb took to X to comment on the changing dynamics of XRP’s market accessibility, highlighting a growing concern among long-time followers of the asset. In a brief but pointed statement, Cobb reflected on the diminishing purchasing power of retail investors by contrasting current and past valuations of XRP . “Remember when $100 used to get you 400 XRP,” Cobb wrote. “Now $100 only gets you 43 XRP. Only going to get worse, retail is going to get completely priced out this year.” Cobb’s remark underscores a significant appreciation in XRP’s value, paired with a growing unease about the affordability of accumulating the token. At the time of his post, $100 could only purchase approximately 43 XRP, reflecting a market price of $2.32 per token. Remember when $100 used to get you 400 XRP Now $100 only gets you 43 XRP Only going to get worse, retail is going get completely priced out this year — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 9, 2025 According to CoinMarketCap, XRP is up 1.23% over the last 24 hours, which further reinforces the trajectory Cobb is pointing to. The implication is clear: if XRP continues its current momentum, average investors could soon find themselves unable to buy meaningful quantities . XRP’s Fractional Nature Sparks Debate About Accessibility The commentary attracted responses from other users on the platform, each providing different perspectives on Cobb’s warning. Andrew Pearce responded by offering a counterpoint to Cobb’s concern, stating, “Don’t forget, there are 1000000 drops in each xrp, so we will never really be priced out of xrp. People might get ‘priced out’ in a certain cycle where they think the price has gone too high in the short term, but within another year or two they’ll be fomo’ing in at way higher prices.” Pearce’s comment references the divisibility of XRP into one million units called “drops,” which allows for fractional purchases even at high valuations. His response suggests that while the full coin may become more expensive, access to the asset in smaller increments will remain technically available, though possibly less psychologically or strategically appealing for retail buyers. Community Members Reflect on XRP’s Early Days Another user, LunarAngel, contributed to the historical context of XRP’s pricing, recalling an era of far lower valuations. “I can tell you there was a time it was 300 coin per dollar when it was open coming with a webwallet. During the XRapid era. I was there but then I missed the journey even till now,” the user wrote. Their comment points to a time when XRP could be acquired for as little as $0.0033, dramatically different from today’s pricing. It reflects the sentiment of early adopters who witnessed the coin’s journey through utility-focused initiatives such as the now-shelved xRapid product. Ongoing Price Appreciation Raises Barriers to Entry Cobb’s observation reflects a larger theme in crypto markets, where early access often translates into disproportionately greater rewards, while later entrants must navigate higher barriers. His claim that retail will be “completely priced out” this year hinges on the assumption that XRP’s value will continue to climb rapidly—an outcome that, while speculative, is supported by the asset’s current momentum. Cobb’s comment did not provide a specific target price or timeline, but it does emphasize his broader outlook: that the window for affordable retail accumulation may be closing soon.

The rally, marked by a V-shaped recovery from key support levels, is indicative of DOGE’s resilience as it attracts attention from both retail and institutional investors. News Background Dogecoin’s latest rally comes amid renewed interest in meme coins and growing speculation around a potential DOGE ETF. According to Polymarket data, traders now estimate a 51% chance of SEC approval for a DOGE ETF in 2025, a development that could bring substantial institutional inflows. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s integration with the Coinbase-backed Base network has enhanced its utility in DeFi applications, making it easier for users to engage with the token across multiple platforms. As geopolitical tensions and evolving trade policies continue to roil traditional markets, Dogecoin’s role as a speculative asset — and potential hedge — remains in focus. Institutional whale activity, along with sustained interest from high-volume traders, suggests the token could remain a key performer even amid broader market uncertainty. Price Action Dogecoin’s rally was highlighted by a dramatic price surge during the 11:00-13:00 window, where volume spiked to 541 million and 589 million units respectively — more than double the average. The surge established a strong high-volume resistance zone at $0.198-$0.199. DOGE’s price bounced decisively from $0.194 support, forming a V-shaped recovery pattern with renewed buyer interest. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE climbed from $0.189 to $0.199, a 4.8% gain. Significant volatility occurred during 11:00-13:00 UTC, with volumes of 541 million and 589 million. Resistance established at $0.198-$0.199, with support at $0.189. V-shaped recovery pattern formed in the final hour, with substantial buying interest at $0.194. Volume spikes at 01:56 UTC to 7.2 million and during the final 10 minutes confirmed strong buyer interest. Price established new resistance at $0.196, suggesting potential continuation of the uptrend.

As XRP basks in post-lawsuit clarity, Lightchain AI surges ahead with real-world traction and a $21m presale milestone. Table of Contents XRP stays in the spotlight amid ongoing developments Lightchain AI builds confidence through presale execution Lightchain AI is shaping the future of decentralized solutions While XRP gains attention through legal clarity, Lightchain AI is gaining something far more actionable, real-world momentum driven by strategic presale execution. With all 15 stages now completed and a Bonus Round currently live at a fixed price of $0.007, the project has already secured nearly $21 million in early support. But beyond the numbers, it’s Lightchain AI’s focused rollout that’s turning heads: a fully functional AI Virtual Machine, developer grant incentives, and transparent governance all designed to build long-term traction. As XRP clears courtroom hurdles, Lightchain AI is clearing the path to adoption, one strategic, infrastructure-backed milestone at a time. XRP stays in the spotlight amid ongoing developments XRP continues to be at the center of the cryptocurrency market as legal and regulatory battles rage on. After winning partially in a court in July 2023, which determined that XRP generally isn’t a security, Ripple Labs ended litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May 2025. Ripple has settled a protracted lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that started in December 2020, agreeing to pay a $50 million fine. The clarity provided by this resolution, on XRP, has also helped drive an increase in price as investors are now more confident. Still, the internal disagreement at the SEC over the terms of the settlement have underscored continuing disputes over the regulation of crypto. But XRP’s fate is also a litmus test for how the broader cryptocurrency industry will maintain its connection with U.S. regulators, at a time when the regulatory landscape around crypto is changing quickly. You might also like: Ethereum scales strong, but Lightchain AI leads presale with dev-first design Lightchain AI builds confidence through presale execution Lightchain AI is steadily building market confidence through its disciplined and transparent presale execution. With over $21 million raised across 15 carefully phased presale stages, the project has demonstrated consistency, clear communication, and a commitment to long-term value. Now in its fixed-price Bonus Round, Lightchain continues to attract strategic buyers by backing its momentum with real infrastructure, public GitHub repositories, a live Developer Portal, and decentralized validator and contributor nodes. Its tokenomics further boost confidence: the original 5% Team Allocation has been fully reallocated to grants and ecosystem growth, aligning incentives with builders. This structured, utility-first approach sends a clear message, Lightchain AI isn’t built on speculation, but on delivery. And that’s exactly what today’s serious investors are seeking. Lightchain AI is shaping the future of decentralized solutions Lightchain AI is turning ambition into action with its final Bonus Round, offering LCAI tokens at just $0.007125 ahead of the highly anticipated July 2025 mainnet launch. With over $21 million already raised, the project is taking a bold step by reallocating 5% of team tokens to empower developers and infrastructure partners. At launch, Lightchain AI will open its public repositories, inviting transparency and global collaboration. This game-changing initiative cements Lightchain AI as a leader in decentralized AI, driving innovation with purpose and precision.

The sidechain brings Ethereum smart contract compatibility to XRPL using wrapped XRP as gas. XRPL also expanded its stablecoin ecosystem with EURØP and USDB to strengthen regional adoption. The XRP Ledger is preparing to roll out an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain in Q2, marking a major step toward Ethereum compatibility. The development was confirmed by Ripple CTO David Schwartz at the Apex 2025 event in Singapore , with blockchain firm Peersyst helping lead the effort. The EVM sidechain is designed to combine the XRP Ledger’s low-cost, high-speed settlement layer with Ethereum’s robust smart contract capabilities. XRP Ledger’s EVM Sidechain is Live on Testnet Built using the evmOS software stack, the sidechain is currently live on testnet, with a mainnet launch expected later this quarter after further validator onboarding. Unlike Ethereum-native blockchains, the XRP Ledger does not currently support the EVM environment that powers most decentralized applications. The new sidechain aims to fill that gap while preserving XRP’s efficiency. A bridge will link the sidechain to the XRP Ledger mainnet, using Axelar as the sole provider for asset transfers. The one and only @JoelKatz and Ripple’s @jazzicoop announced the XRPL EVM is going live Q2 at Apex featuring some DeFi apps like @StrobeFinance @vertex_protocol , @SecurdLabs and @squidrouter building on it pic.twitter.com/EPhz1JcdiA — Peersyst Technology (@Peersyst) June 11, 2025 Wrapped XRP will act as the gas token on the EVM sidechain, enabling smart contract execution without leaving the broader XRP ecosystem. While the Flare Network already offers an EVM-compatible solution for XRP users, this move brings Ethereum integration directly under Ripple’s umbrella. In May, the XRP Ledger expanded its stablecoin offerings with the launch of two new region-specific assets, including EURØP, a MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin from Schuman Financial, and USDB, a dollar-pegged token issued by Brazil’s Braza Group. EURØP, backed by euros and safeguarded by major institutions like Societe Generale, marks the first fully MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin on XRPL. Meanwhile, Braza Group’s USDB stablecoin, backed by U.S. and Brazilian bonds, offers Brazilian users a secure digital asset for payments and hedging. XRP Faces Backlash as Ripple Aligns With Europe on Digital Euro Project As reported, serial entrepreneur and investor Gary Cardone has launched a scathing attack on XRP , accusing the digital asset of aligning itself with centralized governments in a bid to stay relevant. His remarks follow ongoing speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) may integrate the XRP Ledger into its digital euro infrastructure. While the ECB has not confirmed any formal partnership with Ripple or its XRP Ledger, rumors have circulated across crypto circles. Cardone went further, likening XRP’s influence in finance to a new virus, calling it “COVID-19 Part Two in finance.” He warned that continued support for the token amounts to voting for “European warmongers,” framing XRP’s ambitions as a threat to freedom rather than a step forward in financial innovation. The comments drew immediate backlash from the XRP community, which labeled the remarks as inflammatory and unfounded. Robert Doyle, known online as Crypto Sensei, countered Cardone’s statements by noting that “there is no official confirmation” that Ripple technology will be used for the digital euro.

According to Koch, Bitcoin has become indispensable not only for individual investors but also for the US government. Koch examined Donald Trump’s drastic change in attitude towards Bitcoin. Describing Bitcoin as a “valueless bubble” in 2019, Trump signed a decree in the White House declaring Bitcoin a “strategic state reserve” after his re-election in 2024. Koch argues that this change is not random but part of a deliberate plan. The economic part of this plan is that Trump’s family runs a crypto fund, invests in Bitcoin mining and makes millions with their own memecoins. But that’s not the real issue, Koch says. Alongside Trump, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also completely changed his view on Bitcoin over the years. While Fink once described Bitcoin as a “money laundering index,” he began to describe it as a “financial revolution” by 2023. Koch says that these changes in attitude are not so much about personal gain but rather an effort to maintain the US’s economic leadership. The US’s global supremacy is based on three pillars: the dollar being the global reserve currency, the high demand for US bonds and technological leadership. Bitcoin and crypto markets have the capacity to play a strategic role in all three of these areas. Since 2020, the US government debt has increased from $23 trillion to $36 trillion, while the money supply has increased from $1.8 trillion to $2.4 trillion. Koch says that this level of debt would have long ago bankrupted any other country, but the US has been able to carry the burden thanks to the dollar’s global position. Related News: Secret Bitcoin Activities of a Company Supported by Donald Trump in the US Have Been Revealed - Here Are the Details This is where the crypto market comes in. The stablecoin market is a huge liquidity pool with a size of around $250 billion. Large issuers like Tether back most of their reserves with US Treasury bonds. This gives the crypto sector an important role in indirect financing of US debt. Citing Standard Chartered’s analysis, Koch argues that the stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion by 2028, in which case stablecoin issuers alone would own 15% of U.S. bonds. According to Simeon Koch, Bitcoin and crypto markets in general have become not only an investment tool, but also a lifeline for the sustainability of the US economy. The shift towards crypto by both political and financial elites is not only due to individual interests, but also systemic needs. As a result, Koch says the U.S. needs Bitcoin more than ever to maintain its economic stability and global leadership: “This is no longer an option, it’s a necessity.” Just a few years ago, many US officials viewed the growing power of stablecoin issuers in the bond market as a threat to the national budget. But the picture has quickly changed. Today, the crypto industry is supported by regulatory frameworks and encouraged to grow, provided, of course, that major players like Tether and Circle remain loyal to the US and its dollar. To strengthen this connection, a new bill called the “GENIUS Act” is currently being discussed in the US Congress. According to the bill, stablecoin issuers will be required to back the majority of the digital assets they issue with US Treasury bonds. The idea behind this strategy is clear: The more bonds stablecoin companies buy, the more easily the US can finance its budget deficit. At the same time, the fact that these companies hold large amounts of dollar reserves allows excess liquidity to be drawn out of the system, giving the US Federal Reserve more leeway to stimulate the economy by printing new dollars. According to Koch, Trump and his team have a clear understanding that the crypto market is not only a “liquidity sponge” against inflation, but also a loyal buyer of US debt. Therefore, the government’s welcoming approach to the crypto market is a natural consequence of this conscious strategy. According to the analyst, Donald Trump’s goal of making the US a global crypto leader also fits perfectly with this equation. The stronger the blockchain, the more transactions are made in US dollars. This means more dollar reserves are drawn into the system. If the dollar’s dominance in the crypto market is maintained, the US could also offset potential losses in the petrodollar system. For decades, the dollar’s dominant role in oil trading has been a cornerstone of US economic dominance. Now, crypto has the potential to take on that role. But this new collaboration is a double-edged sword: the crypto market is both gaining more traction and demand, and increasing its reliance on US-centric monetary policies and bonds. According to Simeon Koch’s analysis, Trump’s call to “never sell your Bitcoin” stems not from a crypto belief, but from a cold-blooded geostrategic calculation. *This is not investment advice.

This development was confirmed by Ripple CTO David Schwartz and Ripple’s director of product management, Jaazi Cooper, at the APEX 2025 conference in Singapore . The sidechain is designed to merge XRP Ledger’s fast, low-cost transactions with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. It’s built using the evmOS stack and currently runs on testnet. XRP Ledger’s EVM-compatible sidechain expected in Q2 David Schwartz, chief technology officer at @Ripple $XRP , announced at the APEX 2025 conference in Singapore that XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible sidechain will go live in the second quarter (Q2),… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) June 11, 2025 Bridging Ethereum and XRP Worlds The EVM compatibility is a game-changer for XRP Ledger (XRPL). It enables the network to seamlessly support Ethereum-based smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), significantly broadening XRPL’s developer base. This positions XRP Ledger to attract projects and developers from Ethereum’s vast ecosystem, effectively bridging the gap between the two chains. Testnet Growth Signals High Potential The XRPL EVM sidechain testnet, which went live earlier this year, is already showing strong signs of momentum. According to Peersyst Technologies, the infrastructure partner behind the project, the testnet has attracted 87 new contributors, all previously unaffiliated with XRP, who are now actively building infrastructure, applications, and driving adoption. Peersyst described the upcoming mainnet launch as possibly “the biggest onboarding in XRP history,” suggesting this could mark a major milestone in expanding the utility and reach of the XRPL ecosystem. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News: First XRP ETF Approval Could Happen by June 25 , What This Means for XRP Price Once it goes live, the new EVM sidechain will make the XRP Ledger much more useful. It will let developers build apps like DeFi projects and NFT platforms, just like they do on Ethereum. Plus, they’ll be able to use Solidity, Ethereum’s most popular programming language. As more Layer 1 blockchains compete, Ripple’s move to support Ethereum-based tools, while keeping XRP Ledger’s fast speed and low costs, could help it stand out again in the growing blockchain world. With the full launch expected by the end of Q2, the crypto community is watching closely. If successful, this sidechain could bring in a new era for XRP, one that extends far beyond remittances. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A DeFi project is designed to run independently of any centralized authority. Today, Ethereum is the most popular network for decentralized applications (dApps) that power DeFi use cases. The main advantage that DeFi has over traditional finance is that it is faster. A financial transaction on a dApp can be completed in seconds at a lower cost compared to the legacy financial system. This is because there are no middlemen and associated costs. As a result, people can lend, borrow, earn interest, and trade on the blockchain. Another benefit is that anyone can access DeFi without the need for extensive paperwork. How DeFi Evolved There is no definitive event or time when DeFi began. Instead, the system has developed gradually as people have created more use cases for blockchain technology. It has emerged out of a need to solve existing problems in the financial world. In this article, we will explore the top DeFi projects you should consider adding to your portfolio in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an emerging DeFi project that has taken the crypto world by storm. So far, conservative estimates forecast that MUTM tokens, the native token of the ecosystem, could rise by as much as 2,569% once it goes live. How it Works Mutuum Finance (MUYM) is built for lenders, borrowers, and liquidators. On the platform, lenders deposit their assets to earn interest, while borrowers can take loans and pay interest on those assets. One of the unique features of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its liquidity management. Unlike existing projects, which allow any type of asset on their platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will restrict the protocol to a subset of assets, which are known to have high liquidity and low volatility. The protocol will also vet tokens to determine if they are fully decentralized or controlled by a single entity. Any assets that show signs of price manipulation will not be allowed on the platform. Advantages Of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A major advantage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its intense focus on liquidity management and protocol solvency. It is also laser-focused on security and recently completed its CertiK audit, where it currently has a token Scan Score of 80. The project will also implement address screening measures to ensure that wallet addresses previously associated with bad actors do not make it onto the platform. However, the third-party address screening service will not have access to private data like IP addresses or metadata. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to offer targeted liquidity mining rewards. By targeted, it means resources will be focused on high-value tokens that have high demand on the open market. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will occasionally adjust parameters in the lending protocol to protect the ecosystem from arbitrage-induced outflows. The team plans to make this ecosystem multi-chain. The Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. The presale is currently in phase 5, and over 30% of the tokens have already been sold, barely a week after the current phase launched. To date, over $10.3 million has been raised from more than 11,900 participants in the presale. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. Monero (XMR) Monero (XMR) is a project that was created out of a need for privacy in the crypto market. It combines multiple technologies for this task. As a result, Monero has become famous around privacy circles. Monero was created out of a need to improve privacy on Bitcoin. This is because there are various tools today that can be used to unmask those behind a transaction. However, the main challenge with Monero (XMR) is utility. The token is not listed on many leading exchanges, which makes it difficult to have real world utility. Additionally, most merchants do not accept Monero (XMR) as payment. As a result, the price of XMR has suffered, with the coin down 10% in the past week alone.

It recently flashed a bullish golden cross on the daily chart – a signal that has many crypto analysts forecasting a potential new all-time high (ATH) in the near future. Ethereum Flashes Bullish Golden Cross In an X post published today, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that ETH has formed a golden cross on its daily chart. He shared the following chart and remarked that bullish momentum appears to be building for Ethereum. To explain, a golden cross is a bullish technical pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average (MA) – typically the 50-day – crosses above a long-term MA like the 200-day. It signals a potential shift in momentum and is often seen as an indicator of a sustained upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 – Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez commented on ETH’s recent price action. He noted that Ethereum has broken resistance on the 4-hour chart and could be setting up for a move as high as $2,920 in the coming days. Fellow market commentator Ted Pillows echoed a similar view. He stated that ETH is currently trading at a local range high, pushing against a key resistance level at $2,800. Pillows suggested that the digital asset might reach $4,000 later this month. Multiple technical indicators and market structure patterns are also hinting at near-term upside for ETH. For instance, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader observed a hidden bullish divergence on the 12-hour chart. A hidden bullish divergence occurs when price forms a higher low, while a momentum indicator – such as RSI or MACD – forms a lower low. This setup suggests that although momentum appears weak, the underlying trend remains intact, and a price continuation to the upside is likely. In a similar vein, digital assets analyst Crypto Caesar pointed out that Ethereum’s Wyckoff Accumulation pattern is “still playing out perfectly.” He shared a chart predicting that ETH may hit a new all-time high by August 2025. All Indicators Point To Further Upside Beyond the technical patterns, other on-chain and market indicators continue to support the bullish thesis. For instance, even after gaining over 11% in the past two weeks, Ethereum’s funding rates remain relatively neutral – a sign that the rally may still have room to grow.

Almost all of them—103 to be exact—said the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will hold rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50% during the June 17–18 meeting, the same range it’s been stuck in since the start of the year. The only reason? Inflation still hasn’t calmed down, and the labor market isn’t showing enough pain to force the Fed’s hand. The forecast comes at a time when economic stability is still on edge. Trade negotiations between the U.S. and China remain incomplete, and a July 9 deadline for a temporary 90-day tariff pause is fast approaching. That truce, first introduced in April, hasn’t led to much actual progress, and now economists are keeping their outlooks fragile. The White House, under President Donald Trump, has raised tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, and markets are starting to price in the cost of those decisions. On top of that, a massive new tax cut bill just passed by the House of Representatives is fueling more uncertainty, as it hasn’t yet passed through the Senate. Trump demands cuts as economists hold the line Despite pressure from Trump to lower rates by a full percentage point—he wants to see the fed funds rate drop to 3.25%–3.50%—the Fed is unmoved. The central bank is watching inflation expectations closely, and they’ve stayed high thanks to growing assumptions that the U.S. will keep erecting trade barriers. UBS Chief U.S. Economist Jonathan Pingle summed up the hesitation clearly: “As long as the labor market looks fine, we expect the FOMC to continue to stay on hold, and use rhetoric to bolster their inflation-fighting credibility. Until there is a cost, why signal otherwise?” Pingle also added, “At the moment ‘grey area’ seems more ‘charcoal’ … the Committee is facing a substantial amount of uncertainty.” Out of the 105 economists Reuters spoke to, 59 said they believe the Fed will begin cutting rates in the third quarter of 2025, most likely September, while 44 predicted the cuts won’t happen until Q4 or later. Another 20 said there would be no rate cuts at all this year. So while the majority still expect a move in a few months, a big chunk think it’ll be much longer. BNP Paribas Chief U.S. Economist James Egelhof believes the inflation problem isn’t going away. “High tariffs are here to stay, and they will produce elevated inflation that is sustained well into 2026,” he said. “The Fed will see little need to cut … the lesson we have from history is, if inflation becomes entrenched in the economy, it can be very hard and very costly to remove.” Debt concerns and spending bill drive uncertainty While inflation is a major concern, so is federal debt, which has now ballooned to $36.2 trillion. The new tax-and-spending package making its way through Congress is expected to pile on another $2.4 trillion, and the bond market is already reacting. The increased issuance of Treasuries is pushing up long-term interest rates, which directly affects lending costs for things like housing and business investment. Comerica Bank Chief Economist Bill Adams explained why the Fed won’t be rushing to help. “With more fiscal stimulus coming out of the tax and spending bill, the Fed sees less of a case for supporting the economy with lower interest rates,” Bill said. “The fiscal policy looks set to push the deficit (higher) … exerting continued upward pressure on long-term interest rates that will be a headwind for credit-intensive parts of the economy like the housing market and business capital spending.” The economy isn’t doing great either. U.S. GDP shrank by 0.2% last quarter, largely due to a growing trade deficit, and full-year growth is now expected to reach only 1.4%, down sharply from 2.8% in 2024. Next year’s forecast is just slightly better at 1.5%, and that projection hasn’t moved since May. Even as U.S. officials continue trade discussions in London with top Chinese representatives, there’s no strong indication of any deal materializing before the tariff pause expires. Meanwhile, both economists and everyday Americans are bracing for higher prices to stick around. Inflation expectations remain well above the Fed’s 2% target, and no one expects that to change until at least 2027. By the end of 2025, most economists—85 of them—think the fed funds rate will still be at 3.75% to 4.00% or even higher. Nobody has a clear view on exactly when that rate will finally drop. What’s obvious is that the Fed is in no mood to make a move unless something dramatic happens, and so far, nothing has.

While buying Bitcoin directly is one option, some prefer investing in Bitcoin mining stocks like MARA for several practical reasons, as explained by an analyst. Why Mining Stocks? Unlike holding Bitcoin, which requires managing private keys and digital wallets, mining stocks are traded like regular company shares on the stock market. This makes them easier for traditional investors to access. Plus, mining stocks come with fewer regulatory concerns compared to direct crypto investing and can even fit into retirement accounts. About Mara Holdings Founded in Florida in 2010, the company originally operated under the name Marathon Patent Group. It switched to Bitcoin mining in 2021 and later rebranded as Mara Holdings in 2024. Today, it’s one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, known for using renewable energy and advanced cooling systems to run its operations. As of early 2025, Mara’s mining power reached over 54 exahashes per second — meaning its machines can make over 54 quintillion guesses per second while mining Bitcoin. In simple terms, it’s one of the fastest and most powerful mining setups out there. A Unique Bitcoin Strategy In mid-2024, MARA announced a full “HODL” strategy, deciding not to sell any of its mined Bitcoin to cover expenses. Instead, it started aggressively buying more Bitcoin from the market. To support this plan, MARA launched several stock offerings, including a massive $2 billion stock sale in March 2025. Thanks to this strategy, Mara has built up a huge Bitcoin reserve. In the first three months of 2025 alone, it mined 2,286 BTC, increasing its total holdings to over 48,100 BTC — the second-highest stash among public companies after Michael Saylor’s firm. The Bigger Picture Mara’s decision to hold onto its Bitcoin rather than sell it could significantly increase the company’s value, especially as Bitcoin’s price rises. Many other mining firms are now following a similar strategy, showing growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

They went too far,” he said in a brief update. That line landed after nearly a week of public shots between the two men that started with Elon claiming Trump appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein files and ended with threats from the White House. The comments Elon referred to were two deleted posts from earlier that week. In the first, he claimed Trump was part of the sealed Epstein documents. In the second, he wrote that Trump wouldn’t have a shot at re-election if not for his support. Both posts were taken down, replaced with standard error pages on X that now read: “Hmm…this page doesn’t exist. Try searching for something else.” Elon didn’t say why he deleted the posts. But the consequences were instant. Trump responds with warning over Democrat support The fallout hit fast. On Thursday, Elon replied “yes” to a post that called for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance. That post was also deleted. As of Saturday, nothing remained from Elon’s week-long rant but the regret post. In a phone interview with NBC News, Donald Trump threatened Elon with consequences if he chooses to back Democrats in upcoming races. “If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that,” Trump told Kristen Welker. “He’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,” he added. He didn’t explain what those consequences would be. Trump also said he’s done with Elon. “I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened,” Trump said. “I gave him breaks in my first administration and saved his life in my first administration.” He added, “I have no intention of speaking to him.” When asked if the relationship was over, Trump said, “I would assume so.” He also accused Elon of being “disrespectful to the office of the president.” JD vance calls Musk ’emotional’ during podcast On Friday, JD Vance responded to Elon’s attacks during an interview on the This Past Weekend podcast with comedian Theo Von. “I think Elon’s making a huge mistake,” Vance said, attempting to cool tensions by describing Elon as “an emotional guy” who got frustrated. The tone was more forgiving, but the message was clear: Elon went too far. Less than two weeks earlier, Trump and Elon had publicly praised each other. Elon had just finished leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a Trump-created agency focused on cutting federal spending. Their partnership was strong enough to draw attention from investors tracking Elon’s businesses. Now, that alliance looks completely dead. According to CNBC, the fight escalated after Elon opposed Trump’s new legislative effort, widely known as the “big, beautiful bill.” Elon criticized the bill for ignoring policies he supported. The White House hit back through Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary. “This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,” she told CNN. The week of chaos triggered speculation about how the feud could affect Elon’s companies, especially Tesla and SpaceX, both of which benefitted from Trump’s first term. Elon’s role in the government helped shape federal policy around tech and budgeting. With that gone and public attacks stacking up, investors are watching closely.

Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $23.01 level by 2027 and above $45.41 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a corrective phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are losing value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained resistance around $8.66, negative sentiment took over the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.90, while the average price is expected to be around $9.08. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.8 and $7.5; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $47.22 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

45786760,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=744438,1749629190,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45786760.jpeg,US and China agreed to a limited trade framework,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-and-china-reach-limited-trade-deal/,"United States and China officials have agreed to a barebones trade framework meant to calm tensions and delay massive tariff hikes, following two days of closed-door talks that ended late Tuesday in London, according to Reuters. The deal will remove some restrictions on China’s rare earth exports and unwind a few recent U.S. export bans, but offers no actual resolution to the larger fight that’s been dragging both economies through hell. The meeting, which wrapped around midnight, was the first real movement since the failed Geneva agreement last month. That earlier deal got trashed after China refused to lift bans on critical minerals. In response, the Trump administration retaliated with new export controls, halting U.S. shipments of chip software, airplane equipment, and advanced chemicals. Rare earths back in play as export licenses resume U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that the new agreement puts “meat on the bones” of the Geneva talks. He said the framework clears a path for removing export restrictions “in a balanced way,” including on China’s rare earth magnets and minerals, but didn’t spell out what the U.S. will drop in return. “We have reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus and the call between the two presidents,” Howard said. “And if that is approved, we will then implement the framework.” China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang confirmed the same deal had been reached “in principle,” and said it would now go back to the leaders of both countries for review. So far, there’s no written agreement—just mutual paperwork to present to President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. Signs of a policy shift started to show almost immediately. Several Shenzhen-listed companies, including JL MAG Rare-Earth, Innuovo Technology, and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan, announced they had received fresh export licenses from Chinese authorities. Tariff hikes paused, but nothing is actually solved This deal doesn’t erase the deeper problem. The U.S. still sees China’s economic model as state-controlled and unfair. Trump’s team has never backed off its claim that Beijing manipulates trade using subsidies and closed-door rules. On the other hand, China continues to argue that Washington’s use of unilateral tariffs is illegal and reckless. No one gave up ground on that front. The so-called “framework” is just a stopgap to avoid more damage while they stall for time. That stall is short. August 10 is now the deadline for a bigger agreement. If nothing happens, tariff rates will explode again. The U.S. will jump from about 30% to 145%, and China will spike from 10% to 125%. It’s the same game of chicken all over again. The impact is already visible. China’s exports to the U.S. fell by 34.5% in May, the sharpest drop since COVID lockdowns. The numbers came straight from Chinese customs on Monday. Meanwhile, U.S. inflation hasn’t surged yet, but business confidence is falling and the dollar is getting weaker. Even the World Bank is waving a red flag. On Tuesday, it lowered its global growth outlook for 2025 by 0.4 percentage points, now expecting just 2.3%. It warned that higher tariffs and constant trade tension are dragging down nearly every major economy. Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, visited Beijing this week and said the current trade war could wreck more than just bilateral relations. “A resolution to the trade war may require policy adjustments from all countries to treat financial imbalances or otherwise greatly risk mutual economic damage,” she said. Other countries and industries are trying to put pressure on Trump to avoid another trade spike. The governments of Mexico, Japan, Canada, the European Union, and a long list of airlines and aerospace companies submitted formal complaints to the administration asking them not to add national security tariffs on commercial aircraft parts. No response yet from the White House. Still, Trump has no intention of backing off for now. Right after the framework deal was announced, a U.S. appeals court gave him the green light to keep one of his most aggressive tariffs—the 34% “reciprocal” duty—active while a lower court ruling that tried to kill it gets reviewed. That decision lets Trump hang on to one of his key trade weapons against China, even though it’s currently suspended. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Buying Bitcoin Cash with a credit card shouldn’t feel like solving a puzzle, here’s what actually works without the sky-high fees. Table of Contents Quick facts: Bitcoin Cash purchase options Why Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin? Real talk: Credit card vs. debit card for crypto Step-by-step: How to buy Bitcoin Cash The fee game: What users are really paying Payment methods that actually work Storage: Where to keep Bitcoin Cash Global access: Where this works Security without the paranoia Trading vs. holding What actually matters Bottom line Finding the best exchange to buy BCH with a credit card shouldn’t be this hard. Most platforms either charge crazy fees or make people jump through hoops just to buy Bitcoin Cash. After spending months testing different ways to purchase Bitcoin Cash, here’s what actually works. Quick facts: Bitcoin Cash purchase options Most people want to buy Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) fast without getting scammed on fees. Here are the only platforms worth considering if traders want to buy Bitcoin Cash instantly with a credit or debit card: Platform Fees Speed Card Types Why Use It ChicksX 0.5% Under 2 mins Visa, Mastercard Lowest fees anywhere Binance 2.8% + spread 5-10 mins Most cards High liquidity Coinbase 3.99% 1-3 mins All major Beginner friendly Kraken 3.75% + fees 10-15 mins Limited Good security CEX.io 3.5% + $2.99 5-30 mins Visa, Mastercard Multiple countries ChicksX wins by a mile with 0.5% fees. That’s less than what most companies charge for basic credit card processing. Everyone else is charging 3-4% which adds up fast when you’re trying to buy BCH regularly. Why Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin? Bitcoin Cash came from a hard fork in 2017 when Bitcoin got too slow and expensive. The current market price reflects what people actually want to use for payments. Key differences: Bitcoin Cash transactions cost pennies vs dollars for Bitcoin Faster confirmation times Better for actually spending money Current circulating supply around 19.6 million coins Total supply capped at 21 million like bitcoin The market cap shows Bitcoin Cash isn’t going anywhere. Companies that accept crypto for payments often prefer Bitcoin Cash because transactions don’t cost a fortune. Real talk: Credit card vs. debit card for crypto Banks often treats crypto purchases differently: Credit cards often: Charge cash advance fees Have higher interest rates Block crypto purchases randomly Offer better fraud protection Debit cards usually: Have lower fees Process faster Get blocked less often Take money directly from the bank account Using a debit card instantly often works better for buying Bitcoin Cash. Users need to just make sure their bank doesn’t block crypto transactions, some still do in 2025. Step-by-step: How to buy Bitcoin Cash The process varies between platforms, but here’s what works on most exchanges: Pick a platform – Compare fees first Sign up – Basic registration takes minutes Add payment method – Enter card details securely Verify account – Upload ID for larger purchases Buy Bitcoin Cash – Enter amount in USD, EUR, or other fiat currency Move to wallet – Don’t leave large amounts on exchanges Some platforms let users buy cryptocurrency without full verification for small amounts. This speeds things up but usually has lower limits. You might also like: Bitcoin Cash soars 30% to lead top coins amid market bounce The fee game: What users are really paying Here’s where most people get burned. Exchanges advertise low fees but hide costs in spreads and extra charges: Visible fees: What they show upfront (usually 1-4%) Hidden costs: Marked-up prices, conversion fees, withdrawal charges Card processing: Sometimes treated as cash advances Example: A trader wants to buy $1000 worth of Bitcoin Cash ChicksX: $5 in fees (0.5%) Coinbase: $39.90 + spread (4%+) Others: $30-50+ in total costs The math is simple: lower fees mean more Bitcoin Cash in the wallet. Payment methods that actually work Beyond credit or debit card purchases, these payment options can save money: Bank transfer: Cheapest but slower (1-3 days) PayPal: Available on limited platforms Apple Pay/Google Pay: Mobile convenience Wire transfer: For large purchases over $10,000 Most crypto veterans use bank transfers for big purchases and cards for quick buys. The convenience of instant purchases often justifies slightly higher card fees. Storage: Where to keep Bitcoin Cash After buying Bitcoin Cash, storage matters more than most realize: Exchange wallets: Easy but risky for large amounts Mobile wallets: Good for spending Bitcoin Cash daily Hardware wallets: Best security for long-term holding Desktop software: Balance of convenience and security Investors should start with small amounts on exchanges while learning. As their crypto assets grow, they can move them to wallets they control. Global access: Where this works Availability depends on where users live: North America: Most exchanges work, strict regulations Europe: Good options, can often use euros directly Asia: Varies by country, some restrictions Other regions: Growing but limited choices Some countries have better local options. Investors must research what works in their region before starting their crypto journey. You might also like: Bitcoin Cash price prediction: is it time for BCH to shine? Security without the paranoia Crypto security doesn’t have to be complicated: Account security: Use unique passwords Turn on two-factor authentication Verify website URLs before entering card details Transaction security: Start with small test purchases Double-check wallet addresses Keep records for taxes Most reputable exchanges have insurance and cold storage. The bigger risk is usually user error, not platform failure. Trading vs. holding Once users own Bitcoin Cash, they can decide what they’re doing with it: Hold long-term: Focus on secure storage and don’t stress about daily price movements. Active trading: Keep funds on exchanges, watch price charts, trade against other cryptocurrencies. Regular use: Keep some in mobile wallets for spending. Many people do a mix, it’s best to hold most Bitcoin Cash long-term but keep some available for trading or spending. What actually matters Fees kill returns : Paying 4% in fees means Bitcoin Cash needs to go up 4% just to break even. That’s why many users have switched to ChicksX, their 0.5% fee is unbeatable. Verification isn’t scary : Most platforms verify accounts in minutes, not days. Don’t overthink the current price : Trying to time markets is harder than it looks. Regular small purchases work better than waiting for the “perfect” moment. Start small and learn : Buy $50-100 worth first to understand the process before committing serious money. Every platform works differently. The Bitcoin Cash community focuses on real-world use cases, which sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies that are purely speculative. Companies actually accept it for payments, making it useful beyond just investment. Bottom line Most exchanges overcomplicate things and overcharge fees. It’s always best to find a platform with low costs, verify the account once, and start buying Bitcoin Cash regularly. The current market shows Bitcoin Cash has staying power. With major companies accepting it and low transaction costs, it serves the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash better than Bitcoin itself. But investors shouldn’t fall for platforms charging 4%+ fees when better options exist.

On Tuesday, Tate took to X (formerly Twitter) to flex a massive +138.5% return on an ETH long position using 25x leverage on Hyperliquid, a rising decentralized perpetuals exchange ( DEX ). His post included a Hyperliquid-branded trade screenshot and a referral link, an apparent attempt to capitalize on the buzz and drive affiliate signups. Andrew Tate’s now deleted tweet. Source: X But Tate may have underestimated the transparency of on-chain platforms. While centralized exchanges (CEXes) can obscure account identities, DEX trades are fully public, tied to wallet addresses. Crypto sleuths quickly traced the wallet behind his Hyperliquid trade, exposing a much less glamorous truth. According to data from portfolio tracker Hyperdash, the wallet currently shows a cumulative PnL of -$597,302.89, reflecting total losses across all past trades . In other words, Tate has burned through nearly $600K on Hyperliquid since he began trading there. Andrew Tate’s wallet. Source: HyperDash Tate is currently up 138% on ETH long In contrast, his flexed ETH long is a currently open position with $22,000 in unrealized profit, meaning this single trade is indeed up +138%, but the overall account is still deep in the red. The reaction was swift. Users shared screenshots of the findings across X and crypto forums. Within hours, Tate’s original post had mysteriously vanished. When pressed about the losses, Tate replied: “I’ll make it all back with one trade.” https://twitter.com/Cobratate/status/1932636022069674259 The episode highlights a key dynamic of modern DeFi: clout-chasing posts can backfire in a fully transparent ecosystem. On Hyperliquid and similar platforms, wallet histories are an open book, allowing the community to verify whether public wins match private records. Whether Tate can indeed trade his way back to green remains to be seen. For now, the blockchain remembers.

If positive sentiment holds, the market appears poised to retest its all-time high near $3.7 trillion and Bitcoin Pepe is seeing strong momentum as SOL ETFs may get approval soon. The increasing dominance of institutional and professional capital has subdued retail-driven FOMO, contributing to a more orderly and sustainable market trajectory—a dynamic more favourable for long-term investors. Bitcoin is currently trading above $109,000, although upward momentum is facing resistance near the $110,000 mark. Selling pressure is expected to intensify as prices approach the $112,000 level, which represents the previous all-time high set in late May. As Bitcoin pushes toward new highs, retail investors are increasingly gravitating toward speculative tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe , now entering the final stretch of its presale. Momentum-driven capital is rotating into early-stage projects as traders seek assets offering asymmetric upside potential. This renewed appetite for risk is being fueled by a broader crypto rebound, supported by institutional inflows and a more favourable macroeconomic backdrop. SOL ETF approval around the corner? The US Securities and Exchange Commission has asked issuers of proposed spot Solana ETFs to update their S-1 filings, a move that may signal progress toward potential approval, according to Blockworks, citing sources familiar with the matter. Following last year’s approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, issuers have submitted a wave of applications for altcoin-based funds, including those tied to Solana (SOL), XRP, and others. While analysts say the odds of approval are rising, the SEC has yet to greenlight any spot ETFs beyond BTC and ETH. Just last month, the regulator extended its review period for spot Solana ETF applications from Bitwise and 21Shares, continuing its cautious approach to altcoin-linked funds. Bitcoin Pepe to benefit from broader crypto adoption The approval of a spot Solana ETF would bring much-needed visibility to the broader altcoin and meme coin markets, helping shift perceptions of these assets from speculation to more credible components of the digital asset ecosystem. Such a move could lend legitimacy to technically ambitious projects like Bitcoin Pepe, which aim to bridge the gap between novelty and utility in the meme coin space. By seeking to “build Solana on Bitcoin” and combining Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability, Bitcoin Pepe stands out for offering more than just hype. The project has unveiled a slate of strategic partnerships to expand its Layer 2 ecosystem. These include Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. A collaboration with the GETE Network is also in the works, potentially bringing Bitcoin Pepe into the cross-chain Web3 gaming space. These developments are intended to strengthen the project’s technical infrastructure while introducing practical use cases for the token, setting it apart from meme tokens driven solely by speculation. Investor appetite appears strong. Bitcoin Pepe ’s ongoing presale has raised over $14 million, with BPEP tokens currently priced at $0.0416.

Regular people who saw the opportunity and acted early changed their financial lives forever. Now, a new project is capturing that same attention. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), currently in Phase 7 of its presale at $7, has already created a buzz by offering exactly what early Bitcoin once did: a chance to step in before the real acceleration begins. The entry window at $5 is officially behind us — but the opportunity hasn’t closed. Analysts predict the token could hit $100 by 2026, and with a hard cap of 21 million tokens and growing participation, many believe the launch price will be just the start of a much longer climb. $1,000 Could Mean $20,000 or More Let’s be clear: Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a speculative token built on hype. The current presale structure — now past $3.8 million in contributions from over 11,000 participants — is based on capped supply, real user incentives, and a model that rewards contribution, not just holding. At the current $7 token price, a $1,000 allocation secures roughly 142 BTC-S. With public listings expected at $20, that alone represents a projected 185% return — before any long-term appreciation. But the reason analysts are pointing to BTC-S as a millionaire-maker isn’t the jump from presale to launch. It’s the runway after. Ben Crypto, a widely followed market analyst, recently broke down his full BTC-S forecast in a YouTube video — watch it here . His projection? If adoption follows the same curve seen in early Bitcoin — where network use, supply mechanics, and demand created natural lift — BTC-S could climb to $100 or beyond in under two years. That means the current $1,000 investment could realistically turn into $20,000. And if token adoption expands further, the upside grows with it. Scarcity Is Already in Play BTC-S has a maximum supply of 21 million tokens — the same hard limit that gave Bitcoin its deflationary strength. But only 4.2 million of those are allocated to presale phases. There are no hidden reserve wallets, no future minting functions, and no emissions curve waiting to dilute value after launch. What exists is what will exist. That fixed model is what gives current investors real leverage. As the network grows and post-launch mining increases demand, those with early allocations stand to benefit not only from token price increases, but also from reduced mining difficulty and increased rewards. The Price Momentum Is Already Real When Bitcoin Solaris opened its early phases at $5, the response was immediate. More than 11,000 unique buyers have entered across presale stages. Social media volume spiked, independent YouTubers and analysts began publishing predictions, and investor groups started referencing BTC-S alongside legacy projects like Bitcoin and Solana. But what makes this momentum sustainable isn’t marketing. It’s structure. The presale isn’t based on vague promises — it’s built on verified mechanics and visible infrastructure. BTC-S smart contracts have passed a full Cyberscope audit , while its mining backend — which allows mobile mining — was independently validated by Freshcoins . The team behind the project has also completed KYC verification , eliminating the anonymity risk that plagues many new tokens. A Crowded Market Needs Clear Winners Investors are overwhelmed by options in 2025 — meme coins, overhyped L2s, “future utility” tokens. Most are chasing short-term attention, not long-term value. Bitcoin Solaris has managed to break through this noise by offering the fundamentals that early adopters care about: limited supply, real accessibility, and early-mover reward potential. And unlike tokens that lock users into staking contracts or require expensive equipment, BTC-S delivers utility from the start. Participants aren’t sidelined — they’re earning. No lockups. No waitlists. No guessing. Still Early — But Not For Long Phase 7 pricing sits at $7. Launch benchmarks are set at $20. And the next wave of user growth will likely come not from crypto insiders, but from mobile users globally who gain mining access for the first time. Once the presale allocation closes — and fewer tokens remain to meet future demand — pricing pressure will follow. And for those who waited too long? The chance to enter under $10 will be gone.

Considering the current BTC market sentiment and rising buying demand among investors, the CFX price will reach $0.47 in 2025. In 2031, CFX might record a maximum price of $4.15. Conflux Network (CFX) is a high-speed layer 1 blockchain that combines proof-of-work consensus with proof-of-stake finality. Originating from China, it follows local regulations, earning it the nickname “Chinese Ethereum.” The network’s native CFX token serves various purposes, such as a store of value and governance token. You can also stake these tokens to earn passive income in more CFX tokens.

They then issued a joint waiver, a dismissal that was filed with a US court. The retreat by the SEC marks a major victory for the crypto sector, and flings the doors open for unprecedented growth in June. With legal barriers quickly dissolving, investors are looking at the most lucrative crypto to build their wealth in June 2025. Here are the three most promising projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) crypto project is currently in phase 5 of its presale. It aims to transform DeFi and take it to the next level through unprecedented innovation. On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Once a user deposits their assets into the protocol, they start earning passive income. The amount they earn is based on a pool’s utilization rate. To determine the utilization rate, the protocol measures the amount of assets that are being actively borrowed against the total amount in the pool. Borrowers on the protocol can choose between stable and variable rates. When using a stable borrowing rate, the protocol sets it higher at the start to account for market volatility. A stable rate can be rebalanced if the variable rate becomes significantly higher than the stable rate. The mtToken Program One of the biggest innovations of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the mtToken program. When a user deposits assets in a pool, such as $890 worth of AVAX in a pool, they receive mtAVAX tokens in exchange. These mtTokens can be used like any other ERC20 token. For instance, users can transfer them to secondary exchanges to take advantage of other market opportunities. They can also be used as collateral on the Mutuum Finance protocol. Liquidity Mining On Mutuum Finance On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the liquidity mining program will be reserved for those who supply stable assets into the protocol. It will have the benefit of preserving the protocol’s stability and lowering borrowing costs for those seeking capital. One of the assets to be used for rewards is the MUTM tokens. The protocol will use it as compensation for providers of critical assets. This program will ensure that the protocol always has liquidity, even during high market volatility. To ensure efficient use of assets, the protocol will focus incentives on the most crucial assets. This will ensure that it does not dilute the token’s value. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase, where over $10.3 million has been raised so far. Over 11,900 participants have bought tokens in the presale, which is currently in phase 5, at the price of $0.03 per token. The current price is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will increase 16.67% to $0.035. If you participate in the ongoing presale with a minimum of $50, you are automatically added to the $100,000 giveaway . Ten lucky giveaway participants will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Binance Coin (BNB) The BNB coin has been a major beneficiary of the SEC withdrawal, which could potentially expand the opportunities for the coin. The recent court victory will help Binance roll out use cases that might have been put on hold. As such, it could lead to some gains. However, it is worth noting that Binance has been around for a long time. Consequently, most of the early gains have already been made on BNB. A realistic forecast for BNB would be a 2x increase at the most. Sui (SUI) SUI is the native coin of the SUI blockchain and has performed quite well since its launch. However, the project recently suffered a major setback when the Cetus Protocol, the leading DEX on SUI, suffered a major disruption. Despite this setback, SUI has held onto its value quite well. Another point to note is that SUI is still in the unlock phase, with new coins being unlocked on a regular basis. Such unlocks are historically known to trigger volatility that is often followed by a period of slow growth. Summary Based on current projections and recent events, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents the best opportunity for growth. Recently, it passed a CertiK audit, which has boosted trust and confidence, translating into the current fast pace of the presale. The Mutuum Finance team has also recently revealed that they will release a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. That event is expected to provide a major boost to the price of MUTM tokens. According to some forecasts, MUTM could gain as much as 2,679% in the days after the beta version launch. If you are looking for a crypto project that is built on the foundation of utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is your best option. The project is primed for takeoff and could offer its early adopters substantial gains a few days after it goes live.

The firm announced Wednesday it has partnered with layer-1 blockchain Flare FLR to deploy $100 million XRP to generate yield on its treasury holdings. The initiative marks the first large-scale use of Flare’s FAssets system, which enables non-smart contract tokens like XRP to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the press release said. VivoPower plans to generate yield through Flare-native protocols such as Firelight and reinvest the income to expand its XRP holdings. The company said it will also adopt payment firm Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin as its cash-equivalent reserve. ""It’s no longer enough to simply hold XRP; the duty to our shareholders is to make it productive,"" CEO and executive chairman Kevin Chin said in a statement. ""Adopting Ripple’s RLUSD is a cornerstone of this strategy, providing the stability and compliance this next-generation treasury demands."" For Flare, the deal is a milestone of institutional validation, Flare co-founder Hugo Philion pointed out. ""Our FAssets system [...] is more than just a bridge; it’s a gateway that allows institutions to bring assets like XRP into programmable DeFi environments to generate yield, all while retaining their fundamental security,"" he said. VivoPower is part of the growing roster of public firms raising money to purchase and add digital assets to their treasuries, a playbook popularized by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) that has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC. The firm's latest move comes shortly after tapping BitGo's over-the-counter trading desk for acquiring an initial $100 million trench of XRP tokens. VivoPower last month said that it entered into an agreement for a $121 million private share placement, with the fundraising led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, chairman of Eleventh Holding Company, according to a SEC filing .",Finance|XRP|Flare Network|Ripple|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-11 09:30:00

The bill, submitted on June 10, was put forward by a group of Members of Parliament led by Yaroslav Zheleznyak from the Holos party. It proposes amendments to the law “On the National Bank of Ukraine,” specifically to permit the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to hold virtual assets alongside gold and foreign currencies. Ukraine’s Central Bank May Soon Hold Crypto — If It Chooses To The draft law, registered as bill No. 13356 , does not require the central bank to invest in crypto. Instead, it gives the NBU the option to do so at its own discretion. Decisions about whether to allocate reserves into digital assets, such as when, how, or how much, would remain entirely with the bank. “Under this draft law, we authorize the National Bank of Ukraine to include virtual assets in the country’s reserves,” Zheleznyak said. “However, decisions regarding the timing, method, and volume of such inclusion are left entirely to the discretion of the central bank.” JUST IN: Ukraine officially introduces bill to establish a Strategic BTC Reserve. pic.twitter.com/VlxcXnwz9N — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) June 11, 2025 The proposal marks a notable shift in Ukraine’s stance toward integrating digital assets into its financial framework. Although the bill does not mandate the use of crypto in reserves, it creates a legal foundation for the NBU to act if it chooses to in the future. “If [the National Bank] doesn’t want to invest in crypto, it doesn’t have to,” Zheleznyak clarified. The draft bill reflects broader interest among Ukrainian lawmakers in aligning the country with global trends in financial innovation. Zheleznyak said a state-backed crypto reserve could support macroeconomic stability and help drive the growth of Ukraine’s digital economy. “Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,” he wrote on Telegram. In a video discussion with Binance’s regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, Kirill Khomyakov, Zheleznyak highlighted growing international interest in crypto as a reserve asset. He pointed to countries like the United States, El Salvador, Switzerland, and Brazil as examples of jurisdictions moving toward strategic digital asset holdings. The bill has been submitted to Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, and is now awaiting further consideration. If passed, it would position Ukraine among a small but growing group of nations exploring crypto’s role in sovereign monetary policy. Ukraine Finalizing Crypto Legalization Bill Amid Plans for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Ukraine is preparing to take another major step toward integrating crypto into its national financial framework. Following the central bank’s move to potentially hold Bitcoin in its reserves, lawmakers are now pushing to legalize cryptocurrency use nationwide by mid-2025. The draft legislation, expected to be submitted after the New Year, has been developed with input from the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund. Ukraine plans to legalize crypto by Q1 2025, with profits taxed similarly to securities with IMF and European expert guidance. #ukraine #crypto https://t.co/0hJPWs511R — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 12, 2024 It proposes a regulatory and tax framework that treats crypto assets similarly to securities, profits would be taxed only upon conversion to fiat, with no exemptions granted for digital asset transactions. Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, said the bill is nearly ready for its first reading . While some regulatory details, such as financial monitoring mechanisms, are still under discussion, Hetmantsev stated that the core of the bill is complete and on track for approval in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s ambitions extend beyond regulation. Lawmakers are also drafting legislation that would enable the country to establish a strategic national Bitcoin reserve . Yaroslav Zhelezniak, deputy head of the finance committee, confirmed the bill is in its final stages and will soon be introduced. If passed, Ukraine would become the first European country to officially hold Bitcoin as a state asset, a move that could position the nation as a leader in institutional crypto adoption.

Tensions had escalated when both sides accused each other of not fulfilling commitments related to rare earth exports and export controls. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent led the American delegation. Lutnick hinted that rare earth-related disputes are close to resolution, with the US willing to lift certain restrictions “in a balanced way,” depending on China's compliance. President Trump is expected to review the proposal soon. The Chinese side, represented by Vice-Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Vice-Minister Li Chenggang, described the talks as “rational and candid.” They emphasized rebuilding trust and reaffirmed commitments made in previous meetings, including a 90-day tariff reduction window. Market reaction was cautiously optimistic: China’s CSI 300 rose by 0.8% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1%, while S&P 500 futures dipped slightly. The talks were hosted at London’s Lancaster House, with both delegations aiming to avoid a return to the damaging tit-for-tat tariffs that had significantly reduced trade volume since the pandemic.

June is showing a potential change in sentiment, with negative net flow through June 7th. With Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust being a notable exception, most US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have negative BTC-denominated AUM growth year to date. BTC remains a cost-effective way to get exposure to an anti-fiat debasement trade in 2025. Through the first week of June, Digital Asset investment net flows came in at $224 million. While this was the seventh consecutive week of positive net flow in the asset class, the week ended June 7th saw the weakest inflow story in nearly two months. Furthermore, if you take out iShares ETF products, year to date net flow into Digital Assets is actually negative. In this article, covering the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ), we'll look at capital flow trends in the Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) ETF products, issuer flows, as well as broader considerations for investors interested in Bitcoin. Capital Flow Winners and Losers There is no doubt at this point that Bitcoin has been the primary beneficiary of investment capital in the Digital Asset space since the approval of spot ETFs in early-2024. That outperformance continued through the first 5 months of 2025 with Bitcoin accounting for roughly 90% of year to date net flow and 86% of the Digital Asset financial product AUM: Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin -$57 $10,143 $151,223 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) $296 $1,701 $14,092 Multi-asset -$5.9 -$142 $6,763 Solana ( SOL-USD ) -$1.1 $79 $1,403 XRP ( XRP-USD ) -$4.0 $194 $1,216 Total $225 $11,342 $175,869 Source: CoinShares, as of June, 7th 2025 However, June is showing a potential change in sentiment, with many of the high-fliers from the last 12–18 months showing negative net flow through June 7th. This is happening while Ethereum - a hugely disappointing laggard post-ETF approvals - masked what would have been a week of negative net outflow were it not for inflow of just under $300 million through the first seven days of the month. Admittedly, this is just one week of data in a longer-term story. But it's interesting to me, nonetheless. The provider details are also quite telling because one product issuer is essentially the entire market so far this year and in June as well: Provider (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM iShares $330 $12,732 $72,844 Grayscale -$16 -$1,741 $29,339 Fidelity -$168 -$274 $20,511 ARK 21 Shrs -$25 -$47 $4,789 Bitwise -$13 -$273 $4,219 Total $225 $11,342 $175,869 Source: CoinShares, as of June, 7th 2025 Were it not for the $330 million month to date net flows into iShares products, investment in Digital Asset ETFs would have been negative through the first week of June. Unlike the asset breakout, this is not a new trend. The year to date story is quite similar with $12.7 billion in positive net flows year to date while most of the other major asset managers have actually seen outflow. This is indeed the case for Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise. This would seemingly indicate that it is the asset class itself, rather than a simple 'fee flight' migration from Grayscale products. ETF BTC Balances 12/31/2024 7/9/2025 Change YoY iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) 552,168 662,707 110,539 20.0% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ( FBTC ) 202,800 196,264 -6,536 -3.2% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ( ARKB ) 46,729 45,616 -1,113 -2.4% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) 40,196 37,783 -2,413 -6.0% BTC 38,342 43,436 5,094 13.3% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) 206,835 185,234 -21,601 -10.4% Total Spot ETFs 1,286,857 1,365,429 78,572 6.1% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The clear outlier in this table is IBIT with the 20% year to date change in BTC holdings. Grayscale's Mini Trust, which is up 13.3% in BTC-denominated holdings, has jumped BITB as a 'top-5' fund this year by AUM but has failed to make up for the 21.6k Bitcoins that have come out of Grayscale's flagship Bitcoin product. If it was just a 'fee flight' story, I would think Grayscale's Mini Trust would be a bigger beneficiary of asset flow than IBIT: Fund Comparison Inception Expense Ratio AUM IBIT 01/05/2024 0.25% $71.85 ARKB 01/10/2024 0.21% $4.97 FBTC 01/10/2024 0.25% $20.49 BITB 01/10/2024 0.20% $4.10 GBTC 09/25/2013 1.50% $20.13 BTC 07/31/2024 0.15% $4.73 Source: Seeking Alpha, June 10th 2025, AUM in billions While still far more competitive than the 1.5% expense ratio seen through GBTC, IBIT is more expensive than Grayscale's Mini Trust and two additional offerings with top 5 AUM. Grayscale's Mini Trust is the most cost-effective, with just a .15% expense ratio. Data by YCharts If we look at the total return of both IBIT and BTC since the inception of the latter at the end of July 2024, we do indeed see BTC gets a very slight edge in total return. For a 'set it and forget it' type of investor, BTC will ultimately outperform IBIT since it's 10 bps cheaper annually. That said, this is not necessarily a meaningful boost in return for an asset that has appreciated in value by over 66% in the last 11 months. For those who want liquidity, IBIT is the clear winner. But for longer-term Bitcoin bulls, BTC will work perfectly fine. Cycle Top and Global Liquidity In previous articles for Seeking Alpha covering Bitcoin and cyclical sell indicators, we've looked at metrics like MVRV and Pi Cycle Top. From where I sit, the fundamental argument for Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment network isn't all that compelling, given the lackluster growth in usage and scaling. However, the belief by many that Bitcoin is 'Digital Gold' continues to carry the asset as an 'anti-fiat currency' instrument. As I see it, that view is still a winning one until price returns stop moving with global M2: BTC vs M2 (BGeometrics) I still like this chart quite a bit, and it shows Bitcoin price appreciation could realistically be looked at as a liquidity sponge when global M2 starts to surge on a year-over-year basis. Isolating down to the last 12 months shows Bitcoin's price moving with a lag when global M2 growth hits 7% year over year: BTC vs M2, 1 yr (BGeometrics) Our first example shows M2 growth at 7% in late September 2024. This preceded a 67% rip higher in BTC from $63k to $105k in December. We again saw 7% YoY growth in global M2 at the end of April. Bitcoin's return since then is slightly above 11%. Notably, M2 growth does not appear to be slowing down just yet, with the YoY change again hitting 7.5% as of June 2nd. Should history repeat, we could reasonably expect a Bitcoin price closer to $158k later this summer. Risks The old adage fits here; past performance is not a forecast of future returns. Just because money printing by global governments/central banks has produced higher Bitcoin prices so far, it doesn't necessarily mean that dynamic will continue. Bitcoin was initially intended to be a monetary asset for the people to use on-chain and with each other. 'HODLing' via ETFs isn't exactly what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. Furthermore, Bitcoin remains a new asset relative to historical fiat currency substitutes: Bitcoin/Gold Ratio ( Longtermtrends ) Measured against Gold, Bitcoin hasn't gone anywhere since November 2021. I will reiterate what I've said since I first started covering Bitcoin for Seeking Alpha several years ago; those seeking refuge from fiat currency debasement don't need to pick between the two when they can just buy both Bitcoin and Gold. Closing Summary I remain long Bitcoin both directly and through the ETF wrapper. While I personally like FBTC for my long-term position, I think Grayscale's Mini Trust is a perfectly fine way to allocate to Bitcoin in a traditional investment account. BTC is the most cost-effective way to buy that exposure, and I believe the fact that BTC is the only major spot ETF that has seen positive year to date inflows is a testament to that cost-effectiveness.",BTC-USD|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-11 09:35:18

According to Bloomberg, the European Union sees the most likely outcome as reaching just a basic agreement on general principles by the deadline — not a finished deal. That would leave a lot of important details still unresolved, and the White House hasn’t even responded yet to the EU’s latest proposal. Talks have turned urgent because Washington plans to hit almost all EU exports with a 50% tariff if there’s no agreement by the deadline. That covers around €380 billion, or about $434 billion, in trade — roughly 70% of European exports to the US. Trump’s move is designed to increase pressure. But on the EU side, officials are already getting ready for retaliation if the deal falls through. Sefcovic pushes negotiations while prepping EU countermeasures Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s trade chief, has been in constant contact with Howard Lutnick, the US Commerce Secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the US Trade Representative. They’ve been speaking regularly on the phone and even held an in-person meeting recently to speed things up. These conversations started after both sides agreed two weeks ago to fast-track the process. Despite this, there’s been no official reply yet from the US on the EU’s latest suggestions, and time is almost up. The European Commission gave an update to member states earlier this week. Right now, both sides are locked in detailed talks on specific sectors including steel, aluminum, civilian aircraft, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. They’re also talking about problems with tariff and non-tariff barriers. But officials involved say it’s still tough. The EU thinks the US is pushing for terms that mostly benefit Washington and don’t offer much back. Because of that, Brussels is getting its backup plans ready. Officials are reviewing potential countermeasures in case talks collapse completely. These would include more than just tariffs. The commission is asking member countries to help find strategic areas where the US depends on the EU — areas that could be used to apply pressure. The EU is trying to make it clear that if Trump triggers a tariff war, they’ll respond immediately. The bloc already approved tariffs on €21 billion worth of American goods, mostly targeting politically sensitive states. That includes soybeans from Louisiana, where House Speaker Mike Johnson is based. It also covers US poultry, motorcycles, and other agricultural products. A second round is also ready — it would slap tariffs on €95 billion worth of US exports, including Boeing aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. That second list is directly tied to Trump’s new “reciprocal” tariffs and auto duties. Lagarde warns against more economic damage as EU draws red lines The EU is still trying to address some of Washington’s complaints, especially about non-tariff barriers. Officials say they’re simplifying rules internally, but they won’t agree to anything that touches the bloc’s autonomy over tax or regulation. Those areas are “red lines,” and the commission won’t cross them under any pressure, even with the July 9 threat looming. While the EU keeps trying to talk, they’re also preparing for failure. Separate from these talks, the bloc is having bilateral discussions with the US on critical minerals. That issue may also show up at the Group of Seven summit in Canada later this month, though it’s not clear if anything concrete will come out of it. On Wednesday, Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said the world is heading toward bigger economic problems if countries keep using trade as a weapon. Speaking in Beijing, Lagarde said: “We have witnessed a sharp rise in the use of industrial policies aimed at boosting domestic capacity. Since 2014, subsidy-related interventions that distort global trade have more than tripled globally.” Lagarde added that China isn’t alone — governments in emerging markets and advanced economies are all doing the same thing. She pointed out that America’s share of global demand has jumped in recent years, driven partly by high public sector spending. “Coercive trade policies fail to resolve financial imbalances,” she said. “They just bring economic damage.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Source: Hypurrscan.io Bitcoin bulls target $150,000 after breaking key resistance The whale’s aggressive positioning comes as Bitcoin surged past the $110,000 mark, with analysts suggesting the next potential target could be $150,000 if technical indicators continue to align. Prominent crypto analyst TradingShot observed that Bitcoin’s current rally has invalidated several short-term bearish patterns and broken through a critical resistance zone. The analyst noted that Bitcoin recently rebounded at the lower high trendline of a three-year ascending channel, with this price structure appearing thrice in Bitcoin’s ongoing ‘channel up’ formation. Each instance triggered at least a 101% gain. From the April 7 bottom, a 101% rally would put Bitcoin at the $150,000 mark, a clean technical target supported by historical precedent, strong channel support, and renewed breakout momentum . Analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicted that the current phase is likely a short consolidation period before increased upward momentum. Van de Poppe suggests the ideal buying range sits around $107,000 to $108,000 as BTC prepares for what could be another historic run. If Bitcoin’s relative strength index ( RSI ) retests 75 by the end of the month, analyst PlanB suggests the June closing price for BTC would be around $130,000. Meanwhile, investment firm Bernstein maintains a $200,000 price target, calling it a “high-conviction but conservative” forecast. Institutional demand remains strong, with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) (NASDAQ: MSTR ) buying over 1000 BTC this week, worth approximately $110.2 million in total. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage over $120 billion in assets, highlighting BTC’s transition into a mainstream asset class.

However, Binance has since clarified the situation. A spokesperson for the exchange told crypto.news that the latest reports are false, asserting that there have been no service suspensions on the platform. “XRP withdrawals are operating normally without any disruptions,” said the Binance spokesperson. Reports of this nature often cause panic among users and the community.

However, as blockchain technology continues to evolve, a rising star in the form of Ruvi AI is catching the attention of sharp investors. With its blend of artificial intelligence, utility-driven goals, and strong presale performance, Ruvi AI may very well position itself alongside heavyweights like Cardano in the crypto space. What Sets Cardano Apart? Cardano’s methodical development strategy has attracted a loyal following. Its research-driven roadmap and focus on scalability, sustainability, and security have made it a top contender in the blockchain industry. Cardano also boasts a robust community that contributes to its long-term growth. However, one area where Cardano may struggle to maintain its lead is its ability to innovate quickly amid fierce competition. This is where newer platforms like Ruvi AI are finding opportunities to shine. By blending cutting-edge technology with real-world applications, Ruvi AI is making a formidable case as the next crypto project to watch. Ruvi AI’s Presale Signals Game-Changing Potential Ruvi AI is not just riding a wave of speculative interest; its ongoing presale has demonstrated its ability to build trust and momentum in the market. The presale has raised a remarkable $1.5 million so far, with nearly 135 million tokens sold. Investors can secure Ruvi AI tokens at a Phase 2 price of $0.015 per token, making it an accessible opportunity for early adopters. What adds to Ruvi AI’s credibility is its structured valuation plan. The $0.07 valuation after the presale is a pre-designed feature, addressing concerns about speculative pricing. Analysts predict that Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token post-listing, further reinforcing its growth potential. Such transparency and structure are invaluable in a crowded and sometimes speculative market. Leveraging Real-World Applications for Sustainability Unlike Cardano and many other blockchain projects that focus heavily on platform development, Ruvi AI stands out with its commitment to real-world applications. By integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, Ruvi AI delivers solutions across several industries: Healthcare: Utilizing AI for early diagnostics and patient data management, improving efficiency and outcomes in medical operations. Logistics: Streamlining supply chain processes to reduce costs, enhance delivery speed, and increase real-time tracking transparency. Finance: Deploying advanced fraud-detection systems to secure transactions and ensure regulatory compliance. These industry-specific use cases give Ruvi AI scalability and ensure sustained market demand, making it a utility-based token that solves real challenges. Partnership With WEEX Exchange Boosts Accessibility Ruvi AI’s recent partnership with WEEX Exchange is another milestone that elevates its profile among both retail and institutional investors. This collaboration enhances Ruvi AI’s accessibility, enabling global participation and improving liquidity. Not only does this partnership solidify Ruvi AI’s credibility, but it also positions the token for easier adoption across the crypto ecosystem.

Whale activity intensifies with over $40M in leveraged long positions on $HYPE. Protocol revenues surpass $850M annually, with significant buybacks boosting the HYPE coin price. Daily trading volume for HYPE/USDT exceeds $500M, backed by rising TVL and app fees. Technical indicators remain bullish, but overbought signals suggest caution near resistance levels. HYPE Coin Rally Enters Discovery Mode Hyperliquid token (HYPE) has broken above $42 for the fourth time in 2025, entering price discovery once again. The latest breakout reflects consistent investor interest, aggressive whale positioning, and a broader DeFi resurgence. With strong market cap growth and user engagement, Hyperliquid crypto is establishing itself as one of the most active Layer-1 DeFi platforms. The HYPE chart confirms that this uptrend has been driven not only by market speculation but also by robust on-chain activity. The current Hype Coin price surge comes with clear support from both retail and institutional players, as evidenced by sustained volume and open interest growth. HYPE/USDT Technical Analysis: Momentum Builds, But Overbought Caution Remains On the HYPE/USDT daily chart, the price has surged over 350% since bottoming near $9.29 in early April, forming a steep parabolic curve. This aggressive rally indicates strong market conviction, but also introduces the risk of abrupt reversals if momentum weakens. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 73.51, placing $HYPE in the overbought zone. While this confirms bullish dominance, it also suggests the token may be nearing short-term exhaustion. The MACD shows a positive crossover above the zero line, reinforcing bullish sentiment. However, the flattening histogram indicates that momentum is beginning to level off. The BBTrend momentum indicator remains elevated, signaling continued trend strength. Still, prolonged high readings often precede volatility spikes or retracements, especially in assets with recent parabolic moves. In short, while the hype coin price action remains bullish and well-supported above $38, traders should be cautious. A breakout above $44.50 would confirm trend continuation toward $50. But if price dips below $38, a deeper pullback toward $34–$36 is likely as the parabolic structure gets tested. Whale Activity & Hyperliquid Token On-Chain Strength Significant whale activity continues to back the HYPE price (According to LookonChain): Two wallets deposited $19.43M USDC and opened 5x long positions on HYPE — a sign of high-conviction bullish positioning. Another whale posted $11.8M in SOL as collateral to borrow $4M USDC, buying and staking 126,353 HYPE at $39.1. A separate $9.97M USDC buy netted 259,367 HYPE tokens — illustrating deep-pocketed confidence. These on-chain moves show that capital is flowing into Hyperliquid crypto not as a short-term bet but as a strategic position. Rising open interest on HYPE futures, which now totals $1.89B, supports this bullish interpretation. TVL (DeFiLlama) : $1.73B — Reflects growing trust and liquidity within the Hyperliquid Layer-1 ecosystem. Daily Fees (Artemis) : $2.99M — Surpassing Ethereum and Solana, this indicates extremely high protocol usage and user activity. Open Interest (Coinglass) : $1.89B — All-time high for $HYPE futures, suggesting strong speculative interest and positioning. Annual Fees : $851M — With 97% of revenue used for token buybacks, supporting long-term price stability and appreciation. FDV : $42.05B — Demonstrates $HYPE’s valuation scale, positioning it among the most valuable DeFi assets. What this implies : These metrics validate that Hyperliquid crypto is not just experiencing a price rally, it is establishing itself as a dominant DeFi infrastructure layer with robust user engagement, strong on-chain demand, and clear institutional interest. HYPE Coin Price Prediction The HYPE chart reflects strength, but traders should be alert to changes in whale behavior. As long as the hyperliquid price holds above $38, momentum remains with the bulls. A breakout beyond $44.5 would likely trigger the next leg toward $50. However, if profit-taking accelerates or market sentiment shifts, $HYPE could correct down to $26.89 — a key support area. In either case, traders should manage entries carefully.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-11 09:46:36

Officials of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have been getting increasingly louder about having the country maintain pace with the rapid developments around digital currencies, which may accelerate a shift to cashless payments. Japan is getting serious about digital currency Japan has always favored physical currency, but things are changing. The country witnessed the ratio of cashless payments rise to 42.8% in 2024, hitting the government’s 40% goal a year earlier than targeted, according to government data. Japan is not one of the first names that come to mind in terms of payment technology, but in recent times, there has been an increase in cashless transactions and it is forcing policymakers to ensure they are ready to adapt to shifting public preference on payment and settlement means. This includes exploring the option of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) but while no decision has been made on whether to issue a digital yen, the BOJ kickstarted a pilot program for developing a CBDC in 2023, and has been consulting with private firms and the government on its framework and design. “Although banknote issuance remains high in Japan, usage of notes could fall significantly in the future amid rapid digitalisation,” BOJ Executive Director Kazushige Kamiyama said in a meeting last week with private firms on the pilot program. “As such, Japan must consider what steps it can take now to ensure its retail settlement system is convenient, efficient, accessible universally, while being safe and resilient.” Cash will remain king in Japan for now BOJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida believes a CBDC may become “a critical piece of infrastructure” shaping the future of Japan’s payment and settlement systems. However, he does not expect demand for cash to disappear in Japan any time soon. In his Saturday speech, Uchida painted the picture of a hypothetical world in which the yen becomes second to another payment instrument — such as crypto assets — as the main form of payment in Japan. However, Uchida also stated that for such a world to come into being, the public’s belief in the BOJ’s ability to keep the value of the yen stable has to be shaken, which could happen if the central bank fails to fullfil its mission of keeping the price stable. “Looking to the future, in a society that has made significant advances in digitalization, there is no guarantee that currency issued by the central bank of a sovereign nation will continue to function as a generally acceptable payment instrument,” he said . Talk of CBDCs in Japan coincides with a time when the topic returns to the spotlight in the US as President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, seemingly in a drive to promote cryptocurrencies and stablecoins instead. Japan, like many other countries, has gotten serious about a CBDC due to the recent developments and the growing global suspicion that the US dollar’s dominance is ending. In response to Trump’s push to promote stablecoins, the European Central Bank has revealed a need to issue a digital euro and develop an electronic means of payment that does not rely on dominant US providers such as Visa.

According to a June 11 announcement on Ripple’s blog, qualified purchasers can now mint and redeem OUSG tokens around the clock using the RLUSD stablecoin as the settlement asset. OUSG, short for Ondo ( ONDO ) Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries, provides exposure to low-risk, short-duration Treasury bills via tokenized money market funds. With more than $670 million in total value locked across chains and $30 million already on XRP ( XRP ) Ledger, it’s one of the largest tokenized Treasury products in the market. Institutional users looking for on-chain finance liquidity, speed, and compliance can now access OUSG on XRPL. Unlike conventional financial rails, which are limited by slow settlement cycles and banking hours, XRPL enables the real-time issuance and redemption of OUSG using RLUSD. This feature is attractive to institutions that operate across jurisdictions, as it improves capital efficiency, decreases idle cash buffers, and facilitates quicker cash flow management. You might also like: Ondo introduces 24/7 conversions between PayPal USD and OUSG Ripple and Ondo have committed liquidity to jumpstart activity, helping RLUSD serve as a stable bridge for real-world asset settlements on XRPL. Markus Infanger, the senior vice president of RippleX, stated that the launch represents a move in tokenized finance from theory to practice. “Ondo’s OUSG going live on the XRPL demonstrates that tokenized finance is no longer theoretical, it’s maturing in real markets. Institutions can now access high-quality assets like U.S. treasuries on public blockchains, with the compliance and efficiency they need.” — Markus Infanger, SVP of RippleX XRPL is a suitable platform for asset-backed tokens because of its native support for tokenization, decentralized exchange features, and identity standards. Future network features like multipurpose tokens, a lending protocol, and permissioned domains show a growing institutional focus. OUSG’s rollout on XRPL comes after its launch on Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ), putting the product in a position to reach even more institutional users. The market is developing quickly, with over $7 billion in tokenized Treasuries TVL worldwide. As a result of its tokenization efforts, Ondo Finance was featured in World Economic Forum’s May 21 report , demonstrating its role in promoting adoption.

Key Takeaways: Dogecoin jumped over 6% after Elon Musk publicly apologized for his feud with President Trump. The six-day online clash between Musk and Trump included personal attacks and political fallout. DOGE’s rally was backed by a 24% surge in trading volume, reflecting renewed retail interest. The billionaire entrepreneur, who had spent the past week escalating a bitter online feud with Trump, took to X to issue a rare mea culpa, admitting his comments “went too far.” “I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote early Wednesday morning on the platform he owns. Six Days of Heated Exchange Between Musk and Trump The reversal follows six days of heated exchanges sparked by Musk’s attack on Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which he had described as “a disgusting abomination.” The spending package, which passed with support from both parties, had drawn sharp criticism from Musk, who called on citizens to pressure lawmakers to “KILL the BILL.” Trump responded by calling Musk’s actions “disappointing” and questioned his loyalty, setting off a volley of increasingly personal attacks between the two, including references to SpaceX contracts and explosive allegations involving the late Jeffrey Epstein. Musk even shared an old video of Trump and Epstein together, fanning the flames. Did Trump censor Elon Musk? And where are the Epstein files? https://t.co/jePD2ZV8UJ — Anonymous (@YourAnonCentral) June 11, 2025 The back-and-forth escalated across their respective platforms, X and Truth Social, culminating in threats from Trump to revoke Musk’s government contracts and a retaliatory post from Musk suggesting he would decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft. The feud drew widespread attention, with former Trump strategist Steve Bannon calling for Musk to be deported and late-night television turning the incident into fodder. However, the Musk-Trump rift has since been overshadowed by mass protests in Los Angeles over Trump’s immigration policies and his deployment of the National Guard. While the political feud dominated headlines, DOGE quietly rallied. The memecoin, often seen as a proxy for Musk’s public sentiment, climbed over 6.60% in the past 24 hours, with its market cap rising to $30.37 billion, according to CoinMarketCap . Volume also saw a 24% increase, reaching $1.61 billion, signaling renewed retail activity. Dogecoin Approaches Overbought Conditions Dogecoin is trading at $0.2036 with modest intraday gains, supported by increasing volume and technical indicators pointing to bullish momentum. On the 2-hour chart, the RSI is hovering near 70, signaling approaching overbought conditions, while the MACD shows a bullish crossover above the zero line, indicating upward momentum remains intact. The Bollinger Bands are widening, suggesting rising volatility, and the price is testing the upper band near $0.204. On the 30-minute chart, DOGE pushed above the midline of its Bollinger Bands, while the RSI climbed above 74—confirming short-term buying pressure. However, overbought signals on both hourly and lower timeframes hint at a possible pullback or consolidation ahead. On the 1-minute chart, DOGE appears to be stabilizing, with RSI near 58 and MACD flattening. Immediate support lies at $0.1983, while resistance is at $0.205. A clean breakout above $0.205 could open the door for a test of $0.22.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $10.25 million, attracted more than 11,850 holders, and later will be preparing for Phase 6 of its presale, where the price will rise to $0.035.

Cardano (ADA) Delivered Value, But It Took Time Cardano (ADA)’s (ADA) bullish run wasn’t built overnight. It was the result of years of research, peer-reviewed whitepapers, and gradual ecosystem growth. ADA climbed from undervalued lows to deliver a strong 4x return for investors who stayed the course. However, the process was slow. ADA’s utility took years to materialize, and many of its features arrived long after its price peak. Investors had to wait for smart contracts, dApps, and staking infrastructure to roll out. Today’s investor environment rewards speed, transparency, and actual user rewards. That’s exactly why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting more attention from both DeFi enthusiasts and new investors looking to multiply their capital before the broader market catches on. Why MUTM’s Foundations Are Stronger from Day One Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a concept in development—it is an actively rolling presale project with a working strategy, functioning interface, and a clear utility in decentralized finance. With a total token supply of 4 billion and a current presale price of $0.03, MUTM has projected to offer both utility and affordability, allowing investors to position early with strong upside ahead. The token will power a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow major cryptocurrencies like ETH, BTC, BNB, SOL, AVAX, and DAI. The platform will support both P2C (pool-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) lending structures—something very few platforms offer at once. This means borrowers can access liquidity without selling their assets, and lenders earn passive income through dynamically adjusted interest rates based on real-time pool usage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) issues mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens given to lenders when they deposit assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools. These mtTokens automatically accrue value over time, reflecting the interest earned through real-time borrowing activity. This creates a fully on-chain, non-custodial yield generation mechanism—something that Cardano (ADA) did not offer natively during its early rise. Unlike ADA’s staking model, which relied on network validation, Mutuum’s mtTokens generate yield from actual lending demand and capital utilization, offering a more DeFi-native, utility-driven return model. A 20x Roadmap Is Already in Motion The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) roadmap is clear and already underway. In its earliest phases, the project has successfully launched its presale, secured a CertiK audit with a strong score of 80.00, launched an AI-powered helpdesk, achieved branding milestones, and earned listing across major token tracking platforms. As the presale progresses, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch the beta version of its lending platform. This release is timed to go live alongside the full token launch, giving early investors immediate access to core platform features—not vague future promises. Users will be able to test the lending and borrowing modules, interact with smart contracts, and begin generating income directly on the protocol. Future phases of the roadmap include multi-chain integration, stablecoin deployment, and an institutional-grade lending suite—all engineered to ensure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) scales into a global DeFi platform. Later stages will also introduce a bug bounty system, and large-scale marketing campaigns to further expand user adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) started its presale at just $0.01 in Phase 1. It is now in Phase 5, with the price having already increased to $0.03. At this pace, the post launch will take the token to $0.20, marking a 20x increase from the earliest round. Even at the current price, there is still a strong upside to capture. A confident investor who entered at $0.02 with a $2,000 allocation would already see their portfolio value grow to $3,000 by Phase 5. Those who enter now at $0.03 and ride the trajectory to $0.20 will convert $2,000 into $13,333—and those who came in at $0.01 will realize a complete 20x return, bringing $2,000 to $40,000. This is not speculative hype; it’s a mathematically structured token sale with defined pricing and real platform development to back it. Staking Rewards and Buyback Mechanism Add More Layers of Value In addition to lending income, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer staking incentives through a revenue-backed dividend model. Users who stake their mtTokens—representing deposited assets in the protocol—will receive MUTM tokens purchased from the open market using revenue generated by the platform. This buyback-and-distribute mechanism not only rewards long-term participants, but also contributes to organic demand for MUTM, helping form a self-sustaining incentive loop. Unlike speculative airdrops or price-driven bonuses, these dividends are anchored in actual platform usage and revenue activity—a model built to scale alongside Mutuum’s ecosystem growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also addressing scalability through Layer-2 blockchain integration. This ensures faster transaction speeds and dramatically lower fees—two key pain points for DeFi users. The platform will also introduce its own decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain assets. This stablecoin will serve as the engine for loans and repayments within the protocol, while interest earnings will flow back into the treasury, reinforcing long-term sustainability. Cardano (ADA) did not offer such ecosystem-native income channels or stable value mechanisms during its initial climb. That’s one reason why today’s investors are seeing stronger upside in projects like MUTM. With over 11,850 token holders already, a total of $10.25 million raised, and a $100,000 giveaway underway to boost user engagement, the momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is undeniable. The project is gaining traction at a pace few other DeFi protocols achieve during their presale stages. As more people discover the platform’s utility, income potential, and execution speed, the entry point of $0.03 will become a rare opportunity. Every new phase of the presale means a higher price—and a narrower entry window for serious investors looking to multiply their holdings. Conclusion: From ADA’s Legacy to MUTM’s Future Cardano (ADA) built its reputation on long-term vision and academic credibility. It rewarded patient investors with a 4x surge—but those gains required years of waiting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built differently. It is utility-first, income-driven, and rapidly executing on its roadmap. With a 20x pricing structure already mapped out and real platform functionality launching soon, MUTM is not just another presale—it’s the future of decentralized lending. Investors have seen what happens when vision meets delivery. Now, with $0.03 as the current price and $0.20 on the horizon, the roadmap is clear—and so is the opportunity.

Some analysts suggested that BTC is preparing for the “final resistance,” while others warned that it still risks a potential pullback to lower levels. Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 – Is A Recovery Around The Corner? Bitcoin Rally Eyes Next Resistance Bitcoin has finally regained significant bullish momentum after printing a massive daily candle on Monday. The flagship crypto recently lost its post-all-time high (ATH) range of $106,800-$109,700, sparking concern among some investors. Amid the recent market pullbacks, which began in late May, the flagship crypto also registered some volatility, losing key levels as support and hitting a one-month low near the $100,000 level last week. However, BTC reclaimed the $105,000 mark over the weekend before surging above the $106,800 crucial resistance on Monday. Following this performance, analyst Rekt Capital stated that Bitcoin has successfully retested the $104,400 re-accumulation range high resistance as new support for four weeks. He highlighted that BTC was “rebounding from this new support base in an effort to transition into Price Discovery again.” Additionally, Bitcoin ended its two-week downtrend, recording a Daily Close around the $110,500 area. Per the analyst, BTC “has skipped through the $106,600-$109,443 Daily Range entirely,” and is “once again positioning itself like in late May for a retest” of the range’s high as support, which propelled the price to its ATH last month. A daily close above the $109,443 level would set up BTC for a revisit of the “final Daily resistance,” around the $111,723 mark, before a new ATH. The analyst also affirmed that reclaiming the “final weekly resistance” of $108,900 as support would also add to BTC’s momentum. BTC In A ‘Dangerous Area’? Analyst Crypto Jelle suggested that turning the $108,000 price area into support could send Bitcoin to the price discovery phase, potentially targeting the $120,000 mark. He noted that previous unsuccessful breakout attempts failed to reclaim this level, but that the cryptocurrency is currently holding this area. Based on a multi-month pattern, Jelle also reaffirmed its $140,000-$150,000 target for BTC’s cycle top. The analyst highlighted a major inverted Head and Shoulders pattern forming since the end of 2024. According to the post, the pattern is “nearing completion” after the recent price drop formed the right shoulder, while the neckline sits around the $111,000 mark. A breakout above this level could send Bitcoin to Jelle’s cycle top target. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Altcoin Sherpa considers that BTC’s chart “looks pretty good” in the high-time timeframes, suggesting that he will be “bullish until shown otherwise.” However, he warned that Bitcoin is “still in a dangerous area” as it could drop to lower levels if it doesn’t reclaim the $110,000 level. To Sherpa, “it’s logical to assume some sort of pullback is going to come in the red supply zone,” which sits between the key resistance line and its ATH level. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez highlighted on X that BTC’s most important support area sits between the $102,770 and $106,090 levels, where 2.21 million addresses bought 1.39 million BTC. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,995, a 3.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.

USD1 is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and is designed to serve as a trusted medium for cross-border transactions and DeFi services. TRON, the latest blockchain to support USD1, was founded by Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun and is widely viewed as a China-linked infrastructure. Despite being headquartered in Singapore, its origins and leadership are deeply rooted in China’s tech space, which makes WLFI’s choice of network particularly notable given Trump’s prior criticism of Chinese influence in U.S. tech and finance. WLFI’s stablecoin is fully backed by U.S. Treasury instruments, dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents , with BitGo overseeing reserve custody. The coin was previously deployed on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain and is now gaining momentum with the support of TRON’s fast and cost-efficient network. In addition to the launch, WLFI has partnered with Kernel DAO to enable staking of USD1 , allowing holders to earn passive income while supporting the security of other decentralized applications. The coin’s utility has caught the attention of major investors like UAE-backed MGX, which intends to use USD1 in a $2 billion Binance deal. While the launch boosts USD1’s market position—it now ranks as the world’s seventh-largest stablecoin—it also intensifies scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest, given the Trump family’s ties and the Chinese connections of the chosen blockchain.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-06-11 10:04:25

ETH, which has increased by approximately 5% in the last 24 hours, has approached $ 2,800. While Ethereum provided some relief to its investors with its rise, it also left Bitcoin behind. According to Coinglass data, the trading volume of Ethereum derivatives increased by 38% in 24 hours, reaching over $110 billion. Analysts said the increase was driven by continued strong inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs, renewed interest in DeFi, and positive news from the SEC. This data signals increasing institutional participation for Ethereum, with its $110 billion trading volume surpassing that of Bitcoin derivatives, which had $84.72 billion. While this increase in Ethereum derivatives trading volume comes along with the increase in ETH price, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas said that ETH's transaction increase reflects structural growth and increasing institutional interest. “Ethereum's growth in transaction volume is not a momentary one; it reflects structural growth, institutional validation, and real utility, “ETH is no longer just the second largest crypto by market cap, it is becoming the cornerstone of the digital asset economy.” Lucas, who also explained his prediction about the Ethereum price, said that there is an increase on the horizon, but for now, the $ 2,800 support and $ 3,600 resistance are critical for the new ATH process. “In the short term, ETH is riding a bullish wave. Price action is bullish, but we are also eyeing key levels – resistance at $3,600, support around $2,800. “If staking-supported ETFs are approved later this year, that could push ETH into the $5,500-$6,700 range by December.” *This is not investment advice.

Bernstein, the $800 billion asset management giant, has boldly declared their $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 as notably “conservative,” while CNBC analysts project even more short-term ambitious targets reaching $135,000. This convergence of institutional optimism comes as Bitcoin trades just 4% below its latest all-time high, set on May 22. According to the Cryptonews price index , the crypto is trading above $109K at the time of writing. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Cryptonews Institutional Momentum Drives Market Confidence The institutional adoption story has reached a critical inflection point, with Bernstein analysts emphasizing that the current crypto market cycle began with Bitcoin’s institutionalization through spot ETF launches. These financial vehicles have legitimized Bitcoin in traditional investment portfolios and created massive demand, making their $200K target understated. JUST IN: $800 billion asset manager Bernstein says its $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is ""conservative."" pic.twitter.com/GGLHWfOJQf — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) June 10, 2025 The success extends beyond Bitcoin, with Ethereum ETFs accumulating $9 billion in assets under management and recording $815 million in inflows over just 20 days. The macro environment further supports this institutional thesis, with steady U.S. bond yields despite tariff-driven inflation concerns, expected Federal Reserve rate cuts , and a weakening U.S. dollar all contributing to favorable conditions for growth-oriented assets like Bitcoin. Corporate adoption has reached new heights with major firms like Metaplanet and Strategy holding Bitcoin in record numbers, while Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy continues its aggressive accumulation strategy . This institutional infrastructure has created what CNBC analysts describe as “strong fundamental, macro and technical backdrops” supporting continued price appreciation. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Points to Explosive Breakout CNBC’s technical analysis reveals Bitcoin’s successful navigation through a classic range-bound consolidation between $93,000 and $105,000, followed by a false breakdown in March that trapped short sellers before the subsequent explosive breakout above $107,000. The pattern CNBC analysts explain indicates intense institutional buying pressure. MattC, an Engineer analyst, perfectly describes this pattern, suggesting that Bitcoin has entered the “outer space” territory with minimal historical resistance levels. Bitcoin Outer Space Chart Source: MattC on X The curve is a long-term exponential trend line that Bitcoin has been following, suggesting the current rally is part of a larger macro bull cycle. The fact that Bitcoin has broken into this “outer space” region suggests the next major resistance levels could be psychological round numbers like $120,000 or $130,000. More so, the volatility analysis using Average Percent True Range (APTR) shows particularly intriguing behavior, with low volatility readings of 8.5% on weekly charts and 3-4% on daily charts typically preceding major breakouts. Unlike traditional markets where volatility decreases during uptrends, Bitcoin exhibits the opposite behavior, with increasing volatility accompanying price advances. This unique characteristic, combined with Bitcoin’s approach to the triple-resistance level of $110,000, has led CNBC analysts to project a 100% Fibonacci target of $135,000. Furthermore, historical cycle analysis reveals Bitcoin’s adherence to four-year halving patterns, with peaks traditionally occurring in June of halving years. The current 2025 cycle shows Bitcoin breaking previous all-time high resistance levels around $200,000, suggesting the early stages of what could be the most significant bull run in Bitcoin’s history. BITCOIN Is ‘Bullish June Seasonality’ about to kick in?

Global liquidity continues to expand. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/BU2hCA6PmZ — Root (@therationalroot) June 9, 2025 Global liquidity analysis further supports this technical outlook. Bitcoin’s price strongly correlates with the expanding central bank money supply from major economies, currently showing positive growth of 5-10% year over year. In summary, Bitcoin appears positioned to transcend previous market cycles and establish a new ATH. Whether Bitcoin reaches Bernstein’s “conservative” $200,000 target or CNBC’s aggressive $135,000 projection, the convergence of these technical patterns already creates a foundation for Bitcoin’s continued increase.

The bill passed the House and Senate unanimously and introduced new requirements for crypto-related remittance agencies to verify parental consent for users under 18 years. The bill, officially titled “An Act Concerning the Regulation of Virtual Currency and State Investments,” imposed a comprehensive ban on the state and local governments from investing in crypto assets. Separate from money transmission, the bill prohibited Connecticut and its political subdivisions from accepting or requiring payment in the form of virtual currency or purchasing, holding, investing in, or establishing a digital currency reserve. It also stipulated that crypto businesses must adhere to strict anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. The bill also regulates minors’ access to certain money-sharing applications by imposing restrictions and duties on those businesses. It generally prohibits any business, beginning on October 1, 2025, from allowing anyone to sponsor, open, or establish a money-sharing application account for a minor unless the business receives an attestation from the person stating that he or she is the minor’s parent. HB7082 imposes two restrictions on crypto custody and control The new law imposed two restrictions on the handling of crypto by businesses that engaged in the transmission of money within Connecticut by receiving, sending, storing, or maintaining custody or control of virtual currency. First, it prohibited the businesses from selling, transferring, assigning, lending, hypothecating, pledging, or otherwise using or encumbering virtual currency stored, held, controlled, maintained by, or under the custody or control of the business on a person’s behalf—except for the sale, transfer of ownership, or assignment at the person’s direction. Second, it limited the current law’s provisions authorizing these crypto-related businesses to use designated agents to provide money transmission services on their behalf. However, regardless of those current authorizations, the bill also prohibited the businesses from directly or indirectly using or engaging any other person, including a virtual currency control services vendor, to store or hold virtual currency for or on behalf of a customer—unless the other person was a licensed money transmitter, a qualified bank or credit union, or approved by the banking commissioner to do so. The bill defined a “virtual currency control services vendor” as someone who controls virtual currency under an agreement with another person who assumes control of this currency on a third person’s behalf. Under existing law, businesses that engaged in money transmission in Connecticut by receiving, sending, storing, or maintaining custody or control of crypto on behalf of another person were required at all times to hold digital assets of the same type and amount owed or obligated to the other person. The bill also specified that this virtual currency was a property interest of any claimants against the crypto businesses on a proportional basis and in the type and amount to which the claimants were entitled, regardless of when the claimants became entitled or the businesses obtained control. Connecticut law requires crypto businesses to disclose transaction data The new law required businesses engaged in money transmission in Connecticut to provide specific disclosures and receipts for these transactions. However, the bill authorized the banking commissioner to waive any of these requirements and approve an alternative disclosure or receipt proposed by a crypto business if he/she determined that the alternative was more appropriate for the business and gave the same information and protection to the public. In the absence of an approved alternative disclosure, the bill required businesses to provide several disclosures before entering into a crypto transaction for, on behalf of, or with a person. Specifically, the businesses must clearly disclose relevant details to the extent applicable to the transaction. The Connecticut new law also requires businesses to give people specific receipts once the transactions are completed. The receipt must include the business’s name, contact information, and a description of how a person may ask a question or file a complaint. The details also include the transaction’s type, date, precise time, and value in U.S. dollars, and any consideration the business charged for the transaction, including any charge, fee, or commission, and the amount of any difference between the price the person paid for the virtual currency and its prevailing market price.

Regulation Eases, Innovation Takes Off Hougan believes the crypto industry is finally breaking free from the restrictions of the past few years. “Applications and real-world use cases were artificially suppressed by the hostile regulatory environment of 2020-2024,” he said. “But the infrastructure kept improving, and is now remarkably robust.” Now that those barriers are falling away, technologies like stablecoins, DeFi, tokenization, and DePin are ready to grow fast. Hougan describes the moment as a “coiled spring”, suggesting that a big surge in adoption could be just around the corner. Bitcoin Hits $110K – Could $150K Be Next? The numbers back him up. Bitcoin’s $110,000 landmark was unthinkable last cycle, and a recovery could push it to $150,000 or beyond. That kind of growth would mark a shift away from the short-lived rallies of the past and show that the market is maturing. Trump’s Return Gives Crypto a Boost The political climate in the U.S. is changing fast. Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, crypto has seen a sharp turn in its favor. The SEC has dropped multiple cases against crypto companies, and the White House just hosted its first crypto convention. With the government showing more support, institutional investors are stepping in. That’s a big difference from previous cycles, which were largely driven by retail traders. Hougan says this broader backing could help extend the bull run. “This cycle won’t fade away as it did previously,” he noted. Hougan is confident about what’s next. In a recent interview, he predicted a “fantastic” second half of the year for crypto. With institutional demand on the rise and fewer regulatory hurdles, crypto is finding its place in mainstream finance. Time to Rethink the Crypto Playbook Hougan’s long-term outlook isn’t new. Back in January, he said a crypto winter in 2026 was unlikely. And with Bitcoin’s next halving not expected until 2028, the timeline for the current cycle could stretch far beyond what we’re used to. For investors, that means adjusting to a new kind of market, one that includes big institutions, stronger government support, and a growing list of real-world use cases. The next downturn may still come, but this time, the industry may be more prepared than ever to bounce back.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-11 10:11:22

Major US retailers, including Walmart, GameStop, Target and Best Buy, quickly flashed “out of stock” notices online, showing a strong start for Nintendo’s first new gaming console in eight years. This early success positions Nintendo to meet its goal of selling 15 million Switch 2 units by the end of its fiscal year on March 31, 2026. Analysts, however, view that target as conservative, predicting ongoing high demand. “The market expected a record from Nintendo, and as it turns out, Nintendo delivered,” said Serkan Toto, CEO and founder of Kantan Games, a consultancy focused on the gaming sector. He added that all signs before launch pointed to robust interest, and he expects the company to surpass initial records in the weeks and months ahead. Nintendo may sell over 20 million Switch 2 units by March 2026 Toto projects more than 20 million Switch 2 sales during its first year on the market. David Gibson, a senior research analyst at MST Financial, shared that outlook, anticipating roughly 20 million units sold by March 2026. Released on June 5, the Switch 2 has drawn eager fans who lined up for hours outside Nintendo stores ahead of midnight openings. In a statement, Doug Bowser, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America, said, “Fans around the world are showing their enthusiasm for Nintendo Switch 2 as an upgraded way to play at home and on the go.” He added that the company is grateful for the overwhelmingly positive reaction. Despite this enthusiastic reception, Tokyo-listed shares of Nintendo dipped 3.5% on Wednesday, according to LSEG data, even though they have climbed nearly 30% so far this year. Since the original Switch launched in early March 2017, Nintendo’s stock has increased by almost 5 times in value. Part of the excitement hinges on whether the Switch 2 can match the success of its predecessor. The first Switch sold 15 million units in its initial year and went on to move over 152 million consoles, making it the company’s second best-selling hardware ever, after the Nintendo DS. Supply concerns emerged almost immediately By midweek, the online shops of Walmart, GameStop, Target and Best Buy were all listing the Switch 2 as unavailable. Back in April, Bowser had told CNBC that Nintendo was working closely with its retail partners to secure enough stock not just for launch weekend but for the period that follows. That same month, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that 2.2 million people in Japan entered a lottery to buy the Switch 2 on launch day, a number that outstripped both the company’s forecast and the units it originally planned to send to stores. Toto believes the tight supply will persist in Japan, where demand has been exceptionally strong, but sees better availability elsewhere. “It might take a while, but as far as can be monitored, supply seems to be more robust than around the launch of the original Switch in 2017,” he said. Adding to the challenge, US President Donald Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs on goods from around the world threaten to increase costs for the Switch 2. In April, Nintendo delayed US pre-orders while it evaluated the potential impact of these duties. The Switch 2 carries a $449 price tag in the United States, marking it as Nintendo’s most expensive console to date. Bowser said at the time that the company would keep a close eye on tariff developments before adjusting prices further. Gibson of MST Financial noted that if tariffs are resolved and duty rates fall, the price of the Switch 2 could come down in the US. Beyond its sales and supply story, the Switch 2 builds on its predecessor with a larger display and stronger performance. It also adds GameChat2, a feature that lets players voice or video chat with friends online and share their game screens.

So, when a ChatGPT outage occurs, it sends ripples through the community, highlighting our increasing reliance on these powerful AI models . What Happened During the ChatGPT Outage? OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, reported experiencing a partial outage on Tuesday morning. This disruption impacted users attempting to access several key services, including ChatGPT itself, the Sora text-to-video model, and importantly, the AI API used by developers. The company first acknowledged investigating issues late on Monday night, with the partial outage continuing into Tuesday morning. OpenAI’s status page provided updates, noting elevated error rates and latency across the affected services. By roughly 5:30 am PT on Tuesday, OpenAI stated they had identified the root cause of the problem and were working on a solution. However, full recovery was expected to take several more hours, impacting users, particularly on the West Coast, logging in for their workday. While temporary glitches are not uncommon, this particular ChatGPT outage was notable for its extended duration compared to typical short service interruptions. Experiencing the Issues Firsthand Users trying to interact with ChatGPT during the outage encountered various problems. For instance, attempting to access models like GPT-4o resulted in errors. One user reported receiving a message stating, “Too many concurrent requests,” indicating the system was overwhelmed or unable to process new interactions effectively. This direct impact on user experience underscores the severity of the disruption, preventing people from utilizing the AI models for their tasks. Outage Amidst Major OpenAI Announcements The timing of this service disruption is particularly interesting, coming right after a series of significant announcements from OpenAI : Apple Integration: On Monday, Apple announced deeper integrations with OpenAI’s models during its WWDC event, signaling a massive potential increase in user access via Apple devices. Revenue Milestone: Also on Monday, OpenAI confirmed reaching an annualized recurring revenue of $10 billion, showcasing rapid business growth. API Price Cuts: Earlier on Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced an 80% price reduction for developers using its o3 AI models via the AI API . These developments point towards rapidly increasing demand and reliance on OpenAI ‘s infrastructure. The outage highlights the significant technical challenges involved in scaling sophisticated AI models to meet this growing global demand. Scaling Challenges for OpenAI This isn’t the first time OpenAI has faced challenges in scaling its services. Managing the computational resources required to power hundreds of millions of user interactions simultaneously is an immense task. Sam Altman has previously alluded to the strain on infrastructure, famously stating that the company’s “GPUs are melting” under the demand for ChatGPT. The current partial outage serves as a reminder that even with rapid growth and significant resources, keeping pace with the explosive demand for advanced AI models and ensuring reliable AI API access remains a complex technical hurdle for OpenAI . Keeping Up with AI News The incident underscores the dynamic nature of the AI landscape. While advancements are rapid and exciting, infrastructure stability is paramount for consistent access to these powerful tools. Users and developers relying on OpenAI’s services are keenly watching for full resolution and insights into preventing similar future disruptions. The ongoing developments at OpenAI, from new features and integrations to infrastructure challenges, are key components of the broader AI news cycle that impacts the entire tech ecosystem. In conclusion, the partial ChatGPT outage , affecting access to its primary interface, Sora, and the crucial AI API , highlights the infrastructure pressures faced by OpenAI amidst surging demand and major new partnerships. While temporary, the disruption serves as a stark reminder of the complexities in scaling cutting-edge AI models to a global user base.

While the company posted improved profitability and narrowed operational losses, its revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations, highlighting ongoing challenges in the retail gaming sector. For the quarter ending May 3, GameStop reported revenue of $732.4 million, missing analysts’ forecast of $754.2 million and marking a 17% year-over-year decline from $881.8 million. The company’s financial update attributed the shortfall to weakening demand for physical video games—an industry trend that has been chipping away at GameStop’s core business for years. However, the company reported a net income of $44.8 million, a sharp turnaround from a net loss of $32.3 million in the same period last year. Operating losses also improved significantly, shrinking to $10.8 million from $50.6 million in Q1 2024. Bitcoin Enters the Balance Sheet The earnings report was also GameStop’s first since it revealed its entry into the world of Bitcoin. On May 28, the company disclosed that it had purchased 4,710 BTC—worth around $513 million at the time—making it one of the latest public firms to add Bitcoin to its treasury reserves. The Bitcoin purchase was financed through a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering , indicating GameStop’s commitment to diversifying its financial strategy beyond traditional investments. While the company has not announced a specific target for future Bitcoin holdings, it has stated it may increase or liquidate its holdings depending on market conditions. GameStop’s cash position stands strong, with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities—up significantly from just $1 billion a year ago. This financial cushion gives the company room to explore further Bitcoin acquisitions if it chooses to pursue that route. GameStop Stock Performance Still Under Pressure Despite its improved bottom line and foray into digital assets, GameStop’s stock has remained relatively stagnant. GME is down approximately 3.8% year-to-date and continues to trade well below its historic January 2021 high of over $80, which occurred during the Reddit-fueled WallStreetBets surge. With a solid cash reserve and a bold step into Bitcoin , GameStop appears to be betting on a broader transformation. But whether this shift will be enough to revitalize investor confidence in a declining retail gaming market remains to be seen.

In a new announcement, the Societe Generale-FORGE says it is launching the USD CoinVertible (USDCV), its second stablecoin after the 2023 launch of EUR CoinVertible ( EURCV ). Says Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of the Societe Generale-FORGE, “After the release of a MiCA-compliant EUR stablecoin EURCV, the launch of a US Dollar version USDCV was the obvious next step for Societe Generale-FORGE as market adoption of stablecoins is growing exponentially. The stablecoin market remains largely US dollar-denominated. This new currency will enable our clients, either institutions, corporates or retail investors, to leverage the benefits of an institutional-grade stablecoin.” The French bank says that the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY) will serve as its “reserve custodian, enabling seamless integration between traditional and digital financial ecosystems.” The bank says it’s that stablecoins have multiple use cases for its clients, including crypto trading, cross-border payments, on-chain settlement, foreign exchange transactions and cash management. The launch of USDCV is expected to start next month. The stablecoins will be listed on several crypto exchanges. Neither stablecoins will be available to those in the United States at this time.

The move, which comes shortly after the exchange started trading Bitcoin futures, is seen as another step towards integrating decentralized digital assets into Russia’s conservative financial system. Moscow Exchange introduces its own Bitcoin index The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) has for the first time published the value of its new cryptocurrency index, Moscow Exchange PFI Bitcoin Index (MOEXBTC). On Tuesday, the day it was launched, the indicator grew by 3.1%, slightly exceeding $109,169. On Wednesday, it reached $109,439 and change, marking a 0.25% increase. The Bitcoin index is calculated once daily, at 12:30 p.m. Moscow time, the stock trading venue explained in a press release while also providing a detailed description on its website of the exact methodology employed. MOEXBTC is based on price data of perpetual futures and swaps for the BTC/USDT pair. MOEX said it’s collecting the numbers from four of the largest crypto exchanges in terms of daily volume – Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. These have been weighted as follows: Binance at 50%; Bybit 20%; OKX 15%; Bitget 15%, according to the index’s dedicated page . Noting that the coefficients are based on trading volumes and will be revised quarterly, MOEX said: “The index will be calculated as a weighted average of prices taking into account the weighting coefficients of the selected trading platforms.” Moscow Exchange launches its Bitcoin index after the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) officially confirmed last month that Russian financial institutions can legally offer qualified investors derivatives and other financial instruments linked to the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Following Bank of Russia’s approval at the end of May, MOEX started trading futures contracts for the shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). The Bitcoin futures volume reached $5 million during the first day of trading on June 4. Sberbank and Finam also announced crypto-related products. Russia takes the road to cryptocurrency integration While all the new crypto instruments have been made available exclusively to “ highly qualified ” investors, their offering has been viewed as a move towards integrating crypto assets in Russia’s traditional finances. Elena Baklanova, senior analyst at the financial analytics firm Euler, commented for the Russian business news portal RBC: “Since various instruments with an underlying asset in the form of cryptocurrency began to appear on the market, the launch of the [Bitcoin] index on the Moscow Exchange was a logical step.” According to Roman Nekrasov, co-founder of the blockchain solutions provider ENCRY Foundation, the creation of a Russian Bitcoin index, largely a symbolic move at this point, is part of a broader strategy to integrate crypto assets into the established financial system. “Like the launch of futures on IBIT, MOEXBTC is an attempt to integrate crypto into the framework that is already familiar to the regulator, without physical delivery, without trading in the asset itself,” the analyst told the crypto news outlet Forklog, elaborating: “This is a conservative, regulated experiment that allows us to test participants’ interest without going beyond the current legislation.” “The key question remains whether a sufficient number of secondary instruments will be created for the index to work as a full-fledged basis. Without this, it will remain an indicator ‘for show’,” Nekrasov emphasized. Russia, which has been tempted to use cryptocurrencies to circumvent sanctions, has yet to adopt comprehensive rules for digital assets such as Bitcoin. The CBR, which still stands in the way of allowing their free circulation in the Russian economy, proposed earlier this year to introduce an “experimental legal regime” that would facilitate crypto transactions under close regulatory oversight.

The token’s price leapt from a mere $0.001 to $0.037, sending its market cap soaring to $34.4 million. Trading volume also exploded past $38 million, sparking major excitement among retail traders. Though launched in May 2024 with a previous peak of $78 million, AURA had nearly disappeared from the scene, falling to just $600K before this unexpected comeback, possibly fueled by a wave of coordinated buys. While the surge has given a boost to millions of investors to try new coins, it is also seen as a risky trap by many in the community. Let’s see what’s driving this insane surge! Whales Cash In as Frenzy Builds Blockchain data from Lookonchain revealed that some investors made huge profits. One wallet, for example, turned a previous $24,000 investment into $128,000, bagging a cool $104,000 in profit after holding through a previous crash. Another trader claimed an unrealized gain nearing $700,000. These massive gains have amplified the buzz, but analysts aren’t celebrating just yet. Community Raises Red Flag- A Possible Rug Pull? While the price action appears bullish, experts and crypto experts are urging extreme caution. According to David, a prominent on-chain scam tracker, AURA exhibits multiple signs of a potential rug pull. He flagged the token as a “Level 3, Expert SCAM,” pointing to its unclear utility, suspicious distribution, and the timing of the pump. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban Bitcoin and Crypto Investments , David noted that AURA was only created in May 2024, briefly hit a $70 million market cap, then collapsed before its latest moonshot.

With no clear fundamentals and a murky token history, Aura’s explosive rise could end in disaster, a sobering reminder of the risks in low-cap, unvetted tokens. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The analysis, which incorporates feedback from developers and users, highlights issues such as blind signing, permission mismanagement, and centralization of staking as persistent threats to Ethereum’s long-term resilience. Those concerns are emerging alongside new efforts to align Ethereum with evolving privacy regulations, including a proposal this week that recommends a modular compliance framework to bring Ethereum into alignment with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Ethereum Foundation Identifies Six Key Security Challenges as Ecosystem Matures The Ethereum Foundation has published a comprehensive security report detailing six critical challenge areas that the Ethereum ecosystem must address as it continues to scale, innovate, and cement its leadership position in decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Released on Tuesday, the report captures input from a broad array of stakeholders including developers, infrastructure providers, and end users. The Foundation's analysis reveals that UX security and safety is the number one issue cited by community members. Central to this are problems with blind signing, poor approval and permission management, and vulnerable web interfaces — all of which continue to expose users to phishing attacks, wallet drainer scripts, and key compromise. Excerpt from Ethereum Foundation’s security report (Source: Ethereum Foundation ) “Many users are not equipped to safely manage cryptographic keys,” the report states, pointing to a mismatch between Ethereum’s security assumptions and the practical reality of everyday users. Blind signing, for instance, requires users to approve transactions without a clear view of what they’re signing, an issue worsened by minimal interface cues or deceptive dApp behaviors. In parallel, users often unwittingly give unlimited permissions to unknown smart contracts, creating long-term exposure to fund theft or misuse. These concerns have only grown more urgent with Ethereum’s expanding footprint. As more value and users are drawn into the network through DeFi apps, NFTs, DAOs, and tokenized assets, the consequences of poor UX security have scaled with them. Smart Contracts, Infrastructure, and the Governance Social Layer The Foundation’s report goes beyond UX, laying out five other core challenge areas: Smart contract security Infrastructure and cloud vulnerabilities Consensus protocol design Monitoring and incident response Risks to the social layer and governance Each of these domains carries both near-term and systemic implications. For example, smart contract bugs can lead to multimillion-dollar exploits, as seen in the history of DeFi hacks. Infrastructure compromise, particularly in cloud or RPC node providers, poses threats of censorship or front-running. Meanwhile, weaknesses in consensus design could become more visible as Ethereum continues to experiment with modularity and layer-2 integrations. Perhaps most abstract, yet deeply consequential, are risks to the social layer. These include issues like stake centralization and offchain governance capture. As the report warns, “Centralization of large amounts of stake can pose risks to Ethereum as a whole if the entities controlling that stake decide to collude.” This could lead to the erosion of Ethereum’s core values of neutrality and decentralization, particularly if major stakers — such as large exchanges or staking-as-a-service providers — exert influence over future upgrades or emergency decisions. The Foundation’s newly-released report builds on momentum from its recently launched Trillion Dollar Security Initiative, unveiled in mid-May. Led by EF team members Josh Stark and Fredrik Svantes, the initiative aims to elevate Ethereum’s security architecture to meet the demands of an ecosystem expected to secure trillions of dollars in value over the coming decade. This initiative is not just focused on code audits or bug bounties but also seeks to foster research, tooling, and incentive alignment across the Ethereum stack — from dApps to protocol layers to governance coordination. Ethereum Still Dominates Despite Growing Competition Despite these challenges, Ethereum remains the bedrock of decentralized finance. As of Tuesday, the network accounted for $65 billion, or 55.6% of the total value locked (TVL) across all DeFi platforms, according to DefiLlama. That figure dwarfs the next closest competitor, Solana, which holds just 7.5% of the market. In the realm of RWA tokenization, Ethereum’s lead is even more pronounced . The blockchain anchors $7.35 billion in tokenized real-world assets, representing 59.6% of the market — far ahead of its closest rival, Stellar, at 3.8%. These figures show why the Foundation is turning its attention to long-term resilience. As Ethereum becomes a central pillar in both decentralized finance and the digitization of traditional assets, the cost of security failures — whether technical, social, or user-facing — will only grow. Ethereum Community Proposes Modular GDPR Compliance Strategy to Safeguard Privacy in Public Blockchains Meanwhile, as public blockchains face mounting scrutiny over data privacy and regulatory compliance, a new proposal from within the Ethereum community could represent a major turning point in how decentralized systems interact with traditional legal frameworks like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). On Monday, Ethereum researcher Eugenio Reggianini released a detailed compliance framework aimed at aligning Ethereum’s architecture with GDPR’s stringent requirements. The proposal recommends a modular compliance strategy, which would transform the way personal data is handled across Ethereum’s layers, from wallets and dApps to consensus mechanisms and data availability protocols. The GDPR, implemented by the EU in 2018, sets strict standards on how companies and systems manage personal data. Key provisions include the right to erasure, purpose limitation, and data minimization — all of which present challenges for immutable public blockchains like Ethereum, where once data is written onchain, it’s effectively permanent. “By pushing personal data to the edges (wallets and DApps), using offchain storage with metadata-erasure, and splitting roles cryptographically, we can focus GDPR controller duties on a small set of entities, while the wider network becomes mere processors or falls out of scope,” wrote Reggianini. This approach, he argues, offers a realistic path for Ethereum to maintain its permissionless, censorship-resistant ethos while complying with regulatory demands. Ethereum's Privacy-Enhanced Technical Roadmap The proposal aligns closely with Ethereum’s broader push toward modular design — an architecture that decouples different functions of the blockchain into specialized layers or components. This design philosophy not only improves scalability and flexibility but also opens the door to privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Proposed GDPR compliance framework (Source: ethresear.ch) Reggianini highlights several existing and proposed Ethereum features that could serve as privacy safeguards: Proto-danksharding (EIP-4844): Slated to limit the lifetime of blob transactions to roughly 18 days, enforcing GDPR’s data minimization requirements. zk-SNARKs: Zero-knowledge proofs allow validators to verify computations without accessing the underlying data, keeping sensitive information off the blockchain. Multiparty computation (MPC), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): Each provides a different mechanism for computing on or storing encrypted data securely. Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) and PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling): These emerging designs help decouple roles in block production and distribute data availability, making it easier to isolate and reduce the handling of personal data. Together, these technologies create a pathway for Ethereum to comply with GDPR without resorting to permissioned or centralized solutions, a key concern for the network’s decentralized community. A Layered Approach to Legal Responsibility Reggianini’s modular GDPR framework divides the Ethereum ecosystem into three primary layers, each with distinct roles under GDPR definitions: Execution Layer: Functions as a data processor, transmitting only encrypted or obfuscated data from smart contracts and dApps. Consensus Layer: Validates cryptographic commitments and zero-knowledge proofs without accessing raw data — akin to a neutral verifier. Data Availability Layer: Stores time-limited, anonymized data shards using PeerDAS, reducing exposure and aligning with GDPR’s data retention rules. In this structure, GDPR liability is concentrated at the application layer, i.e., the developers and operators of wallets, dApps, and interfaces, while Ethereum’s core infrastructure remains broadly GDPR-neutral or exempt. The modular compliance strategy arrives at a time when regulators in Europe and elsewhere are sharpening their focus on how decentralized technologies impact privacy rights. Notably, the GDPR doesn’t distinguish between centralized and decentralized systems — meaning blockchains are still expected to uphold the law, even if no single actor controls the data. Reggianini’s framework aims to square this circle by redefining Ethereum’s roles and responsibilities, effectively shielding much of the base protocol from direct legal obligations. However, the success of this proposal will hinge on broad adoption by developers, wallet providers, and infrastructure operators. Implementing PETs, redesigning user interfaces to minimize data collection, and maintaining secure offchain data systems all require significant coordination and buy-in.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-11 12:00:00

TRNR is already in the process of acquiring FET tokens with the initial $55 million of new capital that has been invested by private equity firm ATW Partners and crypto market maker DWF Labs . “Digital assets are rapidly becoming an essential part of global financial infrastructure and AI is the biggest technological leap in our lifetime,” said Trent Ward, CEO of TRNR. “Fetch.ai is the market leader at the intersection of the two most important technology trends today: artificial intelligence and crypto. We believe our strategy to acquire a significant number of FET tokens could dramatically accelerate our mission to create significant long-term value for TRNR shareholders.” “We are proud to support this landmark deal, advancing institutional crypto adoption.” said Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of DWF Labs. “As a global leader in crypto investments and market making, we see enormous potential in TRNR’s treasury strategy and Fetch.ai’s vision, signaling the next wave of corporate capital markets embracing AI-driven digital assets.” “Unlike traditional models that generate isolated responses, Fetch.ai’s ecosystem is built on autonomous agents that can interact, collaborate, and transact in real time,” said Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai. “This enables users to build and monetize AI tools that operate independently—whether for booking doctor appointments, market forecasting, or personalized fitness plans.” Fetch.ai’s platform features the world’s first decentralized LLM designed for autonomous action, not just content generation, and powers AI agents that optimize critical industries—from medical research and energy to logistics and finance. Fetch.ai is the original issuer of FET and a member of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI). As part of the deal, Fetch.ai will collaborate with TRNR to expand its digital fitness services and accelerate an AI-driven personal training platform. This investment accelerates TRNR’s momentum from its two pending acquisitions, which TRNR believes highlights the strong institutional investor support for the Company’s strategy of combining crypto treasury assets and accretive acquisitions. The crypto treasury asset strategy is expected to strengthen TRNR’s financial flexibility, as well as support its AI and digital fitness ambitions, and increase shareholder exposure to next-generation growth assets. FET is a top-50 cryptocurrency and a top-5 AI-focused cryptocurrency by market capitalization according to coinmarketcap.com. TRNR will leverage BitGo for both the trading and custody of its FET holdings through BitGo’s best-in-class custody platform. Advisors: Legal advisors included Lucosky Brookman (Interactive Strength), K&L Gates/Ed Dartley (Fetch.ai), Kelly Drye & Warren (ATW Partners), Blank Rome (ATW Partners) and Nixon Peabody (DWF Labs).

Here’s What Will Happen,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-june-16-is-a-major-xrp-timing-window-heres-what-will-happen/,"XRP has spent months consolidating, but the current technical setup shows that the end of this phase is imminent. The asset’s price continues to hold above $2.25, a key support level tied to the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. This level has acted as a structural anchor since the broader uptrend began. Now, the chart shows price compressing into a triangle formation , pushing XRP toward what CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) calls a “forced decision point.” She believes time is running out, and highlights June 16 as a critical date based on a time-based Fibonacci projection shared in April. Although XRP has not reached a new all-time high as she predicted, the analyst stands by the timing model. June 16 marks the end of the consolidation phase, but price action could break out before then. XRP Macro Apex Here- $2.25 Holding as Forced Decision Approaches! After months of a volatile consolidation, $XRP is nearing a critical decision point. We’re looking at the daily chart, holding above the major .382 retracement at $2.25, a level we've been looking at for MONTHS!… pic.twitter.com/sEJl8zsVkg — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 10, 2025 Wave Pattern Suggests Bullish Impulse Could Follow The current Wave structure also supports a bullish setup. The recent local low could mark the end of Wave 2, which would open the door to a Wave 3 rally. The chart shows the Wave 3 peak at $4.7998 (Fib. 3.618), marking a new all-time high for the digital asset. Following this, the analyst expects Wave 4 to bring the asset down to $3.7674 (Fib. 1.618) before Wave 5 sends it to a range between $8 and $13. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why June 16 Is An Important Date June 16 carries added weight for XRP because it represents a convergence of both technical and legal timelines. CasiTrades marks that date as the likely end of XRP’s consolidation phase, and this same date aligns with a critical court deadline in the Ripple vs. SEC case. The legal significance stems from a mandated status update due from the SEC on June 16. The agency must inform the court whether it plans to settle its long-standing case against Ripple or proceed with the appeal process. Both parties initially agreed to pause their appeals , and a finalized settlement would lift key regulatory barriers for XRP, paving the way for institutional adoption and possibly future ETF listings. The current settlement agreement reduces Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million and removes the permanent injunction preventing institutional XRP sales. If the court approves this settlement agreement, it could significantly contribute to CasiTrades’ expected price surge, pushing XRP past the $8 to $13 range much faster than anticipated. XRP is currently trading at $2.29, holding above the $2.25 level, and market participants will be eagerly watching the asset’s next moves and the developments in the legal battle.

Speaking in a 10 June video, the analyst told viewers he had been “making the case that the first two weeks of June should be when we start moving up—if we’re bullish. He conceded that “there is a chance the move has started” after Dogecoin closed a two-day candle back above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement drawn from the December 2024 swing high. The backdrop VisionPulsed describes is notably risk-on. Bitcoin is hovering around $109,500, roughly 3% shy of its all-time high, while Ethereum has punched out a fresh twelve-month high above $2,790. In equities, the S&P Small-Cap 600—an index the analyst referenced when he quipped that “the S&P broke 600 yesterday”—posted its strongest five-day advance since March, a move the analyst interprets as validation of a global-liquidity gauge Global M2. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Hash-ribbon signals on Bitcoin flipped positive two weeks ago, the analyst noted, historically an early marker of revived demand for risk assets. “Bitcoin at 110K says we should go up. Ethereum breaking out says we should go up. If we still don’t go up… just pick a different investment choice.” Central to VisionPulsed’s thesis is a 70-day cyclical window counted from Dogecoin’s April 1 local low. “We’re approaching that 70-day mark.… It is now the time for it to be bullish,” he said, warning that failure to rally before mid-June would all but invalidate the setup. Yet the analyst concedes that Dogecoin’s fate is tethered to the ETH/BTC pair and to Bitcoin dominance, which has remained stubbornly elevated: “When the ETH-BTC move does occur, that’s going to be when the dominance falls and we need the dominance to fall because that’s when Dogecoin goes to the moon.” Until that rotation happens, any up-ticks in DOGE may remain prone to stalling beneath long-term resistance. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive VisionPulsed identifies three price milestones that will decide sentiment. A daily close above $0.23 would constitute the first clear break of the descending trend-line in place since December, while $0.30—the 0.618 retracement of the entire 2021–2024 bear market—marks the level at which, he says, “people will start talking about Dogecoin at your summer camp… it’s going to be euphoric.” Should time drag on, he allows that the trigger could slide to $0.27, but the message is stark: “If we just shoot up, it’s still $0.30. If we take longer, it could be lower, but it’s the same concept.” With Bitcoin firm above six figures, Ethereum printing new local highs, and global liquidity gauges flashing green, the stage is set for an upside resolution. Whether Dogecoin can convert that macro tail-wind into a decisive break above $0.23—and ignite the $0.30 euphoria line—will become evident within the next fortnight. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.197.

Many individuals in this period are looking for the one coin that will bring them a multiple return on their investment. Every week, there’s a new project, a new listing, or a fresh trend making noise across the space. After the quick dip experienced when Bitcoin fell to the $100,000 area, the market quickly recovered and now the market is buzzing again with new tokens getting attention, and communities forming around promising ideas.

Bitunix exchange has officially listed Skate Coin (SKATE) on its spot and futures market, a project that’s starting to catch the eyes of both developer and investor circles. What is Skate Chain’s Coin (SKATE)? Skate is a new project that’s changing the way different virtual machines (VMs) work together. It’s a protocol that lets users and apps interact smoothly across different VMs without the hassle of switching wallets or using complicated bridges. At the heart of this system is the SKATE token, which helps secure the network, lets holders vote on important decisions, and rewards people who help grow the ecosystem. The maximum supply is 1 billion SKATE tokens, with 150 million in circulation already. As per Coinmarketcap Skate Coin price at the time of writing is $0.054. Skate works through three main parts: the Hub Chain, Skate AVS which keeps everything secure using advanced technology, and the Executor Network which manages tasks between chains. This setup makes it possible for apps to run smoothly across many blockchains at once. What makes Skate really stand out is how it solves a big problem in crypto: fragmentation. Instead of juggling multiple wallets and bridges, users get a smooth experience, and developers can build apps that work everywhere without extra hassle. Where to Buy Skate Coin (SKATE)?

According to CoinGecko data, aura (AURA) surged from $0.001 to a high of $0.005 on June 11, marking a 400% gain in a few hours. Its trading volume skyrocketed by over 115,000% from the previous day. Interestingly, there was no official update or announcement from the project that could explain such a steep rally. As of press time, AURA was still up 4,130% over the past 24 hours, trading at around $0.042 with a market cap of $41.6 million. AURA price chart — June 11 | Source: CoinGecko Some traders believe the pump may have been triggered by a whale connected to SPX, a popular Solana culture coin. The SPX whale reportedly scooped up $500,000 worth of AURA shortly before the rally, which may have caught the attention of other investors and helped fuel the frenzy. A few early investors have already cashed out. According to Lookonchain, one whale sold 2.87 million AURA tokens for a $104,000 profit, a 433% return on a $24,000 investment made about five months ago. You might also like: HYPE hits new ATH in 12% climb as whales bet big But while the gains look impressive, red flags are starting to surface. David, a known crypto scam analyst on X, warned that the rally might be part of an organized rug pull . In a June 11 post, he described AURA as a cleverly articulated scam run by insiders. David pointed out that AURA has been around since May 30, 2024, but has shown no signs of development or added utility since launch. He also noted that this isn’t the first time the token has pumped. AURA previously reached an all-time high market cap of $70 million before crashing to just $500,000 within two months, likely due to the founder pulling liquidity. On-chain data raises further suspicion. David highlighted that AURA’s token supply is tightly controlled, with top wallets holding large bundles of tokens. Most of these tokens weren’t bought on the open market but were transferred or split from other wallets, indicating possible insider coordination. Further, he flagged that many of these top holders are new and not long-term supporters, which makes the whole price action seem more like a setup than a genuine rally. “It’s not a utility token, so we can’t say insiders would know something – kind of partnership or anything like that,” he added. With no clear catalyst and rising concerns over manipulation, traders should proceed with caution. AURA was still trading 42.5% below its all-time high at press time, but its highly concentrated holder base leaves the token vulnerable to sharp downturns if major wallets choose to offload.

The new law, signed as Public Act 25-66 and effective October 1, bars the state and its political subdivisions from accepting payments in virtual currency or from purchasing, holding, investing in, or establishing a reserve of such currencies. The statute defines “virtual currency” as provided in section 36a-596 of Connecticut’s general statutes, a definition broad enough to cover most cryptocurrencies in use today. The bill passed unanimously through both chambers of the state legislature, signaling broad bipartisan consensus against state-sponsored virtual currency initiatives, including any form of a sovereign bitcoin reserve.

It requires businesses that deal in digital wallets or crypto kiosks to be licensed and to comply with strict financial safeguards, including 1:1 reserve backing for virtual currencies held on behalf of customers, detailed consumer risk disclosures, fraud protections, transaction limits, and receipt requirements. Connecticut’s move stands in stark contrast to the growing momentum in many other U.S. states, where legislatures are actively advancing bills to establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserves. According to the State Reserve Race tracker by Bitcoin Laws , Arizona and New Hampshire have fully enacted SBR bills into law, completing all legislative steps. Texas passed its bill through both chambers but have not yet finalized enactment, awaiting governor’s signature .

Powered by Across, the update removes technical hurdles on the platform to make trading easier. Users can now swap tokens between BNB Chain ( BNB ), Arbitrum ( ARB ), and Base ( BASE ) directly through the PancakeSwap interface, completing the process in a single transaction. To use the new Crosschain Swap feature, users can visit the PancakeSwap Swap page, choose a token and destination chain, and confirm the transaction. The interface then tracks all transaction history in one place for convenience. The update allows users to swap between tokens without needing to use bridges, external apps, or complex tools. If a token has liquidity on the platform, it’s eligible for swapping across chains right from the main interface. Powered by Across’ intent-based bridging system based on the open ERC-7683 intents standard , the update is designed to solve one of the biggest challenges plaguing the DeFi space today: interoperability . Across currently powers around 20% of bridging volume across supported chains, with over $23 billion in transfers and more than 16 million transactions completed. It uses a network of relayers and UMA’s optimistic oracle to ensure fast, secure, and cost-efficient transactions. You might also like: PancakeSwap’s daily trading volume rockets to $1.27b after SpringBoard launch As each chain remains isolated from one to another, liquidity is restricted, and moving assets often requires navigating a range of tools and platforms. These challenges result in slower transactions, higher costs, and added risks. “We’re solving a major DeFi pain point by giving users the freedom to move across chains with just one click – no bridges, no delays,” said Chef Kids, Head Chef at PancakeSwap. Co-founder of Across, Hart Lambur stated that the protocol’s intent-based infrastructure allows users the freedom to forego bridges altogether. They can interact with the platform as they normally do without thinking of the technical constraints. “PancakeSwap has one of the most intuitive interfaces in DeFi. With intents-based infrastructure, users don’t even have to think about bridging—it just works,” said Lambur.

According to DeFiLlama data on June 10, 2025, the total value locked on the Sui now sits at $1.96 billion. This marks an approximate 10% increase from the $1.77 range it maintained over the past week, bringing the protocol closer to regaining the $2 billion milestone achieved earlier this year.

Market analysts have also placed odds for a SUI ETF approval in 2025 at 60%, fueling the positive sentiment. Kevin Boon, the president of Sui’s founding team Mysten Labs, praised the development stating, “Looking back at our mainnet only two years ago, the milestone of a NASDAQ filing is a powerful moment. We are proud to help 21Shares build towards a world where every investor can access SUI.” Beyond the ETF speculation, multiple ecosystem-wide developments are also contributing to Sui’s rising TVL. For one, the network has seen an increase in Bitcoin-pegged assets, with around 10% of its locked value now held in tokens such as wBTC, LBTC, and stBTC. Additionally, Sui recently crossed a major liquidity threshold, with over $1 billion in stablecoins now circulating across its DeFi applications. Meanwhile, the native token of the protocol SUI ( SUI ) has been on a modest climb all week. At press time, it trades around $3.47, reflecting a 2% gain over the past 24 hours and approximately 7% over the last week.

Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon ( POL ), has been appointed CEO of the project’s foundation. The move aims to speed up decision-making amid increasing competition in the blockchain industry, Nailwal said in Bloomberg interview. He noted that before his appointment, the foundation’s institutionalized and decentralized decision-making had introduced “all sorts of slowness” into the operations. Additionally, Nailwal’s appointment stems from a growing unrest within the Ethereum ( ETH ) community regarding its strategy, which heavily depended on Layer 2 solutions like Polygon for scaling and growth.

Under Nailwal’s leadership, Polygon will focus in the near term on scaling AggLayer — Polygon’s interoperability layer that connects multiple blockchains — and expanding tools for digital payments and real-world asset integration. Everything else “will either be spun out or shut down,” Nailwal said. AggLayer version 0.3 is anticipated by the end of the year, with the foundation aiming to more prominently position the protocol under the Polygon brand. Additionally, the foundation has recently accelerated scaling efforts by launching the Agglayer Breakout Program , an incubator that supports projects building on AggLayer and Polygon’s PoS network by providing funding and resources. Several projects have already graduated from the program, most recently Katana Network, which launched its private mainnet on May 28 to boost liquidity and yield within the AggLayer ecosystem.

As investor confidence returns to the digital asset space, the timing couldn’t be more calculated, especially with President Donald Trump signaling strong support for the industry. Bullish Takes Another Shot at Going Public This isn’t Bullish’s first attempt to hit the public markets. The exchange tried to go public in 2021 through a SPAC merger, but that deal fell apart due to rising interest rates and a tougher market environment. Now, under the leadership of CEO Tom Farley, the former NYSE Group president, Bullish is making a fresh move. Investment bank Jefferies is handling the underwriting, but the company is keeping further details under wraps for now. The market conditions, however, look far more favorable than they did a few years ago. Institutional-First Crypto Exchange Launched in 2021 with a $300 million capital injection from Thiel’s Founders Fund and other top investors, Bullish was built for institutional traders rather than retail users. That focus gives it an edge in today’s maturing crypto landscape. The exchange is regulated in Gibraltar and designed to offer high-performance trading infrastructure with deep liquidity – qualities that institutions are increasingly seeking as they return to digital assets. Crypto IPOs Steal the Spotlight Recent successes make way for Bullish’s ambitions. Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, raised $1.1 billion in its debut last week, soaring 167% on day one. Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed for a U.S. listing on June 6 , while eToro hit Nasdaq under the ticker ETOR on May 14. A CoinMarketCap report from April 3 highlights crypto’s edge: tokens on major exchanges delivered an 80% average return on investment (ROI) over 180 days, outpacing Nasdaq (51%) and NYSE (54%) listings. Thiel’s Vision Meets Trump’s Crypto Push Peter Thiel has always seen Bullish as a core part of the evolving crypto revolution. Back in 2021, it was valued at $9 billion, and its institutional-grade platform gives it a strong shot at standing out. Now, with Trump backing clearer digital asset regulation and even hinting at a national Bitcoin reserve, momentum is building. Institutions are starting to shift their strategy, and crypto-friendly U.S. policies are making the market more attractive. For Bullish, that means the stars may finally be aligning for a successful IPO.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-11 12:12:06

The deal, announced late Tuesday, didn’t come with any clear terms or promises. Instead, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would be heading back to Washington to “make sure President Trump approves” the trade framework. That was it. No text. No timeline. Just a pitch to the president. The update came as investors also waited for May’s consumer inflation numbers, which are expected to land later this week. According to data from Reuters, futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.2%, Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 66 points. On the crypto side, Bitcoin and Ethereum didn’t move. Traders stayed cautious . There was no sense of relief, no excitement, just a deadpan market trying to figure out what this deal actually means. Currency traders hold off as inflation and bond auction loom The dollar did basically nothing. It dropped 0.1% against the euro at $1.1438, and rose 0.1% versus the yen, landing at 144.93. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, didn’t budge from 98.993. China’s yuan barely twitched, holding at 7.1849 per dollar in onshore trading. None of the big FX pairs moved enough to tell any story. That’s how little impact the London meeting had. Economists warned that even if Washington and China managed to avoid another round of open conflict, the tariffs that could result from this “deal” are likely to be worse than what was in place last year. And the data that’s currently available doesn’t even show the full damage from the last few rounds of threats and walk-backs. There’s more pain hiding in the pipeline. In the UK, traders are waiting on a spending review that could change the budget picture for the next decade. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is getting ready to allocate over £2 trillion (around $2.7 trillion) across departments from 2026 to 2029, with extra investment plans through 2030. The British pound stayed flat at $1.349, while gilt yields rose fast—up 7 basis points to 4.598%, compared to a 1 basis point rise in the U.S. 10-year Treasury, which reached 4.49%. Fed expected to pause again as investors eye inflation print The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at its next meeting. A poll by Reuters showed most analysts don’t expect the central bank to make any changes until September. Bond traders aren’t betting on July either. The mood is wait-and-see. Gold ticked up, but just slightly. Spot gold gained 0.4%, trading at $3,336.20 an ounce as of 09:46 GMT, while U.S. gold futures hit $3,347. That’s not a huge move, but it shows traders are still hedging against whatever might come from inflation or central bank action. One major event markets are bracing for is a $39 billion auction of 10-year Treasury notes later in the day. With so many concerns about the U.S. deficit and rising government debt, investors are demanding higher premiums for long-term bonds. Foreign demand is especially critical now, and if it doesn’t show up, yields could shoot higher fast. Right now, the 10-year Treasury yield is up by 2 basis points at 4.494%. The 2-year yield has surged 1.5 basis points to trade at 4.027%, and the 30-year yield climbed 2 basis points to 4.377%. The next big test is the U.S. CPI data for May, which could show the early effects of tariffs on consumer prices. The median forecast puts headline inflation up 0.2% and core inflation up 0.3%. That would push annual inflation to 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively. But anything hotter than that would kill off any lingering hope for a rate cut, and could trigger a sharp bond selloff. So far, markets aren’t betting on a cut in June or July, and current pricing shows about a 60% chance of a September move. But with trade policy still in limbo and inflation data still unknown, nobody’s taking big positions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The financial committee advanced the measure with a 32-19 vote, agriculture committee passed it with a 47-6 vote. Key highlights of the CLARITY Act It aims to resolve the longstanding jurisdiction conflict among the crypto regulatory agencies of the US by redefining the responsibilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It establishes that certain crypto assets will be regulated as commodities under the CFTC, while others will remain securities and operate under the SEC. The CLARITY Act also offers limited liability protection for blockchain developers , excluding them from money transmitter regulations. It also established the disclosure, fund segregation, and conflict of interest rules to protect the investors from crypto fraud. Maintaining Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the act establishes consumer safeguards for non-custodial wallet providers and peer-to-peer crypto transactions . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban Bitcoin and Crypto Investments , Despite broad support CLARITY ACT faces criticism Representative Maxine Waters voiced concerns while warning that certain provisions in the bill can lead to a conflict of interest. Her comment indicated the ties between political leaders and the crypto industry. Brad Sherman stated that the bill could lead to industry bailouts and regulatory arbitrage. Former CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad called the CLARITY Act ‘complex ’ while stating that the bill has expanded confusion rather than resolving the issues of crypto regulatory ambiguity. CFTC will lead crypto regulations After becoming the primary crypto regulator, CFTC will oversee digital commodities, covering most cryptocurrencies and tokens traded on cash markets, including DeFi activities. It will mandate the activities of exchanges, brokers, and spot markets for non-security digital assets like Binance and Ethereum. It will also mandate stablecoin trade and custody on a commodity exchange, while the SEC’s role is limited to enforcing anti-fraud rules in stablecoin. What’s next? Debate and vote on the CLARITY Act After seeking approval from both committees, the CLARITY Act will proceed to the full House for votes and arguments. And if it is ultimately enacted, then it will become the first comprehensive law in the US for a crypto and digital assets regulatory framework. While the US Senate remains uncertain, the upper chamber works on enhancing digital asset law. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The CLARITY Act will clarify roles by defining “digital commodities” (under CFTC oversight, including most cryptocurrencies and DeFi spot markets) and “investment contract assets” (under SEC, focusing on how assets are sold). What are the main concerns critics have about the CLARITY Act’s provisions? Critics worry about potential conflicts of interest, regulatory arbitrage (creating minimal utility blockchains for CFTC oversight), reduced financial safeguards, and the bill’s complexity hindering effective regulation. What role will CFTC and SEC play if the CLARITY Act is enacted? The CFTC will become the primary regulator for digital commodities, overseeing exchanges and brokers. The SEC will retain authority over investment contract offerings and enforce anti-fraud rules, particularly for stablecoins.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-11 12:15:36

Analyst Says It’s Almost Time for XRP to Explode,https://timestabloid.com/no-room-for-xrp-to-move-analyst-says-its-almost-time-for-xrp-to-explode/,"XRP may be on the brink of a major breakout, according to a new post from prominent technical analyst EGRAG Crypto . In a recent message shared on X, the analyst warned that XRP has “no room to move,” suggesting that the digital asset is nearing the end of its consolidation phase, and an explosive move is imminent. EGRAG’s post, which carried the message “Tick-Tock, MF’s! #Bears”, has stirred speculation within the XRP community. Though he didn’t predict the direction of the next move, the message was clear: XRP is coiling tightly and about to snap, either to the upside or downside. A Technical Pressure Cooker EGRAG Crypto is well known for his in-depth XRP chart analysis, often identifying macro structures and key breakout zones. In this case, he points to a compression pattern, where XRP’s price has been trading within a narrowing range. This typically signals that the asset is preparing for a sharp move as supply and demand reach equilibrium. #XRP — Tick-Tock, MF’s! #Bears : No Room to Move, So It’s Almost Time to Explode! The big question? Will it break to the downside or skyrocket upside? By now, you know I’m a #PERMABULL . So, what do you think comes next? Drop your predictions below! pic.twitter.com/bNVSTWkcYS — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 11, 2025 The formation resembles past price setups seen in XRP’s history, where consolidation gave way to sudden volatility. A similar squeeze occurred before XRP’s rallies in 2020 and 2021. Now, with price action once again tightening, many traders are preparing for a repeat, though no one can say with certainty which direction it will go. EGRAG’s message underscores one central theme: timing. With limited room for sideways movement, XRP’s breakout window is rapidly approaching. Legal Uncertainty Nears Resolution Beyond the charts, a major factor contributing to XRP’s muted price action has been the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While Judge Analisa Torres ruled in July 2023 that XRP is not a security in secondary markets, the case has remained open due to unresolved penalty issues. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In April 2025, Ripple and the SEC submitted a proposed settlement, which was rejected by Judge Torres for procedural reasons. A corrected filing is expected by June 16 , and the final resolution could prove decisive for XRP’s near-term price movement. A favorable ruling or settlement could provide the clarity institutions have long awaited, potentially unlocking suppressed demand. This legal backdrop makes the timing of EGRAG’s post all the more significant. If the technical breakout aligns with a positive court outcome, XRP could gain significant momentum. Clock Is Ticking While no one can predict market moves with certainty, the message from EGRAG Crypto is hard to ignore : XRP is running out of space, and pressure is mounting. Whether that leads to a breakout rally or a breakdown remains to be seen, but the days of sideways drift may soon be behind us. For traders and investors alike, this could be the moment to pay close attention, both to the charts and the courtroom. One way or another, XRP’s next move could reshape its trajectory for the rest of the year. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With several technical factors aligning at this level, the possibility of a bullish expansion toward $4.70 is emerging, but confirmation is critical before this scenario can play out. As Ripple ( XRP ) continues to move within a high-timeframe ascending channel, the asset is now testing a critical support zone that could define its next major direction. Technical confluence between Fibonacci levels, historical market structure, and key volume nodes is forming a compelling case for a potential rally, if buyers can confirm support in the coming weeks. Key technical points Approaching Channel Support: XRP is retesting the low of its long-standing trading channel, an area that has historically provided major reversals. Multiple Confluences Align: Support aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, the value area low, and a higher low structure on the macro chart. Bullish Expansion Possible: I f support holds, price could rotate toward the channel high, projecting a target near $4.70. XRPUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP has been consolidating within a high-timeframe ascending channel that has consistently dictated price direction over the past few years. Each major move, whether bullish or bearish, has respected the channel’s boundaries. Price is now revisiting channel support, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a historically significant zone of demand. You might also like: Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal takes over as Foundation CEO to fast-track AggLayer expansion Also overlapping this region is the value area low, the lower boundary of the high-volume trading range — along with a higher low on the macro chart. These overlapping technical factors suggest that this area could act as a launchpad if buyers step in with conviction. However, the bullish thesis remains unconfirmed unless support is clearly validated in the coming sessions. If support holds and buyers reclaim initiative, historical price behavior suggests XRP could rotate aggressively toward the channel high. This level has repeatedly served as a rejection point and now aligns with $4.70, a technical target based on the channel’s structure and previous rally dynamics. What to expect in the coming price action XRP is at a pivotal point within its high-timeframe market structure. A confirmed hold above current support could open the door to a bullish expansion toward $4.70. Until that confirmation occurs, price may continue to consolidate within the broader accumulation range while the market awaits a definitive breakout catalyst.

Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) shows a significant uptick from previous lows of $0.5588, touching as high as $0.6272. XTZ has also recorded a 3% gain in the last 24 hours—the current momentum surfaces as the price crosses key Fibonacci levels with bullish MACD and RSI signals. XTZ price chart Will Tezos recover?

Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos activates its 18th protocol upgrade, Rio, at block #8,767,488.

The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit.

A prime example is Glean, a startup that has just announced a major funding round, pushing its valuation into the billions. This news underscores the massive capital flowing into artificial intelligence, a sector many believe will reshape industries just as blockchain technology aims to redefine finance. What’s Driving Glean AI’s Massive Valuation? Glean, a company focused on providing AI-powered solutions for enterprises, recently completed a substantial Startup Funding round. The company announced a $150 million Series F raise. This funding was led by Wellington Management, a significant player in the investment world. The most striking detail from this announcement is the resulting AI valuation . The Series F round places Glean’s value at an impressive $7.2 billion. This represents a rapid escalation in value over a short period, signaling strong market belief in Glean’s technology and growth trajectory. Consider the timeline of Glean’s growth: Early 2024: Valuation at $2.2 billion. September 2024: Series E raised $260 million, valuation reached $4.6 billion. June 2025: Series F raised $150 million, valuation soared to $7.2 billion. Since early 2024 alone, Glean has raised a total of $610 million, demonstrating consistent investor confidence and rapid scaling. How Does Glean AI Serve Enterprises? Glean’s core offering revolves around enhancing productivity within large organizations. Their platform allows enterprise employees to use natural language queries, powered by large language models (LLMs), to search across disparate corporate documents and applications. Imagine seamlessly finding information buried within systems like Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, or Zendesk using simple conversational prompts. Beyond just search, Glean is also developing AI agent products, further expanding its utility within the enterprise ecosystem. This focus on practical, application-layer AI solutions appears to be resonating strongly with businesses looking to leverage AI for tangible productivity gains. Who is Investing in This Enterprise AI Growth? The recent Series F round saw participation from a mix of new and existing investors, highlighting broad support for Glean’s vision and performance. Wellington Management led the round, a significant endorsement. Other investors included prominent names in Venture Capital and strategic corporate investment arms: Khosla Ventures Bicycle Capital Geodesic Capital Archerman Capital Existing investors like Altimeter, Capital One Ventures, Citi, Coatue, DST Global, General Catalyst, ICONIQ, IVP, Kleiner Perkins, Latitude Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures, and Sequoia Capital. The continued participation of many previous investors speaks volumes about the company’s execution and future prospects. This diverse group of backers provides Glean with significant capital and strategic expertise. Achieving Rapid Scale: $100M ARR Milestone One key metric underpinning Glean’s high valuation is its reported revenue growth. The company announced it surpassed $100 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in its last fiscal year. Achieving this milestone just three years after launching is a remarkable feat in the enterprise software space and a strong indicator of market adoption and product-market fit. This rapid revenue scaling is a major factor attracting significant Startup Funding . What Does Glean’s Success Mean for the AI Market? Glean’s journey from a $2.2 billion valuation to $7.2 billion in just over a year is a powerful narrative about the current state of the AI market. It demonstrates: High Demand for Enterprise AI: Businesses are actively seeking and investing in AI tools that can improve efficiency and access to information. Investor Confidence: Despite broader economic uncertainties, investors are willing to commit substantial capital to AI companies showing strong growth and clear product value. Rapid Value Creation: The speed at which companies like Glean can scale and increase their valuation is unprecedented in many other tech sectors. While not directly tied to cryptocurrency, the trajectory of companies like Glean highlights the broader trend of disruptive technologies attracting massive investment and achieving rapid adoption. Understanding these dynamics in related tech sectors can provide valuable context for trends within the crypto space. In Conclusion Glean’s successful Series F round and subsequent $7.2 billion valuation mark a significant moment for the Enterprise AI sector. The company’s rapid growth, strong revenue performance, and ability to attract top-tier Venture Capital underscore the immense potential and current boom in AI technologies aimed at improving workplace productivity. As AI continues to evolve, expect to see more companies like Glean achieving impressive milestones and valuations, further solidifying AI’s role as a transformative technology.

Dubbed Bitcoin Core 30, the upgrade removes the long-standing 80-byte OP_RETURN limit , allowing up to 4MB of data to be embedded in transactions. Supporters say this change improves how Bitcoin handles metadata, enabling use cases like NFTs and tokenized documents to be directly on-chain. Critics, however, worry that the move undermines Bitcoin’s original ethos as a peer-to-peer monetary system and fear it could accelerate network bloat, leading to further centralization. NEW: Bitcoin Core devs are shaking up the scene, pushing for a bold OP_RETURN data storage limit increase to 4MB by October. This hot topic's sparked a fiery debate among the Bitcoin fam. Brace for impact! Source: https://t.co/SKYPJE9u3O — Web Weavers (@WebWeaversHub) June 10, 2025 While developer Gloria Zhao argues the update formalizes what miners are already doing, detractors claim the change lacks sufficient consensus. One community member went so far as to call it “a disgraceful precedent,” citing inadequate transparency and stakeholder involvement. Whether it’s an innovation or a deviation remains to be seen, but the October fork is now locked in, and the market is watching closely. Bitcoin Technical Setup Supports $112K Breakout Despite the controversy, the Bitcoin price prediction remains resilient, as BTC is currently trading at $109,717, up 0.04% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $2.18 trillion and a volume of over $52.9 billion.

Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Price recently bounced off $108,910, a key horizontal level, and is now consolidating below the $110,568 resistance. The MACD indicator is flat but not bearish, while neutral candlesticks suggest the price is coiling ahead of a breakout. If price clears $110,568 with substantial volume, targets include: $112,000 : Next resistance in the current range $113,500 : Upper boundary of the ascending channel On the downside, losing $108,900 could open room for a drop to $106,960. Until then, bulls remain in control of the trend. Long-Term Metrics Reinforce Bullish Outlook Market internals paint a more robust picture. Realized capitalization, a key measure of long-term holder conviction, reached an all-time high of $934.88 billion on June 7, despite prices ranging between $102,000 and $106,000. This suggests that long-term investors are accumulating, rather than selling, even in the face of policy uncertainty. Bitcoin Hits $110K, Altcoins Surge, and Regulatory Moves Shape Crypto Landscape On June 10, 2025, the crypto market is buzzing! Bitcoin briefly soared to $110,277.93, a 1.38% jump, before settling at $109,449, with the total crypto market cap reaching $3.41 trillion. Ethereum… — ARG#3Crypto (@Illogicalmind24) June 10, 2025 Moreover, the total crypto market cap soared by $50 billion on June 9, reclaiming the $2.14 trillion mark following a clean double-bottom pattern. This, combined with constant inflows and robust on-chain activity, indicates that whales and institutions stay confident. Conclusion Bitcoin’s upcoming Core 30 upgrade is dividing opinion but not derailing price. The technical setup is bullish, long-term investors are holding, and market inflows remain strong. If Bitcoin clears $110,568, a run toward $113,500 is well within reach, even with October’s fork looming.

In the first phase , $1.8 billion was repaid. However, according to the FTX Creditor and Customer Ad-Hoc Committee , an estimated $2.2 billion worth of claims still remain unresolved. On June 11, committee member Sunil shared updates on X (formerly Twitter), noting: “Current allowed claims: $7.5B.Total estimated allowed claims: $10.6B.30% of allowed claims are disputed—legit claims will be allowed.” He added that FTX currently holds $6.5 billion in reserves for upcoming distributions. Cross-Border Repayments Expand with Payoneer In a key update, FTX has added Payoneer as a repayment partner, alongside BitGo and Kraken , to distribute funds to creditors. Payoneer supports cross-border payments in over 190 countries , improving reach for retail customers in eligible regions. However, countries like China, Russia, Nigeria, and Egypt remain excluded from repayment , delaying future disbursement timelines until a compliant payment provider is found for these regions. KYC Verification Issues Trouble FTX Creditors A growing number of users are raising concerns about FTX’s KYC (Know Your Customer) process , which many say has become unnecessarily strict and difficult to complete. One user, Sal Wals , posted: “I’ve been asked for multiple evidence of my source income. I feel like I’m on trial.” Others have echoed similar concerns, citing delays and a lack of response from support. What’s Next for FTX Creditors? The ongoing issues— disputed claims, KYC bottlenecks , and cross-border distribution limitations —highlight critical gaps in FTX’s global repayment strategy .While some investors remain optimistic about a potential liquidity boost if repayments resume smoothly, many continue to question the platform’s transparency and governance in handling creditor claims. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

How do KYC issues affect FTX creditors’ ability to receive payments? Strict and difficult KYC verification processes can block creditors from receiving repayments. FTX requires extensive documentation, and delays or non-compliance can lead to claims being deemed ineligible or expunged. What impact will adding Payoneer have on cross-border FTX repayments? Adding Payoneer significantly expands FTX’s reach for retail customers, enabling repayments in over 190 countries.

A partnership between the two web3 entertainment giants has broken new ground for interoperability while giving Pudgy holders something to celebrate. All Pudgy holders – as well as those of spin-off collections Lil Pudgys and and Pudgy Rods – have been given a piece of the pie in the new landmass that’s taking shape in MNA. Pudgies Reach Escape Velocity Having started life as a PFP collection of 8,888 NFTs, Pudgy Penguins have defied the odds to become a cultural phenomenon. Not only have they transcended crypto, gracing the shelves of Walmart stores in the form of cuddly toys, but they’ve also jumped chains, making it across multiple ecosystems and arriving on new shores intact. But the Lummelunda archipelago is the furthest they’ve swum, and here within the MNA universe, they might have found their forever home. A lot of work has been put in behind the scenes to complete the Pudgy-MNA integration including porting tens of thousands of penguins complete with their exact traits over to Alice land. As a result, holders of the precious NFTs will be able to step into a world in which their trusty companion is recreated right down to the last little detail. Quests, Crafts, and Winter Wonders While cross-chain web3 collaborations aren’t unusual, the MNA-Pudgy collab has an attention to detail that’s unlike anything seen before. No less than 8,888 Pudgy Penguins, 22,222 Lil Pudgys, and 7,399 Pudgy Rods Collections will be integrated into My Neighbor Alice, with each character faithfully brought to life. Aside from the prospect of being able to take their penguin for a waddle through the Pudgy Land that’s springing to life within MNA, holders will be able to complete exclusive quests and craft exclusive items that they can elect to keep or to sell to other players on the built-in marketplace. While all MNA players are welcome to roam the island world including its new frosty winter wonderland, Pudgy holders will be entitled to prime perks – something to which they’ve grown accustomed without growing complacent. The partnership has been inked at an ideal time for My Neighbour Alice especially, which is preparing to kick off Chapter One: A New Beginning on June 17. Having the industry’s largest IP brand onboard is a major coup that will bring fresh attention to MNA while simultaneously extending the utility of the Pudgy collections. With Pudgy Penguins also preparing to make their gaming debut in the form of Pudgy Party, developed by rising web3 studio Mythical Games, the penguins are showing no signs of letting up. And in My Neighbor Alive, they’ve found a vibrant community that’s only too willing to welcome them with open arms. From Pudgy-themed emotes to the recreation of 40,000 items as native 3D assets, the partnership is more than just a box-ticking exercise: it carries real weight that will open the door for further IP integrations within the expanding Alice universe.

Small and medium-sized businesses are also showing enthusiasm, with 81% expressing interest. This rise in adoption is mirrored by skyrocketing usage metrics, with $27.6 trillion in stablecoin volume recorded in 2024. Meanwhile, global financial giants like Société Générale have launched their own stablecoins, and retail shops in Bolivia are pricing goods in USDT. Still, concerns linger over issuer transparency, particularly with Tether. Overall, regulatory clarity and trust in issuers will be key to mainstream adoption. Stablecoin Interest Triples Among Fortune 500 Interest in stablecoins among businesses is growing rapidly, according to Coinbase’s newly released State of Crypto report . The data reveals that almost 29% of executives from Fortune 500 companies said their firms are either planning to use or are interested in using stablecoins. This is a dramatic rise from just 8% in 2024. (Source: Coinbase ) The threefold increase in enthusiasm is largely driven by a desire to overcome the challenges that are associated with traditional payment systems, including slow processing times and high transaction fees. While only 7% of Fortune 500 respondents said their companies currently hold or use stablecoins, the trend is mirrored even more strongly among small and medium-sized businesses. Of 251 financial decision-makers surveyed from companies with fewer than 500 employees, 81% expressed interest in using stablecoins, up from 61% the previous year. Additionally, almost half of those surveyed expect to adopt some form of crypto in the next three years. Coinbase attributes this uptick in interest to a shared belief that stablecoins can resolve certain financial pain points. These include faster and cheaper remittance solutions, reduced fees for payment processing, improved payroll efficiency, inflation resistance, and better financial infrastructure for underserved populations. (Source: Coinbase ) Backing up the sentiment is a surge in stablecoin usage. Monthly organic transfer volumes peaked at $719 billion in December of 2024 and again reached $717 billion in April of 2025. Over the full year of 2024, total stablecoin volume reached $27.6 trillion. This was more than the combined processing volume of Visa and Mastercard. The number of stablecoin holders also surpassed 161 million in May of 2025, outnumbering the total users of America’s top four mobile banking apps. The growing interest isn’t limited to private firms. Uber’s CEO recently revealed that the company is exploring the use of stablecoins to optimize global money transfers. Internationally, governments and financial institutions are also getting involved. Russia’s finance ministry proposed a state-backed stablecoin in April, while three major entities in Abu Dhabi collaborated to launch a new dirham-pegged stablecoin. Stablecoins Safer Than Banks? Stablecoins may offer a safer alternative to traditional bank deposits. This is according to Diogo Monica, general partner at Haun Ventures. At the Proof of Talk conference in Paris, Monica explained that many stablecoins are backed by reserves held at globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) or in short-term US Treasury bills. This structure, he argued, makes them more secure than deposits held at commercial banks, which are considered liabilities of the bank and may be at risk if the institution fails and deposit insurance does not fully cover the loss. Monica's point rests on the idea that a stablecoin represents a claim on high-quality collateral, rather than on the solvency of a potentially unstable regional bank. However, he also acknowledged that stablecoins come with their own unique risks, largely stemming from the actions and trustworthiness of the issuers themselves. Tether, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has long been at the center of debates around transparency and risk. One of the most memorable incidents occurred in 2018 when Bitfinex, a crypto exchange closely tied to Tether, lost access to $850 million through its payment processor, Crypto Capital. To cover the shortfall, Tether lent at least $625 million of its reserves to Bitfinex without publicly disclosing the transaction or the exchange’s liquidity issues. At the time, this left Tether only 74% backed by cash and equivalents, according to court documents and an affidavit that was filed in 2019. Bitfinex eventually repaid the debt, completing the transfer of the final $550 million in early 2021. (Source: Tether ) Despite these events, Tether has not yet undergone a full independent audit. Although the company issued reserve attestations and claims to be working with a Big Four accounting firm, no formal audit has been released. This lack of transparency continues to concern people in the crypto community. Justin Bons , founder of Cyber Capital, described Tether in late 2024 as “one of the biggest existential threats to crypto,” and criticized its reserve disclosures as inadequate and lacking the rigor of a proper third-party audit. While stablecoins may be underpinned by stronger collateral than traditional bank deposits, the safety they offer ultimately hinges on the credibility and openness of the entities behind them. Société Générale Launches USD Stablecoin Meanwhile, Société Générale-Forge, the crypto division of French banking giant Société Générale, launched a new US dollar-pegged stablecoin called USD CoinVertible (USDCV). The stablecoin will be issued on both Ethereum and Solana, with Bank of New York Mellon acting as the custodian for the underlying assets. This launch follows the company’s euro-pegged stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), which was introduced in April of 2023 for institutional clients. According to Société Générale-Forge CEO Jean-Marc Stenger, the introduction of a USD counterpart was a natural progression given the accelerating adoption of stablecoins in global markets. The main goal of the newly launched USDCV is to offer round-the-clock fiat-to-digital currency conversions, supporting real-time settlement in both dollars and euros. The stablecoin is designed for multiple applications, including crypto trading, cross-border payments, foreign exchange, onchain settlement, and collateral management. Both USDCV and EURCV will be accessible to institutional, corporate, and retail clients via brokers and payment service providers, though they will not be available to users based in the United States. Trading for USDCV is expected to commence in July. Stablecoins are gaining traction globally as regulatory environments evolve and adoption increases. In South Korea, new legislation could soon enable the domestic issuance of stablecoins, as part of a campaign promise from President Lee Jae-myung. In the United States, pending regulation is reportedly motivating companies like Apple, X, and Airbnb to explore stablecoin integration. Meanwhile, stablecoin usage is also expanding organically in emerging markets. In Bolivia, retail shops have started displaying prices in Tether’s USDT, fueled by local banks offering USDT custody services. Major global firms like Stripe are also investigating stablecoin use cases, particularly in the context of lowering cross-border transaction costs and streamlining international payments.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-11 13:31:14

While ETH has maintained key levels recently, the growing divergence between price movement and futures open interest is raising eyebrows. With macro uncertainty easing and altcoin narratives slowly rotating back into the spotlight, ETH is setting up for a potential directional move—but it remains to be seen whether that’s to the upside or downside. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Ethereum continues to consolidate just below the $2,800 resistance zone after reclaiming the 200-day moving average yesterday. The price has been hovering within a narrow range, caught between the key resistance area around $2,800 and the $2,500 demand zone. It has also been creating a tight ascending channel pattern below $2,800, which is usually a reversal pattern if broken to the downside. However, a bullish breakout from this pattern could invalidate the reversal and add fuel to a potential rally higher. The RSI also chart remains stable around the 60 level, indicating there’s still room for upward movement before the asset enters overbought territory. But without a convincing break above $2,800, the move could still be classified as a range rather than a trend continuation. If $2,500 gives way, and the channel is broken to the downside, a deeper pullback into the $2,100-$2,200 imbalance zone becomes increasingly likely, especially as resting liquidity remains uncollected there. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in on the 4H timeframe, ETH’s price action inside the ascending channel becomes clear. This pattern has formed after an almost vertical impulse move from the $1,800 region, which left behind noticeable imbalances that are yet to be filled. There is also a Fair Value Gap formed around the $2,600 level, which is now acting as short-term support. This area is key for the buyers to defend if they want to preserve the current market structure. So far, the asset has attacked the higher trendline of the channel multiple times, but each retest is coming with decreasing bullish momentum. Moreover, the RSI is printing lower highs while the price holds steady, suggesting a potential bearish divergence is forming. If confirmed, this could lead to a drop back to the lower boundary of the channel and even a potential breakdown, sending ETH toward the $2,350 liquidity pool or even deeper into the imbalance zone around $2,000. For a bullish breakout, ETH must clear $2,800 with strength and continuation, ideally backed by volume and liquidation flow to fuel the rally. Sentiment Analysis By ShayanMarkets One of the most notable shifts in recent days has been in Ethereum’s open interest (OI). As shown in the chart, the metric has hit a new high of over $21.7B across all exchanges, despite the ETH price still sitting below recent highs. This creates a clear divergence: OI is climbing aggressively while price remains relatively muted. This kind of divergence often precedes sharp volatility, either in the form of a liquidation flush or a breakout squeeze. Simply put, the market is heavily positioned, but the price isn’t validating the buildup. This scenario can lead to two outcomes. If ETH breaks above key resistance, the heavy open interest could fuel a rapid short squeeze and continuation rally. On the flip side, if the price fails to reclaim $2,800 soon and loses $2,500 support, a cascade of long liquidations could kick in, potentially wiping out recent bullish leverage. Traders should prepare for an expansion move soon, as compression between rising OI and flat price is rarely sustainable. It’s a volatility trap waiting to spring. Timing it right will be critical for short-term positioning.

This renewed scrutiny follows rising public frustration over inconsistent crypto enforcement and a growing call from lawmakers for a fair and transparent regulatory framework. The development was recently highlighted in a post by crypto commentator Xaif in an X community. Xaif outlined a striking timeline: in 2018, the SEC publicly said ETH wasn’t a security . By 2023, the agency dodged direct questions on Ethereum’s status. Now, in 2025, pressure is mounting for answers. “Transparency is coming,” Xaif noted, as Congress demands internal SEC documents that could shed light on this regulatory double standard. Ethereum’s 2018 Regulatory Pass The controversy dates back to June 2018, when William Hinman, then Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, declared in a now-infamous speech that ETH was “sufficiently decentralized” and did not qualify as a security. Though never adopted as official SEC policy, this statement heavily influenced market perception and regulatory treatment of Ethereum. BREAKING: ETH got a free pass. XRP got sued. Congress now demands SEC docs on why ETH was cleared while XRP was targeted. 2018: SEC says ETH isn’t a security 2023: SEC dodges ETH questions 2025: Time for answers. Transparency is coming. #XRP #ETHGate #Ripple #Crypto … pic.twitter.com/A7Hw1rLaai — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 11, 2025 However, during the Ripple case, documents revealed through court discovery showed that Hinman’s speech was controversial within the SEC. Internal emails and memos revealed staff concerns over applying a “decentralization” test and questioned whether Hinman’s analysis had a sound legal basis. Despite this internal conflict, the SEC took no enforcement action against Ethereum, and the market moved forward with the assumption that ETH was in the clear. This perceived leniency has since been dubbed the “ETH free pass” by crypto observers—a term capturing what many see as selective enforcement. Ripple’s Legal Battle Ripple didn’t get the same treatment. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs and two of its executives, claiming they sold XRP as an unregistered security. The lawsuit rocked the crypto world and sparked a broader debate about regulatory overreach. Ripple fought back in court, and in July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP itself is not a security when traded on public exchanges. The decision was seen as a major victory for Ripple and the industry. A proposed settlement between Ripple and the SEC followed in late 2024 but was rejected by Judge Torres on procedural grounds. A revised settlement is expected by June 16, 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Throughout the case, Ripple’s leadership questioned why Ethereum had been spared, despite similar token distribution models and early fundraising tactics. CEO Brad Garlinghouse and others pointed to the lack of regulatory clarity and the damage done by enforcement-first policies. Congress Demands Clarity Now, lawmakers want answers. Congress has formally requested that the SEC release all internal communications and documents related to its decision not to pursue enforcement against Ethereum. This includes any drafts or deliberations tied to Hinman’s 2018 speech, applications of the Howey Test, and any potential external influence on the agency’s posture. The inquiry signals rising dissatisfaction with the SEC’s inconsistent approach to crypto. With momentum building behind legislative reforms and stablecoin regulation in 2025, this push for transparency could be a turning point in how digital assets are governed in the U.S. As Xaif aptly put it: “2018: SEC says ETH isn’t a security. 2023: SEC dodges ETH questions. 2025: Time for answers.” The era of regulatory ambiguity may finally be coming to an end.

Bitcoin,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794054-gamestop-positive-cash-flows-andbitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary GameStop has significantly improved its cash position and reduced debt, strengthening its financial stability. Q1 results highlight material operational improvements in the cash flow, yet still a shrinking business. The company’s recent accumulation of Bitcoin puts it in a similar camp as MSTR now, vying for ""BTC yield."" Despite some positive aspects to Q1's results, I remain cautious about the long-term outlook with its crypto focus. When I covered GameStop ( GME ) last August, I spoke to its strong cash position, as well as, efforts to eliminate debt and mitigate cash burn in its surviving brick-and-mortar retail business. Impressively, GME has made material improvements, visible in Q1's results that came out on Tuesday. Curiously, the accumulation of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a new part of this story. In fact, it may just be the story now. Given the development, the premium to book value, and the trickiness in finding a discount for a soon-to-be crypto portfolio, I rate the stock a Hold. Summary of Previous Thesis Last time, I talked about the situation with GameStop's declining, brick-and-mortar business. Screenshot from previous thesis While revenue decline had stabilized, GameStop still had a cash burn problem. With the 2021 short squeeze providing essential capital, they were able to retire their debt and shift from interest expense to some interest income off of the $1 billion they had leftover. Ultimately, I concluded: The fundamentals show a tale of decline, and there's no obvious strategy to steer this company toward sustainable, positive cash flows. Unless a huge discount opens the door to some cigar-butt investing, I don't see GME being investable. Q1's Financial Results The first thing to mention with GameStop's Q1 2025 results is that they achieved free cash flow, compared to the prior-year quarter. Cash Flow Statement (Q1 2025 Earnings Release) This was achieved by finally generating positive operating cash flows. Generally speaking, this would be a sign that the ship has righted itself. Balance Sheet (Q1 2025 Earnings Release) For example, much of this simply entails monetization of inventories, which were also down YoY. Similarly, not the rise in assets held for sale. GameStop is continuing to shrink the business, selling its weaker assets to reduce cost, such as all of those in Canada . Balance Sheet (Q1 2025 Earnings Release) This is further evidenced by the YoY decline in property & equipment, as well as lease right-of-use assets. While the cash flow statement alone suggests free cash flow in the range of $600M to $700M is possible annually, this isn't sustainable for a retailer with a shrinking balance sheet of inventories and retail locations. Some may also have noticed that cash grew from the $1B I mentioned last time to over $6.3B currently. Obviously, this level of cash flow didn't create that much extra. The increase mostly owes itself to ATM offerings that occurred later in 2024, and that is something that deserves its own focus. Capital Raises and Bitcoin While the company made a series of ATM equity offerings over the last several months, the intentions for these offerings were not clear, merely described as being for general corporate purposes, such as acquisitions and investments. In March, their intentions to purchase BTC were announced, with a confirmation in the link I provided earlier indicated that 4,710 BTC had been purchased. BTC 6M Price History (Seeking Alpha) They did not disclose their cost basis per BTC, and this was not disclosed with Q1 results, as it occurred in the second quarter. Market prices at the time suggest that as much as $490M was spent on this, indicating that much more cash exists for future purchases. Cash Flow Statement (Q1 2025 Earnings Release) One thing that does appear is cash raised from a private convertible debt offering . The issue bears no interest, effectively an equity investment with the principal recoverable to the investor. The announcement came with more clear intentions than the ATM offerings of 2024: purchase of BTC. As this was only about a third of the offering, it stands to reason that more yet will be purchased. MSTR Q1 2025 Presentation This is a technique we've seen elsewhere. Strategy ( MSTR ), under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has developed the method of using his company's own stock as a form of leverage to purchase BTC, in order to generate enhanced returns that he calls ""BTC yield."" The slide above describes the use of convertible issues to accomplish this. MSTR Q1 2025 Presentation Strategy even seems to have given GameStop an official nod for doing so, acknowledging them in their Q1 2024 investor presentation. I've covered MSTR as well. In my February thesis (titled, It Just Doesn't Make Sense ) I questioned the reasoning behind this approach. With MSTR trading at a premium to its BTC portfolio's value, I wondered why investors looking for crypto would purchase it, instead of the BTC outright. While I can kind of see the argument from Strategy's perspective, using their equity as a form of leverage, this also just adding to the risk of holding BTC. In that piece, I concluded: Without a source of earnings...to support this BTC accumulation, it's not clear why those who believe in BTC would aim for MSTR instead of buying the BTC directly. It just doesn't make sense to me. While GameStop does have earnings, for now, in the form of free cash flow, it seems increasingly likely that this won't last, and so the thesis for GME is effectively the same as that of MSTR now. Valuation With that said, we're looking at a market cap of about $13B for $30 per share recently. This compares to a balance sheet with common equity of about $6.5B, if we ignore the convertible debt balance and just assume it converts. Fully diluted, therefore, book value per share should be about $13. Similar to MSTR, GME trades at a premium to its balance sheet, which will soon consist of BTC holdings to a large degree, without any indications that organic earnings will grow to contribute to this upside. That isn't saying that earnings growth won't occur, but if one takes the assets plus potential earnings, I think the best we can say is that GME is fairly valued. There's not a discount before with these financials. Conclusion When I wrote last year, I didn't expect GME to start mimicking the peculiar approach of Michael Saylor, but I guess it's another thing to make 2025 an interesting year. Even if they achieve ""BTC yield"" exactly as Saylor has for MSTR, growth is priced in, and folks believing in Bitcoin (and wanting the benefit of its liquidity) might just do better buying it directly. For that reason, I consider GME a Hold.",GME,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-11 13:39:54
45798875,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=167801,1749649209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45798875.jpeg,Apple AI Stumbles: Benchmarks Reveal Underperformance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/apple-ai-stumbles-benchmarks/,"BitcoinWorld Apple AI Stumbles: Benchmarks Reveal Underperformance In the fast-evolving world of technology, where advancements often ripple across markets, including the digital asset space, news from major players like Apple is always significant. Recently, Apple announced updates to the Apple Intelligence features powered by its latest AI models. However, internal company benchmarks reveal a surprising reality: these new models appear to underperform compared to established rivals, raising questions about Apple’s position in the intense Generative AI race. Decoding Apple AI Benchmarks Apple shared insights into the performance of its updated AI models through a blog post. The results, based on human evaluations, painted a picture that wasn’t quite as dominant as one might expect from the tech giant. Apple On-Device Model: This model runs locally on devices like the iPhone. Apple stated that human testers rated its text generation quality as “comparably” good to, but not better than, text from similarly sized models from Google and Alibaba. This model is roughly 3 billion parameters in size. Apple Server Model: This more powerful model operates in Apple’s data centers. Testers rated its performance behind OpenAI’s GPT-4o, a model that has been available for over a year. Image Analysis: In tests evaluating image understanding, human raters preferred Meta’s Llama 4 Scout model over the Apple Server model. This is notable because Llama 4 Scout has, in other tests, performed worse than leading models from companies like Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI. These AI benchmarks suggest that while Apple is making progress, it may still be playing catch-up in certain areas of Generative AI development. What Do These AI Benchmarks Mean? The benchmark results lend support to earlier reports suggesting that Apple’s AI research efforts have faced challenges in keeping pace with competitors. Apple’s AI capabilities have sometimes been perceived as less advanced in recent years, and a significant planned upgrade to its voice assistant, Siri, has reportedly been delayed indefinitely. The company has even faced lawsuits from customers alleging that it marketed AI features that were not yet delivered. While the benchmarks show areas where Apple’s models lag, it’s important to note the capabilities Apple highlights for its new Apple AI models: Apple On-Device: Powers features like summarization and text analysis. Both Models: Boast improved tool-use and efficiency compared to their predecessors. Language Support: Can understand around 15 languages. Training Data: Benefited from an expanded dataset including images, PDFs, documents, manuscripts, infographics, tables, and charts. Accessing Apple AI Models for Developers For developers, access to these new capabilities is opening up. As of a recent announcement, third-party developers can utilize the Apple On-Device model via Apple’s Foundation Models framework. This allows integration of features like summarization and text analysis into third-party applications, potentially enabling new functionalities within the Apple ecosystem. The Challenge Ahead in Generative AI The field of Generative AI is intensely competitive, with rapid advancements happening across the industry. Companies are investing heavily in research, development, and infrastructure to build ever more capable AI Models. Apple’s benchmark results underscore the significant challenge involved in not just developing advanced AI but also in surpassing the performance of models already in the market from dedicated AI labs and tech rivals. While Apple has a strong ecosystem and user base, success in Apple Intelligence will ultimately depend on the perceived quality and utility of its AI features, which are directly tied to the performance of its underlying AI models. The path to leading the Generative AI race appears to require substantial continued effort and innovation for Apple. Summary: A Reality Check for Apple AI Apple’s latest AI benchmarks present a candid view of its progress in artificial intelligence. While the company is integrating AI deeply into its operating systems and offering developer access, its new AI models are currently performing comparably to or behind older models from competitors like OpenAI, Google, Alibaba, and Meta in key tests. This highlights the significant hurdles Apple faces in catching up in the competitive Generative AI landscape and delivering on the full promise of Apple Intelligence features.

Amid this volatility in the crypto, it could be a perfect opportunity to secure your crypto investments in anticipation of the next bull run. There are plenty of opportunities in the crypto market, with some that could deliver 10x gains. Here is a full list of crypto projects you should seriously look into. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is a project that went live in 2020. One of its main benefits is its ability to support many transactions per second. First conceptualized in 2017, it came to life nearly 3 years later. Since then, it has become popular with meme coins. One of the main downsides is the numerous network outages that have plagued the network. While the issue is not present now, there is no assurance that there will never be another network outage. Such an outage could come at a crucial moment for a SOL holder, causing them to miss out on massive benefits on a crypto exchange. As such, it is not the best for a trader looking to capitalize on the fast pace of the crypto market, and its minute changes. The other issue is that SOL is highly centralized. So far, many of the tokens are in the hands of a small group, which is a concern for decentralization advocates. Ripple (XRP) XRP is the unit of account on the Ripple payment network. It has been in the news numerous times due to its ongoing legal challenges from the SEC. Ripple (XRP) is built to be a faster alternative to the SWIFT global money transaction network. While XRP has seen some meaningful gains in recent weeks due to a partial resolution with the SEC, critics point out that the coin is highly centralized. Ripple Labs, which is behind XRP, still controls a massive supply of XRP, which they release publicly on occasion. Since the company is a private for-profit organization, it is likely that these releases are time to benefit their shareholders, and not the public. Consequently, XRP traders are at the mercy of private capital, which is the antithesis to blockchain decentralization. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project has all the hallmarks of a project built for success. So far, it has a following of over 20k followers across all its social media platforms, an impressive number for a project still in the early stages of development. This massive base of early supporters will be crucial to taking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to the next level of viral fame. Protocol Design The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is a decentralized non-custodial protocol where lenders and borrowers can interact freely. On the protocol, lenders provide liquidity, and earn interest from their assets. The interest they earn from their assets is determined by pool utilization rate. To ensure that it attracts key liquidity, which includes valuable assets like stablecoins, and crypto coins with large market caps, it will run a liquidity reward program. By focusing its resources on these valuable assets, it will ensure that it optimizes yield rewards without weakening the broader token economy. Another unique feature of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the stablecoin design. On the protocol, users can create multi-asset positions, where a basket of assets covers a single loan, instead of single asset vaults. This process is expectedly to simplify the process of minting stablecoins. To maintain a peg to the US dollar, the protocol will utilize a system of arbitrage that will offer a stable, passive income to those stabilizing its price. Once it goes live, the team plans to launch multi-asset support, which will ensure that as many people can access the platform as possible. MUTM Token Presale Roars Ahead The ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has raised a massive amount of capital so far, which will make it easy to roll out as many features as possible. So far, it has raised over $10.3 million and continues to grow. The presale is currently in phase 5, where over 30% of the tokens set aside for the phase have already been sold. The tokens are currently going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the previous phase’ price of $0.025. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price is set to go up by 16.67% to $0.035. Analysts are optimistic about the future of MUTM tokens, giving them a 2,455% growth forecast. As such, even a $350 investment today could grow to over $8,500 when the tokens go live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM presents the best opportunity to grow your crypto portfolio to the moon. With a committed developer community, and massive community support, the current success of the presale is a sign of bigger things to come. Best of all, you can be part of this amazing opportunity at the low price of $0.03.

The integration provides institutional access to $670 million in Treasury products using the RLUSD stablecoin. Qualified purchasers can now mint and redeem tokenized Treasuries around the clock. The deployment marks a concrete step toward BCG’s projected $19 trillion tokenization market. Ondo Finance expands OUSG Treasury access to XRP Ledger Ondo Finance successfully deployed its Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG) product on XRP Ledger and has expanded institutional access to tokenized Treasury assets. As per the press release , the company maintains over $1.3 billion in total value locked across its platforms, and OUSG accounts for more than $670 million as one of the largest tokenized Treasury products available. OUSG achieved the distinction of being the first tokenized security to reach material adoption levels, competing alongside offerings from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton in the institutional treasury space. The XRP Ledger integration allows qualified purchasers to subscribe and redeem OUSG tokens easily using RLUSD as the settlement asset. The deployment eliminates traditional banking hour restrictions and legacy financial rail friction that typically constrain Treasury operations. Qualified purchasers and institutions can now convert between OUSG and RLUSD around the clock. This creates a capital-efficient settlement and liquidity model for Treasury management. Ripple and Ondo Finance provide liquidity commitments to ensure strong initial momentum for the product launch. RLUSD serves as the bridge asset connecting Treasury operations with broader cross-market utility. XRP Ledger infrastructure supports enterprise-grade tokenized finance XRP Ledger’s architecture provides purpose-built infrastructure for institutional DeFi applications through native tokenization support and built-in decentralized exchange functionality. The platform offers enterprise-ready features, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) that create compliance-first infrastructure required by institutional participants. According to Boston Consulting Group’s tokenization report, meaningful adoption occurs with low-risk, high-utility assets like Treasuries when paired with scalable infrastructure and compliant on/off ramps. XRPL delivers these requirements through low transaction fees, fast settlement finality, and comprehensive institutional tooling. The platform’s expanding feature set includes upcoming Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) support, lending protocol integration, and Permissioned Domains functionality. These capabilities address institutional needs for controlled access and regulatory compliance while maintaining blockchain transparency and efficiency. XRPL’s native DEX functionality allows direct trading between tokenized assets without requiring external exchanges or intermediaries. This integrated approach reduces operational complexity for institutions managing multiple asset types and trading strategies. The combination of technical infrastructure and compliance features positions XRPL as a destination for institutional-grade tokenized finance. Treasury products like OUSG benefit from the platform’s 24/7 availability, programmable asset capabilities, and interoperability with other onchain financial instruments and also maintain required institutional safeguards and access controls. Tokenized Treasuries market reaches $7 billion The tokenized U.S. Treasuries market has surpassed $7 billion in total value locked, with Treasury products leading real-world asset tokenization adoption. These assets deliver capital efficiency improvements and maintain programmability and interoperability with on-chain finance infrastructure. For institutions managing liquidity, collateral, and cash flow across multiple jurisdictions, tokenized Treasuries address traditional capital market inefficiencies. Legacy systems often create fragmented settlement cycles and require substantial idle cash buffers that reduce operational efficiency. OUSG’s XRP Ledger deployment allows firms and investors to achieve near-instant fund redeployment with round-the-clock access. This operational model removes traditional banking hour constraints and reduces settlement friction. The broader tokenization market targets $19 trillion by 2033, according to Ripple and Boston Consulting Group projections. Treasury products continue showing strong product-market fit as institutions seek yield-bearing assets with blockchain programmability. Asset tokenization transforms static holdings into dynamic, programmable financial tools that integrate with decentralized finance protocols. The combination of trusted government backing, regulatory compliance, and blockchain efficiency creates institutional adoption catalysts.

The flagship cryptocurrency tested the $110,000 level twice this week, suggesting a potential move past its all-time high could become a possibility. Despite the drop during the ongoing session, BTC remained marginally up in the past 24 hours and is nearly 4% up over the past week. Positive CPI Data Could Boost Markets Bitcoin’s (BTC) push towards a new all-time high has stalled after the price fell below $110,000 during the ongoing session. However, it still retains the potential of setting a new all-time high, especially if the CPI data favors risk assets like Bitcoin . Market experts and investors are waiting for the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could bring volatility to BTC . Some analysts anticipate a 2.5% increase, while others predict an increase between 2.1% and 2.3%, suggesting that it was a sign inflation was cooling. Low inflation could pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, boosting the stock and crypto markets. The analyst also highlighted Bitcoin’s negative funding rate as another indicator of an impending rally and a new all-time high. “What’s crazy right now is the fact that the Bitcoin funding rate is currently negative, which means that there are more shorts than longs open, which indicates an extremely healthy market and even supports the bullish thesis. Also, there is plenty of liquidity in the region between 108 and 110K, which is going to be taken as well for sure in the coming days.” A Correction To $90,000 Still Possible While most analysts are optimistic about an impending market rally pushing Bitcoin to new highs, Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at Youhodler, stated that a potential “head and shoulder” pattern could signal a reversal. The analyst stated, “ BTC quotes are currently in a state of uncertainty. On the one hand, many global traders are gradually withdrawing from the US currency and shifting to more risky assets, including cryptocurrencies. This has a positive effect on the BTC exchange rate. On the other hand, the price on the BTC chart is behaving extremely erratically, and there is currently a possibility of a local price hike. There is a ‘Head and Shoulders’ picture, which, if implemented in its scenario, can lead to a correction in the price to the level of $92,000.” Michael Saylor Dismisses Crypto Winter Fears Strategy co-founder and executive Chairman Michael Saylor has dismissed concerns about a crypto winter. Saylor suggested that Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption and declining exchange reserves could push the flagship cryptocurrency to $1 million. Saylor stated, “Winter is not coming back. We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” Asset manager ARK Invest also raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. According to Saylor, 450 BTC are available for sale everyday, valued at roughly $50 million at current prices. Saylor believes that if such a significant amount is bought on a daily basis, the price must go higher. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up.” Saylor also highlighted public companies purchasing massive amounts of Bitcoin. Saylor’s own firm holds 582,000 BTC worth approximately $63.85 billion. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Saylor reiterated President Trump’s support for Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry, along with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins, and also highlighted that traditional banks and financial institutions are pivoting to Bitcoin and providing custody services. “Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC)’s rally stalled around the $110,000 mark as buyers lost momentum after reaching $110,546. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday to reclaim $110,000 but found itself back in bearish territory during the ongoing session, trading around $109,739 after a decline of nearly 1%. According to Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan, the analytics firm is recording significant anticipation for BTC moving to a new all-time high on social media. However, the analyst stated that the market is not ready for a bullish surge. “It wouldn’t be surprising if we do break through very soon after we see a few frustrating ‘close calls’ that cause small traders to turn sour and impatient on BTC , neutralizing this level of optimism.” Meanwhile, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive, believes BTC will underperform during the third quarter of 2025. The analyst backed up his assessment with historical data. Historically, Q3 has been Bitcoin’s weakest, with an average return of around 6%. On the other hand, Q4 has been BTC’s strongest, delivering an average return of over 85%. Dawson also highlighted macroeconomic concerns as another reason for BTC’s subdued returns during Q3 2025. “Despite political pressure for rate cuts, the Fed seems poised to keep interest rates steady, which could dampen Bitcoin’s appeal for outsized returns.” BTC traded positively the previous weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,779. The price fell to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,435. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3% to $101,614. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, it recovered on Friday, rising 2.72% and settling at $104,378. Source: TradingView BTC traded in positive territory over the weekend, rising 1.15% on Saturday and registering a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price surged over 4%, surging past $110,000 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $110,251. BTC fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday as buyers lost momentum. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $109,700. Buyers will look to regain control and push the price back above $110,000. If bullish sentiment persists, BTC could set a new all-time high in the near term. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The digital asset had earlier fluctuated between $2.264 and $2.319 as investors weighed global macro pressures. Source: CoinMarketCap However, renewed buying interest pushed the token past resistance, with $2.280 emerging as a strong base. This move marks a key shift in market structure, as volume data continues to support a breakout narrative. $2.280 confirmed as short-term support XRP spent much of the previous session consolidating around the $2.273 to $2.280 zone, where repeated tests of lower levels were met with high-volume buying. A notable 3.9 million units were exchanged during a 2.17% dip at 01:55 ET, when XRP dropped from $2.285 to $2.280, only to be swiftly bought back. Earlier at 01:32 ET, the session’s peak volume of 1.8 million units had already confirmed strong buyer interest near the $2.280 mark. This activity reinforces the zone as a reliable support area. Traders appear confident accumulating near these levels, with market structure suggesting a shift from consolidation to potential upside continuation. Since then, price action has moved steadily higher, culminating in a clean break above the $2.319 ceiling. XRP clears $2.319 resistance, hits $2.33 The $2.319 level had acted as the upper boundary of XRP’s consolidation range, with multiple intraday rejections near $2.315. These were seen during the 11th and 22nd hours of trading, both accompanied by elevated volume, indicating strong sell-side presence. Breaking past this resistance was therefore key, and XRP’s advance to $2.33 suggests that buying strength has outpaced sellers for now. Price movement in the current session shows sustained interest, with an ascending trendline continuing to hold. The breakout over $2.319 may now turn this area into a support zone, with new resistance likely forming between $2.35 and $2.38. Market focus shifts to momentum sustainability While XRP’s upward move is backed by volume, traders are watching closely for confirmation. Indicators such as RSI remain neutral, while MACD has started to trend upwards. These technical signals suggest that momentum is building but not yet overextended, leaving room for further gains if buying interest holds. The broader environment remains cautious. Global trade tensions and diverging monetary policy across key economies continue to impact investor behaviour. Even so, XRP’s ability to break out while the wider crypto market shows mixed performance may attract more speculative flows in the short term. Consolidation zone turns into a launchpad XRP’s price action over the past day demonstrates how accumulation at lower levels can fuel a breakout. The former range between $2.264 and $2.319, once characterised by tight movement and neutral indicators, now appears to have served as a launchpad for further upward movement. As of the latest trading data, XRP remains above $2.33 with signs of stabilising. If volumes continue to support the rally, traders may target $2.35 and beyond. However, failure to hold above $2.319 could see the asset revisit the previous support at $2.280. For now, bulls appear in control, backed by a strong foundation and a decisive push past resistance.

SPX6900 ( SPX ) price rose for the fifth consecutive day, reaching a high of $1.62, up by 548% from its lowest point this year. This surge has pushed its market capitalization from $275 million in March to $1.4 billion. The SPX token surge coincided with ongoing whale accumulation. Nansen data shows that whales now hold 105.29 million coins, up from 104 million on May 13 this year.

A rising ADX is typically a sign that the trend is gaining strength. SPX price is forming a cup-and-handle pattern, with the upper boundary at $1.8725. A cup-and-handle is a popular continuation indicator. Therefore, the token will likely continue climbing as bulls target the key resistance at $1.8725, up by 16% from the current level.

The initiative marks a strategic shift for the blockchain-powered fintech group, which now aims to build a digital asset treasury supported by blockchain-native custody, staking, and tokenized management services. According to MFH, the reserve will be managed using institutional-grade custodial infrastructure and staking-enabled liquidity tools. The company plans to generate yield from its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings while enhancing balance sheet resilience and deepening alignment with decentralized finance protocols. CEO Shi Qiu said the initiative reflects a belief in Bitcoin’s future role in financial infrastructure. “We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem,” Qiu stated.

My Neighbor Alice, one of the most ambitious Web3 games, will join forces with the Pudgy Penguins project to expand its metaverse. All the Penguins from the NFT collections will be available as playable characters, with a dedicated Pudgy Land environment and special quests. The game aims to revive hype after a few years of slower development for Web3 gaming projects. Pudgy Penguins will come to life in new game All three Pudgy Penguins collections will be rendered as 3D characters and will explore the open world of My Neighbor Alice. Pudgy Land will be exclusively accessible to avatar holders. The metaverse will be a meetup place for holders of the original 8,888 Pudgy Penguins, the 22,222 Lil Pudgys and 7,399 Pudgy Rods. The game will be open from June 17, with a new set of missions and incentives. “ With this partnership, we’re pushing the envelope when it comes to interoperability.

Pudgy Penguins has its collections on Ethereum and launched its native Pengu token on Solana. Pudgy Penguins holders will access special quests NFT holders will also be able to craft individualized in-game emotes. The emotes will become tradable items in the game, further opening the opportunity to monetize NFT ownership. Some of the features will be open to the entire Alice and MNA token community.

Data shows ETH open interest is at record highs following months of subdued trading and sideways price action. After months of sideways trading, ETH is moving close to $2,800, signaling a bigger potential breakout. The recent expansion of open interest is also considered a rotation from BTC, aiming to tap a higher-risk asset with bigger potential returns. ETH is still seen as the signal for a new altcoin market, aiming to challenge BTC’s dominance . ETH open interest climbed with almost no pause since the lows in April, breaking to an all-time high with a predominance of long positions. | Source: Cryptoquant Ethereum is setting up for a run Based on CryptoQuant data, ETH futures point to the highest level of speculation, while whales are still holding onto ETH in their self-custodied wallets. Open interest on derivative exchanges hovers around $22B, or 7.17M ETH. In the meantime, ETH buyers are in holding mode, with no significant profit-taking. Ethereum’s trading replicates the BTC scenario, where spot trading slowed down and holders are no longer taking profits, despite near-record prices. At the same time, even retail investors are testing derivative markets. Both crowd traders and smart money are cautiously bullish on ETH after it broke out of its months-long range. $ETH Sentiment CROWD = Bullish 🟩 MP = Bullish 🟩 Check out sentiment and other crypto stats at https://t.co/HQDyBNuzek pic.twitter.com/yM2zdCCMi6 — Market Prophit (@MarketProphit) June 11, 2025 ETH is expected to repeat breakouts from previous cycles, as it is considered undervalued despite being key to several decentralized activities. The current open interest is predominantly long, with around 31% in short positions. Short sellers remain cautious, deploying limited liquidity up to $2,900. At the same time, high-risk whales are showing conviction, as in the case of a new whale with an ETH long position, valued at $11M . Ethereum remains in holder mode On-chain activity for Ethereum remains relatively high, with 431K daily active addresses. ETH and USDT transactions are the most common activity, burning the most gas. The Ethereum network still carries highly active DeFi apps and DEXs, offering a mix of passive income and on-chain trading. On-chain lending also expanded, with over $1B in liquidatable positions on DeFi protocols. The liquidation levels for ETH are slowly rising to above $1,500 on MakerDao, Liquidy, Compound, and Aave. In the past months, whales re-accumulated ETH and achieved a lower average entry price. Traders stopped sending ETH to exchanges, diminishing the available reserves to around 18.99M ETH. Additionally, more whales are waiting to stake their ETH and receive block rewards. A total of 9,863 potential validators are waiting in the deposit queue, with only 352 validators leaving. The most bullish narrative for ETH is its slow recovery following the 2023 bear market. ETH was expected to rally in the $6,000 to $10,000 range, based on DeFi activity, larger stablecoin supply and wider adoption. Instead, ETH sank to a lower range and dipped under 0.02 BTC.

The collaboration enables full integration of the Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, and Pudgy Rods NFT collections into the MNA universe. Notably, the partnership coincides with the launch of Chapter One: A New Beginning on June 17, marking a fresh start for the game. MNA players can now explore new quests and winter-themed content in a newly added environment called Snowflake Wilds. This area is part of the broader Pudgy Land experience. Exclusive Pudgy Land Features for NFT Holders NFT holders from the Pudgy community will have exclusive access to Pudgy Land, a zone within My Neighbor Alice designed for social interaction, exploration, and crafting. All 8,888 Pudgy Penguins, 22,222 Lil Pudgys, and 7,399 Pudgy Rods will be rendered as unique 3D avatars inside the MNA world. These NFTs can be used as playable characters, starting as eggs that hatch into the user’s specific asset. Holders can customize their profiles with Pudgy traits and use Pudgy Rods to engage with themed fishing mechanics. These features add depth to the immersive experience in Pudgy Land. My Neighbor Alice’s VP of Games, Steve Haßenpflug, described the integration as a major step toward blockchain interoperability. He said the project has made over 40,000 Pudgy NFTs functional in-game as native 3D assets, enabling new forms of user-driven content and gameplay. A New NFT Gameplay The MNA update introduces new Pudgy-themed content, including non-player characters (NPCs), interactive quests, and craftable wearable items tailored for NFT holders. Players can also create emotes tied to their NFTs and sell them to others within the MNA ecosystem. While several features are exclusive to Pudgy holders, the seasonal update also includes general quests and winter-themed items available to all players. This blend of exclusive and accessible content is designed to attract both new users and existing NFT communities. Looking ahead, the collaboration marks the beginning of a broader initiative to integrate more NFT projects into the Alice metaverse. My Neighbor Alice aims to foster cross-collection interoperability while expanding its open-world, community-driven gameplay.

With summer heating up, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is pressing against the key $420 level. A clean break could send it flying toward $460. Cardano (ADA) is also showing strength, sitting just below $0.73 and eyeing a return to $1. But while these two grab attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stealing the spotlight. It has raised over $295 million, entered Batch 29, and its presale price is frozen at $0.0018 until June 13. With a launch price of $0.05 and the current 2,660% ROI, momentum is soaring. Daily Buyer Battles and a rumored NBA partnership are adding fuel. If BCH and ADA are strong contenders, BlockDAG is already racing ahead, and everyone’s watching. Bitcoin Cash Eyes $460 After $420 Test Bitcoin Cash (BCH) technical charts are showing a strong setup. The $420 resistance level is acting as a key spot to watch. If BCH pushes above it and stays there, it could rally to $460. Analysts point to a compression pattern forming on bigger timeframes that could trigger a strong move. Volume is starting to climb, and moving averages are getting tighter. Both of these show that a bigger move could be near. Sentiment around BCH is shifting to positive, especially with Bitcoin staying stable. Analysts are also looking closely at the $388 to $395 support zone. If BCH holds that level, the case for an upward move grows stronger. Cardano (ADA) Eyes $1.39 Rebound Cardano (ADA) is looking strong again after some recent ups and downs. Right now, the ADA price is holding around $0.44–$0.46, and charts are showing it might make a move to reclaim $1.39. ADA has crossed back above key moving averages, and the RSI is showing bullish signs. If buying volume picks up, it could push toward the $0.60–$0.70 range quickly, with $1 as a key mental mark. Analysts say that a clean move past $0.50 would confirm real momentum. As long as ADA stays above $0.45 and Bitcoin remains calm, many believe a 2x move is realistic in the short term. Cardano’s forecast is also getting a boost from new upgrades and fresh DeFi activity. NBA Rumors Push BlockDAG Toward Crypto’s Mainstream Moment BlockDAG might be stepping into the big leagues soon. Word is spreading about a possible partnership with an NBA team, and that news could push BlockDAG into the mainstream spotlight. With more than 1.5 million users already mining through its X1 app, BlockDAG isn’t starting from scratch. This NBA move could level everything up. And this isn’t just about branding. The NBA reaches millions of people, and that kind of stage can bring nonstop attention. That’s important because crypto still has a long road to become part of everyday life. A courtside logo or even just presence during a live game grabs eyes and gets people curious. And when that happens alongside a red-hot presale, things move fast. With $295 million raised so far and Buyer Battles rewarding daily top contributors, BlockDAG is already running fast, but this kind of visibility can kick things into overdrive. As of now, the price is fixed at $0.0018 until June 13, before it launches at $0.05. However ,from its real batch price of $0.0276, the potential return sits around 2,660%. People are jumping in daily to try to win the Buyer Battles, where the biggest buyer of the day grabs the leftover coins. That’s more than just buying; that’s gamified engagement. BlockDAG is showing it’s not just a tech project; it knows how to stay in the spotlight. With NBA talks heating up, the time to watch closely is now. Final Thoughts Bitcoin Cash (BCH) charts suggest a breakout if it crosses the $420 level, with $460 as the next big goal. Cardano (ADA) is also gaining ground again, with targets of $1.39 in sight. Both coins are back on radar as the crypto market gets ready for its next move. But BlockDAG is making the most noise. With over $295 million raised, a presale price frozen at $0.0018 until June 13, and a confirmed launch at $0.05, it’s speeding toward takeoff. Throw in a possible NBA partnership, daily Buyer Battles, and over 22.3 billion coins sold, and BlockDAG is turning heads. It’s also sold over 17,811 miners, bringing in more than $7.1 million in miner sales. As the launch day nears, and buzz keeps growing, this might be the one not to miss.

XRPL’s Moves Towards EVM-Compatibility The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is preparing to take a significant step in expanding its blockchain capabilities, with plans to launch an Ethereum-compatible sidechain in the second quarter of 2025. The move, announced at the APEX 2025 conference in Singapore, positions the XRPL to tap into Ethereum’s vast decentralized application (dApp) and smart contract ecosystem while retaining its core advantage of low-cost transactions. A New Chapter for XRPL’s Ecosystem Unveiled by Jaazi Cooper, director of product management at Ripple, and David Schwartz, Ripple’s chief technology officer, the sidechain will run parallel to the XRP Ledger’s mainnet, enabling seamless interaction with Ethereum-based applications. Developed collaboratively by Ripple and blockchain infrastructure firm Peersyst Technologies, the sidechain leverages evmOS’ software stack to deliver full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. The sidechain is already operational on testnet, with mainnet deployment slated for Q2 after completion of ongoing testing phases and validator onboarding. According to Peersyst, the testnet has seen rapid traction since its early 2025 launch, currently handling over 280,000 transactions daily. Expanding XRPL’s Developer Base A notable aspect of the sidechain’s rollout is its success in attracting new contributors to the XRPL ecosystem. Ripple highlighted that “87 new entities – with no prior XRP involvement – are now contributing to the ecosystem: infrastructure, apps, and demand generation.” This marks one of the largest expansions of the XRPL community in its history. Peersyst emphasized the onboarding potential of the initiative, stating, “XRPL EVM has become the most effective tool to onboard talent and projects into the XRP ecosystem. When mainnet goes live, all of it becomes part of the XRP ecosystem — possibly the biggest onboarding in XRP history.” Integrating DeFi and Smart Contract Functionality While the XRP Ledger currently supports native smart contracts, it lacks compatibility with the EVM environment preferred by Ethereum developers. The upcoming sidechain aims to bridge this gap, enabling XRPL users to access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications such as liquidity pools, staking services, and a wider range of dApps. Asset transfers between the sidechain and XRPL’s mainnet will be facilitated by Axelar, which has been designated as the exclusive bridge provider. Wrapped XRP will serve as the native gas token for transactions on the sidechain. Positioning for Competitive Advantage This integration represents a strategic move for Ripple as it seeks to solidify XRPL’s standing in the increasingly competitive Layer 1 blockchain sector. By adopting EVM compatibility, XRPL can attract developers and users from the established Ethereum community while offering them lower transaction costs and faster settlement times. The initiative is part of Ripple’s broader roadmap to enhance XRPL’s infrastructure and utility. The forthcoming mainnet launch is expected to not only expand XRPL’s technical capabilities but also significantly grow its user base and developer ecosystem.

Polygon Co-Founder Sandeep Nailwal Appointed CEO of Polygon Foundation, Announces Major Strategic Overhaul Nailwal, who until now served as the project’s chief operating officer, is assuming unilateral control of the foundation and is moving quickly to restructure and refocus the organization. In a statement today, the foundation described the transition as “from a more passive chapter in Polygon’s history to a focused and ambitious vision of the future under founder leadership.” Key changes under Nailwal's leadership include: Accelerated rollout of Polygon Agglayer, the network’s long-awaited cross-chain aggregation layer. Version 0.3 is scheduled to go live by the end of June, with a full launch to follow. Transformation of the Polygon PoS chain to GigaGAS, a high-throughput chain targeting 100,000 transactions per second. The GigaGAS upgrade is already live on testnet. The deprecation of the Polygon zkEVM chain, which will be phased out over the next 12 months. The Foundation will continue to operate the chain's sequencer during this time and provide grants to projects migrating to other Polygon environments. Nailwal explained his decision in a post he made on social platform X: “I have always stayed away from stepping into a CEO role because I have focused on building Polygon as a decentralized foundation. But right now Polygon needs a clear direction and focused execution, and that means stepping forward.” Nailwal’s leadership comes after Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic recently left the project, leaving Nailwal as the only co-founder still actively involved in the project. Previous co-founders Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun stepped down in 2023. Founded in 2017 as Matic Network, Polygon has been at the forefront of Ethereum scaling technologies, particularly in areas such as zero-knowledge aggregation and proof-of-stake innovation. *This is not investment advice.

A trade truce between the two biggest economies will lower tensions and possibly attract investors back to risky assets. At the same time, the U.S. inflation report means that the Federal Reserve may decide to cut interest rates earlier than expected. The top crypto coins to invest in after the U.S. and China trade truce are those with strong fundamentals and technicals. Some of the most notable ones are Maple Finance ( SYRUP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Binance Coin ( BNB ). 1. Maple Finance Maple Finance is one of the fastest-growing crypto projects this year. It is an asset manager leveraging blockchain technology to raise capital and provide credit to institutions. Maple recently crossed $2.2 billion in assets under management, while monthly protocol revenue jumped to a record high of $1.06 million. More data shows that the amount of staked SYRUP tokens has risen to over 444.1 million, while the staking APY has increased to 2.8%. SYRUP has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, jumping 510% from its lowest point in April. It recently invalidated the double-top pattern by moving above the key resistance at $0.4700. The Maple Finance price will likely retreat and retest the support at $0.4700, then resume the uptrend.

Solana Solana is another top crypto to invest in because of its solid fundamentals and technicals, which point to a surge to $500. Nansen data shows that Solana is the most active blockchain , handling over 474 million transactions in the last seven days. It had over 32 million daily active transactions in the same period. Solana is the most popular chain for meme coins, with those in its ecosystem having a market cap of over $11 billion. Its DEX protocols, like Raydium and Orca, are highly popular, and its network fees are rising. The weekly chart shows that the SOL price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern. Since the cup has a depth of 96%, measuring the same distance from the cup’s upper side gives it a target of over $500. Solana price chart | Source: crypto.news 3. Binance Coin BNB is another quality crypto token to buy as its growth accelerates. Like Solana, its active transactions and addresses have risen in the past few months. Most importantly, it has become the biggest player in decentralized exchanges , handling over $140 billion in transactions in the last 30 days. BNB is also highly deflationary, as it incinerates tokens worth over $1 billion per quarter. Its goal is to reduce the number of tokens in circulation from 144 million today to 100 million. The BNB price has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, giving it a target of $1,141.

Analysts forecast a potential rise closer to $150, pushed via stepped forward community activity, broader market recovery, and growing institutional interest in scalable and green cryptocurrencies. ‘ While Litecoin keeps attracting attention from conservative traders, a brand new player, Ozak AI, is charming the speculative crowd with bold forecasts of 300x returns from its current presale price of $0.005. Litecoin Technical Analysis: Symmetrical Triangle Breakout on the Horizon Litecoin’s price chart is currently showing a symmetrical triangle pattern, a formation marked through converging trend lines that replicate a tightening price range. This happens as investors continue to be indecisive, causing the asset to oscillate among lower highs and higher lows. Symmetrical triangles are taken into consideration impartial styles, but they regularly precede strong breakout actions. The direction of the breakout—upward or downward—generally units the tone for the asset’s next huge trend. In Litecoin’s case, a bullish breakout from the symmetrical triangle would open the door for a run toward key resistance zones. However, failure to break out could signal consolidation or even short-term correction. Key Litecoin Levels to Watch: Resistance Levels: $95, $115, $150 Support Levels: $75, $65, $50 A break above $95 could ignite a rally toward $115 and ultimately $150, while failure to hold $75 support could send LTC down to the $65 or $50 range. For traders, the symmetrical triangle is a crucial setup to monitor, as volume and price direction following the breakout will determine the next major move.

It also rewards community members for contributing data or improving model accuracy. Currently in its 4th Ozak AI presale stage at $0.005, the token is expected to surge as listings and ecosystem adoption increase. Market watchers believe it has the potential to deliver up to 300x returns, particularly as demand for AI-powered financial tools continues to rise globally. Litecoin remains a reliable option for those seeking moderate, stable returns with a favorable technical setup pointing toward $150. However, for investors looking for explosive growth and exposure to cutting-edge AI innovation, Ozak AI presents a compelling alternative. As the crypto landscape evolves, both assets may serve different investor profiles—Litecoin for security, and Ozak AI for high-reward opportunities.

The announcement, spotlighted by prominent crypto analyst SMQKE on X, underscores SWIFT’s new direction: not competing with fintechs, but collaborating with them . SWIFT, which connects over 11,000 financial institutions worldwide, is enhancing, not replacing, its trusted network. Its goal is to interoperate with innovative platforms, including those supporting blockchain-based digital currencies. According to SWIFT, “the most significant opportunity lies in integrating diverse networks and third-party providers leveraging ISO 20022, including those supporting digital currency networks.” This bold move positions SWIFT at the center of the evolving financial landscape, where interoperability and efficiency take precedence over siloed systems. Rather than resisting the wave of decentralization, SWIFT is choosing to embrace it, making the announcement especially bullish for digital assets like XRP, which are already ISO 20022-compliant. XRP’s Strategic Advantage Among the handful of digital assets aligned with ISO 20022, XRP continues to stand out. Designed for institutional use, XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, a blockchain built for fast, low-cost, and eco-friendly transactions. Ripple, the enterprise blockchain company closely associated with XRP, has spent years engaging with central banks, regulators, and financial institutions to build bridges between traditional finance and the digital asset space. XRP’s technical compatibility with ISO 20022 isn’t incidental; it’s foundational. RippleNet, Ripple’s enterprise-grade payments platform, already enables real-time settlement for cross-border payments. In contrast, SWIFT has long faced criticism for delays and inefficiencies in cross-border money transfers. By aligning with ISO 20022 and seeking integration with digital asset networks, SWIFT is effectively acknowledging the value that platforms like Ripple and XRP bring to the table. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Collaboration Over Competition As SMQKE emphasized, SWIFT is not being replaced. It is evolving. The messaging giant is positioning itself as the central hub in a world where various financial networks, centralized and decentralized, must interoperate seamlessly. Its support for third-party fintechs and digital currency platforms signals a future where legacy systems and blockchain-based innovations co-exist within a unified financial architecture. This marks a shift in mindset: from defending outdated infrastructure to fostering collaboration with emerging technologies. The ISO 20022 standard acts as the common language enabling this convergence, and XRP is among its most fluent participants. A Turning Point for Global Finance SWIFT’s confirmation isn’t just a policy update; it’s a signal that the traditional financial system is ready to embrace the next generation of value exchange. By choosing integration over isolation, SWIFT is paving the way for compliant digital assets like XRP to thrive within its network. As institutional adoption accelerates, XRP’s alignment with ISO 20022 and Ripple’s existing infrastructure makes it a leading contender in this new era of financial interoperability.

45804758,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=167868,1749656420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45804758.jpeg,Exciting Move: CoinShares Registers Solana ETF Entity in Delaware,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinshares-solana-etf-delaware/,"BitcoinWorld Exciting Move: CoinShares Registers Solana ETF Entity in Delaware Big news shaking up the digital asset world! CoinShares, a major player in the European digital asset investment space, has taken a significant step towards potentially bringing a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the United States. The firm recently registered the entity specifically for this proposed Solana ETF in Delaware, a key jurisdiction for corporate filings in the U.S. This development is more than just administrative paperwork. It signals serious intent from a reputable firm like CoinShares to explore offering regulated investment products based on Solana, one of the leading smart contract platforms in the crypto market. For investors looking for easier ways to get exposure to SOL, this could be a game-changer. What is a Crypto ETF and Why Does Delaware Matter? Before diving deeper into the specifics of the potential SOL ETF , let’s quickly touch on what an ETF is and why the Delaware registration is noteworthy. An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund that holds assets (like stocks, bonds, or in this case, cryptocurrency) and is traded on stock exchanges. Think of it as a basket of assets you can buy or sell like a single stock. Crypto ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to cryptocurrencies without the need to directly buy, store, and secure the underlying digital asset themselves. Delaware is a popular state for corporate registration in the U.S. due to its business-friendly laws and established legal framework. Registering an entity here is a standard procedure when setting up a new fund or investment vehicle intended to operate in the U.S. market. While this registration doesn’t mean the ETF is approved or will definitely launch, it’s a necessary foundational step in the lengthy process of potentially getting a Crypto ETF listed and traded on a U.S. exchange. Why is CoinShares Focusing on Solana? CoinShares is no stranger to the digital asset space. They offer a range of crypto investment products in Europe, including physically-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs) for various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and yes, Solana. Their existing experience with Solana likely plays a role in this U.S. initiative. Solana itself has emerged as a prominent blockchain platform known for its high transaction throughput and low costs compared to some other networks. It hosts a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including those in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming. Its performance and expanding ecosystem have attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors, making it a logical candidate for a regulated investment product like an ETF. Potential Benefits of a CoinShares Solana ETF If a CoinShares Solana ETF were to receive regulatory approval and launch in the U.S., it could offer several advantages for investors: Accessibility: It would allow investors to gain exposure to SOL through traditional brokerage accounts, making it as easy as buying stocks. This removes the complexities of setting up crypto wallets, dealing with exchanges, and managing private keys. Liquidity: ETFs are typically highly liquid, meaning investors can easily buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices. Regulation: An approved ETF would operate under regulatory oversight, potentially offering a level of investor protection and confidence not always associated with direct crypto investments. Diversification within Traditional Portfolios: It provides a straightforward way for traditional investors to add exposure to the digital asset class, specifically Solana, within their existing investment portfolios. Institutional Interest: The availability of a regulated Solana product could further attract institutional investors who face restrictions or hesitations about holding cryptocurrencies directly. This potential new avenue for Digital Asset Investment could broaden the investor base for Solana significantly. What Are the Hurdles for a U.S. Crypto ETF? While the Delaware registration is a positive sign of intent, the path to launching a cryptocurrency ETF in the United States is challenging, particularly for those holding the underlying asset (spot ETFs). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. While Bitcoin spot ETFs were recently approved, the regulatory stance on other cryptocurrencies like Solana remains less certain. Key challenges include: Regulatory Approval: The primary hurdle is obtaining approval from the SEC. This involves demonstrating that the fund meets stringent requirements regarding investor protection, market surveillance, and custody of assets. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators often express concerns about the potential for manipulation in underlying crypto markets, which can impact the price of an ETF. Custody Solutions: Securely holding the underlying SOL tokens with a regulated custodian is a critical requirement for a spot ETF. Competition: If approved, a CoinShares SOL ETF would enter a potentially competitive market landscape as other firms might also pursue similar products. The process involves extensive dialogue with regulators and meeting strict compliance standards. The success of the recently launched Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. might pave the way for other crypto assets, but it is by no means guaranteed. Comparing the U.S. and European Crypto ETF Landscape It’s worth noting the difference in the regulatory landscape between Europe and the U.S. Europe has been more open to approving physically-backed crypto ETPs, which function similarly to ETFs. Firms like CoinShares already offer these products for various cryptocurrencies across European exchanges. This experience gives CoinShares valuable expertise in managing and structuring such products, which they can leverage in their U.S. efforts. In contrast, the U.S. has only recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, after years of applications being denied. This suggests a more cautious and perhaps slower approach from U.S. regulators compared to their European counterparts when it comes to broader Digital Asset Investment products beyond Bitcoin futures ETFs. What This Means for Solana and Digital Asset Investment The registration by CoinShares is a positive signal for the Solana ecosystem. It indicates growing institutional interest and the potential for increased mainstream adoption if an ETF is eventually launched. While the regulatory path is uncertain, this step highlights Solana’s increasing prominence as a digital asset class that major investment firms are considering for regulated products. For the broader Crypto ETF market, this shows that firms are actively exploring expanding their offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting a maturing market where other established cryptocurrencies are gaining recognition as investable assets. This push towards more varied crypto investment products could significantly impact the future of Digital Asset Investment by making it more accessible and integrated into traditional finance. Actionable Insights for Investors What should investors take away from this development? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on regulatory developments regarding cryptocurrency ETFs in the U.S. The process can be lengthy and subject to regulatory decisions. Understand the Product: If a Solana ETF launches, understand how it works, its fees, and how its performance tracks the underlying asset before investing. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets, including Solana, are volatile. Any investment, whether direct or via an ETF, carries significant risk. Consider Your Investment Goals: An ETF is just one way to gain exposure. Evaluate if it aligns with your overall investment strategy compared to direct ownership or other products. This registration is an early stage, but it puts a potential CoinShares SOL ETF on the radar for anyone interested in regulated crypto investment opportunities. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of SOL Investment? CoinShares registering an entity for a proposed Solana ETF in Delaware is a notable development in the evolving landscape of Digital Asset Investment . While regulatory approval in the U.S. is not guaranteed and faces significant hurdles, this action by a leading European firm underscores the growing institutional confidence in Solana as an asset class and the persistent demand for regulated crypto investment products. This move could be an early indicator of future trends in the Crypto ETF market, potentially opening doors for other altcoins to be considered for similar investment vehicles. Investors should view this development with cautious optimism, recognizing it as a positive step towards potential increased accessibility and mainstream integration for Solana, but also understanding that the journey to a live Solana ETF in the U.S. is still subject to regulatory review and market conditions. It’s an exciting prospect that highlights the ongoing maturation of the digital asset space.

The Singapore-based firm mined 196 BTC last month — up 18% from April — as it pushed forward the deployment of its SEALMINER A2 rigs across data centers in the U.S., Norway, and Bhutan. The company’s proprietary hashrate now sits at 13.6 exahashes per second (EH/s), thanks to the energization of 3.9 EH/s worth of SEALMINER A1 machines and the ongoing rollout of the A2 line. Bitdeer also shipped 1.6 EH/s of SEALMINER A2 units to external customers during the month, signaling growing adoption of its mining hardware. The firm’s infrastructure buildouts are also gaining pace. In Norway, 70 megawatts (MW) of a planned 175 MW expansion at Tydal are already online, with the remaining 105 MW expected to be energized by the end of June. In Bhutan, the Jigmeling site has begun energization, with plans to bring an additional 368 MW online for a total of 500 MW. A 221 MW facility in Massillon, Ohio, remains on track for phased completion through the second half of the year. The company’s reach is extending into new markets.

The deal comes weeks after Stripe’s $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge . Financial terms of the Privy transaction were not disclosed, according to Bloomberg. Founded in 2021, Privy enables companies to integrate crypto wallets directly into their platforms. Its clients include NFT marketplace OpenSea, loyalty platform Blackbird, and global employment firm Toku. By removing the need for external wallet setups, Privy aims to reduce friction for new crypto users. The startup was last valued at $230 million in March 2025. “Wallets were powerful but inaccessible for all but the most technical,” said Privy CEO Henri Stern. “Developers had to send users off-platform to get started, breaking flows and killing user conversion.” You might also like: Dow Jones gains 142 points as Trump claims China trade deal is ‘done’ Privy’s independent operations Stripe said Privy will continue to operate independently, similar to Bridge. The acquisition strengthens Stripe’s ambitions to offer end-to-end infrastructure for businesses building crypto-enabled services. It also supports Stripe’s new stablecoin initiatives, including USDC- and USDB-funded merchant accounts. The deal is expected to close in the coming weeks.

Volume surges 27.11%, with MACD crossover hinting at early bullish momentum. Resistance at $0.0005300 remains pivotal for NEIRO’s short-term breakout attempt. NEIRO (First Neiro on Ethereum) is drawing renewed attention from traders in June 2025, as its price chart forms a classic bullish reversal pattern that could signal an end to its recent volatility. After showing signs of a short-term recovery, the low-cap token is now at a potential inflection point. The current trading level hovers around $0.0005094 , marking a 2.82% gain in the past 24 hours. While still far from its early-year peak of $0.0015, this low-cap token is displaying behavior that may suggest a possible reversal or at least a phase of consolidation. Market Structure and Key Price Zones NEIRO’s intraday price movements reflect high volatility. The price has oscillated between $0.0004925 and $0.0005300.

From viral sensations to community-driven powerhouses, these coins have ignited massive enthusiasm among investors looking for the next big breakout. Coins like Doginme, SLERF, Comedian, Sudeng, and Degen have all captured attention with unique concepts and strong communities fueling their rapid growth. The surge in popularity isn’t just hype—it’s a revolution in how people engage with and invest in cryptocurrencies. Amid this booming landscape, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) stands out as a unique gem. Not just another meme coin, APC combines a smart deflationary mechanism with exciting community incentives and a thriving presale that’s capturing the spotlight. With a robust token burn system and an irresistible presale opportunity, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself as one of the best meme coin presale chances to maximize wealth potential in 2025. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Mechanism: Creating Scarcity for Long-Term Value One of the most compelling features setting Arctic Pablo Coin apart is its innovative token burn system. Unlike many meme coins that flood the market, $APC uses a weekly burn mechanism during the presale to permanently eliminate unsold tokens. This ongoing reduction increases scarcity, directly boosting the token’s value. Once the presale ends, any remaining tokens will also be burned, creating a highly deflationary environment designed to protect investor value over the long haul. All these burns are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain, ensuring trust and accountability in every transaction. This thoughtful approach to scarcity isn’t just about hype—it’s about sustainability. By controlling supply and encouraging demand through strategic burns, Arctic Pablo Coin is laying a foundation for enduring growth and value appreciation that investors can count on well beyond the initial launch phase. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: The Wealth-Building Opportunity You’ve Been Waiting For Imagine stepping into a presale where the current price is just $0.0003, but the coin is set to debut on exchanges at $0.008. That’s exactly the opportunity Arctic Pablo Coin presents right now. For example, an investment of $5,000 at this stage would secure over 16 million APC tokens, which could be worth a staggering $133,333 once the coin lists. The current stage, known as Blizzard Borough (Stage 27), has already raised over $2.73 million with a jaw-dropping current ROI of 2,566.66%. This isn’t just a presale; it’s a launchpad to potential wealth. Every moment you wait, others are snapping up tokens that promise to multiply dramatically. Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers a rare chance to get in early on one of the hottest meme coin presales, where smart investors are positioning themselves to ride the explosive growth wave to substantial profits. 2. Doginme: Community-Driven Fun Meets Utility Doginme is more than a typical meme coin; it’s a community-centric project focused on blending humor with real-world utility. Built on a strong social foundation, Doginme offers staking rewards and engaging events that keep holders excited and involved. Its playful branding draws attention, but it’s the active development and transparent roadmap that make it a contender in this list. Doginme made it to this list because it combines meme coin culture with tangible user engagement, carving out its niche in a crowded market. 3. SLERF: The Rising Star of Social Tokenomics SLERF has rapidly gained momentum by integrating social media dynamics directly into its tokenomics. It rewards users for community participation and viral content sharing, making it a truly decentralized social currency. Its innovative rewards system encourages organic growth and network effects, pushing SLERF into the spotlight among emerging meme coins. SLERF earned its place here due to its clever mix of social engagement and reward mechanics that attract active holders. 4. Comedian: Laughing All the Way to the Bank Comedian taps into humor and entertainment to build a passionate following. The coin leverages meme culture’s viral nature, combining it with smart contracts that incentivize holders through cashback and referral bonuses. This dual approach fosters loyalty while attracting new investors looking for fun but profitable crypto assets. This crypto made it to the list because it marries entertainment value with solid incentive structures, creating a compelling user experience. 5. Sudeng: A Playful Meme Coin with Serious Ambitions Sudeng stands out with its unique mascot and engaging storyline, which resonates with meme enthusiasts and crypto investors alike. The project’s transparent development and regular updates assure the community that Sudeng is more than just a fleeting trend. Its combination of playful branding and steady progress makes it an appealing pick. Sudeng is on this list for successfully blending creative branding with consistent project execution, giving it long-term potential. 6. Degen: The Wild Card for Risk Takers Degen embraces the high-risk, high-reward philosophy that many crypto adventurers love. Known for its unpredictable price swings and bold marketing, Degen appeals to traders and speculators looking for fast gains. Despite its volatility, the coin has built a devoted community that thrives on excitement and the chance for big wins. Degen’s place on this list comes from its strong community and the allure of significant upside potential, appealing to those ready to take calculated risks. Verdict: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Pack in the Top Cryptos to Join Now Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join now are Arctic Pablo Coin, Doginme, SLERF, Comedian, Sudeng, and Degen.

The latest data from a key industry metric suggests we’re not quite there yet. The Altcoin Season Index, a popular gauge for understanding the current state of the crypto market , recently registered a figure that firmly places us in ‘Bitcoin Season’. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for investors trying to navigate the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency space. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index provides a snapshot of how the broader market is performing relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. What it Measures: The index looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The Timeframe: It specifically analyzes the performance of these top altcoins compared to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Thresholds: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. For the market to be considered in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority of these top altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Specifically, at least 75% of the top 100 coins need to have posted better returns than BTC. Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day window. Anything in between is often considered a transition period or ‘Other’. Currently: It’s Bitcoin Season As of 00:33 UTC on June 11, the Altcoin Season Index stood at 31. While this was a slight increase of two points from the previous day, it remains well below the 75 threshold required for Altcoin Season and firmly within the zone indicating Bitcoin Season . This means that over the last three months, a large percentage of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed relative to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, capturing a larger share of market gains or holding value better during downturns compared to most other cryptocurrencies. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for the Crypto Market? When the market is in Bitcoin Season , it typically signifies that capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is leading the market movements. This can happen for several reasons: Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance tends to increase. Safe Haven Narrative: In uncertain economic times or during periods of market consolidation, investors may view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional inflows often target Bitcoin first, before potentially moving down the market cap ladder. Pre-Alt Season Consolidation: Sometimes, Bitcoin Season precedes an Altcoin Season, acting as a phase where Bitcoin consolidates gains or makes significant moves before capital rotates into altcoins seeking higher potential returns. For participants in the crypto market , Bitcoin Season means that simply holding a diversified basket of altcoins might not yield optimal results compared to focusing on Bitcoin or carefully selecting altcoins with strong individual catalysts. Why Isn’t It Altcoin Season Yet? Investors eagerly anticipate Altcoin Season because it’s historically the period where many smaller cryptocurrencies experience explosive growth, often posting returns that far outstrip Bitcoin’s performance. However, the index at 31 clearly shows that the broad altcoin market is not currently in this phase. Factors preventing a widespread Altcoin Season might include: Lack of strong, broad market narratives driving capital into altcoins. Lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. Focus remaining on Bitcoin due to specific events (like ETF performance or halving cycle aftermath). Altcoins consolidating after previous runs. Navigating the Current Cryptocurrency Landscape So, how should you approach the cryptocurrency market when the Altcoin Season Index indicates Bitcoin Season? Here are a few considerations: Focus on Bitcoin: Given Bitcoin’s current dominance, it may be a primary focus for investment during this period. Selective Altcoin Investing: Instead of broad diversification across altcoins, focus on specific projects with strong fundamentals, upcoming milestones, or unique narratives that might allow them to outperform even in a Bitcoin-dominated market. Risk Management: Altcoins can be particularly volatile when not in their peak season. Employ robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses and not over-allocating to single altcoin positions. Observe Market Rotation: Keep a close eye on market dynamics. Signs that the index is rising towards the 75 threshold could indicate capital starting to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Stay Informed: Follow news and developments for both Bitcoin and promising altcoin projects. Understanding the catalysts driving individual assets is crucial. The current index reading serves as a reminder that market cycles are real and understanding the prevailing conditions is key to making informed investment decisions in the volatile world of cryptocurrency . Conclusion: Patience During Bitcoin’s Reign The Altcoin Season Index sitting at 31 confirms that the crypto market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . This means that, for now, Bitcoin is the primary driver and performer compared to the majority of the top 100 altcoins. While this might temper the excitement for immediate, broad altcoin rallies, it provides clarity on the current market structure. Understanding this phase is crucial for investors. It calls for potentially shifting focus towards Bitcoin or being highly selective with altcoin exposure, rather than expecting widespread gains across the board. While Altcoin Season remains a highly anticipated event, the current data suggests patience is required. Keep monitoring the index and market dynamics for signs of a potential shift, but for now, Bitcoin holds the crown.

The KOPS has commenced its ICO on May 17, allowing early participants to gain big. Along with the ICO, the KOPS team has initiated a referral program through which investors can multiply their profits as well as contribute to the growth of the KOPS ecosystem.

In order to participate in the referral program , investors should acquire tokens for a minimum of $25. Once the purchase is done, a referral code will be generated, which can be shared with friends and peer traders.

Bonus Tokens: Double Your Investment It’s not only the referral program that makes traders join the KOPS club. $KOPS includes an added 100% bonus for every purchase made.

In order to protect its followers, it built a digital fortress with the power of BNB chain and started to advocate for strategy, survival, and strength.

Historically, the best performers in this category have shared a common profile: viral appeal, community support, and, more recently, real utility. In 2025, three meme coins trading under $0.01 are turning heads: Future Pepe ($FPEPE) , Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogwifhat (WIF) . Each offers a different take on the meme economy, but only one may offer the perfect mix of early entry, strong narrative, and functional innovation. Here’s how they compare. 1. Future Pepe ($FPEPE): The Tech-Driven Meme Coin Current Price: ~$0.0096 Key Differentiator: Built-in utility (AI security scanner, staking) Community: 10,000+ active members Secure $FPEPE tokens today and position yourself ahead of the next price rally Why It Stands Out: Future Pepe is making waves as a next-generation meme coin that combines classic virality with modern DeFi infrastructure. At its core lies a powerful AI-based scanner that identifies scam contracts and rug-pull behaviors before they happen. It’s a first for the meme coin space, where security is often an afterthought. Staking rewards up to 30% APY are available instantly upon purchase in presale, rewarding early believers and encouraging long-term holding. With deflationary tokenomics and an ambitious roadmap, $FPEPE positions itself as more than a trend, it’s infrastructure disguised as a meme. Who It’s For: Investors who want meme energy but also seek long-term token sustainability, staking yields, and protection tools. 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Ecosystem Veteran Current Price: ~$0.00002 Key Differentiator: Shibarium L2 + ShibaSwap DEX Community: 1M+ holders globally Why It Stands Out: SHIB has evolved far beyond its 2021 meme coin roots. Today, it powers an entire ecosystem that includes a layer-2 solution (Shibarium), a decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), NFT integrations, and regular token burns. It’s also widely listed across major exchanges, giving it an edge in visibility and liquidity. Though SHIB’s massive circulating supply has made rapid price gains harder, its longevity and ongoing development make it a serious contender in 2025—especially as the Shibarium network continues to onboard new projects and users. Who It’s For: Investors seeking stability, brand recognition, and participation in an already-thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystem. 3. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Solana-Based Underdog Current Price: ~$0.005 Key Differentiator: Solana-based + cultural branding Community: 60,000+ across Solana circles Why It Stands Out: WIF brings the meme game to Solana with cheap gas fees and fast transactions. Its unique dog-with-a-hat imagery quickly went viral across crypto Twitter and Telegram, gaining traction especially among Solana-native users looking for their own breakout token. While it doesn’t yet offer the tech stack of Future Pepe or SHIB, WIF benefits from Solana’s growing DeFi and NFT scenes—and may serve as a cultural entry point to that chain. Who It’s For: Buyers who want to ride Solana’s growth wave and tap into grassroots meme communities with viral branding. The Bottom Line: Which One Wins Under $0.01? Each of these coins brings something unique: Feature Future Pepe SHIB WIF Price ~$0.0096 ~$0.00002 ~$0.005 Utility AI Scanner + Staking L2 + DEX None yet Chain Ethereum + BSC Ethereum + Shibarium Solana Community 100K+ 1M+ 60K+ Stage Presale Fully listed Fully listed Final Take: If you’re looking for a low-cost meme coin under $0.01, all three offer compelling angles. SHIB offers scale. WIF offers speed. But Future Pepe may be the best all-around play for 2025, blending early-stage upside with real technology and strong tokenomics. With Ethereum and Bitcoin pumping again, meme season is heating up. Getting into the right sub-penny gem early could mean the difference between 2x… and 100x.

The hunt for top tokens only just got easier with a hot list of altcoins under $1 ready to skyrocket. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which is at $0.03 is creating serious buzz as the must-watch DeFi token with explosive upside potential that’s impossible to ignore. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,800 investors. More than $10.3 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Alongside Pepe (PEPE), these coins are dominating crypto conversations and are on every investor’s radar for what to buy before June ends. If you want to catch the next wave and capitalize on the top summer cryptos, now’s the time to act, these undervalued gems could deliver life-changing returns in the coming months. Pepe (PEPE) Continues Riding Meme Coin Wave in 2025 Pepe (PEPE) is trading around $0.000012, maintaining its position as one of the most talked-about meme coins this year. Despite some volatility, PEPE’s strong community backing and frequent viral moments keep it among the top meme coins, although with higher risk. While Pepe captures the meme coin spotlight, emerging tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining strong momentum, offering promising prospects within the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance Presale Skyrockets: $10.3M Raised and 11,800 Investors Can’t Be Wrong Mutuum Finance is rapidly carving its place in the DeFi lending space, having already attracted over $10.3 million and built a thriving community of 11,800+ holders. Right now, MUTM tokens are available at just $0.03, but in the next presale round, prices will jump to $0.035, meaning anyone who buys now locks in an instant 16.67% profit. When Mutuum officially launches at $0.06, early investors could see a massive 100% gain. This is the kind of growth that DeFi investors dream about! The Power of Dual Lending: Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Models Changing the Game Mutuum Finance’s secret weapon is its hybrid lending system that blends: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Lock your USDT into smart-contract-driven liquidity pools and earn passive income — no hassle, all automated. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Cut out the middleman and lend or borrow directly, with full control and privacy over loan terms. This combination gives users unmatched flexibility, privacy, and competitive yields, putting Mutuum ahead of the pack. Built on Trust: Certik-Audited & Backed by a Stable USD-Pegged Coin Security is king in crypto and Mutuum Finance delivers. Its open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, one of the blockchain industry’s top security firms. On top of that, Mutuum is creating a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, designed to maintain long-term price stability and avoid the collapse risks that have tanked algorithmic stablecoins. This means safer investments and a foundation for institutional adoption. Huge Rewards for Early Backers: $100,000 MUTM Giveaway for 10 Lucky Investors Mutuum Finance isn’t just growing, it’s giving back.

45805701,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=769597,1749657618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45805701.jpeg,"Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: ‘Fair Price’ Today Is $230,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-undervalued-bitwise-fair-price-today-230000/,"Bitcoin is once again knocking on the door of price discovery, but researchers at Bitwise Asset Management argue that spot quotations still understate what the network is worth. In their Week 24 Crypto Market Compass circulated late Tuesday, Dr. André Dragosch, Bitwise’s Head of Research for Europe, and analyst Ayush Tripathi calculate that “quantitative models estimate Bitcoin’s hypothetical ‘fair value’ amid the current sovereign default probabilities at around $230,000 today.” The figure implies a premium of just over 110 percent to the market price, which was hovering near $109,600 at press time on 11 June 2025. Bitcoin’s ‘True Worth’ Is Explosive Dragosch ties that assessment to the rally in sovereign-risk hedges. United-States one-year credit-default-swap spreads are trading near half-percentage-point territory—levels last seen during the 2023 debt-ceiling scare—reflecting “broader concerns over the US fiscal deficit,” Reuters reported last week. “Bitcoin can provide an alternative ‘portfolio insurance’ against widespread sovereign defaults as a scarce, decentralised asset which is free of counterparty risks,” the note argues, adding that net interest outlays projected by the Congressional Budget Office point to a tripling of US debt-service costs to roughly $3 trillion by 2030. Related Reading: Bitcoin Skyrockets Past $108,000 Amid US-China Tariff Discussions The macro backdrop, however, is not the only pillar supporting Bitwise’s fair-value call. The firm’s in-house Cryptoasset Sentiment Index shows twelve of fifteen market-breadth gauges trending higher, while the cross-asset risk-appetite index (CARA) compiled from equities, credit, rates and commodities has surged to a five-year high. “Both cryptoasset and cross-asset sentiment are now decisively bullish,” Dragosch writes, noting that Bitcoin’s climb back above $110,000 places it within two percent of the all-time high near $112,000 set in May. On-chain data remain constructive. Exchange reserves have slipped to 2.91 million BTC—about 14.6 percent of the circulating supply—after whales withdrew an estimated 390,632 BTC last week. At the same time, net exchange-spot outflows slowed to roughly $0.53 billion from $1.78 billion the previous week, suggesting lighter profit-taking pressure. Derivative positioning echoes the spot-market resilience. Aggregate Bitcoin futures open interest added 2,200 BTC across venues, while the CME leg gained 6.4 k BTC. Funding rates on perpetual swaps stayed positive overall despite flipping negative for parts of the weekend, and the three-month annualised basis held around 6.3 percent. In options, open interest expanded by 27,300 BTC, with the put-to-call ratio settling at 0.55; one-month 25-delta skew remained modestly negative, implying continued demand for downside hedges even as realised volatility slipped to 28.2 percent. Institutional flows are reinforcing the bullish tone. Global crypto ETPs absorbed $488.5 million last week, of which $254.9 million went into Bitcoin products. US spot Bitcoin ETFs led the charge with $525 million of inflows, counterbalanced by a $24.1 million weekly leak from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Bitwise’s own BITB vehicle attracted $78.1 million, while its European physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE) saw only marginal outflows. Ethereum products also enjoyed $260.9 million in net inflows, maintaining the broad-based risk bid. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative Bitwise concedes that headline risk can still provoke sharp, short-lived drawdowns—last week’s spat between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump briefly drove BTC back to $100,000—but sees structural forces firmly tilted to the upside. “US economic policy uncertainty has most likely passed its zenith already and continues to decline at the margin,” Dragosch writes, pointing to May non-farm-payroll growth of 139,000 and a moderation in recession odds. With Bitcoin already outperforming traditional assets year-to-date and cross-asset sentiment now confirmed by Bitwise’s indicators, the analysts argue that the market is beginning to price the asset less as a speculative vehicle and more as a macro hedge. Whether traders embrace the $230,000 fair-value marker hinges on the same variables underscored in the note—sovereign-risk premiums, policy uncertainty and the pace of institutional adoption—but the groundwork, they say, is visible on-chain, on desks and in the flow data. “Bitcoin also reclaimed 110k USD and is close to its previous all-time high,” the report reminds readers. For Bitwise, that proximity is not an end point but a staging area: the monetary asset’s intrinsic value, they conclude, resides “considerably further north.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,617.

The company announced a substantial purchase of additional Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies, bringing their total investment in this asset class to an impressive $5 million . This decision, according to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, received official approval from the company’s board of directors, highlighting a deliberate and strategic approach to integrating digital assets into their financial planning. While the specific ‘other cryptocurrencies’ acquired were not detailed in the announcement, the focus on Bitcoin suggests a foundational belief in the leading digital asset’s value proposition. Why Are Companies Like Quantum BioPharma Pursuing a Bitcoin Investment Strategy? The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin investment and other digital assets to their balance sheets has been gaining momentum, particularly over the past few years. For companies like Quantum BioPharma, operating in a traditional sector like biotech, this move might seem unconventional at first glance. However, several compelling reasons often drive such decisions: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about currency devaluation and inflation rising globally, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value and a hedge against traditional financial system risks due to its decentralized nature and capped supply. Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets to a corporate treasury can help diversify risk beyond traditional cash, bonds, and equities. Digital assets offer a new avenue for potential growth independent of the core business operations. Potential for Growth: Despite volatility, the long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin and select cryptocurrencies remains attractive to investors seeking higher potential returns than traditional low-yield assets. Forward-Thinking Stance: Embracing digital assets can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, potentially appealing to a broader range of investors and stakeholders interested in the future of finance and technology. Cash Management: For companies holding significant cash reserves, especially in a low-interest-rate environment, deploying a portion into digital assets can be seen as a way to generate potential returns on otherwise stagnant capital. Quantum BioPharma’s decision underscores that the appeal of digital assets is extending beyond tech-centric firms and reaching into diverse industries, including the complex world of biotechnology and medical research. Understanding Corporate Crypto Holdings: More Than Just Bitcoin While Bitcoin often grabs the headlines, the concept of corporate crypto holdings encompasses a broader range of digital assets. Companies might choose to hold other cryptocurrencies for various strategic reasons: Ethereum (ETH): As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum is seen by some as a bet on the future of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. Stablecoins: Some companies might hold stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) for transactional purposes, ease of transfer, or as a temporary holding place within the crypto ecosystem, though Quantum BioPharma’s announcement focuses on investment assets. Altcoins: A smaller portion might be allocated to other altcoins based on specific research or perceived potential, although this carries significantly higher risk. Quantum BioPharma’s statement mentioning ‘other cryptocurrencies’ alongside Bitcoin suggests a diversified approach within the digital asset class, tailored to their specific risk tolerance and investment objectives. The $5 million total represents a significant commitment for a company whose primary focus is highly specialized scientific research. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption: A Growing Trend The move by Quantum BioPharma is part of a larger narrative of institutional crypto adoption . What began with a few pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla has evolved into a more widespread phenomenon. Investment funds, asset managers, and now companies from various sectors are exploring or actively engaging with digital assets. This trend is driven by increasing regulatory clarity in some regions, the development of more robust infrastructure for institutional investors (custody solutions, trading platforms), and a growing understanding of the digital asset market. Key indicators of this trend include: Examples of Companies with Significant Bitcoin/Crypto Holdings: Company Industry Notable Holdings (Examples) MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Significant Bitcoin holdings (often the largest corporate holder) Tesla Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy Bitcoin Block, Inc. (formerly Square) Financial Services Bitcoin Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin (from mining operations) Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange Various Cryptocurrencies While Quantum BioPharma’s $5 million holding is modest compared to giants like MicroStrategy, it is significant relative to the company’s likely balance sheet size and signals a broader acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate part of a corporate financial digital asset strategy . Navigating the Challenges and Risks Investing in cryptocurrencies is not without its challenges and risks, particularly for publicly traded companies like Quantum BioPharma. These include: Volatility: Digital asset prices can experience dramatic and rapid fluctuations, which can impact a company’s reported earnings and balance sheet valuation. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, creating potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires sophisticated security measures to protect against hacking, theft, and loss of private keys. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for cryptocurrencies are still developing, which can create complexities in financial reporting. Public Perception: While growing, mainstream acceptance of crypto is not universal, and some shareholders or customers may view such investments negatively. Quantum BioPharma’s board approval suggests they have likely considered these factors and established protocols for managing these risks, including secure custody solutions and a clear investment rationale. What Does This Mean for Quantum BioPharma and the Market? For Quantum BioPharma, this investment represents a strategic allocation of capital aimed at potentially enhancing treasury returns and diversifying assets. It positions them among a growing group of companies embracing the future of finance. The success or performance of this digital asset portfolio will likely be watched by investors and potentially influence future corporate treasury decisions within the biotech sector. For the broader market, Quantum BioPharma’s announcement adds another data point to the trend of institutional crypto adoption . Each new company, regardless of sector, that publicly discloses a significant crypto holding contributes to the legitimization and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. It signals to other corporate treasurers and boards that exploring a digital asset strategy is becoming a viable, albeit still relatively novel, option. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Crypto Quantum BioPharma’s move offers insights for other companies contemplating adding digital assets to their balance sheet: Board Education & Approval: Ensure leadership understands the asset class, risks, and rationale. Board approval is crucial for legitimacy and governance. Define Objectives: Clearly articulate why you are investing (e.g., inflation hedge, growth, diversification) and what percentage of the treasury is appropriate. Start with Bitcoin: BTC is often the first step due to its liquidity, market cap, and established narrative as ‘digital gold’. Research Custody Solutions: Securely storing digital assets is paramount. Explore reputable institutional-grade custodians. Consult Experts: Engage with legal, accounting, and financial advisors experienced in digital assets. Develop a Policy: Establish clear internal policies for acquisition, management, and risk mitigation. Quantum BioPharma’s $5 million commitment, while a fraction of their total assets, demonstrates that companies are moving beyond just exploring and are actively implementing a digital asset strategy . Conclusion: A Biotech Firm’s Bold Step into Digital Assets Quantum BioPharma’s decision to boost its corporate crypto holdings to $5 million, including significant Bitcoin investment , is a noteworthy development. It signifies the increasing penetration of digital assets into traditional industries and underscores the growing trend of institutional crypto adoption . While risks remain, the strategic rationale based on diversification, inflation hedging, and growth potential is clearly compelling for a growing number of corporate boards. This move by a Nasdaq-listed biotech firm further solidifies the position of digital assets as a legitimate component of a forward-thinking digital asset strategy for companies across diverse sectors.

Zheleznyak said the proposed law will not conflict with the nation’s international commitments. A group of MPs from the Holos party of Ukraine, led by Yaroslav Zheleznyak, submitted a legislative proposal No. 13356 to the parliament on Tuesday. The bill proposed the inclusion of digital assets such as Bitcoin and other crypto options into the country’s gold and foreign exchange reserves. Zheleznyak said that under the proposed bill, the National Bank of Ukraine can include digital assets in the nation’s reserves. The MP added that the central bank of Ukraine would have the authority to decide on the timing, approach, and volume of incorporating digital assets in the reserves. Zheleznyak argued that the proposal would not go against the country’s international commitments. Private sector supports the inclusion of digital assets in reserves 💥 BREAKING: 🇺🇦 UKRAINE PROPOSES BILL TO ALLOW CENTRAL BANK TO HOLD DIGITAL ASSETS IN NATIONAL RESERVES. BULLISH FOR CRYPTO & #XRP pic.twitter.com/8OKunadXRk — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 11, 2025 The government of Ukraine has been preparing an act to establish a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ukraine held approximately 46,351 BTC as of December 2024, valued at $4.8 billion, primarily acquired through asset seizures, donations, and fundraising during the war. The move to create a BTC reserve has received support from the private sector, with the regional Head of Binance for Central and Eastern Europe, Kirill Khomyakov, welcoming the proposal. Khomyakov revealed that establishing the BTC reserve would need significant legislation amendments. The head of Binance added that creating the reserve was a positive step, saying it would lead to clearer regulations regarding crypto assets. In April, Ukraine’s parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy passed a new legislation on crypto. The bill was, however, withdrawn following a request from the Office of the President and the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC). The commission later revealed that it had no authority to halt the bill. The NSSMC, however, submitted a list of 80 suggested changes and comments to the parliament. Central banks say Bitcoin unfit for reserves European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently trashed the idea of creating European crypto reserves. Lagarde stated there was no place for cryptocurrency in Europe’s central banking. The ECB President said she was confident digital assets would not enter the reserves of Europe’s central banks. Lagarde maintained that the national reserves should remain liquid, safe, and secure. The Czech National Bank also recently announced that its board had agreed to broaden its national reserves portfolio to incorporate other asset classes without pointing out Bitcoin or other digital assets. Poland’s central bank also recently revealed that it would not invest in crypto assets. The bank claimed that cryptocurrency was an asset class bearing a very high risk. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, recently stated that the central bank was not authorized to own digital assets. Martin Schlegel, the president of the Swiss National Bank, said in March that digital assets did not meet the bank’s currency reserve standards, dismissing crypto advocates’ demands that the institution hold BTC as a hedge against increasing global economic uncertainties. Crypto campaigner Luzious Meisser, also Bitcoin Suisse’s board member, argued that holding BTC made more sense as the world moved towards a multipolar order, where the official currencies, the euro and dollar, were weakening. The crypto campaigners had launched an initiative to mount pressure on the SNB to acquire Bitcoin, claiming that the economic crisis triggered by Trump’s tariffs made it more crucial for the institution to diversify government reserves. Schlegel rejected the suggestions, arguing that the digital asset’s market liquidity was a big concern as the institution was required at all times to be able to acquire or sell foreign exchange.

Analysis Company Explains The Reason Behind The Rise In ETH!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-is-on-the-rise-again-analysis-company-explains-the-reason-behind-the-rise-in-eth/,"The largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has risen to $ 2,800 with the rise it has experienced in the last 24 hours. While the market is expecting ETH to break and exceed the $ 3,000 level, the analysis company evaluated ETH's recent rise. Accordingly, analytics firm Matrixport said that Ethereum's recent rally was due to leverage and not fundamentals. In its latest analysis from the X account, Matrixport highlighted that Ethereum’s outflow was driven by the leveraged trading market rather than the spot market. Analysts stated that the ETH funding rate rose to 13.7%, the highest level since February, and that this level is generally a bullish sign and attracts ETH ETF inflows by mobilizing institutional investors. More importantly, ETH futures open interest is approaching its December 2024 peak, according to analysts, suggesting that leveraged investors, not spot buyers, are leading the ETH rally. “The current Ethereum rally is based on leveraged futures trading, not spot trading. “Ethereum open interest (OI) is near its all-time high from December of last year. Ethereum funding rate has also increased to 13.7%. This is the highest level since February.” Matrixport analysts recently noted a sharp increase in ETH call options. At this point, analysts comparing Ethereum and Bitcoin stated that ETH is driven by the leveraged market rather than spot demand, while Bitcoin continues to be driven primarily by spot demand. *This is not investment advice.

The round was led by cyber•Fund and Blockchain Capital, according to a release shared with crypto.news. The company was founded by Flashbots core contributors Stephane Gosselin and Daniel Worsley, along with ex-Coinbase engineer Ankit Chiplunkar. The round also included participation from Bybit’s Mirana Ventures and L2IV, following a $5 million angel round in 2024 backed by investors from Consensys, Wintermute, and prominent crypto figures. OneBalance addresses a longstanding issue in crypto: the user experience of interacting across multiple blockchains . Traditionally, users must navigate wallets, bridges, and gas fees across different chains. OneBalance aims to eliminate this complexity through its new Toolkit powered by “Resource Locks” — a technology that allows developers to build apps that operate across chains with one-click actions. You might also like: Dow Jones gains 142 points as Trump claims China trade deal is ‘done’ Seamless interactions without chain knowledge According to CEO Stephane Gosselin, OneBalance enables developers and fintechs to offer seamless interactions — sending, swapping, or earning yield — without users needing to know which chain they’re on or manage bridging and gas. “We’ve rethought blockchain development from the node up,” said Gosselin, adding that the platform maximizes value for users rather than enabling retail extraction. The key innovation, Resource Locks, improves on traditional cross-chain methods by parallelizing execution instead of waiting for sequential confirmations. This unlocks 40% faster transactions and simplifies the underlying complexity for users and developers alike. OneBalance has already demonstrated native Bitcoin-to-EVM swaps and plans to support Solana and other networks shortly. The Toolkit has been tested in a closed beta with early partners such as DSX, Vooi, Spritz Finance, and Nuvolari. Vasiliy Shapovalov of cyber•Fund said the firm doubled down after seeing how Resource Locks could unify fragmented userbases and liquidity across chains. “OneBalance isn’t only fixing UX—it’s extending crypto’s network effects,” he noted. OneBalance’s approach hinges on abstracting user balances across chains into a single “spendable” balance. Users no longer need to hold native gas tokens, as fees are paid using the tokens being transacted.

Have you been keeping an eye on Ethereum lately? There’s some pretty exciting news coming out about the network’s health and adoption. We’re seeing a significant surge in Ethereum network activity , pointing towards potentially robust growth and increasing interest in the ecosystem. According to data cited by Cointelegraph, sourced from growthepie, the Ethereum network recently hit a new milestone. In early June, it recorded a massive 17.4 million unique addresses. But the really striking figure? Since the beginning of the second quarter of the year, the number of addresses interacting across one or more blockchains connected to Ethereum has soared by an impressive 70.5%! Even looking at daily figures, June 10 saw a strong 16.4 million active addresses, confirming that this isn’t just a fleeting spike, but sustained high activity. What Does Surging Ethereum Network Activity Tell Us? When we talk about network activity, we’re essentially looking at how many people are using the blockchain and how often. A significant jump, like the 70.5% increase seen in Ethereum network activity since Q2, is a strong indicator of several positive trends: Increased Adoption: More addresses means more users, whether they are individuals, dApps, or institutions. Ecosystem Health: High activity suggests the applications and protocols built on Ethereum are seeing significant usage. Developer Interest: Growing user numbers attract more developers to build and innovate on the platform. Network Effects: As more people use the network, it becomes more valuable and attractive for others to join. This surge in activity isn’t just a vanity metric; it represents real-world interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, from simple token transfers to complex DeFi transactions and NFT minting or trading. Decoding the Rise in ETH Unique Addresses Let’s zoom in on the 17.4 million ETH unique addresses recorded. A unique address is essentially a distinct participant on the network. While one person or entity can control multiple addresses, a growing number of unique addresses often correlates with a growing user base. The jump to 17.4 million is a record high, signifying a significant expansion in the reach of the Ethereum network. Think of unique addresses as the total number of accounts ever created on the network. Active addresses, on the other hand, represent accounts that were involved in a transaction on a specific day. The fact that both unique addresses are at a record high *and* active addresses remain consistently high (16.4 million on June 10) paints a picture of both expanding reach and ongoing engagement. This sustained interaction is crucial for the long-term health and viability of the network. Connecting the Dots: Blockchain Activity Data and Market Trends Understanding blockchain activity data is key to grasping broader crypto market trends . Increased activity on a major network like Ethereum often signals growing confidence and participation in the wider crypto space. Here’s how the data connects: Correlation with Market Sentiment: Often, rising network activity coincides with positive market sentiment or periods of increased interest in specific sectors like DeFi or NFTs. Indicator of Utility: Unlike speculative trading, network activity based on transactions, smart contract interactions, etc., highlights the actual utility being derived from the blockchain. Forecasting Potential Bottlenecks: While positive, high activity can also put pressure on network resources, potentially leading to higher transaction fees (gas prices) if not managed by scaling solutions. The current surge suggests that despite market volatility, the underlying use cases for Ethereum remain strong and are attracting new participants. Implications for Ethereum Growth What does this significant activity mean for future Ethereum growth ? The outlook appears largely positive, but it’s not without its challenges. Potential Benefits: Strengthened Network Effects: More users make the network more valuable for developers and businesses. Increased Demand for ETH: As the native asset used for gas fees and staking, higher activity can increase demand for ETH. Innovation Boost: A large, active user base encourages ongoing development and deployment of new dApps and protocols. Validation of Scaling Solutions: The increased load highlights the necessity and growing adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions, which are crucial for handling higher transaction volumes efficiently. Potential Challenges: Network Congestion: Without sufficient scaling, high activity can lead to slower transaction times. Higher Gas Fees: Increased demand for block space drives up gas prices, making transactions more expensive for users. Competition: While Ethereum is a leader, other blockchains are also vying for users and developers. Sustained growth requires continuous innovation and effective scaling. Overall, the surge in activity is a powerful testament to the resilience and expanding utility of the Ethereum ecosystem. Navigating Crypto Market Trends : Actionable Insights For those participating in the crypto space, keeping an eye on crypto market trends and underlying network data like Ethereum’s activity is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: For Users: Be aware that increased activity can mean higher gas fees, especially during peak times. Explore Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, or Polygon PoS for potentially lower costs and faster transactions. For Developers: The growing user base presents a massive opportunity. Building on Ethereum or its Layer 2s offers access to a large and engaged community. Consider optimizing dApps for gas efficiency. For Investors: Surging network activity can be seen as a bullish signal for ETH and the broader ecosystem. However, it’s just one metric. Combine this data with other fundamental and technical analysis before making investment decisions. Understand that increased activity can also contribute to network strain, which is a challenge Ethereum is actively addressing with scaling upgrades. Stay Informed: Follow reliable data sources and news outlets to understand the drivers behind network activity and how ongoing developments (like future Ethereum upgrades) might impact it. This jump in activity underscores the importance of utility and adoption in the long run for blockchain networks. Conclusion The significant jump of 70.5% in Ethereum addresses interacting across blockchains since the start of Q2, pushing unique addresses to a record 17.4 million, is a powerful indicator. It signals expanding adoption, robust ecosystem health, and sustained interest in the Ethereum network and the applications built upon it. While challenges like scaling and potential fee increases remain, this surge in Ethereum network activity highlights the network’s continued relevance and growth potential in the dynamic world of crypto market trends . It’s clear that despite market fluctuations, the fundamental utility and reach of Ethereum are expanding, paving the way for exciting developments in the future of Ethereum growth .

This shows that Ukraine is ready to join other countries that are looking to establish the same bill to support their economy. This move comes as the war-torn country faces economic turmoil and financial uncertainty. Ukraine Proposes Bitcoin as Part of National Reserves The newly proposed draft law is officially registered as Law No. 13356 in the Ukrainian parliament. This new bill authorizes the National Bank of Ukraine to include Bitcoin and other virtual assets in foreign exchange reserves. These reserves already hold gold and other regular currencies. Now, digital assets might be added. This new law lets Ukraine’s central bank choose how and when to use these digital reserves. It does not force immediate action, but it creates a legal path for future decisions. The bank will be responsible for managing these assets wisely. The bill was introduced by People’s Deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a member of parliament who plays an important role in financial planning. He believes that allowing digital assets in the national reserves is a good way to keep up with global trends and improve the economy. Bitcoin As a Hedge Against a Difficult Global Economy Ukraine’s Bitcoin reserve plan comes at an important time. Many countries deal with high inflation, weaker currencies, and unstable markets. As the US dollar loses strength in the global market, some countries seek new ways to keep their economies safe. More people are seeing Bitcoin as a safe haven during an economic crash and a way to hedge against inflation. Ukraine’s interest in holding the flagship crypto for the long term shows that it is planning ahead to face these challenges. With a Bitcoin reserve, Ukraine hopes to stay stable during tough times and be ready to grow. Ukraine Aligns with Crypto-Adopting Nations Ukraine is not the only country making this change. Recently, countries like Pakistan have also talked about building Bitcoin reserves . The Pakistani government is trying new ideas to rebuild and grow its economy. El Salvador was the first to start this trend in 2021 and has already used Bitcoin to attract major investments. This shows how digital money can help boost economies if used wisely in national plans. In the U.S., a certain American military division reportedly supported establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . This shows growing belief in Bitcoin’s future value. Ukraine’s move aligns it with other countries that are changing how they handle money. If the new law passes and is used well, Ukraine could benefit in many ways. This could be a big step in modernizing Ukraine’s financial system and making the country more competitive globally.

Ravencoin ( RVN ) rose to $0.02180, up 145% from its lowest point in April, giving it a market capitalization of $330 million. The rally coincided with the broader crypto market surge that has pushed the total market cap of all coins close to $3.5 trillion. RVN’s rally started after Upbit, the biggest crypto exchange in South Korea listed it on June 4. Since then, more Ravencoin tokens have continued to move out of centralized exchanges, a sign that holders are not selling. Net outflows stood at $793,000 on Wednesday, up from $643,000 a day earlier.

Like Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) and Litecoin ( LTC ), its main difference from Bitcoin is a supply limit of 21 billion tokens, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. Ravencoin price technical analysis RVN price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that RVN token price bottomed at $0.008977 in April. It has since bounced back, rising to a high of $0.02573, its highest point since December last year. Ravencoin moved above the key resistance level at $0.0126, its lowest point in August last year. The coin is about to form a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages near a crossover. A golden cross is a widely followed bullish pattern that signals market strength. The Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator are both pointing upward, indicating that momentum is building. Ravencoin price has moved above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the 50% retracement at $0.03523, about 50% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.020 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Historically, Bitcoin’s climb has paved the way for exponential growth in altcoins, as investors diversify their portfolios in search of the next big opportunity. Among the many options available, analysts are increasingly pointing to Ruvi AI as a standout choice for investors ready to capitalize on this trend. Backed by tangible use cases, a highly successful presale, and promising growth potential, Ruvi AI has all the makings of the next big name in crypto. Bitcoin’s influence and the dawn of altcoin season Bitcoin’s price movements often set the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market. Its recent rise has not only renewed investor interest but also signaled the start of altcoin season—a period during which alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin in terms of percentage gains. Altcoins typically benefit from the trickle-down effect as investors seek assets with higher growth potential. Ruvi AI, a blockchain-based project driven by artificial intelligence, is emerging as a prime candidate for those looking to ride this wave. With solid fundamentals and an impressive presale performance, it presents a rare opportunity to secure a position in a high-growth asset while its value is still low. Ruvi AI’s presale success captures investor attention Ruvi AI has already proven its appeal through its ongoing presale, having raised $1.7 million and sold over 145 million tokens to enthusiastic investors. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2, Ruvi AI offers a low-cost entry point with immense upside potential. What makes Ruvi AI particularly compelling is its built-in valuation structure. Unlike speculative tokens, Ruvi AI’s $0.07 valuation post-presale is intentionally preplanned, providing clarity and predictability. Analysts predict the token could reach $1 post-listing, signaling a strong return on investment for early adopters.

CyberScope audit strengthens credibility Investor confidence in Ruvi AI is further bolstered by its ongoing third-party audit by CyberScope, a renowned auditing firm known for its commitment to safety and transparency. This initiative ensures the integrity of Ruvi AI’s operations and reassures investors that their funds are secure. Such efforts reflect Ruvi AI’s dedication to building trust while highlighting its long-term viability as a serious player in the cryptocurrency space. VIP investment tiers maximize returns Ruvi AI offers a unique advantage with its VIP investment tiers, designed to reward early investors with lucrative bonuses. Here’s a breakdown of the tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These structured tiers incentivize early participation, giving investors a clear path to maximize their returns while Ruvi AI continues to gain traction.

Nowa struktura powstała z inicjatywy administracji Donalda Trumpa, która zdecydowała się wykorzystać skonfiskowane środki w celu zabezpieczenia cyfrowych aktywów. Ten ruch nie wynika z przypadku. Z danych udostępnionych przez Gemini i Glassnode wynika, że ponad 30% całkowitej podaży BTC znajduje się w rękach scentralizowanych podmiotów. Wśród nich są fundusze ETF, giełdy kryptowalut, przedsiębiorstwa oraz rządy. W raporcie podkreślono, że zaangażowanie instytucji publicznych może mieć istotny wpływ na rozwój rynku. Każdy dolar wprowadzony przez państwowy kapitał przekłada się na wzrost wartości rynkowej w wysokości 25 dolarów. Co więcej, generuje 1,70 dolara trwałego wzrostu wartości sieci. Tego typu wpływ sygnalizuje coraz większe znaczenie strategicznych rezerw w świecie cyfrowych aktywów. Nowy sygnał dla inwestorów długoterminowych Bitcoin przestaje być kojarzony wyłącznie z aktywem spekulacyjnym. Wzrost liczby zasobów przenoszonych z giełd do niezależnych depozytariuszy wskazuje na proces konsolidacji. Zmienność kursu uległa zmniejszeniu, co ułatwia planowanie inwestycji w dłuższym horyzoncie. Obecne cykle rynkowe nie przypominają już gwałtownych skoków i spadków. Sprawdź, jak kupić Bitcoina. Źródło: CoinMarketCap Zamiast tego charakteryzują się spokojniejszymi, bardziej stabilnymi wzrostami. Rezerwa Strategiczna działa nie tylko jako narzędzie ochrony wartości. Stanowi również dowód na to, że państwa zaczynają włączać kryptowaluty do swoich modeli zarządzania finansami. Dla inwestorów oznacza to zwiększoną pewność, a także nowe formy zaangażowania kapitału instytucjonalnego. Zjawisko to może wpłynąć na dalsze umacnianie pozycji Bitcoina w globalnym systemie finansowym. Bitcoin Hyper – nowa warstwa funkcjonalności Pomimo coraz większej akceptacji ze strony instytucji, główna sieć Bitcoina długo pozostawała ograniczona w zakresie możliwości technologicznych. Sytuacja ta zmienia się dzięki projektowi Bitcoin Hyper. W ciągu pięciu dni sprzedaż tokena $HYPER przekroczyła milion dolarów. Sprawdź też najlepsze kryptowaluty poniżej 1 dolara. To efekt rosnącego zapotrzebowania na rozwiązania, które rozszerzają funkcjonalność Bitcoina bez naruszania jego podstawowych zasad bezpieczeństwa. Bitcoin Hyper to druga warstwa Bitcoina zbudowana na maszynie wirtualnej Solany, która działa w połączeniu z bazową warstwą BTC. Taka konstrukcja pozwala uzyskać ponad 2 tysiące transakcji na sekundę, zachowując przy tym odporność na manipulacje oraz decentralizację. Użytkownicy mogą realizować szybkie przelewy, korzystać z aplikacji zdecentralizowanych, a także uczestniczyć w nowych formach aktywności, takich jak staking czy zdecentralizowany handel. Mechanizm działania sieci Bitcoin Hyper System opiera się na transparentnym modelu. Użytkownik deponuje BTC w inteligentnym kontrakcie, który weryfikuje transakcję na podstawie danych z łańcucha bloków. Następnie sieć emituje równoważny token, możliwy do wykorzystania w ekosystemie Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER) . Po zakończeniu aktywności użytkownik może spalić token i odzyskać oryginalne BTC. W tle działają dowody zerowej wiedzy oraz weryfikacja danych przez light clients. Użytkownik przesyła bitcoiny do inteligentnego kontraktu, który potwierdza transakcję na podstawie danych z sieci głównej. Po weryfikacji powstaje równoważny token w sieci Hyper, gotowy do dalszego wykorzystania. Kiedy użytkownik chce wycofać środki, token zostaje unieważniony, a oryginalne Bitcoiny wracają do właściciela. Cały proces odbywa się z użyciem zaawansowanych metod kryptograficznych, które zapewniają bezpieczeństwo i zgodność z głównym łańcuchem bez konieczności angażowania pośredników. Właściciele tokena $HYPER mogą korzystać z produktów o podwyższonym zwrocie, zyskać dostęp do zaawansowanych narzędzi oraz uczestniczyć w dalszym rozwoju projektu. Twórcy aplikacji mają szansę uzyskać dofinansowanie i zwroty kosztów opłat sieciowych, jeśli zdecydują się wykorzystywać $HYPER w swoich kontraktach. Dane z rynku potwierdzają skuteczność modelu Bitcoin Hyper Podobne projekty już wcześniej osiągały znaczące wyniki. Arbitrum zgromadziło ponad 13 miliardów dolarów wartości zablokowanej oraz ponad milion aktywnych portfeli. Sieć Base, powiązana z Coinbase, przekroczyła wartość 2,5 miliarda dolarów i notuje ponad milion aktywnych adresów dziennie. Dane te to dowód na to, że dobrze zaprojektowane sieci drugiej warstwy mogą szybko zdobywać rynek i użytkowników. Bitcoin Hyper ma potencjał, żeby powtórzyć ten sukces i stać się jedną z najlepszych przedsprzedaży kryptowalut . Całkowita podaż tokenów została ustalona na 21 miliardów, bez alokacji dla uprzywilejowanych grup. Obecnie trwa przedsprzedaż tokena $HYPER, a jeden z większych inwestorów nabył niedawno tokeny za równowartość 55 tysięcy dolarów. Tego rodzaju ruchy ze strony dużych graczy często prognozują większe zmiany. Nowa rola Bitcoina w cyfrowym świecie Rozwój Rezerwy Strategicznej oraz wdrożenie sieci Hyper to dwa bieguny tej samej zmiany. Z jednej strony widać instytucjonalizację zasobów cyfrowych. Z drugiej pojawiają się narzędzia, które poszerzają zakres ich użycia. Bitcoin przestaje pełnić jedynie funkcję przechowywania wartości. Staje się środowiskiem operacyjnym dla całych aplikacji, usług i produktów nowej generacji. Bitcoin Hyper wnosi do sieci Bitcoina funkcjonalność, której dotąd brakowało. Dzięki nowej warstwie technicznej możliwe stają się szybkie transakcje, obsługa aplikacji finansowych, zdecentralizowanych projektów i rozwiązań opartych na inteligentnych kontraktach. Sieć zyskuje skalę, której wymaga nowoczesna gospodarka cyfrowa. Bitcoin nie pełni już wyłącznie roli cyfrowego magazynu wartości. W połączeniu z Bitcoin Hyper przechodzi transformację w platformę operacyjną dla szerszego ekosystemu finansowego. Może wspierać codzienne zastosowania, przepływy kapitału, tworzenie nowych usług oraz rozwiązań dla użytkowników i firm.

On the day of the event, TRUMP’s total market cap stood at $3.13 billion. In the lead-up to the dinner, the token had experienced a consistent inflow of capital, largely driven by whales competing for top positions. As of press time on June 11, the market cap has declined to $2.12 billion, a loss of approximately $1.01 billion. This equates to an average daily drop of about $50.5 million over 20 days.

Source: Finbold Since its controversial January launch, TRUMP has generally moved in tandem with the broader cryptocurrency market . However, the meme coin appears to have lost momentum, failing to rally alongside recent bullish trends that pushed Bitcoin ( BTC ) past the $110,000 mark before a slight pullback. TRUMP’s performance Following the dinner announcement, TRUMP occasionally outperformed the broader crypto market, boosted by aggressive whale accumulation. To this end, some whales recorded massive profits and losses while trading TRUMP . The dinner was a reward for the top 220 TRUMP holders, who collectively spent over $100 million to secure seats. The top 25 investors also received access to a private VIP reception with President Trump. The guest list featured notable figures such as crypto billionaire and Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun. Trump first announced the exclusive dinner in April, a move that sent the meme coin soaring, with prices spiking over 60% in a single day. On the other hand, the event sparked controversy, with critics, particularly Democratic leaders, accusing Trump of running a “pay-to-play” scheme and profiting from the presidency by selling access to wealthy investors.

Paired with predictions of a $1 token valuation, Ruvi AI is capturing the attention of investors, including those in Solana’s (SOL) community. This forward momentum signals a promising future for Ruvi AI as it builds credibility and positions itself as an innovative force in the market. Solana (SOL): The Standard in Speed and Decentralization Solana has long been regarded as a powerhouse in the blockchain space. With its capacity to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, the platform has become a favorite for developers creating decentralized applications (dApps) across industries such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming. Solana’s low transaction fees and high efficiency have cemented its standing as a leader in scalability. The network’s growing ecosystem of dApps and ongoing partnerships highlight its staying power.

Built as a cutting-edge superapp, Ruvi AI allows users to create AI-driven content including text, audio, video, and images. The $RUVI token fuels the platform, supporting transactions, premium feature access, staking rewards, and governance rights. This unique combination of blockchain and AI provides real-world use cases in industries like creative production and marketing, setting Ruvi AI apart from its competitors. Strong Start with a Record-Breaking Presale Ruvi AI’s presale trajectory has proved its potential to deliver substantial returns for early investors. Phase 1 sold out within two weeks at a price of $0.010 per token. Phase 2 followed with the token priced at $0.015, delivering early backers a 50% gain. With more than 1,500 investors now on board, Ruvi AI has successfully raised over $1.6 million. Adding to its growth path, the project has achieved its first exchange listing and formed a key partnership with a major trading platform. These milestones have increased the token’s accessibility and liquidity, with further updates expected soon. Investor excitement is bolstered by the team’s consistent delivery on its roadmap. Cyberscope Audit and Predictions of a $1 Valuation A major step forward for Ruvi AI is its collaboration with Cyberscope, an industry-leading firm known for rigorous blockchain and smart contract audits. The audit is a testament to Ruvi AI’s commitment to transparency and security, both critical factors in earning investor trust. This move reassures token holders of the platform’s reliability while enhancing its reputation in a competitive market. Meanwhile, experts analyzing Ruvi AI’s trajectory project that the $RUVI token could reach a valuation of $1 post-listing, underscoring the platform’s explosive growth potential. Such predictions highlight Ruvi AI’s ability to carve out its place in the blockchain landscape and appeal to forward-thinking investors. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI’s presale offers lucrative opportunities for early participants through its VIP investment tiers. Here is a detailed breakdown of potential returns based on the presale price of $0.015, the $0.07 listing price, and the expert-predicted $1 token valuation: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $70,000 (9,233% ROI).

Value at $1 Post-Listing : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). These scenarios reveal the incredible growth potential Ruvi AI offers to early adopters, making it a compelling choice for investors aiming to maximize returns. Why Choose Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI combines innovative technology with practical applications, making it more than just another cryptocurrency. Its integration of blockchain and AI delivers real-world solutions while its decentralized governance ensures a community-first approach. By undergoing a Cyberscope audit, Ruvi AI further solidifies its transparency and trustworthiness, two qualities crucial for long-term success. The Final Takeaway As Ruvi AI continues to gain traction, its presale progress, security audit, and expert-driven valuation forecasts showcase its potential to emerge as a leader in the blockchain sector.

As the markets start to rally again, the crypto market is watching Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is currently receiving growing attention from SHIB investors. SHIB Price Prediction Shiba Inu (SHIB) has one of the biggest ecosystems in the crypto sector, with over 1.5 million holders. This is in line with the cult-like following that the project has on social media. Many of them are waiting for the next market movement as an exit opportunity to direct capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . So far, Shiba Inu (MUTM) has not reacted to the price movement of Bitcoin (BTC). Its price has continued to trend downward, and it is down over 16% in the past month. While SHIB has a large market cap, placing it at position 19 by overall market cap size, it has struggled to find growth recently. The stagnant price movement comes amid recent upgrades to the blockchain that were expected to spur some major price movement. One explanation for why this is happening is meme coin fever. When the developer team has attempted to build some utility into the ecosystem, SHIB’s price movement is still mainly driven by hype. However, price movement is still expected, with SHIB investors eagerly waiting for SHIB to start rising so they can move into Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Future Of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning heads in the crypto world, thanks to its unique protocol design and the success of its ongoing presale. Unlike SHIB, which thrives on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has won over investors with utility. Mutuum Finance Protocol Is Built For Utility The Mutuum Finance protocol is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as borrowers, lenders, or liquidators. Lenders on the platform deposit their assets to earn passive income through interest. The interest rate they earn is set dynamically based on the pool’s utilization rate. Managing Market Volatility To protect the solvency of the protocol, Mutuum Finance has measures in place to manage on-chain liquidity and volume. These two metrics are crucial to prompt liquidations within the ecosystem. By ensuring there is enough liquidity, distressed positions can be quickly closed without price slippage. The project also used caps and strict parameters to control exposure. For example, when there is limited liquidity, the protocol could increase incentives for liquidators to quickly purchase debt, reducing the chances of insolvency. Price fluctuations are another major factor considered in Mutuum Finance. If there is heightened volatility, it can cause positions on the lending protocol to become undercollateralized. To avoid this scenario, the protocol uses the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio parameter. The LTV ensures there is enough of a moat for liquidators to come in and stabilize a position. Assets that are considered stable, based on various metrics, such as ETH and stablecoins, will be assigned a high LTV of up to 75% and a liquidity threshold of around 80%. Meanwhile, assets considered to be unstable based on a slew of metrics can get an LTV of up to 40% only. The liquidation threshold for these assets is also significantly lower at around 65%. These parameters ensure that during massive fluctuations, the loans on the protocol do not become undercollateralized. The protocol also assigns assets a reserve factor. This reserve factor is a portion of the interest that borrowers pay. It goes into an aggregate pool that is used to protect the protocol during extreme market movements. For stable assets, the reserve factor can be around 10%. High-volatility assets like meme coins can have a reserve factor of as high as 35%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Progress The Mutuum Finance (MUTM presale has been doing exceptionally well so far. Over $10.3 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from over 11,900 unique contributors. The presale tokens are currently going for $0.03 in phase 5 of the presale. In the upcoming phase 6, the price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. Over 26% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have already been sold, barely a week after it started. One of the leading contributors to the current fast pace of the presale is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . The giveaway has received widespread attention from the crypto community, boosting presale participation. To qualify for the giveaway, you only need to participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Summary Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that has increasingly received attention from Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors.

Traders are once again looking to Federal Reserve policy for direction. On Wednesday, June 11, the Dow Jones was up nearly 200 points, or 0.45%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.16%. At the same time, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.11%. Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | Source: TipRanks Markets are recovering on positive news from the trade front, even as monetary uncertainty remains in focus. Earlier on June 11, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that the country had reached a deal with China over rare earth minerals. The issue had been a major stumbling block in negotiations, with China determined to maintain control over the strategic resource. At the same time, China demanded access to U.S.-made advanced microchips, which are crucial for artificial intelligence development. While the trade news was positive, Federal Reserve policy remains a key concern for markets. Wednesday’s lower-than-expected inflation figures, just 2.4% year over year, suggest that there is room to cut interest rates to boost growth.

Most recently, Vice President JD Vance echoed Trump’s demands that the Fed should cut rates by at least one point. Vance also accused the Fed of committing “monetary malpractice” by refusing to cut rates. For the administration, lower rates could boost stock prices and spur economic growth—potentially improving Trump’s approval ratings. However, the Fed remains concerned about inflation risks, particularly those tied to Trump’s tariffs.

Yet, not all is smooth sailing. A $215 million token unlock on June 1, 2025, threatens to introduce major selling pressure. Volatility Meets Opportunity: SUI Charts A Risk-Reward Path According to SirRichard’s latest update on X, SUI has exhibited notable price swings, but its long-term outlook remains firmly bullish. The token recently pulled off a remarkable 150% rally, climbing from a low of $1.71 to a high of $4.30. This explosive move caught the attention of traders, especially as it coincided with a golden cross formation on the daily chart, a classic technical signal that often precedes major bullish continuation. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View Based on this setup, SirRichard believes SUI could be preparing for an even more significant leg up, potentially targeting new highs around the $7.56 mark. If this plays out, it would represent a staggering 380% gain from earlier levels. However, he also warned that the journey may not be without obstacles, particularly as other technical and fundamental signals begin to surface. A recent bearish crossover in the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) may hinder SUI’s bullish momentum in the short term. Additionally, the token unlock on June 1, 2025, resulting in the release of approximately $215 million worth of SUI into circulation, poses a potential risk. Such a large supply event could introduce selling pressure and spark short-term volatility if not absorbed smoothly by the market. Currently, immediate support lies between $3.40 and $3.43, which could act as a cushion in the event of a dip. On the upside, resistance is building around the $3.50–$4.00 zone. A firm break above this level would reignite bullish momentum, paving the way for SUI’s next upward surge. Bearish Winds Loom, But On-Chain Strength Holds Ground On the other hand, if bearish sentiment intensifies, the price could fall toward the $2.33 level, a key support that could be tested. Such a move would likely challenge bullish confidence and introduce volatility in the near term. Related Reading: Here’s Why SUI At $3.61 Could Be the Calm Before A Parabolic Surge Despite this, the broader outlook is supported by impressive network activity. SUI’s ecosystem has seen over $40 billion in aggregator volume, a significant metric pointing to strong participation and interest. Even more encouraging is the 24% increase in activity over the last 30 days, highlighting a growing user base and rising utility. These fundamentals serve as a strong counterbalance to short-term risks. If sustained, they could provide a firm foundation for renewed bullish momentum. As such, any price dip may offer a fresh opportunity for long-term investors.

Both firms recently submitted amendments for ETFs that would incorporate staking mechanisms for Solana (SOL) and Ether (ETH), but the SEC has argued that the funds may not meet the requirements to be classified as traditional ETFs under current U.S. regulations. While the objections appear procedural on the surface, they have reignited concerns about the broader compatibility of crypto innovation with outdated regulatory frameworks. New SEC crypto guidance just dropped: certain staking activities aren't securities transactions — but not everyone’s on board. https://t.co/Igzg1Nm7zX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 Palisade: SEC at Odds with Itself on Staking Manthan Davé, co-founder of Ripple-backed digital asset custodian Palisade, said the SEC’s objections reflect a deeper discomfort with the evolving structure of digital asset markets. “The SEC’s latest resistance to staking-enabled ETFs underscores a deeper institutional discomfort with digital asset models that blur traditional definitions,” Davé explained. “At face value, the regulator’s warning to REX-Osprey appears procedural. However, dig deeper and it reflects a regulatory body caught between policy intent and market reality.” Davé noted that the SEC has previously indicated that staking may not constitute a securities activity—a position welcomed by much of the crypto industry. Yet the agency’s current hesitance to approve ETFs that rely on staking suggests a contradiction that threatens to discourage innovation. Calls for Regulatory Coherence Amid Growing Market Demand According to Davé, asset managers are looking for clarity, not contradiction. “Institutions and asset managers looking to package next-gen digital asset products need more than ambiguity. They need regulatory coherence.” He warned that without clearer frameworks, the U.S. risks losing its edge as a hub for digital finance innovation. “We’ve seen this movie before: regulatory opacity pushing innovation offshore, with capital following closely behind,” Davé said. He urged the SEC to rethink its approach and adapt to how crypto markets actually function. “Staking isn’t some fringe feature, it’s intrinsic to how modern blockchains operate and secure value,” he said. “The path forward lies in engaging with technical realities and designing fit-for-purpose classifications for crypto-native activities like staking.” The post SEC’s Staking ETF Pushback Shows Regulatory Uncertainty, Says Ripple-Backed Custodian appeared first on Cryptonews .",Crypto Regulation News|News|ETFs|securities and exchange commision|Staking,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-11 17:37:12

The giant company, which announced its attempt to purchase Bitcoin, this time made a surprise move of $500 million for an altcoin.

This decision has helped calm global tensions and bring hope to the markets. Both countries agreed to return to the Pre-Liberation status quo . This means they will go back to the way things were before recent conflicts. Following this deal, the crypto market went up. Bitcoin (BTC) rose again to around $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) also grew strongly, reaching the $3,000 mark. US and China Reach Trade Deal Framework Talks that began on Monday led to an agreement by Wednesday, as officials from both the US and China confirmed they had found common ground. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the two countries had agreed on a basic framework that would begin once both presidents gave their final approval. He explained that the first step was to remove negativity so progress could follow. China’s Vice Minister of Commerce also said that both sides had settled on steps to implement the deal. Key parts of the agreement include China lifting limits on rare earth exports and the US easing some export bans. The deal will move forward once both Presidents review and approve it. Crypto Market Reacts Strongly The news of the truce sparked a strong reaction in the crypto market. The flagship crypto climbed higher , reaching near its all-time high. This price increase has sparked optimism among coin supporters with BTC up 2.2% to $109,572 On June 11, Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor, said that the digital gold could reach the $1 million price mark, claiming the crypto winter is over. Ethereum increased by 5.5% in just 24 hours and is now trading at $2,772. Many traders believe it may soon cross the $3,000 level. Altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) coins also saw big gains. Some DeFi tokens recorded double-digit increases. If this trend continues, the total market value of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin, could rise from $857 billion to $1.7 trillion. Stock Market Also Shows Growth The optimism was not limited to cryptocurrencies. US stock markets also showed strong signs of growth. Dow futures grew by 100 points. Also, major stocks like Tesla rose 2.3% during pre-market trading on June 11. This strong crypto market response reflects investors’ renewed confidence in the crypto and financial market. The agreement between the U.S. and China is a major step toward better relations. It has already helped lift financial markets. If the president approves the deal soon, it could lead to further growth in crypto and stock markets.

No wonder developers working on Bitcoin Core have some influence on Bitcoin per se. Lately, they have been pushing to remove limits on arbitrary data from blocks (non-monetary data, such as text messages, pictures, and more). Despite the backlash from the Bitcoin community, the Bitcoin Core developers pushed for implementation, arguing with their peers. Citrea is named as the implementation’s stakeholder. Table of Contents What exactly Bitcoin Core is going to change? Conflicting reasoning for the change The community battle What exactly Bitcoin Core is going to change? Bitcoin Core will remove OP_RETURN in the next version, scheduled for release in October. OP_RETURN is a script Bitcoin Core devs added to Bitcoin in 2014. It aimed to limit the arbitrary data (Bible verses, images, etc) in each block and separate it from more crucial information associated with BTC transactions so that the network would ignore this data while working with monetary data. There can be only 83 bytes of space per block intended for arbitrary data recorded in unspendible TX outputs. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin Core developers have encouraged bitcoiners not to use the Bitcoin blockchain for recording arbitrary data, as there are better options that would not pile extra pressure on the Bitcoin network. The OP_RETRUN segment in the Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 release description reads: “[OP_RETURN] is not an endorsement of storing data in the blockchain. The OP_RETURN change creates a provably-prunable output, to avoid data storage schemes – some of which were already deployed – that were storing arbitrary data such as images as forever-unspendable TX outputs, bloating bitcoin’s UTXO database. Storing arbitrary data in the blockchain is still a bad idea; it is less costly and far more efficient to store non-currency data elsewhere.” However, 11 years later, Bitcoin Core developers decided to remove the 83-byte limit, allowing users to set their own limits manually. By default, there will be no limitations at all. It may fuel the use of the Bitcoin blockchain for backing various media content, etc. It’s worth noting that even with an 83-byte limit, Bitcoin has always been used for arbitrary data transactions. The limit is thought to keep Bitcoin safe from overloading and spam. Read more: NFT sales on Bitcoin hit record in December 2023 The changes were implemented despite much criticism from the community. The way Bitcoin Core was pushing the change stirred controversy that reached people not engaged in the tech backrooms of Bitcoin. Conflicting reasoning for the change In a statement released on June 6, 2025, Bitcoin Core cited censorship resistance as the reason for the change. However, developer Peter Todd, who created a pull request calling for the removal of OP_RETURN, raised a different reason. He called the data recorded in unspendable TX outputs a harmful burden for developers and emphasized that removing the limit altogether is more efficient: “As was discussed in the mailing list discussion, entities are using unspendable outputs in lieu of OP_Return outputs. Precisely because of the size limit. This increases the UTXO set size unnecessarily, a harmful effect of having the arbitrary OP_Return output limitations There’s no reason why Bitcoin Core should be forced to take on the maintenance burden of maintaining arbitrary limits that we believe are ineffective, and even harmful.” One of the problems with this case is the issue of centralization. The Knots software is one of the preferred alternatives to Bitcoin Core, but its influence on the network is way lower. As Peter Todd puts it in one of his messages, “We […] know that Knots isn’t going to be effective at preventing transactions from being mined even if it gets, say, 50% of nodes and 25% of hash power. You need Bitcoin Core on board to have any chance of success.” At the same time, the Bitcoin Core statement reads, “While we recognize that this view isn’t held universally by all users and developers, it is our sincere belief that it is in the best interest of Bitcoin and its users, and we hope our users agree.” This portion of the statement somewhat conflicts with the second paragraph, which states, “Bitcoin Core contributors are not in a position to mandate [certain policies].” > Bitcoin Core is just one protocol implementation that can be copied and modified by anybody; the only thing that makes it special is the way its contributors make decisions. 🤦🏻‍♂️ What makes Core “special” is not just that, it’s that it is by far the most popular node… — C (@RIPreason) June 9, 2025 An Ocean Mining executive using the Bitcoin Mechanic handle assumes that Citrea could back the proposal.

Bitcoin Core and their sponsors have ensured that Bitcoin isn’t just boring old money anymore! https://t.co/rcNUP6d5Un — Justin Bechler (@1914ad) June 9, 2025 Moreover, the way Bitcoin Core developers insisted on their vision, ignored or hid the messages of opposition on various platforms, or attempted to move the discussion away from public spaces, contributed to the controversy surrounding the debate that made waves across the cryptocurrency community. Previously, at this level of controversy PRs were just closed after being called controversial but not now Clearly, the motivation behind this has nothing to do with improving the protocol — Delta-V (@SellSideShits) June 9, 2025 However, Bitcoin Core devs insist that they are right.

They say growing hostility toward the brand has stopped them from enjoying the cars they picked, many of which they chose for environmental reasons. The action is still in its early stages. Judges at Paris’s commercial court will first decide whether to allow the case to proceed. If they do, the court will examine the merits of the customers’ arguments. Around ten drivers are already named in the lawsuit, and the group’s lawyers say more Tesla users in France can join the legal action. That means the number of customers could grow if others agree that Musk’s statements affect the value and treatment of their vehicles. French Tesla owners seek to return cars early without penalty Most Tesla leases in France run for about four years. At the end of those contracts, lessees usually have the option to buy the car outright at a set price. The suit asks the court to declare those leases void, letting drivers return their cars early without penalty. The complaint points to a string of Musk’s recent acts that the plaintiffs say are inflammatory. They include what looks like a Nazi salute Musk made on camera after Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, as well as his public claim that Britain’s Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, was “complicit in rape” over his handling of historic child abuse cases when he led prosecutions in the UK. According to the lawsuit, Musk’s behavior has left Tesla owners facing extra costs and risks. The drivers say they now deal with a higher chance of having their cars vandalized, they pay bigger insurance bills, and their vehicles’ resale values have fallen because of the backlash. Lawyers Patrick Klugman and Ivan Terel gave specific examples of damage. Klugman said one client found a swastika carved deep into the metal of their Tesla. Terel added that another had to clean up after vandals defecated on the bonnet of their car. The plaintiffs base their claim on French civil law, which requires lessors to allow renters to “peacefully enjoy” what they have rented. Klugman argued that, because of Musk’s political statements, some Tesla drivers have become “prisoners of their contracts,” unable to use their cars freely without fear of attack. “It will be interesting to see someone who is so liberal like Mr. Musk confronted with the responsibility of their words on their business,” Klugman told the Financial Times. “Freedom, even among the most liberal among us, doesn’t come without responsibility. The actions of business leaders engage their businesses.” The lawsuit comes as Tesla’s sales in Europe have dropped sharply. In France, new registrations of Tesla cars fell by 67% in May compared with the same month a year earlier. That marked the lowest level of new Tesla registrations in France since July 2022, according to data from Plateforme Automobile. Over the past few months, Tesla has reduced sticker prices by up to 20% in major markets. While these cuts have spurred some purchases, they’ve also undercut the brand’s premium image and squeezed earnings. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said on Monday that despite recent tensions with Elon Musk, he plans to keep his Tesla and continue using Musk’s Starlink service. Trump said he “wished Musk well” and suggested the CEO might want to reach out to him soon—“maybe he has already called,” Trump added. Tesla shares rose roughly 1%, marking their fourth consecutive daily gain, after Musk publicly expressed regret for specific social media comments about Trump. That rare show of contrition appeared to calm some investors.

The authors say stablecoins can improve cross-border transaction speed, lower costs, and avoid interference with monetary policy. Tether’s existing CNY-denominated stablecoins are mentioned as early proof of technical feasibility and limited demand. Developing an offshore yuan-backed stablecoin could help expand the currency’s international use without compromising domestic monetary controls, according to a commentary published by China Economic Times on June 10 and authored by Shen Jianguang and Zhu Taihui of JD Group. The article argues that issuing a CNY stablecoin outside mainland China, beginning with Hong Kong , would support the currency’s presence in global trade and finance while avoiding direct conflict with existing capital controls. Hong Kong Seen as Launchpad for Expanding CNY’s Global Use The authors describe the approach as a practical response to the growing dominance of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins in international transactions. “Offshore CNY stablecoins are a tool for supporting cross-border trade settlements and financial services, without interfering with domestic monetary policy,” the commentary states. Hong Kong is seen as the most viable launch site due to its regulatory environment and digital finance infrastructure. The authors recommend a phased rollout strategy, starting in Hong Kong and expanding to other free-trade zones such as the Shanghai FTZ and Hainan. The commentary emphasizes that unlike volatile crypto assets, stablecoins can facilitate 24/7 settlement, lower remittance costs, and offer transparency through blockchain rails. It cites the World Bank’s estimate that traditional cross-border remittances average five days and cost over 6%, while stablecoin transfers can occur instantly and for a fraction of a cent. “Delays and manual intervention in current fund transfer systems limit yuan’s usability abroad,” the authors wrote. “Stablecoins offer a parallel track that enhances efficiency and expands usage.” Offshore Stablecoin Could Extend Yuan’s Reach The article also responds to concerns about monetary leakage or policy dilution, suggesting that technical restrictions can prevent domestic circulation. Regulatory measures, including the travel rule, AML compliance, and large transaction screening, are described as sufficient for managing risks. Tether’s issuance of CNY-denominated stablecoins totaling over 20 million yuan (~ US$2.8 million) is cited as evidence that offshore yuan digital assets are technically viable and already in limited use. Shen and Zhu also suggest that a public-private issuance model could further support adoption, especially for trade settlement and fund investments. Shen is the chief economist of JD Group, while Zhu is the senior research director. @JD_Corporate is testing a fiat-pegged stablecoin in Hong Kong’s regulatory sandbox for cross-border payments and retail use. #stablecoin #hongkong https://t.co/WlxEcenrfl — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 Offshore stablecoins could also offer China an alternative financial channel in a dollar-dominated system, especially in regions facing dollar access constraints. This would give Chinese institutions more control over bilateral trade flows without relying on U.S.-led infrastructure. Still, scaling such a system would require international regulatory alignment. Without clear legal frameworks and credible reserve structures, CNY stablecoins risk being viewed as policy tools rather than reliable instruments of settlement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might offshore CNY stablecoins interact with other forms of digital money like CBDCs or tokenized deposits? Offshore CNY stablecoins could function alongside central bank digital currencies by covering use cases where full central bank backing isn’t necessary while offering more flexibility in cross-border environments where CBDCs are not yet interoperable. Could offshore CNY stablecoins reduce China’s reliance on SWIFT and other Western-controlled systems? By allowing direct digital settlement between trading partners, offshore stablecoins could bypass traditional messaging and clearing systems, reducing exposure to sanctions and geopolitical friction. What technical hurdles could limit the adoption of offshore CNY stablecoins? Cross-chain interoperability, on-chain compliance enforcement, and liquidity management across jurisdictions remain unresolved.

While momentum remains bullish, the memecoin is now approaching a major confluence of resistance that could prompt a temporary correction before further upside continuation. Pepe’s ( PEPE ) recent rally has been impressive, posting a clean 30% gain off a well-defined swing low. However, price is now testing a critical resistance cluster, which includes the point of control (POC), a high-timeframe horizontal resistance, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level from the previous decline. This area is technically significant and often associated with distribution or profit-taking zones. Key technical points 30% Rally from Swing Low: PEPE has rebounded strongly from a key support, marking a potential trend shift. Major Resistance Confluence Ahead: Price is now testing the POC, 0.618 Fibonacci, and high-timeframe resistance zone. Correction May Be Healthy: A rejection here would align with normal bullish structure, potentially forming a higher low. PEPEUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, the area PEPE is entering now acts as a natural resistance zone, where buyers may begin to slow down and profit-taking could emerge. This resistance band is reinforced by: The point of control, where the most volume has traded historically, A macro 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a key reversal level in trending markets, And a high-timeframe horizontal resistance, which previously capped bullish momentum. Given the strength of the recent move, a pullback would be considered healthy, particularly if it results in a higher low forming near the last major breakout level. This would reinforce the current bullish structure and set the stage for a sustainable rally in the next leg up. You might also like: ADA, TON surge expose market weakness; BlockDAG’s X1 app sets new record with 1.5M users However, if the bullish momentum is particularly strong, there is still a chance PEPE breaks above this resistance cluster. In that case, bulls will need to push through the value area high, which would confirm a new swing high and shift the short-term outlook decisively in favor of continued upside. Until then, this region remains a critical decision zone where price must prove whether bulls are in full control, or if a rotation lower is required before the next leg. What to expect in the coming price action PEPE is now at a major crossroads. If bulls fail to break through the POC–0.618 resistance zone, a pullback toward high-timeframe support is the most likely outcome. This would allow for a healthy retest and potential higher low, keeping the uptrend intact. A breakout, however, would signal accelerating strength and continuation toward new highs.

The program evaluates on-chain enforcement of KYC and transfer restrictions using ERC-20 and ERC-3643 standards. Participants describe the pilot as a foundation for future digital money infrastructure rather than a consumer-facing rollout. Hong Kong’s central bank has moved into the next stage of digital currency testing, with the second phase of its e-HKD pilot focusing on live applications in asset settlement, cross-border payments, and programmable finance. In a report published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in collaboration with Visa , ANZ, Fidelity International, and ChinaAMC, active trials involving tokenized money, fund units, and smart contracts are designed to simulate real-world transaction flows between banks and asset managers across jurisdictions. Hong Kong Tests Tokenized Cross-Border Fund Settlement One of the core tests involves allowing an Australian investor to purchase a Hong Kong-based money market fund using tokenized Australian dollars exchanged for tokenized Hong Kong dollars. The process combines permissioned bank infrastructure with public blockchain settlement using Chainlink’s interoperability protocol. We’re excited to share that Chainlink is facilitating the secure exchange of a Hong Kong CBDC and an Australian dollar stablecoin as part of an ongoing use case in Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program. Congratulations to participants @Visa , ANZ, China AMC, and Fidelity… pic.twitter.com/ts2C6Vt4Ul — Chainlink (@chainlink) June 9, 2025 While the HKMA previously explored conceptual use cases, the current phase focuses on execution under constrained but operational conditions. This includes integrating compliance checks, reserve management, and identity verification into an end-to-end cross-border payment system. The testing environment also experiments with different token standards, including ERC-20 and ERC-3643, to evaluate how regulatory features such as transfer restrictions and KYC enforcement perform on-chain. The participants describe this stage as a proving ground for core infrastructure rather than a retail rollout. “We are extremely excited about the future of tokenization for payments,” said Visa Crypto’s Head of Institutional Client Solutions, Catherine Gu. “Visa’s long-term collaboration with the HKMA and our partners for two consecutive years has provided us with many valuable insights around tokenization technology and new business flows,” said Gu. e-HKD Pilot Explores Real-World CBDC Use The results could help shape how financial institutions structure cross-chain asset transfers, settle trades without intermediaries, and align blockchain design with existing compliance frameworks. While the pilot is still limited in scope, its architecture reflects the technical and regulatory compromises required to embed digital money into global financial plumbing. Other central banks have focused on retail pilots or isolated technical proofs. In contrast, Hong Kong is testing how digital money moves through actual financial workflows—across borders, institutions, and legal jurisdictions. The pilot raises a larger question about control over the rules encoded in programmable money. When compliance and restrictions are built into tokens, authority may move from legal contracts to code, changing how institutions manage trust and enforcement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How could programmable CBDCs affect central bank oversight in cross-border markets? Programmable features may allow central banks to embed rules directly into currency flows, reducing the need for external enforcement. What risks could arise if financial institutions rely on third-party blockchain infrastructure for CBDC operations? Dependence on external networks could introduce vulnerabilities in data security, protocol governance, and operational continuity, particularly if control lies outside domestic regulatory reach. How does token standard experimentation in CBDC pilots relate to future financial regulation? Testing standards like ERC-3643 helps regulators evaluate how to codify legal restrictions into digital assets. This may inform how laws are translated into technical specifications, shifting enforcement into infrastructure.

Speaking at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Scott said the deficit for the 2025 fiscal year is expected to fall somewhere between 6.5% and 6.7% of GDP—the third straight year the figure has sat above 6%. “What we are seeing here is a blowout in the spending,” he said. Scott made clear he’s not interested in hearing critiques from the other side of the aisle. “I find it very difficult to be lectured to by people who created the largest deficit in history,” he said, calling out Democrats for backing policies that pushed federal expenditures past historical thresholds. The 2024 fiscal year, which ended in September, recorded a 6.4% deficit, following 6.2% in 2023. He accused Democrats of abandoning any pretense of financial restraint, slamming their policies as the main force behind America’s worsening fiscal health. Scott Bessent clashes with Democrats over tax policy and debt concerns Democratic Representative Mike Thompson pushed back against Scott during the hearing, arguing that it’s not just spending but Republican-led tax cuts that have piled on to the national debt. “Every expert will tell you that the proposed Trump tax cuts will also add to our debt,” Thompson said. But Scott refused to link the Trump administration’s tax policy to the deficit and instead placed the blame back on rising discretionary spending. Tension flared again when Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, who opposed the GOP tax bill, suggested that concerns over rising deficits had pushed bond yields higher. “Representative Massie doesn’t understand the bond market,” Scott said. He called it “incorrect” to judge the market based on a single day of trading and argued that US 10-year yields are actually lower than they were at the start of the year—unlike Germany and Japan, where yields have risen. Richard Neal, the ranking Democrat on the committee, tried to shift attention to tax revenue. He claimed it was on the rise due to President Joe Biden’s boost to the IRS budget, but Scott laughed and shut that down immediately. He said the real reason for improved revenue collection is that the IRS is still using outdated systems, not because of increased staff. “They focused on hiring more people instead of fixing the tech,” said Scott, adding that the agency’s infrastructure was in such bad shape that any efficiency gain was coming in spite of Democrat-led efforts, not because of them. Bessent denies Fed rumor and defends industrial policy The conversation took a turn when speculation over Scott possibly replacing Jerome Powell as Fed Chair was raised. That rumor’s been bouncing around Wall Street, but Scott denied it under oath. “If those conversations are happening, I’m not in them,” he said. The White House has also dismissed the idea publicly, but the buzz hasn’t stopped. Still, Scott didn’t spend much time on it, choosing instead to double down on his policy goals. He quickly pointed to US industrial capacity as another priority, saying, “There are strategic industries in the US where we must have an industrial base, and I would put steel in the top three.” He argued that the Offshore Balanced Budget Bill (OBBB) is the only way for the US to stay competitive with other countries that subsidize their industries. But that claim didn’t go unchallenged. Linda Sanchez, a Democrat on the committee, brought in a report by the Yale Budget Lab, which predicts the OBBB will increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion by 2034. Scott shot back, “The Yale Budget Lab is staffed by former Biden officials,” clearly dismissing the report as politically biased despite it being labeled nonpartisan. Before wrapping up, Republican Lloyd Smucker from Pennsylvania asked Scott about his 3-3-3 plan—a strategy that promises 3% GDP growth, a 3% deficit-to-GDP ratio, and 3 million more barrels of oil per day in production. When asked if the plan was still on track, Scott didn’t blink. “Yes,” he said .

Here’s Why Pepeto Could Be the Hottest Token This Summer,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/torn-between-pepe-and-pepeto-heres-why-pepeto-could-be-the-hottest-token-this-summer/,"In the crypto space, it is common knowledge that altcoins tend to spark activity once Bitcoin gains upward momentum. And right now, two meme coins keep popping up: Pepe and Pepeto. Pepe had its big moment, but now Pepeto is stealing the spotlight with its innovative ecosystem and a presale that’s already raising millions. Just think of Pepeto as an improved version of Pepe, not a copycat. If you missed Pepe’s debut rise last year, you might have another chance with Pepeto. What Makes Pepeto Stand Out? If you’re familiar with the cryptocurrency space, you’ll know that Pepe was the king of meme-coins. However, Pepeto rose to fix some of its problems. Unlike Pepe, which has unlimited coins, Pepeto burns 5% of every transaction, making the remaining coins more valuable over time. Additionally, Pepeto isn’t just a meme; it’s building a play-to-earn game with NFT rewards, so it has real-world use. Imagine it this way: Pepe = Fun meme, but no plans after the hype. Pepeto = Fun meme plus games, rewards, and an innovative ecosystem to keep growing. Pepeto’s Presale: Why’s Everyone Talking About It? The Pepeto presale has been gaining momentum for several months, and savvy investors are jumping in early as it gradually nears its end. Right now, you can purchase Pepeto tokens for $0.000000133 each. However, this price won’t last long, as the presale has already raised over $5.3 million, indicating that people believe in this project.

Currently, they’re burning tokens (making yours more valuable) and creating NFT rewards. And the best part? You’re getting in before everyone else. Once the presale ends and it hits big exchanges, early buyers could see massive gains. Don’t wait. Join the presale now. Why It’s Time for The Pepe Legacy to Move On Pepe the Frog was the meme coin king of 2023, as it shocked everyone with its incredible rise. At its all-time high, early investors made life-changing profits.

In a new interview on Bloomberg Television, the Tudor Investment Corporation founder says that the US government is in a debt trap, and will need to run negative real rates – or set interest rates lower than the rate of inflation, in order to devalue its debt. Jones says that the “playbook is clear” as far as what the government is going to need to do, giving an edge to investors looking to position themselves. Besides stocks, he mentions Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold as portfolio staples moving forward. “We’re going to have negative real rates and that’s why you have to think about what is facing our policy makers in this debt trap as you construct your portfolio. So, what would an ideal portfolio be in something like that? Well, what has worked so far? What has worked so far has been some combination of stocks – which won’t do great, which would do terribly if they called us out on the bond market… But it would be some combination of probably volatility-adjusted Bitcoin, gold, stocks. That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation.” The investor also said he believes that President Trump will attempt to install a new Fed Chair who is “uber dovish” in order to get rates down and achieve the desired market environment. At time of writing, both BTC and gold are just slightly below their all-time highs.

Techsmart Telecom, the Institute of Information Technology and CyberSecurity (IITCS), Venom Foundation, and GS Fund Abu Dhabi have formalized a targeted partnership to design and deploy an integrated digital ecosystem. The heart of this partnership lies in the fusion of infrastructure, blockchain network implementation, legal oversight, and talent development. Techsmart Telecom will leverage its national connectivity to underpin a new data center and digital currency network.This move aligns with broader national ambitions: Vietnam's Digital Infrastructure Strategy by 2025, towards 2030 aims for universal fiber, full 5G, and hyperscale data center capabilities. Venom Foundation will implement its Layer-0 blockchain protocol, designed for institutional-grade applications. The network already operationally supports USD-backed stablecoins, on-chain KYC/AML, ISO 20022 messaging, and tokenisation frameworks underpinned by pilots in the Philippines . CEO Christopher Louis Tsu frames the project as a showcase for tokenizing both financial and real-world assets, delivering efficient cross-border services. Regulatory coherence is a central driver. In March 2025, Prime Minister directives mandated the Ministry of Finance and State Bank of Vietnam to propose updated frameworks by May 2025. Proposals include a Draft DTI Law to define digital assets, a sandbox for controlled experimentation, and a Crypto Pilot Resolution to regulate issuance, trading, and custody until at least 2027. Vietnam's crypto landscape remains in transition. An estimated 17 million citizens own digital assets worth over $100 billion, positioning the country fifth globally in interest and third in international trading engagement. However, ambiguity around exchange licensing, asset categorization, and consumer protection has resulted in Vietnam being categorized as FATF ""gray list"" — a status that underscores the urgency of regulatory clarity. Execution will begin with a 12-month Phase 1 roadmap focused on legal groundwork, market analysis, and data center planning — areas that have posed bottlenecks in past blockchain initiatives. By aligning technology deployment with talent creation, this effort could accelerate Vietnam’s leap into a sovereign digital infrastructure era. Subsequent phases envision blockchain-enabled digital payments, decreasing cash dependency, and elevating cybersecurity standards using distributed ledger technologies. IITCS will ensure compliance and lead educational initiatives aimed at both public and private sectors. Success will hinge on multi-agency collaboration and the agility to adapt pilot learnings into scalable policy frameworks. Should this MoU translate into concrete progress, Vietnam may emerge as a regional exemplar in embedding blockchain within national infrastructure.

In the June 6 SEC filing, the digital asset mining firm revealed it was holding 215 Bitcoin in its reserves as of May 31. Based on current prices, the stash is worth $23.6 million. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin was changing hands at $109,605 at publication time . This marks the company’s first sizable Bitcoin acquisition since announcing a Bitcoin treasury play, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy — which started accumulating BTC in 2020. American Data Center, owned by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., merged with Bitcoin mining company Hut8 to form American Bitcoin in March. The Trump brothers own 20% of American Bitcoin, while Hut 8 holds the remaining 80%. The newly established entity plans to go public as early as the third financial quarter of this year through a stock-for-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining and will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ABTC. “ABTC considers its reserve a core strategic asset, managed adaptively to support balance sheet strength with a view to enhancing long-term stockholder value. Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC’s business. It is the business,” the firm said. The company added that its accumulation strategy is open-ended, suggesting that it has no fixed BTC target. Instead, it will continuously assess market conditions to raise capital when favorable and boost its holdings of the foremost cryptocurrency. American Bitcoin’s strategy to grow its Bitcoin stash comes as a slew of public and private companies increasingly add the asset to their corporate treasuries. Companies including Trump Media , GameStop , and Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain became the latest to announce or advance their Bitcoin treasuries, joining the likes of Semler Scientific , Cantor-backed Twenty One , and Metaplanet . Though American Bitcoin is separate from the Trump Organization, it may eventually team up with World Liberty Financial — the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform launched by Trump’s eldest sons late last year.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-11 18:11:32

Here Are Expert Opinions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-for-bitcoin-following-the-inflation-data-shock-in-the-us-and-trumps-statements-on-china-here-are-expert-opinions/,"With inflation in the US remaining below expectations, the Bitcoin (BTC) price remained stable in the $110,000 band. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May increased by 2.4% on an annual basis, while headline inflation rose for the first time since January, while the overall inflation trend continued to slow. Core inflation remained stable at 2.8%. Financial markets showed limited reaction to the data, with Bitcoin trading in the $109,600-$110,100 range, while U.S. stocks continued their volatile course with a slight increase. Nansen Chief Research Analyst Aurelie Barthere said the current data will have limited impact on the market. “This data is not expected to create a strong movement in the markets,” Barthere said, arguing that US-China trade talks have become a more important macro factor. “The progress or setbacks in these talks could be decisive for risk assets.” Related News: Caution: Well-known app Accused of Seizing Cryptocurrency from Users Who Have Not Moved Their Assets for a Year Ahead of the CPI data, President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that a new tariff agreement between the US and China has been completed and only formalities remain. Trump also called on the Fed to cut interest rates by a full percentage point. Nic Puckrin, founder of Coin Bureau, said that falling inflation and “exaggerated” tariff concerns could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. “I expect inflation to continue to trend downward throughout the year. This could give the Fed confidence to cut interest rates,” Puckrin said, adding that this could trigger Bitcoin’s final bullish phase of this cycle. “With almost half of the year behind us, the inflation monster still remains in its cage despite all the pessimistic forecasts,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto winter, as widely known within the cryptosphere, is a period typically characterized by a cruel correction in Bitcoin prices. According to Saylor, BTC is not going to $0 but is headed towards the $1 million per coin coveted milestone based on a number of key factors that he believes will supercharge the price of the oldest cryptocurrency. Price Has To Rocket If $50 Million In Bitcoin Is Bought Daily Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Michael Saylor highlighted that roughly 450 Bitcoin (BTC) are minted by miners every day. At current Bitcoin prices of $109,559 as per CoinGecko, that amount is equivalent to around $50 million. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” Saylor posited. The Bitcoin bull further noted that the increasing number of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is buying “the entire natural supply.” Saylor’s software intelligence-turned Bitcoin Treasury firm Strategy has amassed 582,000 BTC since it started purchasing in 2020, which is valued at around $63.59 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Notably, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin surges to $500,000 or $1 million, it may be more realistic to expect it to fall by about $200,000 a coin. Trump Endorsement Another Key Tailwind According to Saylor, there are enough confirmations in the wider economy to support his all-or-nothing prediction for Bitcoin. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” the Strategy co-founder quipped. Saylor also pointed out that US President Trump’s backing of Bitcoin and his efforts to create a more friendly regulatory environment will buoy the asset’s uptrend. Meanwhile, traditional banks have started to leverage this improving regulatory scene to foray into the fast-growing market, as they prepare to provide BTC custody services. Growing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption He further pointed out that demand for the scarce asset is going through the roof. For instance, BlackRock and other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and nation states are buying up Bitcoin daily. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan’s crypto council, recently disclosed that the country is set to create its own United States-esque strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor described the growing demand for Bitcoin as a “digital gold rush,” suggesting the top crypto has “gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” It’s worth mentioning that Saylor is not the only uber-bullish pundit in the crypto market. As ZyCrypto previously reported , asset manager ARK Invest bumped its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, bolstered mainly by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as “digital gold.”",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-11 18:14:43

AAVE ( AAVE ) soared to $312 as network growth accelerated. Data shows that the total value locked on the network jumped to a high of $27.5 billion, up from the April low of $16 billion. The total borrowed amount rose to $17.5 billion, up from $10 billion on April 13, a sign that the protocol is gaining traction. AAVE’s fees have also jumped in the past few months. It generated $40 million in May, up from $33 million in April. Most notably, cumulative revenue crossed the key resistance level at $210 million and reached $211.7 million.

The rally also coincided with a surge in futures open interest, which soared to a record high of $745 million, up from the year-to-date low of $180 million. Soaring open interest signals growing demand from investors. Meanwhile, AAVE’s supply on exchanges has dropped from 3.8 million in December last year to 3.06 million today. The total supply in profit has jumped to 1.25 million, its highest level since January. AAVE price technical analysis AAVE price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the AAVE token bottomed at $114.80, its lowest point on April 7. It recently broke above the resistance level at $282.10, its highest swing on May 27. AAVE has formed a golden cross pattern, as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages continue to slope upward. Similarly, the Relative Strength Index and the Average Directional Index have both continued to rise. The token will likely continue climbing as bulls target last year’s high of $398.85, its peak in December and 28% above the current level. A drop below the support at $282 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

His investing solution to hedge against inflation includes buying commodities such as Bitcoin. US national debt currently stands at $37 trillion and counting. Jones argued that the U.S. is stuck in a “debt trap” and that policymakers will likely keep real interest rates below inflation to reduce the burden, the veteran investor told Bloomberg TV on June 11. President Trump will likely tap an “uber-dovish” Fed chairman to replace Jerome Powell, whose tenure at the central bank is set to end in 2026. That means higher prices, lower purchasing power, and bigger risk for traditional portfolios, Jones, who founded hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation, noted. In other words, the only way a nation gets out of such high debt is to inflate its way out of it. To hedge against that ugly scenario, Tudor Jones thinks every portfolio should consist of Bitcoin, gold, and stocks. “It would be some combination of vol-adjusted bitcoin, gold, and stocks,” Jones opined, highlighting that BTC’s price swings are much more wild than those of gold, so the sizes of the positions should vary. Still, he astutely clarified: “That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation.” Notably, Bitcoiners have long touted the flagship cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation, just like the yellow metal. Jones has oftentimes stated in the past that he likes Bitcoin and that the asset can be held by investors in times of economic uncertainty. Though he previously suggested allocating 5% to BTC , he refused to give a figure during the recent Bloomberg interview — though he doubled down on his strong belief in the crypto. The legendary investor’s comments come after the Consumer Price Index accelerated to a year-on-year pace of 2.4% in May, indicating that U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has had a limited impact on the economy. At around $109,536, the price of BTC is up more than 64% in the year to-date, according to crypto data provider CoinMarketCap . Analysts are eyeing price targets for BTC past its current all-time high of $111,814.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|BTG,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-11 19:08:48

Semler Scientific (SMLR), a medical technology firm that pivoted into bitcoin treasury strategy, has seen its stock fall over nearly 50% in 2025 to nearly the level it was at a bit more than one year ago when it first began to accumulate BTC. The company’s premium to its net asset value (NAV), often referred to as multiple-to-NAV (mNAV), has dropped below 1x. On a basic share count basis, its market cap sits at approximately $420 million compared to bitcoin holdings valued around $491 million (4,449 BTC), putting its NAV ratio at just 0.859x, according to Strategy-Tracker . The mNAV being below 1.0 is crucial as Semler's main mechanism for accumulating bitcoin is to raise capital via share sales. However, for the share sale strategy to be accretive to shareholders, the stock must trade at a premium to the value of the company’s bitcoin holdings. With the share price at or below NAV, issuing new shares would dilute existing shareholders without adding proportional value, effectively halting the company’s ability to pursue further bitcoin accumulation under the current strategy. Bitcoin bull Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat, however, views Semler Scientific as an opportunity in his firm's ""Granny shot"" research portfolio . Granny shot refers to an unconventional way of shooting free throws in basketball and Fundstrat's Granny Shot (GRNY) portfolio is meant to emphasize the firm's unusual approach to research.",Markets|Eric Semler|Semler scientific|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-11 19:11:29

At the forefront of the new wave are Librarian Ghouls, a Russia-focussed advanced persistent threat (APT) group, and Crocodilus, a cross-platform stealer with roots in Android banking trojans. “Librarian Ghouls’ latest campaign uses legitimate software like AnyDesk to hide crypto miners and keyloggers. Once they’re in, they’re silent—until midnight.” — Kaspersky Threat Intelligence ( June 9, 2025 ) Librarian Ghouls: The “Legitimate” Malware This APT group disguises attacks as routine documents (e.g., payment orders) in phishing emails. Once opened, their malware: Installs 4t Tray Minimizer to hide malicious processes. Deploys AnyDesk for remote access and XMRig to mine Monero. Steals crypto wallet credentials and registry keys. New in 2025 : Midnight activation — malware runs only at night to avoid detection. Their attack is not simply brute-force robbery — rather, they pool technical expertise with psychological coercion, striking at every step of the crypto cycle. Librarian Ghouls have also optimized their loader to masquerade as legitimate business applications, often implanting their malware into what appear to be harmless documents like payment orders or invoices. When the victim then executes the file, the malware installers install quietly programs such as 4t Tray Minimizer to cover its tracks and AnyDesk for remote control. But what is most unique about this group is that they use time-based triggers: the malware only activates at night, lowering the chances of detection by security teams during working hours. It does this using a nighttime strategy that allows it to steal wallet credentials, mine Monero using XMRig, and exfiltrate sensitive data undetected. Victims may not even realize something is amiss until weeks later, when their wallets have typically been drained and their systems compromised beyond simple restoration. Crocodilus: The Seed-Phrase Collector Originally a Turkish banking trojan, Crocodilus now targets global crypto users via: Fake apps masquerading as Coinbase , MetaMask , or mining tools. Automated seed-phrase harvesters that scan devices for wallet data. Social engineering via fake “Bank Support” contacts in your phone. “Crocodilus’ new parser extracts seed phrases with surgical precision. One click on a fake X link, and your wallet is gone.” — ThreatFabric MTI Team ( June 3, 2025 ) Crocodilus, on the other hand, rapidly evolved from a regional threat to a global one. No longer limited to Android, it now targets malicious browser extensions, clone desktop apps, and even Telegram bots to spread its reach. The malware's most deadly feature is its ability to steal seed phrases from clipboard data, screenshots, and autofill data, sometimes even before the victim is aware of even being targeted. Threat actors began to offer access to the compromised wallets for sale on darknet forums, establishing a thriving black market for pilfered cryptocurrency assets that is growing in size and complexity. At times, Crocodilus even spams innocent ”support” numbers onto victims' phones, tricking users into providing sensitive information in the guise of technical support. Fake X Links: Now With Real-Time Deepfakes Hackers are exploiting X (Twitter) with: Hijacked verified accounts promoting fraudulent airdrops. QR codes linking to wallet-draining smart contracts. AI deepfake support chats that mimic real agents. Real Example :In May 2025, a deepfake “Elon Musk” livestream urged viewers to scan a QR code for a “TeslaCoin” giveaway. Victims lost over $200K in 30 minutes. One of the most menacing trends is the development of real-time deepfake support chats. Hackers use AI-affected avatars to impersonate recognized brands or influencers on X (Twitter), providing authentic, interactive ”help” that lures victims into sharing their seed phrase or private key. The deepfakes are so convincing that even seasoned crypto users have been caught up in them, with the avatars mimicking voice, tone, and even body language of recognized figures in the community. In one of the most notable cases, a deepfake ”Elon Musk” live stream on X advertised a false TeslaCoin giveaway and had hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses within a few minutes. OPSEC Tips: How to Stay Safe From Quillaudits’ 2025 Guide : Action Why It Matters Use a dedicated device Isolate crypto activity from daily browsing Revoke approvals Malware can’t drain wallets you’ve locked Avoid public Wi-Fi Crocodilus thrives on unsecured networks Verify X links offline Deepfake scams vanish when cross-checked For protection against such threats, the users will have to utilize a multi-layered OPSEC approach. Experts recommend using hardware wallets for high-value investments, enabling two-factor authentication, and never sharing seed phrases — never even with presumed support personnel or legitimate social accounts. Regular wallet approval checks, keeping software up-to-date, and separating crypto operations into single-use devices can similarly reduce risk. As attackers become increasingly more innovative and inventive, the best defense is to remain well-educated and to be adequately skeptical.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XMR|APT|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-11 19:11:44

The new entity will serve as the core development arm of Safe, which until now had outsourced technical work to a separate development firm, a structure commonly used across the crypto industry, Safe Labs Chief Executive Rahul Rumalla said on Wednesday. Safe Labs will operate directly under the umbrella of the Safe Foundation, a nonprofit organization. In an interview with CoinDesk, Rumalla said the transition reflects a broader strategy shift toward building products that can meet both the ideological standards of cypherpunk culture and the practical demands of enterprise clients. “This framework that we are forced to operate in — it actually forces you to compromise one over the other: If you want more security, you have to compromise on convenience, and if you want more convenience, you compromise on security,” Rumalla said. “We at Safe Labs, we step back and we reject this framework. We don’t want to operate in this model where we have to compromise one over the other.” Post-Hack Pivot According to Rumalla, the ByBit hack was a “catalyst” for the creation of Safe Labs. While Safe’s core smart contracts remained uncompromised, its user-facing web application was infiltrated with malicious code by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. That attack enabled the hackers to trick ByBit’s CEO into signing off on a transaction that rerouted funds into their control. “What we saw with an attack like this is that our core values were used against us,” Rumalla said. “Anonymity, privacy, self-custody, transparency, open source — these were used against us.” Despite the breach, Rumalla said user confidence in the Safe platform remained strong. The application saw “practically no churn” in the aftermath and continues to process 10% of all transaction volume across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks. “We’re not defending against cyberattacks,” Rumalla said. “We are defending cyber warfare, and that requires a mindset shift — not just at the project level, not at the company level, but as Ethereum or even crypto as a whole.” From Ideals to Infrastructure The move to formalize internal development echoes similar shifts by other major protocols, including Morpho and Polygon , which have both recently made moves to streamline decision-making and improve accountability with more traditional organizational structures. In parallel, Safe Labs is also refocusing on product design. The team is currently working on a “V2” version of its wallet, which Rumalla described as more “opinionated” — meaning bolder product direction, particularly for institutional users. “What we’re going to be launching and testing in the future is a subscription plan, essentially, that’s called Safe Pro — or Safe for enterprises, Safe for institutions — very much around that realm,” he said. “We’re going to basically package this opinionated product that’s more for the user segments that have higher security needs and more customization appetite.” “We need to operate at startup speed,” Rumalla added. ""That in itself is the premise of why we need to operate as a separate, independent entity. We need to align where we need to align, which is on the mission, but we need to be a bit more independent in terms of how we execute."" With more than $60 billion in total value locked and over $1 trillion in historical transaction volume, according to Rumalla, Safe remains one of crypto’s most battle-tested self-custody platforms. The team, now roughly 40 strong and based in Berlin, is betting that its next chapter — one that embraces opinionated product design without sacrificing its open-source ethos — will help define how wallets look in a world heading toward a trillion-dollar on-chain economy. ""Our mission is simple: making self custody easy and secure,"" Rumalla said. ""That's a win for everybody.""",Tech|Gnosis Safe|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|ETH|MATIC|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-11 19:21:02

The selling activity stems from wallet movements that began eight days prior, when 744,971 TRUMP tokens worth $8 million were transferred from Meteora Vault Authority through a Squads multisig wallet likely controlled by the official TRUMP team. This fresh dumping episode unfolds against a backdrop of relentless decline. The token is now trading 85% below its $73 all-time high while facing an imminent $520 million token unlock scheduled for July 18. At the time of writing, $TRUMP is trading at $11.09. $TRUMP Price Chart Source: Cryptonews $TRUMP Token Team Is Executing a “Systematic Liquidation” The current sell-off represents just the tip of the iceberg in what analysts characterize as a systematic liquidation by project insiders. Since launching at $0.18 on January 17, 2025, TRUMP has experienced a meteoric rise to $75.35 within 48 hours, creating what many now recognize as a textbook pump-and-dump pattern. TRUMP price history Source: CoinGecko However, the euphoria proved short-lived. The token entered a devastating downtrend, plummeting to $31.61 by January 21 and continuing its descent through multiple phases of decline. By February, prices stabilized around $16 before further deterioration brought values to $12.50 in late February, eventually finding temporary support around $7.50 in early April. The pattern of team-controlled selling has become increasingly sophisticated and concerning for investors. In April, on-chain data exposed the first major withdrawal when the team moved $4.6 million worth of liquidity to Coinbase Prime accounts , strategically timed just days before the project’s first major token unlock. The $TRUMP dev pulled 4.6M $USDC from the pool by removing liquidity 13 hours ago. Then they bridged 4.6M $USDC to #Ethereum and deposited it into #CoinbasePrime . https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiA https://t.co/Cgybm89XTi pic.twitter.com/NI3gZsJWFI — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 16, 2025 This withdrawal pattern escalated sharply in subsequent months, with Lookonchain reporting a massive $47 million transfer to major exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit, in early June. A wallet linked to the $TRUMP team deposited 1,346,000 $TRUMP ($19.58M) into #Binance , #OKX , and #Bybit 9 hours ago. https://t.co/Mkk5VIjIFW pic.twitter.com/G4cuIBrQVq — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 29, 2025 The April 29 incident alone saw $20 million worth of tokens offloaded across multiple exchanges, with 700,000 tokens worth $10.21 million dumped to Binance while additional quantities flooded OKX and Bybit. Fresh Dumping Activity Raises Red Flags The latest selling episode, shared by Stalkchain , reveals the sophisticated nature of team-controlled liquidations. Eight days ago, the large transfer of 744,971 tokens worth $8 million from Meteora Vault Authority to wallet BeC***W7M marked the beginning of the current dumping cycle. The transaction’s execution through a Squads multisig wallet strongly suggests official team authorization, contradicting any claims of unauthorized or external selling pressure. The dumping accelerated dramatically when the receiving wallet transferred 100,000 TRUMP tokens worth $1 million to a fresh wallet address just three hours before market close, with blockchain analysis confirming the immediate conversion to USDC through active selling. This methodical approach (utilizing fresh wallet addresses and systematic USDC conversion) indicates a deliberate strategy rather than panic selling or external market manipulation. The original wallet retains 645,072.16 TRUMP tokens valued at $7.07 million, suggesting additional selling pressure remains imminent. The timing proves particularly damaging as it coincides with already fragile market conditions and an approaching $520 million token unlock event. With only 26.48% of tokens currently in circulation, the July 18 unlock represents a potential 20% increase in circulating supply, historically a catalyst for major price depression. Technical Analysis Points to Deeper Decline Ahead The daily TRUMP/USDT chart presents an unambiguously bearish technical structure that validates concerns about continued downside pressure. The token currently trades beneath a long-term descending trendline established in February, with multiple failed attempts to sustain upward momentum reinforcing the dominant bearish trend. Key support at $10.20 represents the final defense against a potential 26.4% decline toward $7.90, a scenario that appears increasingly probable given the mounting selling pressure from both team liquidations and the approaching token unlock. The parabolic rally formation marked by the initial price explosion has now completely collapsed, following the typical 70-90% retracement pattern common in memecoin bubble formations. At current levels around $11.06, the token has barely begun its technical correction, with the blue zigzag pattern suggesting this represents only the initial wave of a multi-stage decline. The Relative Strength Index at 45.44 confirms bearish momentum control, while the previous RSI divergence bear indicator in May, when readings dropped below the 50 mark, shows the weakening technical foundation. Technical analysis suggests realistic downside targets extend toward the $6-8 range in the near term, with potential for extreme weakness reaching $3-5 levels representing the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the entire rally. The broken parabolic structure typically requires months to repair, if recovery proves possible at all. Therefore, any bounce attempts are likely candidates for additional selling opportunities rather than signs of genuine reversal.

It plans to focus on the Polygon Proof of Stake (PoS) sidechain and the AggLayer. The founder, Sandeep Nailwal , disclosed this today in a post on X, noting that Polygon PoS will focus on stablecoin payments and real-world assets (RWAs) while the AggLayer will continue in its effort to become a cross-chain settlement layer. Nailwal said: “Polygon PoS will focus on Stablecoin payments and RWAs, while AggLayer will focus on building a trustless Internet of Blockchains.” As part of its plans for AggLayer, Nailwal disclosed that AggLayer v0.3, which has been in the pipeline for some time, will launch on June 30th with improved features, signaling the organization’s readiness to ship more products to the market. He added that Polygon PoS will also see improved capacity as the milestone of its Gigagas roadmap is now live on the testnet. This upgrade will launch by early July and will push the network capacity to 1,000 transactions per second. Interestingly, Nailwal stated that this is only part of the several changes that have started to increase Polygon’s economic viability and will ensure that stakers of its native token, POL, also get more value Nailwal becomes CEO of Polygon Foundation Meanwhile, Nailwal also announced that he would take up the CEO role for Polygon Foundation, the parent company of all Polygon products. According to Nailwal, the move shifts Polygon from its decentralized governance approach to a centralized model necessary for the project’s evolution. He said: “I’ve always stayed away from moving into the CEO role because I’ve been focused on building PF as an institutionally governed foundation. But right now, Polygon needs clear direction and focused execution, which means stepping up.” Despite the changes, Marc Boiron will remain as CEO of Polygon Labs, with Nailwal only having positive commendations for the executive. In his words, Boiron is the “best executive/leader in the crypto industry.” Meanwhile, Nailwal noted that the company has a healthy treasury with hundreds of millions in cash. Thus, it is well-positioned for its long-term building without worrying about raising capital. While Polygon appears to be moving away from ZK efforts, Nailwal added that this is not exactly the case. Instead, the company plans to spin off its ZK projects while acknowledging the role of the technology in blockchain developments. The planned spinoff subsidiary for its ZK research would be known as Polygon ZisK and led by Jordi Baylina. However, there are no specific timelines for when this would launch. POL sees a massive surge in value Meanwhile, the market appears to have taken to the recent developments positively, with POL price increasing by more than 6% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap. This represents a significant increase in value for the token formerly known as MATIC. It is a welcome development, given how POL has struggled so far this year. The token is down 50% year-to-date, making it one of the worst-performing major cap tokens this year. This poor performance was mostly due to the struggle to generate significant activity and compete with other Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Even Nailwal acknowledged Polygon’s struggles as one of the major factors that necessitated recent changes. Interestingly, POL could see more tailwinds soon. POL has already enjoyed some regulatory clarity after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its lawsuit over the status of POL, which is already attracting more market makers to the token. However, the Polygon Foundation is also planning to start campaigns to create awareness so users can know about the upgrade of MATIC to POL . If the foundation is successful with its plans, the token could see a significant surge in value before the year ends.

According to the firm’s analysts, the behavior of whales on Binance shows that Bitcoin has proven its resilience again by holding above $100,000. According to CryptoQuant data, when Bitcoin approaches or surpasses all-time highs, Binance whales typically send large amounts of BTC to the exchange in an attempt to book profits. These moves are reflected in sharp increases in inflow volumes to the exchange. Analysts recall that during the peak period in early 2024, Binance saw over $5.3 billion in BTC inflows, while in previous cycle peaks, these figures reached $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion. It is stated that such large inflows are usually followed by short- or medium-term corrections. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Unleashes Listing Storm - Announcements Coming One After Another - Here's the Latest Altcoin They've Chosen However, the situation is different in the current situation. According to the latest data, BTC inflows to Binance are only around $3 billion and this figure continues to decrease. This shows that whales are currently avoiding selling and continue to hold on to their Bitcoins in anticipation of higher profits. CryptoQuant analysts argue that this attitude of Binance whales should not be ignored: “Considering the impact that these whale entries could have on the market, the current stance of Binance whales clearly signals a bullish trend.” *This is not investment advice.

That’s the whole strategy. There’s no big plan, no actual growth, just blind hope and overpriced stock. According to Wedbush’s Michael Pachter, who put out a note on Wednesday, GameStop has no clear direction. He said, “Despite a complete lack of a clear strategy, GameStop has consistently capitalized on the existence of ‘greater fools’ willing to pay more than twice its asset value for its shares — and so far, they’ve been correct.” This came after the company’s Tuesday earnings showed a drop in first-quarter revenue, which was expected because people are buying games online, not walking into stores. But instead of fixing their core business, GameStop took a wild detour, buying 4,710 bitcoins worth over half a billion dollars. It’s copying the same move MicroStrategy made, but here’s the problem: MicroStrategy is a tech company with actual value. GameStop is not. Buying Bitcoin isn’t a business strategy Michael thinks this Bitcoin plan makes no sense. He wrote, “It is difficult to understand why any investor would be willing to pay more than 2x cash value for the possibility of GameStop converting more of its cash into Bitcoin.” GameStop’s stock is already trading at 2.4 times its actual cash, which means it’s way overvalued. There’s no way putting more money into crypto is going to make it worth even more. Investors who believe in Bitcoin can just buy the coin or an ETF themselves. They don’t need GameStop as the middleman. CEO Ryan Cohen claimed the move was about macroeconomic fears. He said Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralization could help the company hedge against bigger risks. That doesn’t explain how a video game chain plans to survive while turning into a crypto treasury. Bitcoin might be solid, but it’s not a business model for a retail company that’s bleeding relevance. Michael didn’t hold back. He doubled down on his underperform rating and gave GameStop a 12-month target of $13.50 — that’s 55% lower than the $30.15 close on Tuesday. He broke that down to $12.50 in cash per share and $1 for the company’s business itself. “GME shares trade at a level that overlooks the many challenges ahead,” he said . GameStop is using Bitcoin like a smokescreen, but there’s still no real answer for why it exists as a retail business today. They didn’t lay out any future direction. They didn’t explain how they plan to compete with digital game downloads. They just dropped a crypto bomb and left everyone to figure it out. Greater fool theory is doing the heavy lifting Every part of this situation is built on the greater fool theory. That’s the idea that you can make money off a worthless or overvalued asset, not because it’s good, but because someone else might buy it from you for even more. It only works as long as you find a bigger fool. Once that chain breaks, the last one holding the asset is stuck with it. That’s exactly what’s happening here. Investors aren’t buying GameStop because they believe in the company. They’re betting they can flip their shares for a profit. They think someone else will see the price go higher and jump in, even though the business underneath hasn’t improved. The problem is that this can’t last forever. Once people realize the stock price is disconnected from reality, the sell-off starts. And when that happens, the shares will crash back down to something closer to what the business is actually worth — maybe less. Everyone who bought in late gets burned. Everyone who sold earlier walks away with the money. Michael’s breakdown shows how fragile the whole thing is. GameStop is leaning on crypto and the hope that its loyal army of speculative traders sticks around. But even that crowd has limits. And if the company keeps dodging its real problems, the last fools in line are going to pay for it. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

33767162,[object Object],1749670249,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Admits He Was Wrong About Dogecoin,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-wrong-about-dogecoin/,"At Ripple Apex, the company’s flagship gathering for developers and partners, Ripple president Monica Long and chief executive Brad Garlinghouse took the stage for an unscripted fireside chat that quickly zeroed in on one of the industry’s most polarizing sub-sectors: meme coins. In an exchange that mingled candor with contrition, Garlinghouse acknowledged that his once-unyielding dismissal of Dogecoin no longer holds. Dogecoin Forces Ripple CEO To Backtrack The session began with the moderator’s binary provocation—meme coins, overrated or underrated?—to which Long replied that, taken at face value, many are “outright scams,” yet their speculative magnetism has nevertheless “miraculously become real functioning markets.” Long credited the phenomenon with seeding vital infrastructure—wallets, capital, developer mind-share—that she likened to Ethereum’s own 2016–2017 ICO surge. “There’s a lasting impact from meme coins,” she said. The Ripple CEO offered what he called “the other side” of the argument. “I think meme coins are generally maybe grossly overrated,” he said, framing most of them as “not sustainable” projects that amplify regulatory skepticism. He contrasted that short-term gambling impulse with what he described as Ripple’s “long arcs of time” approach. Yet the conversation turned when Garlinghouse revisited Dogecoin, a target of his past derision. “For people who have followed some of my public statements, I used to really speak not so kindly towards Dogecoin,” he admitted. “I was just like, Dogecoin? It literally was created as a lark… it is literally a pile of shit as the logo.” His original objection, he explained, was that an asset conceived as parody could not credibly represent an industry courting institutional capital: “If we’re trying to engage institutions and build those bridges between traditional finance and decentralized finance… Dogecoin isn’t representing us well.” What changed his mind was not a newfound appreciation for the token’s fundamentals but the market reality forged by Elon Musk’s relentless advocacy . “Where I agree with Monica, and I think I got wrong, is Elon Musk willed Dogecoin into so much liquidity that it’s not going away,” the Ripple CEO conceded. “It’s part of the ecosystem. It plays a role.” Even with that reversal, Garlinghouse made clear that most meme-coin launches remain “get-rich-quick rug pulls” that “reflect badly on those of us in the industry trying to build real products for real customers.” He cited US Senator Elizabeth Warren ’s focus on negative use cases as a political example of how hype-driven projects can taint the wider field. Pressed to nominate a single meme that captures crypto’s “chaos or brilliance,” Garlinghouse did not hesitate: “Doge. It is both the chaos and the brilliance.” Musk’s influence, he said, demonstrated how “liquidity begets liquidity,” underscoring the difficulty newcomers face in replicating Dogecoin’s network effects amid today’s “explosion” of imitators. Long, for her part, maintained that even dubious tokens serve as experimental sandboxes that, over time, strengthen underlying blockchains. Garlinghouse ultimately stuck with his “overrated” verdict for meme coins as a category, yet his concession on Dogecoin—effectively elevating it from punchline to permanent fixture—marked a notable shift for the CEO of a company long positioned at the institutional end of the spectrum.

Now, price action faces a critical test at the $176 resistance. Whether Solana breaks through or rejects from here could define its next major move. After a sharp rebound from a high-confluence support zone, Solana ( SOL ) is now trading near a crucial resistance level that could determine its short-term direction. The rally off the $143 level, supported by the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and weekly support, has brought price into a region packed with multiple overhead resistances, including the point of control, the daily supply/resistance level, and the upside 0.618 Fibonacci retracement near $176. Key technical points Strong Bounce from $143 Support: Price rebounded 17% after holding the 0.618 Fibonacci and weekly support zone. $176 Resistance Cluster: Price is now approaching a high-confluence resistance region — POC, upside Fibonacci, and daily SR. Range Risk or Breakout Potential: A rejection could lead to consolidation, while a breakout would signal continued bullish momentum. SOLUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Solana’s recent price behavior has been technically clean. The bounce from the $143 level was textbook, reacting strongly to the 0.618 retracement zone, which was also reinforced by high-timeframe weekly support. This confluence triggered a sharp bullish reaction, resulting in a 17% gain that now brings Solana into a complex resistance area. Currently, price is testing a major cluster of resistance around the $176 mark, which includes: The point of control (highest volume traded area), The upside 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the previous swing, A significant daily support/resistance flip. This region presents a key decision point. A break above $176 with conviction would likely extend the bullish trend, potentially triggering an accelerated move toward higher targets. However, a rejection at this level may simply lead to a healthy pullback, potentially forming a higher low and preserving the uptrend structure.

A clean break above $176 could ignite further upside momentum, while failure to clear this level may suggest continued consolidation within the $143–$176 range.

The Commission stated that such activities are unauthorized and violate Nigeria’s Investments and Securities Act 2025. In its official advisory released Wednesday, the SEC reaffirmed that CBEX and its affiliated entities are not registered to operate in the Nigerian capital market. The Commission also revealed that enforcement actions had already been initiated against the company and its promoters due to their previous unapproved investment schemes. “The Nigerian public is accordingly advised to refrain from patronising or transacting with CBEX or ST Technologies International Ltd (Smart Treasure or Super Technology) as they risk losing their funds,” the SEC stated.

CBEX had blamed a “security breach” and promised refunds, but instead closed its Telegram groups and allegedly wiped user funds. Videos showed devastated investors, some of whom claimed to have lost life savings, including one user who reported losing 8.7 million naira. The regulator is now working with relevant law enforcement agencies to investigate CBEX’s operations and pursue further legal action aimed at safeguarding investors and the broader financial system.",News|Exchange|fraud|Nigeria,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-11 19:40:00

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction.

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6501, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.7539. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5579, beginning a bearish trend to $0.5068. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bullish as buyers gained confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, buyers are now approaching the $0.6 level to initiate a stronger recovery rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.6 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX The dYdX platform revealed that over 64.4 million ethDYDX tokens remain unmigrated to its native chain, prompting urgent calls for users to act. Backed by 91% community support, an on-chain vote is set for June 9, 2025, to potentially end support for the Ethereum-dYdX bridge. dYdX price prediction June 2025 May was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin surged toward $0.75 but failed to maintain its buying momentum. As a result, dYdX recorded over 13% decline in May. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.9 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $1.2, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction June 2025 $0.45 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|DYDX|WLD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-11 19:45:00

In a post on the social media platform X, crypto wallet company Privy says it’s been bought out by Stripe, a firm that provides payment infrastructure for businesses. “Today, we’re proud to announce that Stripe is acquiring Privy. We couldn’t be more excited. Privy will continue as an independent product – but now we’ll move faster, ship more, and serve you even better, so you can stay focused on your users.” Earlier this year, Stripe completed its purchase of stablecoin issuer Bridge, the company behind USDB , a programmable dollar-pegged crypto asset backed by a combination of cash and money market funds held by BlackRock. As stated by Zach Abrams, co-founder of Bridge, at the time, “We closed our acquisition with Stripe! Together we’re scaling digital dollars to businesses everywhere. Stablecoins aren’t the future- they’re already transforming how people move money today.” Earlier this month, Stripe reportedly was in talks with unnamed banks regarding their potential use of stablecoins. Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said that banks seem eager to work with dollar-pegged digital assets. “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Invest in These Solana (SOL) Alternatives Now,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/got-1000-invest-in-these-solana-sol-alternatives-now/,"If you’re holding just $1,000 and wondering what crypto to buy before June ends, you might want to skip the usual suspects and look at where smart money is going now. While Solana (SOL) continues to dominate headlines, investors are now shifting focus toward top altcoins Cardano (ADA) and new Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . ADA, already a household name in the crypto market, is gaining renewed momentum with major ecosystem updates, but it’s MUTM, the under-$1 DeFi token, that’s triggering real FOMO. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 11,800 buyers are out there along with a total raise of $10.3 million. Investors who get in on this level will see 100% return on investment when the token is sold at launch for $0.06. If you’re still asking which crypto to buy now, this could be your last low-entry window. Cardano Holds Steady Despite Volatility, Setups Bullish Momentum Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.67, bouncing back after a recent dip from $0.688 to $0.621 and showing signs of strong support to $0.67. Despite a 10% intraweek drop, ADA’s recovery into an ascending channel signals renewed bullish momentum, with key on-chain developments, including its first Bitcoin‑to‑Cardano Ordinals bridge and institutional backing from Franklin Templeton, fueling confidence. Technical indicators point to a reclaim of resistance near $0.64–$0.65, positioning Cardano as one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now within the sub‑$1 category. As investors search what crypto to buy before June ends, ADA stands out — even as capital begins flowing toward DeFi plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Blows Up: $10.3M Raised and Counting — Are You Late Already? The Phase 5 Presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is heating up fast, and smart investors are jumping in before the next price hike. While meme coins flash and fade, Mutuum stands out with a real use case and serious long-term potential. With over 11,800 investors already in and $10.3 million secured, this DeFi gem is becoming a must-watch in 2025. At just $0.03 per token, Phase 5 is your last chance to get in before prices rise again. Will you act — or watch others cash in? Early Investor Jackpot: $100K Giveaway + Leaderboard Rewards for Top Holders To reward early believers, Mutuum Finance running a $100,000 giveaway , and 10 lucky winners will each snag $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. But that’s not all. The top 50 MUTM holders will also score exclusive bonus tokens, and the race is on. Want to make it onto the leaderboard? Now’s the time to go big before competition tightens. Not Just Another DeFi Project: This Lending Protocol Puts You in Control Mutuum is redefining decentralized lending. With a hybrid model blending Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), users enjoy more freedom, more flexibility, and more potential rewards. Whether you’re parking stablecoins into smart-contract-powered pools or directly negotiating terms with borrowers, Mutuum gives you total control, a far cry from centralized platforms that hold your money hostage. This is DeFi done right, and it’s built for the long haul. Final Call: Phase 5 Tokens Are Still at $0.03 — But Not for Long Over $10.3 million raised, 11,800+ investors in, and the clock ticking, this is your shot to grab MUTM at just $0.03 before the Phase 6 price hike. That’s a guaranteed 2x ROI by launch, with analysts projecting 10x to 30x+ upside as DeFi adoption surges. While Cardano (ADA) holds firm with bullish signals near $0.67, early movers are already shifting focus to Mutuum Finance. Get in before the next phase hits, or watch the gains go to someone else.

With the announcement of an ongoing Cyberscope audit and a new exchange partnership, Ruvi AI is taking significant steps to establish itself as a trustworthy and accessible player in the crypto space. Analysts are closely watching this rising project as it captures the attention of investors seeking promising opportunities. Avalanche (AVAX): A Leader in Scalability and Decentralization Since its inception, Avalanche has been recognized for its ability to address scalability challenges plaguing the blockchain industry. Leveraging its unique Avalanche consensus protocol, the platform can process up to 4,500 transactions per second (TPS), making it one of the most efficient and scalable blockchains in existence. Avalanche has developed a rich ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), catering to industries ranging from DeFi to gaming. Its partnerships with major organizations and seamless integration with enterprise and developer needs have cemented its position as a leader in the blockchain world. However, as emerging competitors like Ruvi AI bring new technologies and use cases to the table, investors are starting to reconsider their options for exponential growth. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Innovating Blockchain with AI Ruvi AI is reshaping the blockchain landscape by offering a platform that seamlessly integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized technology.

A Promising Start with Record-Breaking Presale Ruvi AI’s presale has exceeded expectations, demonstrating strong investor confidence in its future. Phase 1 of the presale sold out within just two weeks, with tokens priced at $0.010. Early investors have already seen a 50% increase in value as Phase 2 commenced at $0.015 per token. Over 1,500 supporters have joined the project, reflecting its growing appeal. The presale has also proven lucrative, raising $1.6 million so far. Add to this the recent milestones of securing its first exchange listing and forming a partnership with a major trading platform, and Ruvi AI is prepared for significant liquidity and market entry. Further announcements are expected in the near future, fueling excitement as the project gains traction. Cyberscope Audit and Exchange Partnership Boost Confidence Ruvi AI has taken a major step toward building trust and transparency by undergoing an audit with Cyberscope, a reputable blockchain security firm. This audit will assess the platform’s code and security measures, ensuring reliability and protecting investor interests. Transparency is a critical factor in the crypto market, and Ruvi AI’s proactive approach demonstrates its commitment to maintaining integrity. Furthermore, Ruvi AI’s new exchange partnership expands accessibility and liquidity for its token. By enabling seamless trading, the partnership positions Ruvi AI for significant adoption as it continues to attract both retail and institutional investors. These developments highlight Ruvi AI’s dedication to creating a secure and accessible ecosystem that prioritizes its community. Why Choose RUVI?

According to his recent post on X, current XRP holders may be on the brink of acquiring generational wealth. He argues that those who have remained committed to the asset could soon see life-changing returns, potentially securing long-term financial stability for their families. Long-Term Confidence in XRP’s Trajectory Pumpius, who has been active in the Bitcoin space since 2013, maintains that XRP’s current valuation does not reflect its long-term potential. While the token has yet to reach its previous all-time high, he believes the asset remains significantly undervalued and still presents a unique opportunity for outsized returns, especially for early participants in the ecosystem. His optimism is shared by other prominent voices in the financial space. Linda Jones, a financial analyst and author, previously shared similar sentiments, citing views from a U.K.-based fund manager who also considers XRP one of the most promising assets for building long-term wealth. If you understand what’s happening right now with $XRP… You’re not just early — You’re about to retire your entire bloodline. Generational wealth is loading. Don’t flinch. Don’t fold. — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 10, 2025 XRP’s Historical Performance and Investor Sentiment Despite lagging behind Bitcoin’s recent surge , where BTC briefly traded above $110,000, XRP has maintained relative price stability, currently sitting at approximately $2.29. This plateau may frustrate some investors, especially when compared to the more aggressive movements seen in other assets. However, those advocating for XRP remain focused on its long-term potential rather than short-term price fluctuations. Supporters often reference XRP’s sharp rally from late 2024 to early 2025 as evidence of its ability to generate high returns. In November 2024, XRP was priced around $0.49; by January 2025, it had surged to $3.40, a gain of over 590%. Investors holding 100,000 XRP during that period would have seen their holdings increase in value from $49,000 to $340,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Debate Over a “Life-Changing” Price Point The conversation surrounding XRP’s potential has also led to debate about what price level truly constitutes financial transformation. Influencer “The Bearable Bull” recently suggested that $8 per token is a key milestone that could validate the patience of long-term holders. At that price, an investment of $55,000 in XRP would be worth over $200,000, an outcome some view as significant, though not necessarily life-altering for all. Others in the community believe that higher targets are required for meaningful wealth creation. For example, some speculative investors continue to project an eventual price of $1,000 per token. However, analysts like CryptoGuard’s Matthew Brienen have cautioned that reaching such a valuation may take several years, if not a decade, and is far from guaranteed. While the asset remains below its all-time high and its growth trajectory is uncertain, prominent investors and analysts continue to express confidence in its long-term potential. The optimism surrounding XRP’s future continues to fuel investor interest. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Morgan Stanley’s global head of corporate credit research, Andrew Sheets, says in a new CNBC interview that he sees the S&P 500 surging by nearly 8% in 2026, powered by a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. According to Sheets, the stock market appears to have digested US recession odds and is poised to steadily climb higher in the coming months. “We think the inflation data will pick back up a little bit, we do think growth is going to slow some. But importantly, we think the equity market is forward-looking and we think the equity market is going to look ahead to a better rate of change. We’ve already started to see some of the earnings revision numbers incrementally get better. We think that the dollar has been weak. We think it continues to be weak. That’s a tailwind for earnings. So we think the market is going to see better earnings revisions. Already, we think we’ve kind of priced [in] a recession, priced [in] the usual drawdown back in the April lows. So a better rate of change, better trend on earnings revisions, tailwind from a weaker dollar should help S&P earnings hold up. The Fed’s going to be cutting over the next 12 months. We don’t expect a recession. Usually when that happens, the multiple doesn’t decline. And so that’s why we think the S&P can move up to 6,500 by the middle of next year.” As of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 6,038 points.

Growth and Investor Safety Are a Strong Point,https://timestabloid.com/why-analysts-predict-massive-roi-for-ruvi-ai-ruvi-growth-and-investor/,"The crypto world is buzzing with the name Ruvi AI , a project that’s redefining the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). With analysts predicting massive ROI for this ambitious project, Ruvi AI is capturing the attention of investors looking to ride the next wave of innovation. Combining real-world applicability, structured growth, and a commitment to safety, Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a standout option with seemingly unlimited potential. A Strong Start With $1.7M Raised in Presale Ruvi AI’s presale success is a clear indicator of market confidence. The project has already raised $1.7 million and successfully sold over 145 million tokens , demonstrating significant early traction. Currently in Phase 2 , Ruvi AI tokens are priced at $0.015 each, offering an attractive entry point for those looking to invest in a rising star. Unlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI’s value projection is anchored in a clear roadmap. Once the presale concludes, the token’s valuation will rise to $0.07 , providing a structured and transparent growth model for early adopters. Analysts have further projected a post-listing valuation of $1 per token , representing a potential 13,200% ROI for those who invest during these initial phases. Solving Real-World Problems With AI What sets Ruvi AI apart in a crowded crypto marketplace is its focus on real-world applications . By integrating blockchain technology with the power of AI, Ruvi AI offers solutions that address critical challenges across major industries: Healthcare Ruvi AI’s tools improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance patient management systems, and streamline hospital workflows. These contributions help reduce inefficiencies and add value to an industry primed for tech-driven innovation. Logistics Businesses can benefit from Ruvi AI’s AI-powered supply chain optimization. By cutting operational costs and resolving bottlenecks, the platform ensures smooth and efficient logistics operations across global markets. Finance Addressing growing concerns over security and transparency, Ruvi AI’s advanced fraud detection capabilities and AI-driven analysis reinforce trust in financial transactions. These applications go beyond speculation, establishing Ruvi AI as a token of substance with long-term scalability. Building Trust With Partnerships and Security Ruvi AI understands that growth comes hand-in-hand with transparency and safety. The project has partnered with WEEX Exchange , ensuring its token is accessible to a global audience while maintaining liquidity for investors. Adding to its credibility, Ruvi AI is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a well-respected name in blockchain security. This step demonstrates a proactive commitment to investor protection and solidifies its position as a reliable platform in an industry often fraught with risks. Maximizing Returns With VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI further incentivizes early participation through its VIP investment tier system . These tiers allow investors to amplify their returns with significant bonuses. Here’s a breakdown of the most popular tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . This tiered system not only enhances potential ROI but also shows Ruvi AI’s commitment to creating wealth for its early adopters. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out The defining strength of Ruvi AI lies in its combination of innovation, timing, and trustworthiness . While many crypto projects rely on hype and speculation, Ruvi AI’s success is rooted in delivering meaningful value with practical applications and a well-thought-out growth plan. Its $0.015 presale price offers an unparalleled opportunity for investors to secure a stake in the project before its value skyrockets. With a transparent presale strategy, real-world relevance, and a commitment to security, Ruvi AI proves that it’s not just another token but a game-changing player in the blockchain and AI space.

If passed, the bill could set the first national regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The GENIUS Act—short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins — requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100% reserves, submit to annual audits if they hold over $50 billion in market cap, and adhere to rules for foreign issuers. It could serve as a benchmark for stablecoin regulation in the U.S. financial system. Senate Majority Leader John Thune spoke in favor of the bill, aligning with President Donald Trump’s stance on digital assets. “We want to bring cryptocurrency into the mainstream, and the GENIUS Act will help us do that,” Thune said . However, not all lawmakers were on board. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the bill for failing to address bipartisan amendments and warned of the political risks linked to Trump’s crypto dealings. “By passing the GENIUS Act, the Senate is not only about to bless this corruption, but to actively facilitate its expansion,” she said, referencing Trump’s ties to a crypto platform backed by his family.

This development signals a bold step by a publicly traded company to integrate Bitcoin directly into its financial reserves, potentially setting a precedent for others in the traditional finance sector. What is The Blockchain Group’s Ambitious Plan? According to reports, The Blockchain Group has received shareholder approval to raise an astounding €10 billion, equivalent to approximately $11 billion. This massive crypto funding initiative is specifically earmarked for immediate Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions. The core objective is to fuel the company’s ‘Bitcoin Treasury Company’ strategy. This strategy isn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it’s a long-term vision focused on consistently increasing the amount of BTC held per share over time, effectively linking the company’s value proposition more closely to the performance and accumulation of Bitcoin. The approval for such a significant capital raise dedicated to a digital asset strategy underscores a profound belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role as a potential store of value and treasury reserve asset. It positions The Blockchain Group among a select few publicly listed companies globally that have made Bitcoin a central part of their corporate finance strategy. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? The concept of holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet gained significant traction following pioneering moves by companies like MicroStrategy. The rationale behind this Bitcoin treasury strategy often includes several key drivers: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature are seen by proponents as a potential hedge against inflationary pressures on traditional fiat currencies. Store of Value: Believed to be ‘digital gold’, Bitcoin offers a non-sovereign, censorship-resistant store of value that is easily transferable globally. Potential Appreciation: Companies anticipate that Bitcoin’s value will increase over the long term due to increasing adoption and scarcity, potentially boosting shareholder value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can diversify corporate reserves away from traditional cash and financial instruments. Industry Leadership: For companies in the blockchain or technology sector, holding Bitcoin can signal alignment with the digital asset space and attract investors interested in this market. The Blockchain Group ‘s decision to pursue aggressive Bitcoin acquisition with a significant capital injection highlights the increasing confidence among some corporate leaders in Bitcoin’s role in future financial landscapes. How Does This $11B Blockchain Investment Impact the Market? A capital raise of this magnitude, specifically for Bitcoin acquisition , is substantial even in the volatile crypto market. While $11 billion won’t be deployed all at once, the intent to acquire a large amount of BTC over time could provide consistent buying pressure. This kind of institutional-scale blockchain investment demonstrates conviction and could potentially influence market sentiment, encouraging other companies to explore similar strategies or at least take the digital asset space more seriously. It’s important to consider the potential impacts: Increased Demand: Large, sustained buying from a single entity can contribute to upward price pressure, assuming supply remains constant or tightens. Market Sentiment: Corporate adoption, especially on this scale, can legitimize Bitcoin as an asset class for traditional investors and corporations. Liquidity: While $11B is large, the Bitcoin market has significant daily trading volume, so the acquisitions are likely to be managed to minimize market disruption. Shareholder Confidence: For The Blockchain Group , the success of this strategy will heavily rely on Bitcoin’s performance and market acceptance. This move by The Blockchain Group is a clear indicator that crypto funding is not just for startups anymore; established companies are leveraging it for strategic asset accumulation. What Are the Potential Challenges and Considerations? While the potential benefits of a Bitcoin treasury strategy are appealing, there are significant challenges and considerations that companies undertaking such a plan must address: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its extreme price swings. Holding significant amounts exposes the company’s balance sheet to this volatility, which could impact earnings and shareholder perception. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, which could introduce risks related to compliance, taxation, and asset classification. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss due to hacking or operational errors. This is a critical aspect of any large-scale Bitcoin acquisition plan. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for digital assets are still developing, which can make reporting complex and potentially impact financial statements. Public Perception: While some investors may applaud the move, others might view it as speculative or risky, potentially affecting the company’s stock price. For The Blockchain Group , navigating these challenges will be crucial to the long-term success of their Bitcoin treasury strategy . The scale of their planned blockchain investment amplifies both the potential rewards and the risks involved. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses The decision by The Blockchain Group provides valuable insights: For Investors: This event highlights the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Investors should monitor companies that are actively adopting digital assets into their strategies. It also reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a potential long-term store of value. For Businesses: Companies should evaluate their own treasury strategies in light of the evolving financial landscape. While aggressive Bitcoin acquisition might not be suitable for all, understanding digital assets and blockchain technology is becoming increasingly important. Exploring smaller allocations or different crypto assets might be a starting point. The availability of significant crypto funding for strategic initiatives is a trend worth noting. This move by The Blockchain Group serves as a case study in leveraging significant blockchain investment for a focused digital asset strategy. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on Bitcoin’s Future The Blockchain Group ‘s successful securing of $11 billion in crypto funding marks a pivotal moment for the company and a notable development in the corporate adoption of digital assets. Their commitment to a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy , aiming for consistent Bitcoin acquisition per share, is a bold statement about their belief in Bitcoin’s future potential and its role as a corporate reserve asset. While the path ahead involves navigating volatility and regulatory landscapes, this significant blockchain investment positions The Blockchain Group as a key player exploring innovative corporate finance strategies in the digital age.

The Privy acquisition positions Stripe to offer end-to-end crypto infrastructure solutions, combining Privy’s wallet integration with stablecoin payment rails. The company capitalizes on explosive institutional adoption, which saw stablecoins settle $27.6 trillion in transactions during the first quarter of 2025 alone, more than doubling Visa’s entire 2023 settlement volume. Privy To Power the Next Wave of Stripe Crypto Users Privy, founded in 2021 by Henri Stern and Asta Li, has emerged as one of the key infrastructure providers that allows companies to integrate crypto wallets directly into their platforms without forcing users through the traditional friction-heavy process of creating external wallets through providers like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet. Collectively, it powers over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 teams while facilitating billions in transaction volume. The timing of Stripe’s aggressive crypto expansion also reflects broader institutional momentum and diversification toward digital assets. In fact, according to recent cryptonews reports, blockchain technology is now in active development in 60% of Fortune 500 companies . Nearly one in five executives considers on-chain initiatives a key strategic priority, representing a 47% increase from the previous year. Blockchain technology is now in active development at 60% of Fortune 500 companies. #Crypto #Blockchain https://t.co/M4kpX27CQ2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 10, 2025 This institutional embrace has been particularly pronounced in the stablecoin sector, where interest among Fortune 500 companies has tripled since 2024. This is driven by the technology’s ability to address pressing business pain points, including high transaction fees, cross-border payment delays, and currency volatility protection. Stripe’s crypto journey began in 2014 when it became the first major payments processor to support Bitcoin transactions. However, the company subsequently halted Bitcoin support due to network inefficiencies and high fees before rebuilding its blockchain team in 2021. The company’s renewed crypto ambitions accelerated in October 2024 with the launch of stablecoin payment options that achieved rapid adoption across 70 countries on their first day.

The account currently supports Circle’s USDC and Bridge’s USDB stablecoins, with plans for additional integrations. Strategic Infrastructure Play Addresses Growing Market Demand This latest acquisition allows Stripe to offer comprehensive crypto infrastructure spanning wallet creation, stablecoin payments, and traditional fiat integration through a unified platform. This end-to-end approach aligns with growing business needs. Over 81% of crypto-aware small and medium-sized businesses express interest in stablecoin adoption to address financial challenges. Source: Coinbase Over one-third of SMBs already use cryptocurrency, and 46% plan to adopt it within three years. Stripe’s acquisition strategy might also be in the quest for competitive positioning as other payment giants, including Visa and Mastercard, accelerate their own crypto initiatives. The company recently partnered with Ramp to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards . These cards provide businesses with cross-border payment solutions that offer faster settlements, lower fees, and built-in currency volatility protection. They initially launched in Latin American markets before expanding to Europe, Africa, and Asia. The broader context for Stripe’s crypto expansion includes major regulatory developments that have removed previous barriers to institutional adoption. The first quarter of 2025 witnessed unprecedented regulatory clarity. These regulatory advances have catalyzed institutional investment flows, with over 80% of institutional investors planning to increase crypto exposure throughout 2025. The stablecoin market has been the primary beneficiary, with supply growing 54% year-over-year, while global stablecoin holders have exceeded 161 million. The Senate advanced the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 bipartisan vote on Monday, marking a big step toward establishing federal regulation for stablecoins and digital currency oversight. #GENIUSAct #Stablecoins https://t.co/JmoPuWjKdf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 Additionally, congressional momentum continues to build, with the Senate advancing the bipartisan GENIUS Act , which targets stablecoin regulation, and reintroducing the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act.
