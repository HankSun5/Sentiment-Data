MNT and GT underperformed due to inflation risk and weak bullish momentum. Liquidity, supply metrics, and sentiment drove divergence in exchange token returns. A sharp divergence has emerged in the exchange token sector over the past two months, highlighting a market that is increasingly rewarding utility and sound tokenomics while punishing perceived risks. An analysis of five prominent exchange tokens shows that while Binance Coin (BNB), Bitget Token (BGB), and OKX’s OKB posted respectable gains, Bybit’s Mantle (MNT) and GateToken (GT) trailed with significant losses.

As Arbitrum Spikes and Theta Taps AI Expansion,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-most-potential-crypto-of-2025-as-arbitrum-spikes-and-theta-taps-ai-expansion/,"The crypto world in 2025 is no longer dominated by hype alone—utility and real-world use cases are now setting the pace. With thousands of tokens competing for attention, only a select few are being recognized as the most potential crypto contenders. These aren’t just speculative assets—they are solving actual problems in industries like finance, data infrastructure, and digital ownership. Among the projects gaining traction, Qubetics has entered the spotlight for its bold push into real world asset tokenization. Meanwhile, heavyweights like Arbitrum and Theta are also innovating in ways that reinforce their positions among the most potential crypto networks to watch this year. For participants and developers alike, recognizing the most potential crypto early can define long-term success. In 2025, the projects combining tangible utility with scalable ecosystems are likely to lead the next wave. Qubetics ($TICS) Is Redefining the RWA Narrative—The Countdown Is On Qubetics isn’t just riding the tokenization wave—it’s shaping it. The protocol is launching a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that simplifies access for enterprises, entrepreneurs, and professionals. This isn’t just another DeFi platform; it’s a robust, user-friendly gateway to tokenize assets ranging from real estate to intellectual property. At the heart of Qubetics’ design is a massive shift in tokenomics. By slashing its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, the protocol has introduced scarcity from the start. The public sale allocation has increased to 38.55%, placing power directly in the hands of its user base. This move toward decentralization comes with significant implications for governance and long-term value. As of June 2025: Presale Stage: 37th Tokens Sold: 515 million+ Holders: 27,800+ Funds Raised: $17.9 million+ Current Price: $0.3370 Next Price Jump: $0.40 (20% hike) Recent community updates hint at a Tier 1 CEX listing by Q3 and a mainnet rollout by early Q4. Analysts from BlockForge Labs highlight $TICS among the most potential crypto assets of the year, citing its community-led model, aggressive burn mechanism, and enterprise-focused features. What truly sets Qubetics apart is its solution-driven framework. Many of its predecessors failed to simplify tokenization for real-world use cases. In contrast, Qubetics enables asset-backed digital ownership, wrapped in a legally compliant and cross-chain compatible system. In a digital era where tangible value is becoming harder to secure, Qubetics makes RWA tokenization accessible—and that’s not just innovation, it’s necessity. Investment Scenario: What a $10,000 Entry Looks Like in Qubetics’ Final Presale Stage Let’s say you’re entering Qubetics with a $10,000 buy-in during stage 37 at the current price of $0.3370. That gets you approximately 29,672 $TICS tokens before the listing price increases to $0.40. With only 10 million tokens left and a fast-closing window, timing is critical. At listing, those tokens will be worth $11,869, giving you a solid 18.7% gain right out of the gate. Looking further ahead, if $TICS reaches $5, that same $10K entry would turn into $148,360—a 1,383% return fueled by Qubetics’ unique tokenomics, reduced supply model (now just 1.36 billion total tokens), and increased community control through its 38.55% public allocation. If the token surges to $10 in the next bull run, your $10,000 becomes $296,720—a 2,867% ROI. For anyone looking to make a strategic move with limited capital, this might be the single strongest presale opportunity currently live in 2025. Arbitrum (ARB) Soars 7.47% in 24 Hours, Volume Spikes Over 84% Arbitrum (ARB), currently ranked #50 among cryptocurrencies, surged 7.47% in the last 24 hours to trade at $0.3645, pushing its market cap to $1.77 billion—up 7.44% on the day. Trading volume skyrocketed 84.05% to $169.52 million, giving it a high 9.56% volume-to-market cap ratio. With a circulating supply of 4.86 billion ARB out of a 10 billion total supply, the project shows significant market activity despite being 84.79% below its all-time high of $2.40 recorded in January 2024. Arbitrum, which has a profile score of 66% and UCID 11841, is supported by verified contracts (0x912C…9E6548), explorers like arbiscan.io, and various wallets. Notably, ARB is up 48.79% from its all-time low of $0.245, reached just two months ago in April 2025. Theta Network (THETA) Climbs 6.21% in Daily Rally, Market Cap Hits $789M Theta Network (THETA), ranked #88 in the global crypto market, surged 6.21% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7896, bringing its market cap to $789.63 million with a matching fully diluted valuation. The 24-hour trading volume rose 41.76% to $23.37 million, resulting in a 2.97% volume-to-market cap ratio. With its entire 1 billion THETA supply already in circulation, the token maintains a profile score of 72% and is backed by explorers like explorer.thetatoken.org, multiple wallets, and a UCID of 2416. Despite trading 95.03% below its all-time high of $15.90 from April 2021, THETA has seen a remarkable 1,886.99% gain since its all-time low of $0.03977 in March 2020. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: The Future is Tangible Real World Asset Tokenization is becoming more than a buzzword. It is transforming how value is represented, owned, and traded across the digital economy. Qubetics is at the forefront of this shift, bringing practicality to a concept that once seemed too complex for mainstream adoption. Key components of Qubetics’ RWA Marketplace: Tokenization Simplicity : Businesses can tokenize assets in minutes using an intuitive UI. Legal Framework : Built-in compliance tools for KYC/AML and regional regulation adherence. Interoperability : Supports Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Revenue Distribution : Token holders earn from marketplace fees and asset-based revenues. Enterprise Use Cases : Real estate, patents, music rights, logistics, and supply chain assets. This model provides an entry point into Web3 for those traditionally excluded due to complexity or legal constraints. With the crypto presale nearing its final moments, Qubetics stands as a living example of the most potential crypto transforming digital finance. Conclusion: Why Timing and Utility Matter More Than Hype in 2025 The surge in crypto adoption is no longer driven by promises—it’s driven by solutions. Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Theta each offer a unique approach to solving real-world problems using blockchain. But among them, Qubetics commands immediate attention. With scarcity building, functionality maturing, and a crypto presale window rapidly closing, the opportunity is real. For those tracking the most potential crypto projects in 2025, this is not the time to stay passive. Qubetics represents a rare alignment of innovation, timing, and traction—making it a standout among the most potential crypto players right now. As the final crypto presale stage winds down, it could become one of the most potential crypto success stories of this market cycle.

Per a report from Forbes Russia , the ministry says its proposal is currently undergoing interdepartmental review. However, if the plans are adopted as-is, Russian law agencies and courts will be given the power to seize crypto from illegal miners. Russia: Miners May Be Fined for Flaunting Bans Under the new proposal, Russian judges will also be able to punish individuals engaging in illegal mining. Courts will be able to hand out fines worth between 100,000 to 200,000 rubles ($1,272 to $2,544). Maksut Shadayev, the Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, speaking at the Federation Council earlier this year. (Source: Federation Council/VK/Screenshot) Forbes Russia says it has seen the ministry’s proposal. It says Moscow also wants to fine and confiscate crypto from any individual found illegally participating in a mining pool. Harsher fines still lie in store for solo entrepreneurs and officials. This group will have to pay between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($2,544 to $5088) if convicted. Authorities will also gain the power to take coins from industrial miners who flaunt crypto mining rules. The new rules will let courts impose a fine of 1 million ($12,728) to 2 million rubles ($25,456) on corporations involved in illegal mining. The ministry wants to amend the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses, seeking to effectively make illegal mining a criminal offense. BTC hashrate distribution amongst the largest known mining pools over the past four days. (Source: Blockchain.com) Crypto Payments Could Also Be Criminalized Under a law that came into force last year, unregistered Russian individuals can mine crypto at home, provided they do not use more than 6,000 kWh per month. However, in some 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions, mining restrictions apply. The law also states that people with unexpunged convictions for economic crimes, or those convicted of extremist or terrorist crimes, cannot mine crypto. The law also bans certain electricity and grid management firms from mining crypto. Additionally, the ministry plans to punish individuals and firms for making settlements in crypto in Russia outside the Central Bank-run crypto sandbox. The ministry’s proposals include plans to fine people and firms who use crypto as a payment tool up to 1 million rubles ($12,728). The Central Bank, however, appears to think that the threat of confiscating coins from people who seek to do business in crypto will be a bigger deterrent. Andrey Medvedev, the bank’s Legal Department lead, told attendees at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum last month: “The key thing is that the [crypto] illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. And this will be the most painful thing.” Russia and China say the Pentagon's proposed missile-defense shield will be destabilizing.

The commission also decided to postpone a proposed year-round ban on mining in the Zabaikalsky Krai and Buryatia regions.

The move comes after weeks of range-bound price action, and while the breakout attempt has gained attention, traders are now watching closely for confirmation through a decisive push above the next resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? So far, ETH has held up well despite broader market volatility. With buyers back in control, the focus has shifted to whether Ethereum can break through the upper boundary of its current range and begin a sustained move higher. Without follow-through, price risks slipping back into consolidation, frustrating bullish positioning. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is now pushing into weekly range highs, specifically a zone defined by a cluster of upper shadows and the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA). This region has repeatedly acted as resistance, rejecting previous rally attempts. Ethereum Bulls Eye Breakout Confirmation Ethereum is at a critical juncture as bulls push price toward the $2,800 resistance — a level that must be decisively cleared to confirm a breakout and transition into a full bullish phase. After a sharp rebound from April’s low, where ETH traded near $1,400, the asset has surged more than 90%, reclaiming key moving averages and breaking through previous short-term resistance levels. Momentum is clearly building, but Ethereum now faces its most important test. The $2,800 zone marks the top of the current range and coincides with multiple technical barriers. Cheds highlighted that ETH is now trading into weekly range highs, where a cluster of upper shadows has repeatedly rejected price. This region also aligns with the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA), reinforcing it as a major zone of resistance. According to Cheds, the bear thesis fails if ETH can flip $2,750 into support — a level that would likely signal trend reversal and sustained upside. However, macro risks remain. US Treasury yields continue to climb, reflecting concerns over inflation and tighter financial conditions. Rising yields often put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by pulling liquidity out of speculative markets. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s structure remains strong. As long as bulls maintain pressure and defend higher lows, the path toward reclaiming $3,000 becomes more probable. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger increased participation, both from technical traders and investors sidelined by recent volatility. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but the momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June ETH Reaches Key Resistance Zone After Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $2,688 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong breakout from a multi-day ascending triangle structure. The move was backed by rising volume and a clean reclaim of all major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($2,558), 100 SMA ($2,571), and 200 SMA ($2,535) — which now act as support beneath price. ETH has pushed directly into a key resistance zone between $2,690 and $2,735, highlighted by several previous rejection wicks. This area has acted as a supply zone since mid-May, capping every breakout attempt and leading to swift pullbacks. The current test marks Ethereum’s fifth attempt to break above this level in recent weeks, which increases the odds of a potential breakout, especially if bulls maintain momentum and volume remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, if ETH fails to clear this zone, a pullback toward the 200 SMA or the $2,600 level is likely, especially if volume tapers off. The structure remains bullish in the short term, with higher lows forming and buying pressure increasing. A confirmed 4H close above $2,735 would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger a push toward $2,900–$3,000. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but bulls are clearly pressing on the door.

In a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, Saylor argued that Chanos fundamentally misunderstands Strategy’s business model, calling the arbitrage thesis “misguided.” Chanos, known for shorting companies he deems overvalued, recently suggested investors should bet against bet against Srategy due to its substantial premium over the firm’s Bitcoin-adjusted book value. That premium, which exceeded 200% at one point in 2024, has been a focal point for skeptics who view Strategy as a glorified Bitcoin holding company. But Saylor pushed back. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” he said. “We’re actually the largest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world.” Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison Saylor emphasized that unlike Bitcoin trusts or closed-end funds, Strategy retains the flexibility to actively manage capital by issuing new financial instruments and leveraging its balance sheet. “Trusts can’t leverage Bitcoin. They can’t issue preferred shares, they can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can,” Saylor asserted. “What [Chanos] still doesn’t understand is that we are not a holding company or a closed-end trust — we are an operating company.” Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently pivoted its capital-raising strategy. Rather than issuing convertible bonds or diluting shareholders through common stock sales, the firm has embraced preferred stock instruments to finance its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. This includes the newly launched STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Perpetual Stride) preferred shares — a trio of high-yield offerings that collectively raised nearly $1 billion last week. Saylor accuses Chanos of misjudging business model Chanos has not responded to Saylor’s latest remarks. But Saylor was unsparing in his critique of the hedge fund manager’s valuation approach. Saylor said Chanos is valuing the business, generating $8.4 billion of shareholder value at zero, and he is hoping the equity will somehow trade to NAV. He continued to say that Chanos is not paying attention to if Strategy can issue preferred shares that yield 10% and invest that in Bitcoin, which has been going up by 57% for the past four and a half years. Saylor noted that the company is capturing the 47% arbitrage, effectively risk-free for their common stock shareholders. As of Tuesday, Strategy held approximately 582,000 Bitcoin — valued at about $63 billion — making it the largest corporate holder of the asset globally. The company has made over 70 Bitcoin purchase announcements since mid-2020 when Saylor initiated the strategy of using corporate funds to buy the digital currency. Saylor plans stock buybacks to squeeze shorts if premium narrows Saylor also hinted at future financial maneuvers to counter short-seller strategies. Should the premium on Strategy’s stock narrow too much, the firm could issue more preferred shares and use the proceeds to repurchase common shares, further tightening supply and squeezing shorts. “If the stock trades at a weak premium, we’re just going to sell the preferred,” he said. “And if the stock rallies up, he’s going to get liquidated and wiped out.” While the war of words between Chanos and Saylor may intensify, it reflects a broader debate over how to value a Bitcoin-centric operating company in a market still grappling with crypto’s integration into traditional finance. For now, Saylor remains unapologetically bullish — on Bitcoin and Strategy’s ability to outperform critics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Each is gaining momentum for different reasons: Unstaked is leveraging a $1 million giveaway to drive presale growth, Aave is rolling out a major DeFi infrastructure update, and HYPE is testing bullish resistance levels near $40. In a market hungry for clarity and purpose, these three are giving investors plenty to consider. While many search for the best crypto to buy right now, the rising winners seem to combine utility, community alignment, and strong fundamentals. Unstaked leads the way with its unique AI-driven platform and a no-insider-allocation presale. Aave reaffirms its legacy with a sophisticated overhaul to risk management. HYPE, on the other hand, shows that even high-volatility assets can deliver when supported by data and demand. Aave Umbrella Update Overhauls Risk and Rewards The upcoming Aave (AAVE) updates, part of the Umbrella upgrade, are set to reshape the protocol’s risk management framework. Aave is transitioning from locking AAVE and LP tokens to allowing aToken based contributions, enabling users to directly stake assets like aUSDC and aUSDT in exchange for variable yields. More importantly, slashing events will now be triggered automatically based on smart contract data, removing the need for governance votes in most risk events. The update also introduces StakeTokens, which represent a user’s stake in the safety module. These tokens carry slashing risk tied to actual pool deficits, but are managed via a more transparent and decentralized system. Aave is also reducing emissions of AAVE rewards while continuing strategic buybacks, aiming for long-term sustainability. The update arrives at a crucial time for Aave, as competition among DeFi protocols intensifies. Investors monitoring Aave updates are particularly encouraged by the improved capital efficiency and real-time risk response built into this release. For many, it adds further weight to AAVE’s reputation as the best crypto to buy right now among large-cap DeFi assets. HYPE Builds Momentum Despite Whale Exit Despite recent volatility, Hyperliquid (HYPE) remains a strong project in the perpetuals space. After a dramatic $1 million profit-taking move by high-profile trader James Wynn, HYPE has steadied above the $31 level and is now targeting a move toward $40. Wynn entered at an average price of $24.84 and exited near $32.72, marking a 31.9% return on a leveraged trade. While his exit briefly shook confidence, fundamentals behind the project remain strong. Hyperliquid’s May metrics point to increasing traction: TVL rose 108% to $1.46 billion, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume reached a record-breaking $248.3 billion. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows an early bullish crossover, and the price is consolidating just under a resistance zone at $35. If that level breaks, the HYPE coin target of $40 may be in play. For short-term traders and high-risk speculators, HYPE offers volatility, volume, and narrative alignment. However, even conservative investors are now watching closely, as Hyperliquid’s performance makes it a surprise opportunity for the best crypto to buy right now, particularly for those seeking explosive upside potential in DeFi-native environments. Unstaked: AI, Rewards, and the Road to $10M While legacy DeFi players grow and high-octane trades unfold, Unstaked is capturing sustained attention with its AI-powered community platform and unique token model. Currently in Stage 19 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $9.4 million, with tokens priced at $0.011065. The projected launch price is $0.1819, representing a potential 28x return for early buyers. At the heart of the project is a Proof of Intelligence model, where users earn rewards based on contributions, not simply for holding. Unlike many presales, Unstaked features no insider allocations, which fosters trust and fairness within the community. Its AI tools, community voting system, and merit-based incentives combine to form a truly decentralized product vision. To further amplify interest, Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway, awarding 20 winners $50,000 in $UNSD tokens each. Entry requires a minimum $100 purchase and completion of a few social tasks, creating a highly engaged and invested early user base. Among the many presales in the market, Unstaked stands out for its clarity of purpose and execution. It’s not just another AI token or governance play, it’s a live testbed for community-driven crypto development. For investors evaluating the best crypto to buy right now, Unstaked is fast becoming the presale to beat. What Informed Investors Are Watching in 2025 The crypto market in 2025 is rewarding substance, not just speculation. As the latest Aave (AAVE) updates streamline DeFi safety nets, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) coin target bulls push toward $40, Unstaked’s strong community, transparent model, and AI-powered platform are pushing it to the top of presale watchlists. Unstaked’s $1 million campaign, combined with no insider advantages and a performance-based reward system, offers a refreshing model for future crypto launches. Whether you’re a DeFi veteran or new to the space, now is a rare window where development, incentives, and investor alignment are syncing up. For those searching for the best crypto to buy right now, the answer may lie not in the familiar names of old cycles, but in those quietly building the next one.

33767162,[object Object],1749600025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin LTHs Increase Holdings By 1.151M BTC – Will They Continue to HODL?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-lths-increase-holdings-by-1-151m-btc-will-they-continue-to-hodl/,"Bitcoin is currently trading around critical levels, having recently surged past the $110,000 mark, a milestone that underscores its robust momentum. As of Tuesday, June 10, 2025, at 07:08 AM EDT, BTC hovers below its all-time high of $112,000, yet it demonstrates resilience with strong support around the $105,000 level. This positioning suggests the cryptocurrency is well-positioned to maintain its upward trajectory, provided it can sustain this key support. The market’s bullish sentiment is further bolstered by significant accumulation from long-term holders (LTHs), a trend highlighted by recent CryptoQuant data. Starting from the $83,000 level, the LTH cohort has expanded from 14.031 million to 15.182 million BTC, an increase of 1.151 million BTC. Valued at approximately $125.4 billion at current prices, this accumulation reflects a deepening commitment from seasoned investors. This substantial influx of holdings, amassed primarily in the $61K–$83K range, underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s l ong-term value . As the market watches for a potential retest of the $112,000 ATH, the strength of LTH support could be the deciding factor in whether BTC continues its climb or faces a pullback. Bitcoin Prepares To Move As LTH Signal Strength Bitcoin is poised to enter a phase of price discovery, potentially signaling an explosive move that could reshape the entire cryptocurrency market. As of Tuesday, June 10, 2025, BTC is consolidating near its all-time high (ATH) of $112,000, a critical juncture that could dictate its next direction. This week promises to be decisive, with the market teetering between an expansion into uncharted territory above $112,000 or a pullback to clear liquidity below $105,000. Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to fuel volatility across financial markets, with the U.S. economy exhibiting increased systemic risks. Rising US Treasury yields are adding pressure, amplifying the stakes for BTC’s next move. Top analyst Axel Adler recently provided valuable insights , highlighting the robust accumulation by Long-Term Holders (LTHs). Starting from the $83,000 level, the LTH cohort has grown from 14.031 million to 15.182 million BTC, an increase of 1.151 million BTC, currently valued at approximately $125.4 billion. These coins were amassed in the $61K–$83K range, with an average entry price of around $72,000. The LTHs now enjoy an unrealized profit of about $42.5 billion, representing a 51% gain above their cost basis. This significant holding increase reflects strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, potentially acting as a stabilizing force during this consolidation phase. Whether BTC breaks out to new highs or retreats to test lower support, the LTH accumulation suggests a solid foundation. BTC Consolidates Below Price Discovery Bitcoin is trading at $109,546 on the daily chart, consolidating just below the $112,000 all-time high after reclaiming the $109,300 resistance level. The price action shows a strong recovery from last week’s dip to the $103,600 support, a level that continues to act as a key pivot during periods of volatility. This clean bounce from support, followed by multiple higher lows, keeps the overall structure bullish. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $102,409 continues to rise, offering additional support just above the $100K psychological level. Meanwhile, the 100 and 200 SMAs at $93,237 and $95,419 remain well below the current price, highlighting Bitcoin’s dominant trend strength. Volume has been steady, and the price is now pressing against the upper range, suggesting the market is coiling for a decisive move. A daily close above $112K would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger Bitcoin’s entrance into price discovery. However, if BTC fails to reclaim new highs, a sweep back toward $105K–$106K is possible, especially given current macroeconomic headwinds.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 791,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on gold’s price action, noting that the precious metal’s chart is the “most important chart to watch” this week. According to the trader, gold appears to have printed a bearish lower high setup on the six-hour chart, suggesting that the precious metal could fall to as low as $3,200 in the near term. “As long as Gold stays sub-$3,365, we’re likely going to see a sharp fall in the coming one to two weeks of anything between 4-10%, resulting into a sudden macroeconomic shift.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Van de Poppe believes that falling gold prices will be beneficial for altcoins, as it suggests an increased appetite for risk among investors. “At the end of [last] week, a sudden [gold] correction took place, which might result in the confirmation of a short-term downtrend. This is vital, as that would attract more investors towards Altcoins. Why? It would enable more investors to be jumping into risk-on assets, when gold implies that it continues to fall. This means –> money/liquidity flows from risk-off assets towards risk-on assets, and the best asset class remains to be crypto.” But the trader warns that altcoins will likely see lower levels if gold shatters $3,365. “If it does break above that crucial level, the theory is invalidated, and we’re likely open for printing new highs, which then means that we’re printing new lows on altcoins. For me, this is crucial, as a correction in Gold and rally in the CNH (offshore Chinese renminbi) implies that we’re going to be seeing more interest flowing into crypto after that.” At time of writing, gold is trading for $3,324, up more than 60% in the last 18 months.

This comes as the SEC has requested issuers that are launching the Solana ETFs to submit their updated filings especially for the S-1 form within a week potentially signaling approvals. Filing changes signal accelerated Solana ETF approvals A source cited by Blockworks has suggested the filing changes could accelerate the Solana ETF approval, possibly in July or within three to five weeks, before October when most of the final deadlines for a SEC decision expire. According to two sources that spoke with Blockworks, the SEC will provide comments the S-1 forms within a space of 30 days of submission. The agency reportedly solicited for explanations from companies on how investors will get their money back in crypto. It’s also pushing to know if companies plan to include staking, which means earning rewards by helping run the Solana network. The SEC is also said to be open to allowing staking as part of these products. “If staking gets approved, it changes the game” said one enthusiast identified as Crypto Racoon on X platform.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of approval in 2025 are at 90%, which matches their forecast for LitecoinETF approval. “We think the SEC may now focus on handling 19b-4 filings for Solana and staking ETFs earlier than planned.” Bloomberg analysts. Seyffart indicated this week that SEC may prioritize reviewing 19b-4 filings for Solana and bet ETFs sooner than expected, adding that the issuers and industry players have likely been working with SEC together with its crypto taskforce to finalize the details. He also added that Solana and XRP already have futures-based ETFs, which usually makes it easier for the SEC to give a not to spot ETFs. Last month the regulator delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF indicating that it had not “reached any conclusions” on the19b-4 filing to list the proposed ETF. The delay was viewed as procedural rather than rejection. Grayscale wants to convert its SOL Trust into a spot ETF, reflecting the path it used to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF funds. The firm’s filing was delayed on May 13, while Franklin Templeton’s proposal was delayed on April 30, according to SEC. In the meantime, filings by Fidelity and VanEck were postponed on May 19. After the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum ETF in May this year, attention has now turned to other top digital assets like Solana. News of the development sent SOL 4% up, bringing its price close to $165 per trading view data.

He warns that increased oversight could stifle innovation and weaken the US’s competitive edge against China. Speaking to Bloomberg News on Tuesday, Schmidt—who also oversees security at Amazon Web Services (AWS)—cautioned against government overreach in the rapidly evolving AI sector. He said the tension with regulation of any kind is that it tends to retard progress. Schmidt continued to say their approach is to let the industry define appropriate standards—guided primarily by customer needs and demands. Tech leaders push back as Washington moves to rein In AI development Schmidt’s remarks echo those made last month by Microsoft, OpenAI, AMD, and CoreWeave executives during a congressional hearing. The tech leaders argued that government regulation could hinder their ability to compete globally—especially with China, which has made AI development a national priority. Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, emphasized the necessity of “sensible regulation that doesn’t slow us down,” signaling a widening fissure between innovation and governing within the tech world. The fight over AI regulation is heating up on Capitol Hill. A controversy erupted when the House tucked language into President Donald Trump’s broad tax package that would prevent states from going their own way to enforce new AI rules. The provision prompted bipartisan pushback and focused attention on a growing worry that there are no controls on the development of AI. A vocal advocate for unfettered AI growth, Trump has taken steps to dismantle constraints, including repealing the Biden administration’s executive order on AI and promoting AI-related investments in the Middle East. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the move, calling it essential to national security and asserting that “regulatory restraint” was key to ensuring America’s dominance in AI. Attorney General Rob Bonta said he strongly opposes any effort to block states from developing and enforcing common-sense regulation. He noted that states must be able to protect their residents by responding to emerging and evolving AI technology. California implemented a raft of bills this year limiting specific uses of AI, illustrating the kind of laws that would be blocked under the moratorium. Like several other states, California has criminalized the use of AI to generate sexually explicit images of individuals without their consent. The state also prohibits unauthorized deepfakes in political advertising and requires healthcare providers to notify patients when interacting with an AI, not a human. Healthcare provider networks, also known as HMOs, are barred in California from using AI systems instead of doctors to decide medical necessity. Senate challenges House approach However, the House provision may not survive Senate scrutiny. Under budget reconciliation rules, only measures directly related to federal spending or revenue can bypass the filibuster and pass with a simple majority. The Senate proposed alternative language as a workaround: denying federal broadband funding to states that impose their own AI regulations. But the provision’s fate hinges on the ruling of the Senate parliamentarian, who has not yet weighed in. “We have yet to argue this before the parliamentarian. I anticipate that we will do so this week or next week,” Senate Commerce Chairman Ted Cruz told Bloomberg TV . “I don’t know how she’ll rule.” Still, Cruz called the Senate’s approach “very sound policy.” The regulatory debate comes as Amazon ramps up investment in AI infrastructure. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant recently announced plans to spend up to $20 billion on server farms in Pennsylvania—further evidence of the company’s high-stakes bet on artificial intelligence as a core driver of future growth. Like its peers, Amazon sees AI as not just a technological leap but a geopolitical one. And for now, industry leaders are betting that the fewer the rules, the faster they can run.

American Bitcoin (ABTC), backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has quietly accumulated over 215 BTC, valued at $23 million, since its launch on April 1. As revealed in a recent SEC filing dated June 6, ABTC isn’t just a mining company; it’s a Bitcoin accumulation vehicle with long-term ambitions. Operating over 60,000 miners housed in Hut 8 facilities, ABTC generates over 10.17 EH/s of hashpower without owning any real estate. Instead of converting mined Bitcoin into cash, the company stores its reserves securely using Coinbase Custody. Eric and Donald Trump Jr.-backed American #Bitcoin quietly accumulates 215 $BTC ($23M+) since April launch ahead of public merger. pic.twitter.com/OXP9wZvDRS — amit malik (@amitmalikmalik) June 10, 2025 With Eric Trump joining the board and a public listing in the works via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, the company is tying its identity and brand equity to Bitcoin itself. Key points: ABTC’s mining approach focuses on BTC accumulation, not fiat conversion. Trump family’s backing adds political clout and media visibility. Market sees this as bullish supply-side pressure—less BTC on exchanges. U.S. Charges $500M Crypto Laundering Plot While ABTC builds a bullish case, U.S. regulators dropped a bombshell. The DOJ arrested Iurii Gugnin, founder of Evita Pay and Evita Investments, for laundering over $500 million through U.S. banks and crypto platforms, mainly using Tether (USDT). U.S. CRACKS DOWN ON CRYPTO KING: SECRET TECH DEALS WITH RUSSIA EXPOSED U.S. prosecutors charged Iurii Gugnin, founder of crypto payments company Evita, with laundering over $500 million and helping Russians get sensitive American tech. Court documents allege Gugnin used… https://t.co/ccVEVtO59E pic.twitter.com/XMQiVOeatj — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) June 10, 2025 Gugnin is accused of helping sanctioned Russian entities like Sberbank and Rosatom dodge international restrictions. The indictment includes 22 counts of bank fraud, each carrying up to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors allege he: Bought U.S. technology for banned firms. Falsified documents to hide ties to Russia. Exploited crypto’s opacity to bypass sanctions. This case reinforces growing concerns that digital assets are being used to sidestep international law, prompting stricter global oversight. Still, Bitcoin’s transparent and decentralized nature differentiates it from intermediated platforms and may continue to attract regulatory favor. Japan’s QE Pivot May Ignite Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sees a potential global liquidity wave on the horizon. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) resumes quantitative easing (QE) at its June 16–17 meeting, Hayes believes it could be the next big tailwind for Bitcoin. The Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting could impact global risk assets. If they shift to QE, $BTC may surge towards $200K as it becomes a hedge against sovereign risks. Read the full article https://t.co/i2bvc3IJ2I — Nova – {News} AI Agent (@ChainGPTAINews) June 10, 2025 Why? Japan recently signaled plans to reduce bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter. But with rising yields, 30-year JGBs hit 3.185% in May—officials may reverse course. Bitcoin previously surged to $112,000 when yields spiked, suggesting investors see it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability. Hayes predicts: QE would boost risk assets, including BTC. Institutions may turn to Bitcoin as a “counterparty-risk-free” asset. A renewed rally could push Bitcoin toward the $200,000 mark in 2025. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $112K and Beyond? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC remains in a bullish ascending channel on the 2-hour chart, trading above the 50-EMA ($107,510) and making consistent higher lows. A bullish engulfing candle on June 9 pushed the price above a key barrier at $108,627, with current resistance at $110,668. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is flattening, hinting at weakening momentum, while candlesticks show upper wicks—a sign of hesitation. A confirmed breakout above $111,000 could ignite momentum toward $112,000 and $113,500. Technical Levels to Watch: Support: $108,000 (channel base), $107,510 (50-EMA) Resistance: $111,000, $113,500 Trade idea: Buy on breakout or bounce off 50-EMA with a tight stop-loss Conclusion Macro shifts, regulatory crackdowns, and high-profile political support are reshaping the narrative surrounding Bitcoin. As ABTC accumulates, Japan considers more stimulus, and chart patterns remain constructive, the path toward $200K is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a data-backed possibility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading at just $0.03, is drawing comparisons to early-stage Ethereum (ETH) for its ambitious DeFi infrastructure and disruptive potential. The project has already raised more than $10.3 million and attracted over 11,800 holders. Meanwhile, Ethereum, still one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, continues to defend its legacy with strong developer activity and growing institutional adoption, trading at $2,486 as of early June 2025. But as retail investors ask what crypto to buy now, many are betting that MUTM could be the next crypto to take off, offering exponential upside, and potentially carving out its own market alongside Ethereum (ETH) in the changing decentralized market. Mutuum Finance’s Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their listing price of $0.06, which is a 100% gain for phase 5 investors upon the token’s launch. With over $10.3 million raised and a growing community of 11,800+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Rewards for Early Investors Fuel Ongoing Community Growth As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow, it remains committed to its earliest supporters. To show appreciation, 10 early investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway —each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This rewards them for being early backers of the project before it takes off. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key features of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $10.3 million and attracted more than 11,800 holders signaling strong early momentum in the DeFi space. As Phase 5 of the presale continues investors can still acquire tokens at $0.03 ahead of the planned $0.06 listing price which will yield a 100% ROI. The project’s hybrid lending model, Certik-audited smart contracts, and upcoming fully collateralized stablecoin highlight a serious commitment to innovation, transparency, and long-term value.

You’re Among Crypto’s Elite, Expert Claims",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/owning-10000-xrp-youre-among-cryptos-elite-expert-claims/,"According to crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina, most individual XRP holders could find themselves shut out as inflation and tight budgets squeeze their options. He argues that owning more than 10,000 XRP – which costs about $23,100 at a price of $2.31 per token – has become a barrier for anyone living paycheck to paycheck. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Rich List Data Reveals Concentration Based on reports, there are about 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses in existence. Less than 4% of those wallets contain at least 10,000 XRP. A clear majority, over 5 million addresses, hold 500 XRP or fewer. That gap shows how stacked the system is. More than 166,250 wallets sit in the 10,000–25,000 XRP range. Another 159,566 wallets carry between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. These figures point to a small group with deep pockets, while the rest trail far behind. Owning more than 10,000 $XRP nowadays is already a luxury few people can afford. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 9, 2025 Inflation Pressures Hit Small Holders Farina warns that rising inflation is forcing ordinary holders to sell just to cover daily needs. He notes, “We’re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries.” When basic goods cost more each month, people feel they have no choice but to cash out their crypto. It’s a harsh reality. Owning large amounts of XRP has morphed from a luxury into a struggle for survival. Threshold Debate Heats Up He first said 95% of XRP holders risk being priced out. Now he’s raised that warning to 99%. That jump has sparked debate. Some worry it feeds a fear of missing out on a “10,000-XRP club,” while others see it as a wake-up call. Farina questions whether Bitcoin’s rally to about $112,000 really reflects growth, or simply the dollar losing its value. He frames the issue as a tug-of-war between crypto gains and fiat losses. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Calls For New Income Streams Instead of selling crypto, Farina urges holders to find extra income. He suggests side hustles or online work as ways to avoid cutting into holdings. “If you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,” he said. His advice pushes people to rethink how they earn and where they live. Crypto markets can move on legal news and product launches, not only inflation. Ripple’s ongoing court case and ETF filings could change XRP’s path. Still, Farina’s message taps into a broader concern: the gap between small and large holders may widen as prices climb. Retail investors can still join in. They just need to pace their buys and stay aware of both crypto trends and everyday costs.
