MNT and GT underperformed due to inflation risk and weak bullish momentum. Liquidity, supply metrics, and sentiment drove divergence in exchange token returns. A sharp divergence has emerged in the exchange token sector over the past two months, highlighting a market that is increasingly rewarding utility and sound tokenomics while punishing perceived risks. An analysis of five prominent exchange tokens shows that while Binance Coin (BNB), Bitget Token (BGB), and OKX’s OKB posted respectable gains, Bybit’s Mantle (MNT) and GateToken (GT) trailed with significant losses.

As Arbitrum Spikes and Theta Taps AI Expansion,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-most-potential-crypto-of-2025-as-arbitrum-spikes-and-theta-taps-ai-expansion/,"The crypto world in 2025 is no longer dominated by hype alone—utility and real-world use cases are now setting the pace. With thousands of tokens competing for attention, only a select few are being recognized as the most potential crypto contenders. These aren’t just speculative assets—they are solving actual problems in industries like finance, data infrastructure, and digital ownership. Among the projects gaining traction, Qubetics has entered the spotlight for its bold push into real world asset tokenization. Meanwhile, heavyweights like Arbitrum and Theta are also innovating in ways that reinforce their positions among the most potential crypto networks to watch this year. For participants and developers alike, recognizing the most potential crypto early can define long-term success. In 2025, the projects combining tangible utility with scalable ecosystems are likely to lead the next wave. Qubetics ($TICS) Is Redefining the RWA Narrative—The Countdown Is On Qubetics isn’t just riding the tokenization wave—it’s shaping it. The protocol is launching a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that simplifies access for enterprises, entrepreneurs, and professionals. This isn’t just another DeFi platform; it’s a robust, user-friendly gateway to tokenize assets ranging from real estate to intellectual property. At the heart of Qubetics’ design is a massive shift in tokenomics. By slashing its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, the protocol has introduced scarcity from the start. The public sale allocation has increased to 38.55%, placing power directly in the hands of its user base. This move toward decentralization comes with significant implications for governance and long-term value. As of June 2025: Presale Stage: 37th Tokens Sold: 515 million+ Holders: 27,800+ Funds Raised: $17.9 million+ Current Price: $0.3370 Next Price Jump: $0.40 (20% hike) Recent community updates hint at a Tier 1 CEX listing by Q3 and a mainnet rollout by early Q4. Analysts from BlockForge Labs highlight $TICS among the most potential crypto assets of the year, citing its community-led model, aggressive burn mechanism, and enterprise-focused features. What truly sets Qubetics apart is its solution-driven framework. Many of its predecessors failed to simplify tokenization for real-world use cases. In contrast, Qubetics enables asset-backed digital ownership, wrapped in a legally compliant and cross-chain compatible system. In a digital era where tangible value is becoming harder to secure, Qubetics makes RWA tokenization accessible—and that’s not just innovation, it’s necessity. Investment Scenario: What a $10,000 Entry Looks Like in Qubetics’ Final Presale Stage Let’s say you’re entering Qubetics with a $10,000 buy-in during stage 37 at the current price of $0.3370. That gets you approximately 29,672 $TICS tokens before the listing price increases to $0.40. With only 10 million tokens left and a fast-closing window, timing is critical. At listing, those tokens will be worth $11,869, giving you a solid 18.7% gain right out of the gate. Looking further ahead, if $TICS reaches $5, that same $10K entry would turn into $148,360—a 1,383% return fueled by Qubetics’ unique tokenomics, reduced supply model (now just 1.36 billion total tokens), and increased community control through its 38.55% public allocation. If the token surges to $10 in the next bull run, your $10,000 becomes $296,720—a 2,867% ROI. For anyone looking to make a strategic move with limited capital, this might be the single strongest presale opportunity currently live in 2025. Arbitrum (ARB) Soars 7.47% in 24 Hours, Volume Spikes Over 84% Arbitrum (ARB), currently ranked #50 among cryptocurrencies, surged 7.47% in the last 24 hours to trade at $0.3645, pushing its market cap to $1.77 billion—up 7.44% on the day. Trading volume skyrocketed 84.05% to $169.52 million, giving it a high 9.56% volume-to-market cap ratio. With a circulating supply of 4.86 billion ARB out of a 10 billion total supply, the project shows significant market activity despite being 84.79% below its all-time high of $2.40 recorded in January 2024. Arbitrum, which has a profile score of 66% and UCID 11841, is supported by verified contracts (0x912C…9E6548), explorers like arbiscan.io, and various wallets. Notably, ARB is up 48.79% from its all-time low of $0.245, reached just two months ago in April 2025. Theta Network (THETA) Climbs 6.21% in Daily Rally, Market Cap Hits $789M Theta Network (THETA), ranked #88 in the global crypto market, surged 6.21% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7896, bringing its market cap to $789.63 million with a matching fully diluted valuation. The 24-hour trading volume rose 41.76% to $23.37 million, resulting in a 2.97% volume-to-market cap ratio. With its entire 1 billion THETA supply already in circulation, the token maintains a profile score of 72% and is backed by explorers like explorer.thetatoken.org, multiple wallets, and a UCID of 2416. Despite trading 95.03% below its all-time high of $15.90 from April 2021, THETA has seen a remarkable 1,886.99% gain since its all-time low of $0.03977 in March 2020. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: The Future is Tangible Real World Asset Tokenization is becoming more than a buzzword. It is transforming how value is represented, owned, and traded across the digital economy. Qubetics is at the forefront of this shift, bringing practicality to a concept that once seemed too complex for mainstream adoption. Key components of Qubetics’ RWA Marketplace: Tokenization Simplicity : Businesses can tokenize assets in minutes using an intuitive UI. Legal Framework : Built-in compliance tools for KYC/AML and regional regulation adherence. Interoperability : Supports Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Revenue Distribution : Token holders earn from marketplace fees and asset-based revenues. Enterprise Use Cases : Real estate, patents, music rights, logistics, and supply chain assets. This model provides an entry point into Web3 for those traditionally excluded due to complexity or legal constraints. With the crypto presale nearing its final moments, Qubetics stands as a living example of the most potential crypto transforming digital finance. Conclusion: Why Timing and Utility Matter More Than Hype in 2025 The surge in crypto adoption is no longer driven by promises—it’s driven by solutions. Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Theta each offer a unique approach to solving real-world problems using blockchain. But among them, Qubetics commands immediate attention. With scarcity building, functionality maturing, and a crypto presale window rapidly closing, the opportunity is real. For those tracking the most potential crypto projects in 2025, this is not the time to stay passive. Qubetics represents a rare alignment of innovation, timing, and traction—making it a standout among the most potential crypto players right now. As the final crypto presale stage winds down, it could become one of the most potential crypto success stories of this market cycle.

Per a report from Forbes Russia , the ministry says its proposal is currently undergoing interdepartmental review. However, if the plans are adopted as-is, Russian law agencies and courts will be given the power to seize crypto from illegal miners. Russia: Miners May Be Fined for Flaunting Bans Under the new proposal, Russian judges will also be able to punish individuals engaging in illegal mining. Courts will be able to hand out fines worth between 100,000 to 200,000 rubles ($1,272 to $2,544). Maksut Shadayev, the Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, speaking at the Federation Council earlier this year. (Source: Federation Council/VK/Screenshot) Forbes Russia says it has seen the ministry’s proposal. It says Moscow also wants to fine and confiscate crypto from any individual found illegally participating in a mining pool. Harsher fines still lie in store for solo entrepreneurs and officials. This group will have to pay between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($2,544 to $5088) if convicted. Authorities will also gain the power to take coins from industrial miners who flaunt crypto mining rules. The new rules will let courts impose a fine of 1 million ($12,728) to 2 million rubles ($25,456) on corporations involved in illegal mining. The ministry wants to amend the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses, seeking to effectively make illegal mining a criminal offense. BTC hashrate distribution amongst the largest known mining pools over the past four days. (Source: Blockchain.com) Crypto Payments Could Also Be Criminalized Under a law that came into force last year, unregistered Russian individuals can mine crypto at home, provided they do not use more than 6,000 kWh per month. However, in some 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions, mining restrictions apply. The law also states that people with unexpunged convictions for economic crimes, or those convicted of extremist or terrorist crimes, cannot mine crypto. The law also bans certain electricity and grid management firms from mining crypto. Additionally, the ministry plans to punish individuals and firms for making settlements in crypto in Russia outside the Central Bank-run crypto sandbox. The ministry’s proposals include plans to fine people and firms who use crypto as a payment tool up to 1 million rubles ($12,728). The Central Bank, however, appears to think that the threat of confiscating coins from people who seek to do business in crypto will be a bigger deterrent. Andrey Medvedev, the bank’s Legal Department lead, told attendees at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum last month: “The key thing is that the [crypto] illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. And this will be the most painful thing.” Russia and China say the Pentagon's proposed missile-defense shield will be destabilizing.

The commission also decided to postpone a proposed year-round ban on mining in the Zabaikalsky Krai and Buryatia regions.

The move comes after weeks of range-bound price action, and while the breakout attempt has gained attention, traders are now watching closely for confirmation through a decisive push above the next resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? So far, ETH has held up well despite broader market volatility. With buyers back in control, the focus has shifted to whether Ethereum can break through the upper boundary of its current range and begin a sustained move higher. Without follow-through, price risks slipping back into consolidation, frustrating bullish positioning. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is now pushing into weekly range highs, specifically a zone defined by a cluster of upper shadows and the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA). This region has repeatedly acted as resistance, rejecting previous rally attempts. Ethereum Bulls Eye Breakout Confirmation Ethereum is at a critical juncture as bulls push price toward the $2,800 resistance — a level that must be decisively cleared to confirm a breakout and transition into a full bullish phase. After a sharp rebound from April’s low, where ETH traded near $1,400, the asset has surged more than 90%, reclaiming key moving averages and breaking through previous short-term resistance levels. Momentum is clearly building, but Ethereum now faces its most important test. The $2,800 zone marks the top of the current range and coincides with multiple technical barriers. Cheds highlighted that ETH is now trading into weekly range highs, where a cluster of upper shadows has repeatedly rejected price. This region also aligns with the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA), reinforcing it as a major zone of resistance. According to Cheds, the bear thesis fails if ETH can flip $2,750 into support — a level that would likely signal trend reversal and sustained upside. However, macro risks remain. US Treasury yields continue to climb, reflecting concerns over inflation and tighter financial conditions. Rising yields often put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by pulling liquidity out of speculative markets. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s structure remains strong. As long as bulls maintain pressure and defend higher lows, the path toward reclaiming $3,000 becomes more probable. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger increased participation, both from technical traders and investors sidelined by recent volatility. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but the momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June ETH Reaches Key Resistance Zone After Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $2,688 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong breakout from a multi-day ascending triangle structure. The move was backed by rising volume and a clean reclaim of all major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($2,558), 100 SMA ($2,571), and 200 SMA ($2,535) — which now act as support beneath price. ETH has pushed directly into a key resistance zone between $2,690 and $2,735, highlighted by several previous rejection wicks. This area has acted as a supply zone since mid-May, capping every breakout attempt and leading to swift pullbacks. The current test marks Ethereum’s fifth attempt to break above this level in recent weeks, which increases the odds of a potential breakout, especially if bulls maintain momentum and volume remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, if ETH fails to clear this zone, a pullback toward the 200 SMA or the $2,600 level is likely, especially if volume tapers off. The structure remains bullish in the short term, with higher lows forming and buying pressure increasing. A confirmed 4H close above $2,735 would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger a push toward $2,900–$3,000. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but bulls are clearly pressing on the door.

In a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, Saylor argued that Chanos fundamentally misunderstands Strategy’s business model, calling the arbitrage thesis “misguided.” Chanos, known for shorting companies he deems overvalued, recently suggested investors should bet against bet against Srategy due to its substantial premium over the firm’s Bitcoin-adjusted book value. That premium, which exceeded 200% at one point in 2024, has been a focal point for skeptics who view Strategy as a glorified Bitcoin holding company. But Saylor pushed back. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” he said. “We’re actually the largest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world.” Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison Saylor emphasized that unlike Bitcoin trusts or closed-end funds, Strategy retains the flexibility to actively manage capital by issuing new financial instruments and leveraging its balance sheet. “Trusts can’t leverage Bitcoin. They can’t issue preferred shares, they can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can,” Saylor asserted. “What [Chanos] still doesn’t understand is that we are not a holding company or a closed-end trust — we are an operating company.” Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently pivoted its capital-raising strategy. Rather than issuing convertible bonds or diluting shareholders through common stock sales, the firm has embraced preferred stock instruments to finance its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. This includes the newly launched STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Perpetual Stride) preferred shares — a trio of high-yield offerings that collectively raised nearly $1 billion last week. Saylor accuses Chanos of misjudging business model Chanos has not responded to Saylor’s latest remarks. But Saylor was unsparing in his critique of the hedge fund manager’s valuation approach. Saylor said Chanos is valuing the business, generating $8.4 billion of shareholder value at zero, and he is hoping the equity will somehow trade to NAV. He continued to say that Chanos is not paying attention to if Strategy can issue preferred shares that yield 10% and invest that in Bitcoin, which has been going up by 57% for the past four and a half years. Saylor noted that the company is capturing the 47% arbitrage, effectively risk-free for their common stock shareholders. As of Tuesday, Strategy held approximately 582,000 Bitcoin — valued at about $63 billion — making it the largest corporate holder of the asset globally. The company has made over 70 Bitcoin purchase announcements since mid-2020 when Saylor initiated the strategy of using corporate funds to buy the digital currency. Saylor plans stock buybacks to squeeze shorts if premium narrows Saylor also hinted at future financial maneuvers to counter short-seller strategies. Should the premium on Strategy’s stock narrow too much, the firm could issue more preferred shares and use the proceeds to repurchase common shares, further tightening supply and squeezing shorts. “If the stock trades at a weak premium, we’re just going to sell the preferred,” he said. “And if the stock rallies up, he’s going to get liquidated and wiped out.” While the war of words between Chanos and Saylor may intensify, it reflects a broader debate over how to value a Bitcoin-centric operating company in a market still grappling with crypto’s integration into traditional finance. For now, Saylor remains unapologetically bullish — on Bitcoin and Strategy’s ability to outperform critics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Support near the 50-day and 100-day EMAs may lead to a future price surge. Positive futures market indicators suggest growing institutional commitment to XRP. Despite market fluctuations, XRP remains stable with strong support around it. As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.27 , and it has gone up by 0.85% during the past 24 hours. The price increased strongly at the start of March but soon fell again after passing through some important moving averages. XRP Derivatives Market Shows Strong Bullish Signals In the derivatives market, XRP shows signs that add strength to the idea of a bullish trend. According to CoinGlass, the daily trading volume has gone up to $5.27 billion by 26.64%, and open interest rose by 5.25% to $4.27 billion. Such high numbers indicate countries are becoming more interested and are investing for the long term.

Each is gaining momentum for different reasons: Unstaked is leveraging a $1 million giveaway to drive presale growth, Aave is rolling out a major DeFi infrastructure update, and HYPE is testing bullish resistance levels near $40. In a market hungry for clarity and purpose, these three are giving investors plenty to consider. While many search for the best crypto to buy right now, the rising winners seem to combine utility, community alignment, and strong fundamentals. Unstaked leads the way with its unique AI-driven platform and a no-insider-allocation presale. Aave reaffirms its legacy with a sophisticated overhaul to risk management. HYPE, on the other hand, shows that even high-volatility assets can deliver when supported by data and demand. Aave Umbrella Update Overhauls Risk and Rewards The upcoming Aave (AAVE) updates, part of the Umbrella upgrade, are set to reshape the protocol’s risk management framework. Aave is transitioning from locking AAVE and LP tokens to allowing aToken based contributions, enabling users to directly stake assets like aUSDC and aUSDT in exchange for variable yields. More importantly, slashing events will now be triggered automatically based on smart contract data, removing the need for governance votes in most risk events. The update also introduces StakeTokens, which represent a user’s stake in the safety module. These tokens carry slashing risk tied to actual pool deficits, but are managed via a more transparent and decentralized system. Aave is also reducing emissions of AAVE rewards while continuing strategic buybacks, aiming for long-term sustainability. The update arrives at a crucial time for Aave, as competition among DeFi protocols intensifies. Investors monitoring Aave updates are particularly encouraged by the improved capital efficiency and real-time risk response built into this release. For many, it adds further weight to AAVE’s reputation as the best crypto to buy right now among large-cap DeFi assets. HYPE Builds Momentum Despite Whale Exit Despite recent volatility, Hyperliquid (HYPE) remains a strong project in the perpetuals space. After a dramatic $1 million profit-taking move by high-profile trader James Wynn, HYPE has steadied above the $31 level and is now targeting a move toward $40. Wynn entered at an average price of $24.84 and exited near $32.72, marking a 31.9% return on a leveraged trade. While his exit briefly shook confidence, fundamentals behind the project remain strong. Hyperliquid’s May metrics point to increasing traction: TVL rose 108% to $1.46 billion, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume reached a record-breaking $248.3 billion. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows an early bullish crossover, and the price is consolidating just under a resistance zone at $35. If that level breaks, the HYPE coin target of $40 may be in play. For short-term traders and high-risk speculators, HYPE offers volatility, volume, and narrative alignment. However, even conservative investors are now watching closely, as Hyperliquid’s performance makes it a surprise opportunity for the best crypto to buy right now, particularly for those seeking explosive upside potential in DeFi-native environments. Unstaked: AI, Rewards, and the Road to $10M While legacy DeFi players grow and high-octane trades unfold, Unstaked is capturing sustained attention with its AI-powered community platform and unique token model. Currently in Stage 19 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $9.4 million, with tokens priced at $0.011065. The projected launch price is $0.1819, representing a potential 28x return for early buyers. At the heart of the project is a Proof of Intelligence model, where users earn rewards based on contributions, not simply for holding. Unlike many presales, Unstaked features no insider allocations, which fosters trust and fairness within the community. Its AI tools, community voting system, and merit-based incentives combine to form a truly decentralized product vision. To further amplify interest, Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway, awarding 20 winners $50,000 in $UNSD tokens each. Entry requires a minimum $100 purchase and completion of a few social tasks, creating a highly engaged and invested early user base. Among the many presales in the market, Unstaked stands out for its clarity of purpose and execution. It’s not just another AI token or governance play, it’s a live testbed for community-driven crypto development. For investors evaluating the best crypto to buy right now, Unstaked is fast becoming the presale to beat. What Informed Investors Are Watching in 2025 The crypto market in 2025 is rewarding substance, not just speculation. As the latest Aave (AAVE) updates streamline DeFi safety nets, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) coin target bulls push toward $40, Unstaked’s strong community, transparent model, and AI-powered platform are pushing it to the top of presale watchlists. Unstaked’s $1 million campaign, combined with no insider advantages and a performance-based reward system, offers a refreshing model for future crypto launches. Whether you’re a DeFi veteran or new to the space, now is a rare window where development, incentives, and investor alignment are syncing up. For those searching for the best crypto to buy right now, the answer may lie not in the familiar names of old cycles, but in those quietly building the next one.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 791,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on gold’s price action, noting that the precious metal’s chart is the “most important chart to watch” this week. According to the trader, gold appears to have printed a bearish lower high setup on the six-hour chart, suggesting that the precious metal could fall to as low as $3,200 in the near term. “As long as Gold stays sub-$3,365, we’re likely going to see a sharp fall in the coming one to two weeks of anything between 4-10%, resulting into a sudden macroeconomic shift.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Van de Poppe believes that falling gold prices will be beneficial for altcoins, as it suggests an increased appetite for risk among investors. “At the end of [last] week, a sudden [gold] correction took place, which might result in the confirmation of a short-term downtrend. This is vital, as that would attract more investors towards Altcoins. Why? It would enable more investors to be jumping into risk-on assets, when gold implies that it continues to fall. This means –> money/liquidity flows from risk-off assets towards risk-on assets, and the best asset class remains to be crypto.” But the trader warns that altcoins will likely see lower levels if gold shatters $3,365. “If it does break above that crucial level, the theory is invalidated, and we’re likely open for printing new highs, which then means that we’re printing new lows on altcoins. For me, this is crucial, as a correction in Gold and rally in the CNH (offshore Chinese renminbi) implies that we’re going to be seeing more interest flowing into crypto after that.” At time of writing, gold is trading for $3,324, up more than 60% in the last 18 months.

This comes as the SEC has requested issuers that are launching the Solana ETFs to submit their updated filings especially for the S-1 form within a week potentially signaling approvals. Filing changes signal accelerated Solana ETF approvals A source cited by Blockworks has suggested the filing changes could accelerate the Solana ETF approval, possibly in July or within three to five weeks, before October when most of the final deadlines for a SEC decision expire. According to two sources that spoke with Blockworks, the SEC will provide comments the S-1 forms within a space of 30 days of submission. The agency reportedly solicited for explanations from companies on how investors will get their money back in crypto. It’s also pushing to know if companies plan to include staking, which means earning rewards by helping run the Solana network. The SEC is also said to be open to allowing staking as part of these products. “If staking gets approved, it changes the game” said one enthusiast identified as Crypto Racoon on X platform.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of approval in 2025 are at 90%, which matches their forecast for LitecoinETF approval. “We think the SEC may now focus on handling 19b-4 filings for Solana and staking ETFs earlier than planned.” Bloomberg analysts. Seyffart indicated this week that SEC may prioritize reviewing 19b-4 filings for Solana and bet ETFs sooner than expected, adding that the issuers and industry players have likely been working with SEC together with its crypto taskforce to finalize the details. He also added that Solana and XRP already have futures-based ETFs, which usually makes it easier for the SEC to give a not to spot ETFs. Last month the regulator delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF indicating that it had not “reached any conclusions” on the19b-4 filing to list the proposed ETF. The delay was viewed as procedural rather than rejection. Grayscale wants to convert its SOL Trust into a spot ETF, reflecting the path it used to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF funds. The firm’s filing was delayed on May 13, while Franklin Templeton’s proposal was delayed on April 30, according to SEC. In the meantime, filings by Fidelity and VanEck were postponed on May 19. After the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum ETF in May this year, attention has now turned to other top digital assets like Solana. News of the development sent SOL 4% up, bringing its price close to $165 per trading view data.

He warns that increased oversight could stifle innovation and weaken the US’s competitive edge against China. Speaking to Bloomberg News on Tuesday, Schmidt—who also oversees security at Amazon Web Services (AWS)—cautioned against government overreach in the rapidly evolving AI sector. He said the tension with regulation of any kind is that it tends to retard progress. Schmidt continued to say their approach is to let the industry define appropriate standards—guided primarily by customer needs and demands. Tech leaders push back as Washington moves to rein In AI development Schmidt’s remarks echo those made last month by Microsoft, OpenAI, AMD, and CoreWeave executives during a congressional hearing. The tech leaders argued that government regulation could hinder their ability to compete globally—especially with China, which has made AI development a national priority. Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, emphasized the necessity of “sensible regulation that doesn’t slow us down,” signaling a widening fissure between innovation and governing within the tech world. The fight over AI regulation is heating up on Capitol Hill. A controversy erupted when the House tucked language into President Donald Trump’s broad tax package that would prevent states from going their own way to enforce new AI rules. The provision prompted bipartisan pushback and focused attention on a growing worry that there are no controls on the development of AI. A vocal advocate for unfettered AI growth, Trump has taken steps to dismantle constraints, including repealing the Biden administration’s executive order on AI and promoting AI-related investments in the Middle East. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the move, calling it essential to national security and asserting that “regulatory restraint” was key to ensuring America’s dominance in AI. Attorney General Rob Bonta said he strongly opposes any effort to block states from developing and enforcing common-sense regulation. He noted that states must be able to protect their residents by responding to emerging and evolving AI technology. California implemented a raft of bills this year limiting specific uses of AI, illustrating the kind of laws that would be blocked under the moratorium. Like several other states, California has criminalized the use of AI to generate sexually explicit images of individuals without their consent. The state also prohibits unauthorized deepfakes in political advertising and requires healthcare providers to notify patients when interacting with an AI, not a human. Healthcare provider networks, also known as HMOs, are barred in California from using AI systems instead of doctors to decide medical necessity. Senate challenges House approach However, the House provision may not survive Senate scrutiny. Under budget reconciliation rules, only measures directly related to federal spending or revenue can bypass the filibuster and pass with a simple majority. The Senate proposed alternative language as a workaround: denying federal broadband funding to states that impose their own AI regulations. But the provision’s fate hinges on the ruling of the Senate parliamentarian, who has not yet weighed in. “We have yet to argue this before the parliamentarian. I anticipate that we will do so this week or next week,” Senate Commerce Chairman Ted Cruz told Bloomberg TV . “I don’t know how she’ll rule.” Still, Cruz called the Senate’s approach “very sound policy.” The regulatory debate comes as Amazon ramps up investment in AI infrastructure. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant recently announced plans to spend up to $20 billion on server farms in Pennsylvania—further evidence of the company’s high-stakes bet on artificial intelligence as a core driver of future growth. Like its peers, Amazon sees AI as not just a technological leap but a geopolitical one. And for now, industry leaders are betting that the fewer the rules, the faster they can run.

American Bitcoin (ABTC), backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has quietly accumulated over 215 BTC, valued at $23 million, since its launch on April 1. As revealed in a recent SEC filing dated June 6, ABTC isn’t just a mining company; it’s a Bitcoin accumulation vehicle with long-term ambitions. Operating over 60,000 miners housed in Hut 8 facilities, ABTC generates over 10.17 EH/s of hashpower without owning any real estate. Instead of converting mined Bitcoin into cash, the company stores its reserves securely using Coinbase Custody. Eric and Donald Trump Jr.-backed American #Bitcoin quietly accumulates 215 $BTC ($23M+) since April launch ahead of public merger. pic.twitter.com/OXP9wZvDRS — amit malik (@amitmalikmalik) June 10, 2025 With Eric Trump joining the board and a public listing in the works via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, the company is tying its identity and brand equity to Bitcoin itself. Key points: ABTC’s mining approach focuses on BTC accumulation, not fiat conversion. Trump family’s backing adds political clout and media visibility. Market sees this as bullish supply-side pressure—less BTC on exchanges. U.S. Charges $500M Crypto Laundering Plot While ABTC builds a bullish case, U.S. regulators dropped a bombshell. The DOJ arrested Iurii Gugnin, founder of Evita Pay and Evita Investments, for laundering over $500 million through U.S. banks and crypto platforms, mainly using Tether (USDT). U.S. CRACKS DOWN ON CRYPTO KING: SECRET TECH DEALS WITH RUSSIA EXPOSED U.S. prosecutors charged Iurii Gugnin, founder of crypto payments company Evita, with laundering over $500 million and helping Russians get sensitive American tech. Court documents allege Gugnin used… https://t.co/ccVEVtO59E pic.twitter.com/XMQiVOeatj — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) June 10, 2025 Gugnin is accused of helping sanctioned Russian entities like Sberbank and Rosatom dodge international restrictions. The indictment includes 22 counts of bank fraud, each carrying up to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors allege he: Bought U.S. technology for banned firms. Falsified documents to hide ties to Russia. Exploited crypto’s opacity to bypass sanctions. This case reinforces growing concerns that digital assets are being used to sidestep international law, prompting stricter global oversight. Still, Bitcoin’s transparent and decentralized nature differentiates it from intermediated platforms and may continue to attract regulatory favor. Japan’s QE Pivot May Ignite Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sees a potential global liquidity wave on the horizon. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) resumes quantitative easing (QE) at its June 16–17 meeting, Hayes believes it could be the next big tailwind for Bitcoin. The Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting could impact global risk assets. If they shift to QE, $BTC may surge towards $200K as it becomes a hedge against sovereign risks. Read the full article https://t.co/i2bvc3IJ2I — Nova – {News} AI Agent (@ChainGPTAINews) June 10, 2025 Why? Japan recently signaled plans to reduce bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter. But with rising yields, 30-year JGBs hit 3.185% in May—officials may reverse course. Bitcoin previously surged to $112,000 when yields spiked, suggesting investors see it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability. Hayes predicts: QE would boost risk assets, including BTC. Institutions may turn to Bitcoin as a “counterparty-risk-free” asset. A renewed rally could push Bitcoin toward the $200,000 mark in 2025. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $112K and Beyond? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC remains in a bullish ascending channel on the 2-hour chart, trading above the 50-EMA ($107,510) and making consistent higher lows. A bullish engulfing candle on June 9 pushed the price above a key barrier at $108,627, with current resistance at $110,668. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is flattening, hinting at weakening momentum, while candlesticks show upper wicks—a sign of hesitation. A confirmed breakout above $111,000 could ignite momentum toward $112,000 and $113,500. Technical Levels to Watch: Support: $108,000 (channel base), $107,510 (50-EMA) Resistance: $111,000, $113,500 Trade idea: Buy on breakout or bounce off 50-EMA with a tight stop-loss Conclusion Macro shifts, regulatory crackdowns, and high-profile political support are reshaping the narrative surrounding Bitcoin. As ABTC accumulates, Japan considers more stimulus, and chart patterns remain constructive, the path toward $200K is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a data-backed possibility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading at just $0.03, is drawing comparisons to early-stage Ethereum (ETH) for its ambitious DeFi infrastructure and disruptive potential. The project has already raised more than $10.3 million and attracted over 11,800 holders. Meanwhile, Ethereum, still one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, continues to defend its legacy with strong developer activity and growing institutional adoption, trading at $2,486 as of early June 2025. But as retail investors ask what crypto to buy now, many are betting that MUTM could be the next crypto to take off, offering exponential upside, and potentially carving out its own market alongside Ethereum (ETH) in the changing decentralized market. Mutuum Finance’s Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their listing price of $0.06, which is a 100% gain for phase 5 investors upon the token’s launch. With over $10.3 million raised and a growing community of 11,800+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Rewards for Early Investors Fuel Ongoing Community Growth As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow, it remains committed to its earliest supporters. To show appreciation, 10 early investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway —each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This rewards them for being early backers of the project before it takes off. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key features of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $10.3 million and attracted more than 11,800 holders signaling strong early momentum in the DeFi space. As Phase 5 of the presale continues investors can still acquire tokens at $0.03 ahead of the planned $0.06 listing price which will yield a 100% ROI. The project’s hybrid lending model, Certik-audited smart contracts, and upcoming fully collateralized stablecoin highlight a serious commitment to innovation, transparency, and long-term value.

You’re Among Crypto’s Elite, Expert Claims",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/owning-10000-xrp-youre-among-cryptos-elite-expert-claims/,"According to crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina, most individual XRP holders could find themselves shut out as inflation and tight budgets squeeze their options. He argues that owning more than 10,000 XRP – which costs about $23,100 at a price of $2.31 per token – has become a barrier for anyone living paycheck to paycheck. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Rich List Data Reveals Concentration Based on reports, there are about 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses in existence. Less than 4% of those wallets contain at least 10,000 XRP. A clear majority, over 5 million addresses, hold 500 XRP or fewer. That gap shows how stacked the system is. More than 166,250 wallets sit in the 10,000–25,000 XRP range. Another 159,566 wallets carry between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. These figures point to a small group with deep pockets, while the rest trail far behind. Owning more than 10,000 $XRP nowadays is already a luxury few people can afford. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 9, 2025 Inflation Pressures Hit Small Holders Farina warns that rising inflation is forcing ordinary holders to sell just to cover daily needs. He notes, “We’re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries.” When basic goods cost more each month, people feel they have no choice but to cash out their crypto. It’s a harsh reality. Owning large amounts of XRP has morphed from a luxury into a struggle for survival. Threshold Debate Heats Up He first said 95% of XRP holders risk being priced out. Now he’s raised that warning to 99%. That jump has sparked debate. Some worry it feeds a fear of missing out on a “10,000-XRP club,” while others see it as a wake-up call. Farina questions whether Bitcoin’s rally to about $112,000 really reflects growth, or simply the dollar losing its value. He frames the issue as a tug-of-war between crypto gains and fiat losses. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Calls For New Income Streams Instead of selling crypto, Farina urges holders to find extra income. He suggests side hustles or online work as ways to avoid cutting into holdings. “If you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,” he said. His advice pushes people to rethink how they earn and where they live. Crypto markets can move on legal news and product launches, not only inflation. Ripple’s ongoing court case and ETF filings could change XRP’s path. Still, Farina’s message taps into a broader concern: the gap between small and large holders may widen as prices climb. Retail investors can still join in. They just need to pace their buys and stay aware of both crypto trends and everyday costs.

Amidst a crypto market characterized by persistent volatility, with Bitcoin fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000, market sentiment remains largely influenced by macroeconomic policies, regulatory developments, and speculative behavior. Against this backdrop, HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt leverages rigorous data analysis and a meticulous selection process to spotlight seven standout projects. These projects are strategically positioned for growth and demonstrate strong community engagement. The selected assets span some of today’s most dynamic sectors—including RWA/DeFi, AI, Meme, LSD, and SocialFi—and feature both promising new entrants and well-established projects that have recently outperformed broader market trends. New Listings Shine Across a Well-Balanced Sector Mix In May, HTX listed 23 new assets, including six stablecoins, an approach that underscores its commitment to staying at the forefront of the stablecoin trend and expanding its asset offerings. Notably, USD1 made its global debut on HTX. The token, issued by World Liberty Financial (a company backed by the Trump family), focuses on building a DeFi lending ecosystem in the United States. USD1 quickly gained traction as one of May’s most discussed projects on social media and received an S rating. Besides USD1, two other new assets in Crypto Gem Hunt #6 have stood out: SYRUP (Maple Finance) , a key player in the RWA/DeFi sector, experienced an impressive 117.7% surge following its listing on May 8, earning an A rating. SYRUP is the native token of Maple, a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to deposit USDC, receive syrupUSDC, and earn yield. All loans are collateralized by digital assets, ensuring both strong security and sustainable returns. KAITO , an innovator in the InfoFi/AI sector, recorded a remarkable 263.6% increase since its listing on HTX on February 23, securing an A rating. KAITO is building an AI-driven crypto information network that streamlines content distribution among creators, users, and capital. By empowering the content ecosystem, KAITO is positioning itself at the forefront of the convergence between crypto and AI. Veteran Projects Regain Momentum, Fueling Compelling Narratives Despite continuous shifts in market dynamics, a select group of earlier-launched projects are demonstrating remarkable resilience. Backed by strong product fundamentals and vibrant community support, they’ve recently returned to the spotlight with evolving narratives and renewed momentum, capturing the attention of both investors and users. Two Meme projects from last September, MOODENG and NEIROCTO, serve as notable examples: MOODENG , built on the Solana (SOL) chain, surged an incredible 961.5% and received an A rating. Inspired by the famous pygmy hippopotamus from Thailand, MOODENG’s unique design, strong community, and viral momentum propelled it to a nearly tenfold increase post-launch. NEIROCTO ( First Neiro On Ethereum ) is community-driven and carries on the spirit of Doge. Since its launch on September 7, 2024, it has seen a peak increase of 235%. Through consistent operational efforts and content-driven initiatives, NEIROCTO has cultivated a highly engaged Meme community. ETHFI ( ether.fi ), launched in March 2024, emerged during the boom of the LSD sector and has since recorded a 258.7% increase. With rising interest in LSD solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem, ETHFI shows strong growth potential and a solid track record. MASK (Mask Network) , launched in 2021, is a SocialFi project that recently gained 187.3%. Acting as a bridge between Web2 (traditional internet) and Web3 (decentralized internet), MASK integrates decentralized applications into mainstream social media via a browser plugin. Recent feature updates and community efforts have significantly contributed to its price recovery. HTX Crypto Gem Hunt Empowers Users Across Market Cycles To date, HTX has launched six rounds of its Crypto Gem Hunt program. The latest selection features not only high-growth new assets from emerging sectors but also established projects that have recently delivered strong performance. Together, these assets offer users a well-balanced portfolio—combining defensive stability with high-upside potential. Looking ahead, HTX Crypto Gem Hunt will continue to empower users through professional, intuitive asset discovery supported by robust data and forward-looking analysis.

While the world's largest digital asset is trading flat in the early hours of the session, CoinDesk market data shows that it's up 4% on the week. An expected Bank of Japan rate cut isn't doing that much to move the market, even though a low interest rate policy is usually what drives risk-on sentiment and positively impacts BTC prices. One metric to watch instead is the 'Coinbase Premium'. Tracked by CryptoQuant, it measures the price difference between BTC on Coinbase Pro (USD) and Binance (USDT), demonstrating the dollar demand for bitcoin (as opposed to crypto-native demand). ""The Coinbase Premium is gradually rising, indicating that buying pressure from U.S. investors is supporting the trend,"" CryptoQuant analysts wrote in a recent update . ""Additionally, whale buying activity is being observed incrementally."" Part of this movement would include BTC ETF inflow, which has hit $386.27 million so far this week, according to SoSoValue data . That being said, some market observers are concerned that a staked ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), which may be close to getting approved , could put a damper on institutional BTC interest. Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, says that an ETF that gives investors access to ETH yield from staking would be something that BTC ETFs can't match, as they just give exposure to price appreciation. ""This has created a lot of buzz, especially considering how much of bitcoin’s rally was fueled by ETF hype,"" Yang said. ""And let’s be honest: while there’s speculation around Solana or Litecoin ETFs, Ether is still the only other crypto asset with a real existence in U.S. spot ETF. That makes it a go-to option for institutions waiting and watching on the sidelines, ready to move when the timing feels right."" But for now, it's still a waiting game. At least until the BoJ's move is official, as the usual crypto-natives like Arthur Hayes are counting on BTC going parabolic as a result. DEX Volume Has Nearly Doubled in Past Year Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) have always had their eyes on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) since the concept took off in 2018 with the advent of modern Automated Market Maker (AMM) engines – the technology at the center of the product category. But as the year continues, and crypto mergers and acquisitions heat up maybe there'll be a renewed interest in DEXs, considering the massive jump in volume on the platforms in the last year. According to data from Messari, in the last year, trading volume on DEXs has jumped from around 6% of all volume to 12%. In May, that number got closer to 25% as up-and-coming DEX Hyperliquid caught the eye of the market , including crypto's most aggressive traders . But are DEXs and CEX's competitors? No, says OKX President Hong Fang. Speaking with CoinDesk earlier this year in the run-up to Consensus Hong Kong, Fang said that the two are complementary. ""The crypto-native audience will want to be able to use CEX for reliability and DEX for catching innovations,"" she said at the time. ""Such supply-demand dynamics will drive further adoption of DEX to enable innovation while supporting the gradual maturity of the crypto regulatory framework."" News Roundup Trump’s CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz Says Congress Key to Boosting Crypto Innovation and Consumer Protection Brian Quintenz, President Trump's nominee for chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), emphasized at his Senate confirmation hearing that Congress must lead in establishing clear guidelines to boost crypto innovation and consumer protection simultaneously, CoinDesk previously reported. Quintenz, who previously served as a CFTC commissioner and later as head of policy at venture capital firm a16z, argued that forthcoming market structure legislation could provide clarity needed for entrepreneurs while maintaining safeguards for consumers. During his confirmation, senators expressed concerns about vacancies at the CFTC—particularly the absence of Democratic commissioners—but Quintenz declined to commit to advocating Trump to fill these positions, emphasizing presidential discretion. He acknowledged potential resource needs should the CFTC become the primary regulator for digital commodities, advocating a ""technology-first approach"" to enhance agency efficiency, and defended the role of prediction markets as legitimate tools for hedging and risk management. Aave is Now on Sony's Soneium Aave has launched on Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain supported by electronics giant Sony, CoinDesk previously reported. This integration includes exploring real-world applications of Aave's decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin, GHO, across payments, savings, and digital commerce. Aave's involvement will extend to liquidity incentive campaigns, notably partnering with Astar, a significant blockchain player in Japan’s Web3 scene, with a dedicated 100 million ASTR allocation ($4 million) to boost adoption. Soneium already hosts a vibrant 7-million user ecosystem featuring prominent platforms like Uniswap v4, Velodrome, Stargate, and Lido, alongside native protocols Kyo Finance and SuperVol. Stani Kulechov, Aave Labs' founder, emphasized Sony’s global trust and Soneium’s consumer-centric approach as key advantages, aligning with Aave’s strategy of expanding accessibility and mainstream reach. Market Movements BTC: BTC trades below $110K as exchange reserves drop sharply, signaling strong accumulation amid significant short liquidations.

This would be necessary if Congress grants the CFTC expanded authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. “It is precedental that new jurisdiction comes with new resources,” Quintenz said in response to multiple senators’ questions. “So to the extent that new authorities come to the agency… I would anticipate that new resources would likely be needed.” Quintenz, currently head of global policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division (a16z crypto), previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021. If confirmed by the Senate, he would return to the CFTC at a moment of heightened interest in digital asset regulation and amid significant personnel turnover at the agency. Senate backs expanded resources for CFTC Lawmakers from both parties generally agreed with Quintenz’s assessment. While a few expressed reservations about President Trump’s approach to regulatory agencies, there was broad consensus that the CFTC would require a larger budget and staff to oversee an expanded crypto mandate effectively. “It is also essential that the CFTC have the institutional capacity, both in staffing and resources, to fulfill its mandate in the face of these emerging challenges,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) before asking for Quintenz’s take on resourcing. Quintenz responded that undertaking much of that responsibility would be a challenge. He added that the precedent has been to provide new resources alongside new authorities. The hearing took place as lawmakers continue to craft legislation that could hand the CFTC a central role in regulating crypto spot markets, currently in regulatory limbo between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other federal agencies. Quintenz set to lead alone as CFTC faces leadership exodus If confirmed, Quintenz may initially be the only commissioner at the CFTC. In recent weeks, all four remaining commissioners have either stepped down or announced their departures . Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger resigned to become CEO of the Blockchain Association, while Acting Chair Caroline Pham has indicated she will exit once Quintenz is confirmed. Democrats Kristin Johnson and Christy Goldsmith Romero departed or scheduled their exits. This leadership vacuum raises questions about the agency’s near-term capacity to function effectively, let alone take on new responsibilities in the fast-evolving crypto space. Quintenz, known for his pro-innovation stance during his previous CFTC tenure, has been a vocal advocate for clear regulation in the digital asset space. He has called for clearly defining the responsibilities of federal agencies in the crypto space and offering clear guidance to industry participants. His return to the CFTC, especially as the commission’s lone commissioner, could influence how the agency thinks about crypto rulemaking if Congress moves ahead with proposals to broaden the agency’s mandate. Trump’s larger fiscal plan, which includes deep cuts to government spending and essentially an omnibus bill of infrastructure and defense spending, has only complicated negotiations around the budget. While it is unclear if the CFTC will secure the resources it requires, the agency is prepared to step in potentially transformative ways in crypto regulation.

Lummis emphasizes that the policy has been tilted against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lummis said that the Bitcoin mining community is one of the hardest-hit groups due to the proposed provisions, which would endure potentially duplicative taxes and substantial compliance headaches. This interpretation follows Senator Lummis’ X post that says that America’s crypto tax laws disproportionately target Bitcoin and other digital assets. As a long-time advocate, she argued that the current tax laws are a “complete mess,” with the most problems manifested by Bitcoin. Bitcoin and digital assets are being unfairly targeted because of flawed tax rules. We need crypto revisions in reconciliation. — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 10, 2025 She said the cryptocurrency rules must be updated during the reconciliation process to curb that. Senator Lummis refers to the IRS’s crypto tax regulations as ‘bad tax regulations’ Senator Cynthia Lummis stated that Bitcoin and digital assets are wrongly singled out due to bad tax regulations. Though Lummis does not mention them by name, her remarks likely refer to the IRS’s crypto tax reporting rules, particularly those rolled out in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law took a wide view of “brokers,” placing miners and developers under the same category. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is also called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law widened the broker reporting rules in Sections 6045 and 6045A to cover digital assets. This wide-reaching categorization has faced criticism from miners and developers, who have voiced out their claims. According to them, they would be virtually unable to comply with these regulations. The rules force them to report information like names and transaction amounts in their tax filings — information they often do not even have access to. Lummis’ post called on Congress to try to make the rule change on a special amendment vehicle. The pro-Bitcoin senator calls for “crypto changes in reconciliation” to accelerate the amendment process. According to House rules, some tax or spending bills can be approved with a simple majority using reconciliation. Senator Lummis wants to use this method to change the definition of “broker” and bypass bipartisan gridlock. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970 despite regulatory uncertainties People are also worried that the flawed tax code carries the potential for double taxation in the case of miners and participants in decentralized finance (DeFi). This is because Miners get taxed on their block rewards and then again on capital gains when they sell what they own. At the same time, DeFi users could face several taxable events even if they have not made any profits. However, despite such regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970. Cryptocurrency markets are rebounding today, with the two highest performers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, posting positive gains following a weekend of largely sideways trading. US lawmakers are debating new crypto rules to solve this regulatory uncertainty that may profoundly reshape the industry. The GENIUS Act is on the verge of a cloture vote in Congress this week, with the CLARITY Act also moving forward.

""Circle IPO's clearly went very well. That's a reflection of investor interest in crypto, both institutions and retail. The financial future will be blockchain-based,"" Garlinghouse said at Apex. Garlinghouse said that one factor in the success of Circle's IPO is the market's fundamental belief that the GENIUS Act – the U.S. stablecoin legislation – will pass. As CoinDesk previously reported , the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulatory bill, is poised for imminent Senate passage with bipartisan support, potentially moving to the House and becoming law by August recess. ""Regulatory headwinds have now become tailwinds in the U.S., and that's good for the global landscape,"" Garlinghouse continued. ""It's not deregulation that we want, and we are asking for clear regulation, and progress is evident."" Other jurisdictions have also recently passed stablecoin legislation, such as Hong Kong . Korea's new administration is also said to be working on a stablecoin bill. Garlinghouse declined to comment on a potential Ripple-Circle merger or acquisition.

Toncoin Has Been Stuck Inside A Triangle On The Daily Timeframe In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that Toncoin has recently been moving inside. The pattern in question is a Triangle from technical analysis (TA), which forms when an asset’s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance in the future, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Triangles in TA. Three popular ones include the Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines relative to each other defines which type a particular triangular channel falls under. In an Ascending Triangle, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, its consolidation shrinks toward a net upside. The Descending Triangle involves just the opposite case; the upper line is sloped downward while the lower one is flat. The third variation, the Symmetrical Triangle, has its trendlines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In this pattern, the price’s range tightens to a point in a sideways manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Triangle pattern that Toncoin has seemingly been trapped within during the past few months: From the graph, it’s visible that the Triangle that the 1-day price of Toncoin has been following looks similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it’s not a perfect one; there is a slight bias to the downside. The cryptocurrency most recently found support at the lower line and has since climbed toward the midway point between the trendlines. The coin’s price is now not too far from the apex of the pattern. Generally, breakouts become more likely as consolidation becomes tighter, so it’s possible that TON may be approaching one. According to the analyst, a breakout, if it happens, could potentially end up leading to a 40% move for Toncoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative As for which direction a breakout might take the asset in, Symmetrical Triangles usually have both sides at equal probability. Since the Triangle in the current case is slightly angled down, however, an exit below the lower line may be a bit more likely. It now remains to be seen how Toncoin’s price will develop in the coming days and if the pattern will play any role. TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.3, up over 2% in the last seven days.

33767162,[object Object],1749607240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Cycle Performances Say Dogecoin Price Will Rally Above $2.28,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-will-rally-above-2-28/,"Dogecoin’s current trading range between $0.18 and $0.24 has largely mimicked the steady accumulation phases seen in past bull cycles. Although its price action appears muted on shorter timeframes, a technical analysis of broader market cycles shows that the meme coin may be nearing the end of its consolidation phase and entering the early stages of a breakout trajectory. Fibonacci Pattern Points To Bullish Continuation According to a recent post by crypto analyst Javon Marks on the social media platform X, Dogecoin’s price movements over the years reveal a highly consistent relationship with Fibonacci extension levels, especially the 1.618 level. Marks highlighted that in the two previous primary cycles, 2014 to 2017 (Cycle 1) and 2017 to 2021 (Cycle 2), Dogecoin exceeded the 1.618 Fibonacci extension measured from its respective accumulation bases in their bear market lows. In Cycle 1, DOGE went from a 0 Fibonacci level in the 2015 bear market low to a peak above the 1.618 Fibonacci level in 2018. This translated to a move from $0.00009 to $0.00748, representing an increase of more than 8,200% from its cycle low. Cycle 2 followed a similar structure, where the pattern of surpassing the 1.618 Fib level held true. DOGE initially consolidated around its 0 Fib baseline near $0.00168 throughout most of 2020 during a prolonged bear market. Then, in early 2021, the meme coin began to surge aggressively, first reclaiming the 1.0 extension level around $0.11773 and eventually moving beyond the 1.618 extension of $0.39921. This breakout culminated in Dogecoin reaching its current all-time high of approximately $0.7326 in May 2021, a 43,000% increase from its cycle low. Dogecoin’s Next Price Target As illustrated in the accompanying chart, the Fibonacci projection for the current Dogecoin cycle begins at the 2022 bear market low of $0.06036. This price point forms the zero baseline for what is now being tracked as Cycle 3. Keeping in mind Dogecoin’s cyclical behavior , this places the current 1.618 Fibonacci extension target at $2.28008 for the ongoing cycle. Notably, the 1.0 Fib extension level was already confirmed at $0.56953 following Dogecoin’s earlier all-time high. Reaching this price target would translate to a 3670% increase from the current price level, but Dogecoin could repeat what happened in Cycle 2 and even exceed the 1.618 Fib level. Notably, each breakout not only exceeded the Fibonacci level but also reset the base for the next macro cycle. Therefore, a successful move above $2.28 would complete the third full cycle and lay the groundwork for DOGE’s long-term valuation above the $1 threshold even in the next bear market. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1912, up by 5.5% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Fibonacci Extension Levels|Javon Marks|meme coin,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-11 02:00:40

While there are hundreds of options, few coins combine practical use, reliable performance, and smart pricing. With 2025 at its halfway mark, timing is key for anyone eyeing solid gains. BlockDAG is showing unmatched traction with its low price and high user base. FET is building real AI applications. BNB remains central to the Binance ecosystem, and ADA continues to push academic innovation. These four picks bring something unique to the table and are considered solid picks for anyone mapping their crypto strategy. 1. BlockDAG: Real Adoption with 1.5M Daily Users BlockDAG stands out as a top crypto to watch this year. It has already raised over $293 million and sold more than 22.2 billion coins. The price is currently frozen at $0.0018 until June 13. With a $0.05 launch price, this reflects a possible gain of 2,678%. Even early participants have seen profits of 2,520% since Batch 1 at $0.001. The platform’s X1 Miner app is driving mass usage with over 1.5 million daily users mining coins directly on mobile. The app has simple features like streak rewards, zero gas fees, and a referral program that appeals to new users. BlockDAG also supports low-code smart contracts and is fully EVM-compatible, helping developers get involved faster. It passed audits from both Halborn and CertiK, boosting trust. High-profile tie-ups, including one with Inter Milan and hints at an NBA deal, add to its credibility. While some experts note the governance model is still evolving, the metrics point to long-term value. With the GO LIVE reveal happening on June 13, BlockDAG offers strong fundamentals and market attention, placing it firmly among the top cryptos to watch now. 2. Fetch.ai: Building AI for the Real World Fetch.ai (FET) blends AI and blockchain to simplify real-world operations in areas like logistics and IoT. It allows users to set up agents that handle tasks like autonomous payments and data sharing. Businesses are beginning to explore it for reducing system inefficiencies. Its rise in 2025 coincides with a wider shift toward AI-backed crypto solutions. FET’s edge lies in its functioning use cases, unlike many theoretical AI coins. It remains budget-friendly, making it one of the top cryptos to watch for practical automation. With more developers joining the platform and solid real-world tests, it positions itself for future growth. 3. BNB: Central Role in a Massive Ecosystem BNB stays relevant through its deep integration in Binance’s services. It’s used for discounts, staking, and across the Binance Smart Chain’s expanding DeFi world. BNB’s consistent on-chain usage keeps it in the spotlight. The scheduled token burns decrease supply, increasing long-term value. Despite global regulatory challenges, Binance’s wide reach ensures BNB demand holds firm. It’s accepted on multiple platforms outside Binance as well. BNB remains a top crypto to watch for those who want steady growth in a high-utility asset. Though not the highest gainer, it’s a dependable option. 4. Cardano: Steady Growth from Research-Based Development Cardano (ADA) has always followed a deliberate, research-heavy path. Instead of fast launches, it focuses on peer-reviewed improvements and secure infrastructure. This has gained attention from developers looking for long-term platforms. In 2025, ADA is seeing more use cases, especially in smart contracts and digital identity. Its DeFi ecosystem is also expanding slowly but surely. Staking allows users to earn while helping the network. For those looking for a top crypto to watch that emphasizes slow but solid growth, ADA is a reliable option with a forward-thinking roadmap. The Bottom Line Identifying the top crypto to watch involves finding real usage, growth potential, and smart timing. BlockDAG stands out with a $0.0018 price until June 13, over 22.2 billion coins sold, and its June 13 GO LIVE reveal nearing. FET brings proven AI integration into blockchain, while BNB thrives on Binance utility. ADA stays the course with a methodical approach to blockchain advancement. Each of these coins offers something valuable. Depending on your approach, one may align better than the others. But BDAG definitely deserves a spot on your radar in 2025 for its consistent growth and ROI potential.

Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy with a $17.9M Presale Surge,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-out-on-bitcoin-cash-qubetics-is-the-popular-crypto-coin-to-buy-with-a-17-9m-presale-surge/,"In the final quarter of 2017, as the crypto market entered one of its most explosive growth phases, Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) stood out as a high-potential fork of Bitcoin—engineered to deliver faster, more cost-effective transactions. Launched in August 2017 at around $240, $BCH rapidly gained traction and soared to an all-time high of over $4,000 by December, generating more than 1,500% gains in just a few months. For early adopters, it was a defining moment. But for most, the opportunity vanished almost as quickly as it appeared. Today, with similar early-stage momentum and real-world utility, Qubetics ($TICS) is positioning itself as one of the top altcoins to buy, offering a compelling entry point before wider market adoption. Those who hesitated or dismissed it as another altcoin missed a chance to secure triple-digit gains. Today, $BCH trades around $460, a fraction of its all-time high—but still respected as a foundational player in the decentralized payments space. While Bitcoin Cash maintains relevance, it’s no longer viewed as the breakthrough it once was. Its growth has stabilised, its hype subdued. And in a market that rewards innovation and momentum, backers are asking—what’s the next major leap? Qubetics might just be the answer. With its unique decentralized VPN utility, a lean supply strategy, and over $17.9 million raised so far in its crypto presale, Qubetics has swiftly positioned itself as the most popular crypto coin to buy in 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): Reducing Risks of Censorship With Decentralized VPN With governments tightening internet surveillance and traditional VPNs raising privacy concerns, Qubetics came up with a decentralized VPN powered by blockchain infrastructure. It’s a smart, forward-thinking use of crypto tech—giving users control over their digital privacy in a way centralised providers simply can’t match. A decentralized VPN allows individuals and organizations to route internet traffic across a global network of nodes, reducing risks of censorship, tracking, or data harvesting. It’s not just a tool for privacy junkies. Freelancers working across borders, NGOs operating in restricted environments, financial firms protecting sensitive communication—Qubetics offers them all a more secure path online. For developers, there’s an opportunity to plug into the protocol and create privacy-enhancing apps, all while earning $TICS tokens as network contributors. And that’s only one layer of Qubetics’ appeal. The token is powering into its final public crypto presale stage, offering buyers a unique combination of timing, scarcity, and real-world utility. The crypto presale—currently in Stage 37—has already sold over 515 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,800 holders, raising upwards of $17.9 million. At $0.3370 per token, there’s a built-in 20% upside when $TICS lists at $0.40. But analysts are looking much further ahead, estimating price levels of $5 to $15 once the mainnet launches and demand surges. This isn’t a speculative meme coin built on social media hype. Qubetics is rolling out use cases with teeth. The protocol is also structured to solve real cross-border payment inefficiencies, enabling faster, cheaper asset transfers without relying on third-party intermediaries. The total supply of Qubetics was recently slashed from 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, turning $TICS into one of the leanest upcoming tokens. With 38.55% of the supply now flowing into the hands of the community, decentralisation isn’t just a buzzword—it’s embedded into the DNA of the project. An $18,000 buy-in at this stage could yield staggering returns if $TICS follows the price arc analysts foresee. At $1, that’s $53,412. At $5, it’s over $267,000. And if it hits $15 after the mainnet launch? That initial capital could swell beyond $800,000. All of this helps explain why crypto enthusiasts are calling Qubetics one of the most popular crypto coins to buy right now. Bitcoin Cash ($BCH): A Veteran Player with Slower Momentum Bitcoin Cash was born from a desire to make transactions faster and cheaper than its parent, Bitcoin. And in that respect, it delivered. Over the years, $BCH carved out a dedicated user base and continues to serve as a viable payment-focused cryptocurrency with lower fees and quicker confirmation times. However, innovation has slowed. While BCH is widely accepted on some crypto-friendly platforms and remains popular in parts of Asia and Latin America, it’s not breaking new ground in terms of tech or utility. DeFi integrations are limited. NFT support is minimal. And aside from incremental protocol upgrades, $BCH isn’t making the kind of waves it did in its early days. What’s more, the crypto landscape has changed. Backers are no longer drawn only to store-of-value coins. They’re seeking tokens with purpose—those that solve actual problems, not just theoretical ones. And in that space, Bitcoin Cash is feeling the pressure. Still, $BCH remains a household name in crypto, and for risk-averse buyers, it may provide stable if unspectacular upside. It trades at around $460 with a market cap in the billions—reassuring to some, but lacking the explosive upside potential of younger tokens in active presales. As for price outlooks, $BCH could benefit from a general market recovery, but few analysts expect it to 10x or 20x from current levels without a major network overhaul or renewed hype cycle. That’s where Qubetics gains an edge. It offers the one thing $BCH can’t replicate anymore—early-stage entry into a utility-driven ecosystem backed by a scarcity-based token model. Conclusion – Which One Is The Popular Coin to Buy Now? Bitcoin Cash was one of the most popular crypto coins to buy during its launch window. Those who took the leap reaped massive gains. But that opportunity has largely passed. Today, it serves as a steady, familiar option—but not the kind of high-growth asset that backers are hunting in 2025. Qubetics fills that gap. With its decentralized VPN use case, real-world payments utility, and sharply limited supply, it isn’t trying to replicate old models—it’s building something new. Its crypto presale momentum, coupled with analysts’ price targets ranging from $5 to $15, is why $TICS is climbing the ranks among the most popular crypto coins to buy right now. For anyone still regretting missing out on the BCH breakout years ago, Qubetics might be the second chance that rarely comes twice in a lifetime.

Lightchain AI is rapidly taking front stage with over $18.5 million raised during its presale at a price of $0.007 for its creative mix of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. Lightchain AI’s special and powerful value proposition sets it apart from rivals as the bitcoin market changes constantly and guides towards remarkable development. This ambitious project has attracted the attention of investors looking for significant financial returns in the near future since it can outperform the outstanding performance of generally known meme coins. Community Power behind Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Among the finest models of the features of community-driven cryptocurrencies are Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The community of Dogecoin, one of the most well-known for its humor and kindness, is behind several Halloween costume fundraisers and similar charitable events: the first was a successful campaign in 2014 for the Jamaican bobsled team at the Winter Olympics while the others were for the NASCAR driver Josh Wise, on this occasion they used ” Dun only good everyday”. This kind of community approach completely shows the idea that deliberate actions are the only means to make everything better. Shiba Inu’s Shib Army, the community of the Shiba Inu coin, is seeing as a spirit that goes against the fact that ‘it started as a meme’, and is, thus, a founder of a totally digital island comprising projects like ShibaSwap and NFTs. In a similar vein, both communities are using social media channels to grow their operations, compile users, and create trends across the market, so underlining the great relevance of a total involvement— literally—in the cryptocurrency scene. Lightchain AI – Transforming Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence By deftly combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to solve practical problems, lightchain AI is transforming sectors. Lightchain AI, unlike meme coins like DOGE or SHIB, emphasizes utility, allowing real-time data processing and intelligent decision-making for uses including predictive analytics and supply chain optimization. Built on a scalable and strong blockchain infrastructure, Lightchain AI is the perfect fit for companies looking for dependable, high-performance tools since it is meant to efficiently manage intricate AI-driven operations. Lightchain AI has attracted investor confidence and set itself for quick global adoption and expansion having raised an amazing $18.5 million during its presale at $0.007 per token. Embedding artificial intelligence into distributed systems is guiding a daring future for blockchain innovation. Future? All About Utility While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin brought the entertainment, Lightchain AI is here to revolutionize the game. Ignore the hype; blockchain meets actual innovation here. Lightchain AI is redefining what is feasible with blazing scalability, flawless AI integration, and a strong emphasis on useful applications. This is the jaw-dropper; 15,000% of increase is possible. That’s correct; this is a revolutionary platform designed for great disturbance and actual utility, not just another bitcoin. This is your chance to enter something really revolutionary if you’re an investor searching for the next great thing. Still, that’s not all—something major is under progress. Offering creators the best venue to design, launch, and monetize meme-based projects like never before, the Memecoin Launchpad is drawing attention. This is a game-changing combination of opportunity, inventiveness, and imagination all in one location. Are you prepared to travel forward into blockchain?

Speaking in a video posted June 9, the analyst described the current Ethereum setup across multiple timeframes as “something we’ve never seen before,” drawing comparisons to historical signals that preceded major rallies in 2016, 2018, and 2020. Ethereum Primed For Macro Breakout Kevin emphasized that Ethereum now exhibits strong bullish momentum across its USD pair, dominance chart, and ETH/BTC ratio, pointing to a simultaneous alignment of several high-time frame indicators. “These are things that just don’t pop up every day,” he said. “Matter of fact, these are things that have almost never popped up in such confluence throughout history for Ethereum.” The core of Kevin’s thesis hinges on what he calls a “monthly demand candle”—a large, typically green candlestick that emerges after a protracted correction. Ethereum printed such a candle in May 2025 following nearly a year of sideways chop and five months of drawdown. Historically, these demand candles have marked the start of significant uptrends. Kevin cited analogous structures in 2016, 2018, and during the COVID-19 crash in 2020, all of which preceded multi-month rallies. “This may be the most textbook demand candle we’ve ever had,” he noted, adding that “the last time we saw something like this was before ETH ran for nearly a year with barely any major correction.” Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Supporting the candle analysis is a synchronized bullish turn in several technical indicators. The Market Cipher momentum wave has clipped into the oversold zone and printed a confirmed green dot buy signal. Simultaneously, the VWAP—volume-weighted average price—has crossed above the zero line, and money flow has started to trend upward. Kevin was explicit about the importance of this configuration: “Let me tell you something: this is a big deal.” The monthly RSI, currently sitting at 51, has not yet broken the crucial 70-level that historically marks the onset of parabolic price action. According to Kevin, “ETH has never even broken 70 this cycle. You haven’t seen what’s possible yet for Ethereum—or for altcoins in general. You’ve seen nothing yet.” He also highlighted the return of whale accumulation, measured through a proprietary “whale money flow” indicator. After exiting ETH positions for over a year—from March 2024 to May 2025—whale flows have shown a V-shaped bottom and are now turning up. “We are now starting to see accumulation durably here,” Kevin said. “You keep hearing that BlackRock’s buying ETH, and I don’t know if that’s reflected in this indicator, but we are definitely seeing whale activity occur on the monthly time frame.” The analyst went further, showing that Ethereum’s stock RSI on the monthly timeframe has not only bottomed out but is now rebounding sharply—a pattern that historically precedes long-duration uptrends. “This is aggressive movement,” he explained, noting that for confirmation, the RSI still needs to cross the 20-level, but emphasized that the current shape of the rebound is stronger than in previous cycles. Ethereum Shows Relative Strength Another key piece of the puzzle is Ethereum’s dominance chart, which tracks ETH’s market cap relative to the rest of the crypto space excluding Bitcoin. Kevin pointed to a potential double bottom on the monthly chart and a newly confirmed MACD momentum shift, the first in over two years. “That’s two years and one month of downtrend finally reversing,” he said. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Finally, the ETH/BTC pair is showing a near-identical structure to Ethereum’s dominance chart. Kevin believes this confluence is key. “Look at that—wow, that’s funny—it looks the same. You find your major low right where you found it in 2020. The monthly indicators are all curling up.” Still, he remained measured in his optimism, noting that macroeconomic conditions—particularly monetary policy—remain essential for confirming the bullish case. “It’s going to take some monetary policy shifting. We still need inflation to come in line. But the market is living four to six months ahead. If the market starts to sniff out that easing is coming, we’ll see that reflected in asset prices before it happens.” Referencing cycle theory and historical post-halving performance, Kevin argued that ETH’s recent relative strength fits both narratives. “Typically, ETH and altcoins start to outperform Bitcoin in the post-halving year. We’re halfway through that window—and it looks like it’s finally starting.” Looking ahead, he sees Ethereum as the “major key” that unlocks broad altcoin outperformance. “ETH opens the door to soaking up market cap, which will then leak down into mid-caps and small-caps. Everything starts with ETH.” While reiterating that patience is crucial, Kevin concluded with conviction: “The monthly timeframe indicators have never been more historically on our side. I think we’re on the verge of something really big.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,739.

According to James Seyffart, these three classes currently have a 90% likelihood of receiving FDA approval in 2025, according to their updated prediction. The applications for these ETFs have already been submitted by big companies involving Grayscale, Bitwise, Hashdex, Franklin, and VanEck. These filings recently became officially recognized by the SEC and final decision dates are now set between mid-2025 and end of 2025. I wrote about this topic a bit today as well. Can be read at this link here if you're a Bloomberg Terminal Client: https://t.co/Tl3XfNq2Am pic.twitter.com/jAQ048Ewdr — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 10, 2025 However, XRP isn’t too far behind, with analysts giving it an 85% chance of approval in 2025. Dogecoin follows with an 80% probability, while other assets such as Cardano, Polkadot, HBAR, and Avalanche are estimated to have a 75% chance of getting the green light. Newer assets like Sui are rated a 60% chance and that Tron’s ETF filing is unlikely to be looked at until 2026. Bloomberg’s analysts calculated the odds by analyzing the past acknowledgment of applications by the SEC, the actual deadlines the firm has to make a final decision and on the odds of those cryptos being considered commodities, which could facilitate the approving process. Is Solana Leading the Race? The U.S.SEC could green-light ETFs following broad crypto indexes already next month. And among the individual cryptocurrencies, Solana seems to be setting the pace. Analysts say Solana could be the next big asset to have a spot ETF, trailing Bitcoin and Ethereum. The update arrives as seven issuers have already submitted applications for spot Solana ETFs. Regulators could also step in early on Solana and staking-based ETF filings, the report adds. This has been spurred on in part by Rex-Osprey’s recent pivot to create workarounds to the legal restrictions, through which the issuer has launched staking products for Solana and Ethereum. “Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way,” Eric Balchunas wrote.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|LTC|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-11 03:04:39

The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the company recently submitted paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission. By using the confidential filing route, Bullish can move ahead with its IPO preparations without immediately disclosing its financial details, a strategy that has become popular among high-profile startups testing market waters. This marks Bullish’s second attempt at going public. The exchange previously sought a listing through a special purpose acquisition company in 2021, but the deal collapsed in 2022 after a steep decline in tech valuations and rising US interest rates. Jefferies has been tapped as lead underwriter for the offering. Bullish didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Peter Thiel-backed crypto group Bullish files for Wall Street IPO https://t.co/pr22AlV4FQ — FT Markets (@FTMarkets) June 11, 2025 Bullish Eyes Wall Street As Trump Era Revives Crypto Optimism Bullish’s renewed IPO push comes as the US crypto market shows fresh signs of life. Since Donald Trump returned to office, his administration has taken a markedly more supportive stance on digital assets, rolling back restrictions imposed under President Joe Biden. Trump has spoken favorably of Bitcoin in recent months, even after previously calling it a scam. His family has leaned into crypto too, with sons Donald Jr and Eric recently voicing support at a blockchain conference in Las Vegas. Crypto Exchanges Capitalize on Renewed Enthusiasm and Policy Shifts Bitcoin prices have surged past the US$100,000 mark, fueling a rush of capital into crypto-related listings. Last week, stablecoin issuer Circle raised $1.1b in its IPO and soared 168 percent on debut, delivering the strongest first-day gain for a billion-dollar US listing, according to Renaissance Capital. Buoyed by that momentum, Gemini, the exchange run by the Winklevoss twins, also filed confidentially for a US IPO last Friday. Both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been vocal backers of Trump’s re-election efforts and support crypto-friendly policymaking. Bullish positions itself as a blockchain-native exchange offering deep liquidity and tight spreads. CEO Tom Farley, a veteran of traditional finance, previously served as president of the NYSE Group. With Farley at the helm and Thiel’s backing, the firm now hopes to ride the wave of political support and investor optimism to a successful Wall Street listing. The move signals a broader shift in the crypto landscape, as once-skeptical regulators and investors show new openness to integrating digital assets into mainstream finance.

This isn’t just about monetary policy; it’s about international relations, economic strategy, and the intricate dance between nations regarding currency valuations. For anyone tracking macroeconomic trends, including those in the cryptocurrency space who understand how global liquidity and policy shifts impact asset prices, the SNB’s recent stance on FX intervention is a crucial watch point. Understanding SNB FX Intervention and its Purpose The SNB has historically been quite active in the foreign exchange market. Their primary tool? Buying or selling foreign currencies, predominantly euros and dollars, to influence the value of the Swiss Franc (CHF) . The main goal of this intervention is usually to prevent excessive appreciation of the Franc. Why would a central bank want a weaker currency? Here are a few key reasons: Export Competitiveness: A weaker Franc makes Swiss goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting exports, which are vital for the Swiss economy. Inflation Targeting: Currency strength can impact import prices and overall inflation levels. Deflation Prevention: In times of low inflation or deflation risk, a stronger currency can exacerbate these pressures by making imports cheaper. Economic Stability: Managing currency strength is seen as a way to maintain overall economic stability and support growth. For years, the SNB has been a prominent player in this space, accumulating a large balance sheet of foreign currency reserves as a result of its intervention efforts to keep the Swiss Franc from strengthening too much. What is the US Treasury Watch List and Why Does it Matter? The US Treasury watch list is part of a semi-annual report to Congress that identifies countries engaging in currency practices that could potentially harm US economic interests. Being placed on this list doesn’t automatically mean a country is labeled a currency manipulator, but it signals that the US Treasury is closely monitoring its actions. The criteria the US Treasury uses typically involve three main points: A significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States. A material current account surplus. Persistent, one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market. Switzerland has appeared on this list because it often meets the first two criteria and has historically engaged in substantial FX intervention . While being on the watch list doesn’t trigger immediate penalties, it increases scrutiny and can lead to further analysis and potential consultations. Avoiding the more serious designation of ‘currency manipulator’ is a clear objective for countries on the list, as that could potentially lead to punitive measures or trade restrictions. The Crucial Shift: SNB Pauses Interventions Amidst Scrutiny In light of being on the US Treasury watch list , the SNB has made a notable adjustment to its policy regarding FX intervention . Instead of actively selling Francs (buying foreign currency) to weaken the currency, the bank has indicated it is refraining from such interventions. This marks a significant pivot from its previous, more interventionist stance. This strategic change is largely seen as a direct response to the pressure and scrutiny from the United States. By stepping back from large-scale currency purchases, the SNB aims to avoid meeting the criteria for persistent, one-sided intervention, thereby reducing the risk of being labeled a currency manipulation country. This decision isn’t just technical; it’s a major policy signal. It suggests that external diplomatic and economic pressures are influencing the SNB’s operational toolkit, at least for the time being. The priority appears to be navigating the complex international landscape and maintaining good economic relations, particularly with a major trading partner like the United States. How Does This Impact the Swiss Franc (CHF)? When a central bank steps away from actively weakening its currency through FX intervention , the natural forces of the market tend to take over more prominently. For the Swiss Franc , which is often seen as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty, this typically means potential for appreciation. Without the SNB acting as a consistent buyer of foreign currency (seller of CHF), demand for the Franc relative to other currencies could push its value higher. This can have several effects: Stronger CHF/USD and CHF/EUR pairs: The Franc may gain ground against the US Dollar and the Euro. Impact on Swiss Exports: A stronger Franc makes Swiss exports more expensive abroad, potentially challenging export-oriented industries. Impact on Imports: Conversely, a stronger Franc makes imports cheaper, which can help dampen inflation. Safe-Haven Flows: In times of market stress, the CHF might see even stronger inflows without SNB resistance. Market participants are now closely watching the Swiss Franc ‘s movements, aware that the SNB’s ‘hand’ is less visible in the market than it used to be. The currency’s value will likely be more determined by interest rate differentials, global risk sentiment, and other macroeconomic factors. Broader Implications: Currency Manipulation and Global Markets The situation with the SNB and the US Treasury watch list highlights the ongoing tensions and debates surrounding currency valuations in the global economy. While countries have sovereign rights to manage their monetary policy, their actions can have significant spillover effects on other nations, particularly through trade competitiveness. This scenario serves as a reminder that: Currency Policy is Interconnected: One country’s currency management impacts others. Trade and Currency are Linked: Trade imbalances often fuel discussions about currency valuation. Political Factors Influence Central Banks: External political and diplomatic considerations can influence central bank decisions, even for independent institutions like the SNB. For investors and traders, including those in the cryptocurrency space, these developments are relevant because they speak to broader shifts in global liquidity, trade flows, and risk dynamics. Changes in major currency pairs like CHF/USD or CHF/EUR can influence capital movements and market sentiment more broadly. Benefits and Challenges of the SNB’s Policy Shift This change in approach comes with its own set of pros and cons for Switzerland: Benefits: Reduced risk of US designation as a currency manipulation country, avoiding potential trade repercussions or diplomatic strain. Increased credibility regarding adherence to international norms on currency practices. Allows market forces to play a larger role in determining the Swiss Franc ‘s value. Challenges: Loss of a key tool for managing the strength of the Swiss Franc . Potential for significant CHF appreciation, which could negatively impact export-oriented industries and economic growth. Less control over imported inflation dynamics. Increased reliance on interest rates as the primary monetary policy tool. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers Given the SNB’s altered stance, what should market participants, especially those following global macro trends, keep in mind? Monitor CHF Crosses: Pay close attention to how the Swiss Franc trades against major currencies like the USD and EUR. Look for signs of sustained appreciation. Watch SNB Communication: While they’ve paused intervention, the SNB’s forward guidance and economic outlook statements remain critical for understanding their policy intentions. Assess Safe-Haven Demand: The CHF’s role as a safe haven might become more pronounced without intervention dampening its rise during risk-off periods. Consider Macro Impact: Understand that a stronger CHF can have implications for global capital flows and the competitiveness of European economies, which can indirectly affect broader market sentiment and asset valuations, including in crypto. This situation underscores the importance of staying informed about central bank actions and international economic policy, as they form the backdrop against which all financial markets operate. Conclusion: A Strategic Pause Under Pressure The Swiss National Bank ‘s decision to step back from active FX intervention is a direct consequence of being placed on the US Treasury watch list . This strategic pause highlights the influence of international pressure on domestic monetary policy decisions. While it helps Switzerland avoid potential accusations of currency manipulation and maintains diplomatic relations, it also means the SNB loses a significant tool for managing the strength of the Swiss Franc . This shift is poised to allow market forces greater sway over the CHF’s value, with potential implications for Swiss exports and the broader currency landscape. It’s a clear example of how global economic interdependence and diplomatic considerations shape the actions of even the most independent central banks.

For too long, navigating the legal landscape for digital assets in the United States has felt like traversing a maze with shifting walls. This uncertainty impacts everything from innovation and investment to consumer protection. That’s why the recent news surrounding Brian Quintenz, the nominee for chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is generating significant interest. Quintenz has stepped forward with a clear pledge: to bring much-needed clarity to US crypto regulation . Who is Brian Quintenz and Why Does His Nomination Matter for Brian Quintenz CFTC ? Brian Quintenz isn’t a newcomer to the regulatory or crypto space. He previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2020, giving him direct experience within the agency he’s now nominated to lead. Following his time at the CFTC, he took on a role as head of policy for a16z crypto, the dedicated crypto fund of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. This background is particularly noteworthy. His tenure at a16z crypto placed him at the heart of the industry, engaging directly with developers, entrepreneurs, and investors grappling with the existing regulatory ambiguity. This unique perspective—having seen the challenges from both the regulator’s and the innovator’s side—positions him to potentially bridge gaps and foster a more workable framework for Brian Quintenz CFTC leadership. His nomination hearing is a critical step, scheduled for June 11, where he will outline his vision and face questions from lawmakers. The Urgent Need for Clear US Crypto Regulation Why is regulatory clarity such a hot topic? The current state of US crypto regulation is often described as fragmented and inconsistent. Different agencies, primarily the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have asserted jurisdiction over various aspects of the crypto market, sometimes leading to overlapping or conflicting guidance. This lack of a unified, clear framework creates significant hurdles: Hindered Innovation: Startups and established companies are hesitant to build and launch new products or services for fear of running afoul of regulations that aren’t clearly defined. Investor Uncertainty: Both retail and institutional investors face confusion regarding which assets are regulated how, and under whose authority, impacting confidence and participation. Market Fragmentation: The lack of clear rules can push legitimate crypto businesses to operate outside the U.S., potentially limiting domestic growth and job creation. Enforcement by Litigation: Without clear rules, regulators have often resorted to enforcement actions to signal their stance, which is costly, time-consuming, and reactive rather than proactive. Quintenz’s pledge directly addresses this pain point, suggesting a potential shift towards a more proactive and structured approach to establishing US crypto regulation . Understanding the CFTC’s Role in CFTC Crypto Regulation The CFTC’s primary mandate is to protect market participants from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to futures, swaps, and other derivatives. Under current law, the CFTC generally regulates crypto assets that are deemed commodities. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, have been referred to as commodities by CFTC officials in the past, particularly in the context of futures markets. The CFTC’s involvement in CFTC crypto regulation has historically focused on derivatives products like Bitcoin futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges. They have also pursued enforcement actions against platforms and individuals involved in fraudulent activities related to commodity-classified digital assets. Quintenz, having served at the CFTC, is intimately familiar with the agency’s powers and limitations. His nomination signals an intent to leverage the CFTC’s existing authority while potentially advocating for legislative changes to broaden or clarify its role in overseeing the broader spot crypto market, especially concerning preventing manipulation and ensuring market integrity. This focus on market oversight is a critical component of his stated goals. Tackling the Complex Challenge of Token Classification One of the most significant challenges in regulating crypto assets is determining what they actually are from a legal perspective. Are they securities, commodities, or something else entirely? This question of token classification is central because it dictates which regulatory body has primary jurisdiction (SEC for securities, CFTC for commodities, etc.) and what rules apply. Quintenz’s emphasis on token classification is crucial. A clear, consistent framework for classifying digital assets based on their characteristics and use cases could provide the foundational clarity the market desperately needs. This isn’t a simple task, as many tokens have hybrid features or evolve over time. Potential approaches to token classification could involve: Developing specific tests tailored to digital assets, potentially building upon existing frameworks like the Howey Test (used for securities). Creating new legislative categories for certain types of tokens. Providing clear guidance on when a token transitions from potentially being a security (e.g., during a fundraising event) to potentially being a commodity or utility token (e.g., when a network becomes decentralized and functional). Quintenz’s background, including his time engaging with the diverse range of projects at a16z crypto, suggests he understands the nuances involved in token classification and the need for a practical, forward-looking approach. What Could Quintenz’s Leadership Mean for Crypto Market Oversight ? Beyond classification, Quintenz’s focus on crypto market oversight aims to ensure fair and orderly markets, prevent manipulation, and protect participants. This involves looking at exchanges, trading platforms, and other intermediaries. Effective crypto market oversight under the CFTC could involve: Establishing clear rules for crypto trading platforms that list commodity-classified digital assets. Implementing surveillance mechanisms to detect fraud and manipulation across these markets. Setting standards for customer protection and custody of digital assets under CFTC purview. Working with international regulators to address the global nature of crypto markets. His experience at the CFTC gives him insight into the tools and strategies the agency uses for traditional markets. The challenge and opportunity lie in adapting these tools effectively for the unique characteristics of decentralized digital asset markets. His time in the industry likely provided valuable insights into the operational realities and technological capabilities of crypto platforms, which could inform a pragmatic approach to crypto market oversight . Potential Benefits of Quintenz’s Approach If Quintenz is confirmed and successfully implements his vision for clear US crypto regulation , the benefits could be substantial: Increased Investment: Institutional investors, often wary of regulatory uncertainty, could feel more comfortable entering the market. Boosted Innovation: Developers and entrepreneurs would have a clearer path to build and deploy new technologies and services within the U.S. Enhanced Consumer Protection: Clear rules can better protect individuals from scams, fraud, and market manipulation. Greater Market Integrity: Defined oversight helps build trust in the market’s fairness and reliability. U.S. Leadership: Establishing a clear framework could position the U.S. as a leader in the global digital asset space. Challenges on the Horizon Despite the optimistic outlook, the path to clear CFTC crypto regulation and broader U.S. clarity is not without challenges: Congressional Action: Much of the desired clarity may require new legislation from Congress, which can be a slow and politically complex process. Inter-Agency Coordination: Effective regulation requires seamless cooperation between the CFTC, SEC, and other relevant bodies like the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve. Historical tensions or differing views can complicate this. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance between protecting investors and fostering technological advancement is a delicate act. Overly strict rules could stifle innovation. Market Volatility and Evolution: The crypto market is constantly evolving with new assets and technologies, requiring regulations to be adaptable and forward-thinking. Looking Ahead: The June 11th Hearing and Beyond The upcoming nomination hearing on June 11th will be a crucial moment. It will provide the first public opportunity for Quintenz to elaborate on his plans for US crypto regulation , his approach to token classification , and his strategy for crypto market oversight under the banner of CFTC crypto regulation . Lawmakers will likely probe his views on key issues, his relationship with other regulators, and how he plans to navigate the complex political landscape. His confirmation, if it occurs, would place someone with direct industry experience and a stated commitment to clarity at the helm of a key U.S. financial regulator during a pivotal time for digital assets. While significant legislative hurdles may remain, a clear, proactive stance from the CFTC under his leadership could provide a vital piece of the regulatory puzzle, offering a potential blueprint for other agencies and Congress to follow. A Compelling Summary Brian Quintenz’s nomination for CFTC chair and his pledge to clarify US crypto regulation represent a significant development for the digital asset space. With his unique background spanning both regulatory enforcement and direct industry policy, he is positioned to potentially bring a pragmatic and informed approach to complex issues like token classification and crypto market oversight . While challenges remain, particularly regarding legislative action and inter-agency coordination, a confirmed Quintenz could spearhead efforts within the CFTC to provide the clarity that the market desperately needs, fostering greater innovation, investment, and protection within the rapidly evolving world of crypto assets under clear CFTC crypto regulation .

U.S Representative William Timmons from South Carolina is urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to release internal documents explaining its changing stance on Ethereum’s legal status over the years. Asking for Ethereum Internal Documents In his letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins , Timmons expressed concern over what he described as the SEC’s “zigzagging” behavior when it comes to ETH. He noted that the public and crypto market participants deserve transparency, especially after years of mixed signals from the agency. To get to the bottom of it, Timmons has requested key internal documents from the SEC. These include: Emails discussing Ethereum and whether it qualifies as a security Records about the ETH 2.0 investigation Files titled “ETH – Security or Not” and similar subjects These documents were previously identified in a lawsuit involving Coinbase but had not been shared publicly. 2018 Promise, 2025 Confusion Back in 2018, the SEC’s Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, stated that Ether and Bitcoin would not be treated as securities. This made people in the crypto community feel more secure. But, under Chair Gary Gensler and the Biden administration, the rules seem less clear, as they refused to offer more clarity on their security status. Meanwhile, Timmons pointed out that this confusion is bad for businesses and for regular people who are interested in crypto. He said, “The American people and the crypto community deserve transparency as Congress moves forward with the CLARITY Act.” I just sent a letter to SEC Chair Atkins requesting documents on the SEC’s inconsistent treatment of ETH under Chair Gensler and the Biden administration.

A recent announcement from Riot Platforms has caught the attention of the market: the company has offloaded a significant portion of its holdings in fellow Bitcoin Mining firm, Bitfarms. This move, involving the sale of 1.75 million Bitfarms shares valued at approximately $1.58 million, reduces Riot’s stake and potentially reshapes the competitive landscape. Understanding the Riot Platforms Sale Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), a prominent player in the North American Bitcoin mining sector, disclosed the sale of 1.75 million shares of its competitor, Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF). This transaction was reported by CoinDesk and represents a notable divestment. Here are the key details of the sale: Shares Sold: 1,750,000 Bitfarms shares Estimated Value: Approximately $1.58 million Previous Stake: Not explicitly stated in the snippet, but context implies it was higher than the resulting stake. Resulting Stake: Riot’s ownership in Bitfarms is now reduced to 14.3%. This sale comes after a period of heightened interaction between the two companies, stemming from Riot’s earlier attempts to acquire Bitfarms. A Look Back: The Riot-Bitfarms Saga It’s impossible to discuss Riot’s sale of Bitfarms shares without acknowledging the recent history between the two entities. For a period, Riot Platforms pursued an acquisition of Bitfarms, aiming to create a mining giant. This pursuit led to considerable tension and a public management dispute between the two companies. Key points from that period include: Riot’s unsolicited acquisition proposal. Bitfarms’ resistance to the takeover bid. Public exchanges and disagreements over company valuation and strategy. The eventual settlement of the management dispute in September of the previous year. The settlement seemingly cooled the acquisition ambitions, and this recent sale indicates a further step away from deep entanglement between the two, at least from Riot’s perspective as a major shareholder. Why Did Riot Platforms Sell? Exploring Potential Reasons While the official reason for the sale hasn’t been detailed beyond the announcement itself, market observers and analysts can speculate on several potential drivers behind Riot Platforms’ decision to offload Bitfarms shares: 1. Capital Allocation Strategy: Riot may be raising capital for its own operational needs, expansion plans, or investments in its core infrastructure. Selling a non-controlling stake in a competitor can be a way to unlock value from an investment that is no longer strategic or has served its purpose. 2. Strategic Refocus: The sale could signal Riot’s intention to focus purely on its internal growth and operations rather than maintaining a significant stake in a direct competitor, especially after the failed acquisition attempt and settled dispute. 3. Market Conditions: Given the volatility inherent in Crypto Mining Stocks , Riot might believe this is an opportune time to realize gains or limit exposure to a specific asset, potentially re-deploying funds into areas they control directly. 4. Reducing Exposure Post-Dispute: Following a public dispute and settled differences, reducing a large ownership stake might simply be a clean way for both companies to move forward independently without one holding a significant influence over the other. Without direct commentary from Riot Platforms, these remain potential explanations, but they highlight the strategic considerations major companies in the Bitcoin Mining space face. What Does This Sale Mean for RIOT Stock and BITF Stock? For investors holding or considering RIOT Stock and BITF Stock , this sale carries different implications: For RIOT Stock: The sale injects approximately $1.58 million in capital into Riot’s treasury. While not a massive sum for a company of Riot’s size, it adds liquidity. It reduces Riot’s exposure to the performance of Bitfarms. Riot’s future will now be less tied to BITF’s operational successes or challenges. It could be interpreted positively as Riot focusing on its core business, or neutrally as a portfolio adjustment. For BITF Stock: The sale removes a large shareholder from Bitfarms’ cap table. While Riot still holds a significant 14.3%, the reduced stake means Riot’s influence or potential future actions (like further sales) are somewhat lessened. Depending on how the shares were sold (e.g., on the open market), it could potentially exert temporary selling pressure on BITF shares. It solidifies Bitfarms’ independence from Riot following the failed acquisition attempt. The market’s reaction to this news will ultimately determine the short-term price impact on both stocks, but the strategic implications are clear: Riot is reducing its direct investment link to Bitfarms. Challenges and Opportunities in Bitcoin Mining The context for this sale is the dynamic and often challenging Bitcoin Mining industry. Miners face numerous factors influencing their profitability and strategy: Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Mining revenue is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate wildly. Increasing Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining increases, requiring more computational power for the same reward. Energy Costs: Electricity is the primary operational cost, and volatile or high energy prices can significantly impact margins. Halving Events: The periodic halving of the Bitcoin block reward (the most recent one occurred recently) cuts the primary source of revenue for miners in half, forcing them to become more efficient or find alternative revenue streams. Hardware Costs: Acquiring and maintaining the latest generation of mining rigs requires significant capital investment. Opportunities: Technological Advancements: Development of more efficient mining hardware (ASICs) can provide a competitive edge. Favorable Energy Deals: Securing low-cost, stable, and potentially renewable energy sources is crucial for profitability. Scaling Operations: Building large-scale, efficient data centers can lower per-unit costs. Vertical Integration: Some miners explore hosting services, equipment repair, or even proprietary mining pool operations. Strategic Capital Management: Moves like the one made by Riot – selling non-core assets – demonstrate active management to navigate the capital-intensive nature of the business. Riot’s sale of Bitfarms shares can be seen as part of a broader strategy to navigate these challenges and capitalize on opportunities, potentially freeing up resources to tackle internal goals or react to market shifts. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors interested in Crypto Mining Stocks like RIOT and BITF, this event underscores several important points: Monitor Strategic Moves: Pay attention to how major miners manage their assets, raise capital, and adjust their investment portfolios. These actions can signal confidence (or lack thereof) in certain areas or strategies. Understand Company Relationships: Be aware of significant cross-holdings or past acquisition attempts between companies in the same sector. These relationships can influence decision-making. Assess Capital Needs: Consider whether a company might need to raise funds through equity sales, debt, or asset divestitures, especially in the wake of the halving and ongoing operational costs. Evaluate Core Business Strength: Ultimately, the performance of RIOT Stock and BITF Stock will depend heavily on their core mining efficiency, energy strategy, balance sheet health, and execution capabilities in a post-halving environment. While the $1.58 million sale is relatively small in the grand scheme of Riot’s market capitalization, it’s a tangible action that reflects strategic thinking within the company. Conclusion: A Strategic Adjustment in the Mining Landscape Riot Platforms’ decision to sell 1.75 million Bitfarms shares for $1.58 million marks a notable step in the relationship between the two Bitcoin Mining companies. Following a settled dispute over a failed acquisition attempt, this divestment reduces Riot’s stake to 14.3% and signals a potential strategic adjustment. Whether driven by capital needs, a refocus on core operations, or a response to market conditions, the sale highlights the dynamic capital management required in the volatile crypto mining sector. For investors, it’s a reminder to look beyond headlines and consider the strategic implications of such moves on both the selling and holding companies within the competitive landscape of Crypto Mining Stocks .

Specifically, community members are reporting that Alby has withdrawn funds from their inactive Bitcoin wallet accounts without explicit recent permission. This development, initially highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X, has understandably caused significant concern and discussion within the crypto community, bringing the spotlight onto platform terms of service and how user funds are managed. What Exactly Happened with the Alby Wallet and User Funds? The core of the issue stems from Alby’s terms of service, particularly as they apply to certain types of accounts created in the past. According to reports and a look at Alby’s stated policies, the platform has a provision regarding shared wallets linked to legacy accounts. These are accounts established in 2023 or earlier. The policy reportedly states that if such a shared wallet remains inactive for a continuous period of 12 months – defined as having no transactions whatsoever – Alby reserves the right to deduct the full balance held within that specific wallet. This action, reportedly taken under the terms of this specific crypto wallet policy , has led to users finding their Bitcoin funds depleted without a recent, direct notification or request for permission for the withdrawal itself. While the policy may be written into the terms users agreed to, the practical outcome of losing funds from an seemingly forgotten or inactive account has sparked significant criticism. Understanding Alby’s Crypto Wallet Policy on Inactivity To fully grasp the situation, it is crucial to understand the context of Alby’s operations. Alby functions as a browser extension and platform primarily focused on connecting users to the Bitcoin and Lightning Network. It facilitates payments and interactions within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Like many services that handle user assets, even in a partially custodial or facilitated manner, platforms often have terms governing inactive accounts. However, the specific nature of deducting the entire balance from an inactive Bitcoin wallet associated with legacy accounts is what has caused alarm. Users in the crypto space often hold a strong belief in sovereignty over their assets, encapsulated by the phrase “not your keys, not your coin.” While Alby for some functions involves custodial elements (especially for Lightning or simplified user experience), users still expect a high degree of control and security for their user funds . Key aspects of the reported policy: Applies to shared wallets. Linked to legacy accounts (created in 2023 or earlier). Triggered by 12 consecutive months of inactivity (no transactions). Allows deduction of the full wallet balance. This differs from standard practices like applying small inactivity fees, which are sometimes seen in traditional finance or even some older online service accounts. The deduction of the full balance is perceived by many as a drastic measure. Why Does an Inactive Bitcoin Wallet Policy Matter So Much? The reaction to Alby’s action highlights fundamental expectations within the cryptocurrency community regarding asset ownership and platform responsibility. When users deposit Bitcoin funds into a wallet or onto a platform, they expect those funds to remain accessible and secure, barring explicit user action or perhaps extreme, clearly communicated circumstances like platform insolvency (which is not the case here). The concept of an inactive Bitcoin wallet losing its balance due to a policy, even if technically agreed upon in terms of service, raises questions about: User Awareness: Were users sufficiently aware of this specific clause, especially for older accounts? Terms of service documents can be lengthy and complex. Communication: Was there adequate recent communication or warning sent to users with potentially affected inactive Bitcoin wallet balances before the deduction took place? Proportionality: Is deducting the full balance a proportionate response to account inactivity? Trust: Actions like this can erode trust in platforms, even those facilitating beneficial services like the Lightning Network. Users need confidence that their user funds are safe. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of understanding the specific terms governing any platform where you hold cryptocurrency, whether it is an exchange, a custodial wallet, or a service like the Alby wallet . Protecting Your User Funds: Actionable Insights For users concerned about their assets, particularly those using or who have used an Alby wallet or similar services, several actionable steps can be taken: Check Your Alby Account: If you have an Alby account, especially one created before 2024, log in and check your balance and transaction history. Verify the status of any wallets you may have. Review Terms of Service: Make it a practice to review the terms and conditions of any platform where you store or manage cryptocurrency. Pay close attention to clauses regarding inactivity, fees, and asset handling. Understand the specific crypto wallet policy of each service you use. Understand Wallet Types: Differentiate between non-custodial wallets (where you hold the private keys) and custodial or semi-custodial solutions (where the platform holds the keys on your behalf). Custodial solutions inherently carry counterparty risk and are subject to the platform’s policies. Alby, especially for simplified Lightning use, involves elements of platform management of funds. Maintain Activity: If you have funds in a wallet or on a platform with an inactivity policy, make a small transaction periodically (e.g., once every few months) to ensure it is registered as active. Even sending a few satoshis can suffice. Consolidate Funds: For significant amounts of Bitcoin funds , consider holding them in a non-custodial wallet where you control the private keys. Use platforms like Alby primarily for smaller, transactional amounts if you are uncomfortable with their specific policies regarding inactivity. Contact Support: If you believe funds were incorrectly deducted or you need clarification on your account status and the crypto wallet policy , contact Alby support directly. This situation underscores that the responsibility for safeguarding user funds ultimately lies with the user being informed and proactive about how their assets are held and managed by third-party services. Broader Implications for Crypto Wallet Policy and User Trust The incident with the Alby wallet is more than just an isolated event; it highlights broader tensions and challenges in the cryptocurrency space: Balancing Usability and Sovereignty: Platforms like Alby aim to make using Bitcoin and Lightning easier, which often involves abstracting away some complexities, sometimes leading to solutions that are not strictly non-custodial. Finding the right balance between ease of use and ensuring users retain ultimate control and understanding of their Bitcoin funds is an ongoing challenge. Transparency: While the policy might be in the terms, the lack of perceived clear, recent communication before the action for legacy inactive Bitcoin wallet holders is a major point of contention. Platforms need to be hyper-transparent, especially when policies can lead to loss of assets. The “Fine Print” Problem: This event serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of reading and understanding the terms of service, no matter how tedious it seems. A platform’s crypto wallet policy is legally binding. Industry Standards: The crypto industry is still maturing. Establishing clearer norms around handling inactive accounts, especially concerning forfeiture of assets, is important for building long-term trust. Ultimately, trust is paramount in the relationship between users and crypto platforms. Incidents where user funds are affected unexpectedly, even based on existing terms, can damage that trust and reinforce the need for users to be vigilant and informed. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Inactive Bitcoin Wallet Holders The reports of Alby withdrawing funds from inactive Bitcoin wallet balances associated with legacy accounts have sent ripples through the community, prompting discussions about platform policies, user awareness, and the safety of user funds . While Alby’s actions appear to be based on a specific clause within their crypto wallet policy for older, inactive shared wallets, the lack of perceived clear communication and the nature of deducting the full balance have rightly raised concerns. This situation serves as a critical reminder for everyone holding cryptocurrency on third-party platforms: understand the terms, stay aware of your account status, and consider the risks associated with custodial solutions. For those with an Alby wallet , especially older ones, checking your account and activity status is a prudent step. As the crypto space evolves, clear communication and user-friendly policies that respect the principle of asset sovereignty will be key to building enduring trust.

Recent analysis from Citi indicates a significant potential for JPY underperformance , a forecast that warrants attention from investors monitoring global trends. What is Behind Citi’s JPY Underperformance Forecast? Citi’s view on the potential weakness of the Japanese Yen stems from several converging macroeconomic factors. Analysts point primarily to the divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of Japan and other major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Monetary Policy Divergence: While other central banks have aggressively tightened policy to combat inflation, the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose stance, keeping interest rates exceptionally low. This creates a significant yield differential, making Yen-denominated assets less attractive compared to those in regions with higher rates. Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between Japanese interest rates and those in the US and Europe remains wide. This encourages ‘carry trade’ strategies, where investors borrow in low-yielding Yen and invest in higher-yielding currencies, putting downward pressure on the Yen. Global Economic Context: The global economic outlook, coupled with commodity price movements and trade balances, also plays a role in currency valuations. Citi’s Yen forecast considers these external pressures on Japan’s economy and currency. How Does the Bank of Japan’s Stance Impact the Yen Forecast? The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is a central player in the Yen forecast . Its commitment to yield curve control (YCC) and negative interest rates, despite global inflationary pressures, is a primary driver of the Yen’s weakness. While there has been speculation about potential shifts in BoJ policy, the bank has largely maintained its accommodative stance, reinforcing the yield differential that weighs on the currency. Any future adjustments to YCC or interest rates by the Bank of Japan would be a critical event for the Forex market and could significantly alter the Yen’s trajectory. However, Citi’s current analysis suggests that the conditions supporting Yen weakness are likely to persist in the near term. Exploring the Implications for the Forex Market Citi’s expectation of JPY underperformance has direct implications for participants in the Forex market . Traders and investors holding or trading Yen pairs (like USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY) need to factor this outlook into their strategies. A weaker Yen can impact export competitiveness for Japan and influence global trade flows. For those trading other currency pairs, understanding the Yen’s potential moves is important as it can influence overall market sentiment and cross-currency correlations. The carry trade, fueled by the BoJ’s low rates, remains a prominent strategy, contributing to demand for other currencies against the Yen. This dynamic is a key feature of the current Forex market landscape. What Does Citi’s Analysis Suggest for Investors? For investors, particularly those with international portfolios or exposure to currency risk, Citi’s Citi analysis provides a potential heads-up. While this is not investment advice, the outlook suggests considering the following: Currency Exposure: Reviewing exposure to the Japanese Yen in investment portfolios. Carry Trade Opportunities: Understanding the potential for continued carry trade dynamics in the Forex market. Macroeconomic Monitoring: Keeping a close watch on Bank of Japan policy announcements and global interest rate movements. Diversification: Considering diversification strategies that account for potential currency volatility. Citi’s perspective highlights the importance of staying informed about macroeconomic trends, as they ripple through traditional financial markets and can indirectly influence risk sentiment in markets like cryptocurrency. Challenges and Uncertainties in the JPY Forecast While Citi’s analysis points to potential JPY underperformance , the future is never without uncertainty. Several factors could challenge this outlook: Unexpected BoJ Shift: A sudden or faster-than-anticipated pivot in monetary policy by the Bank of Japan could lead to rapid Yen strengthening. Global Economic Shock: A significant global recession or geopolitical event could trigger safe-haven flows into the Yen, despite yield differentials. Changes in Inflation: While Japan’s inflation has risen, a sharp decline could reduce pressure on the BoJ to change policy, while persistent high inflation could eventually force their hand. These potential shifts underscore the need for continuous monitoring and risk management in the Forex market . Conclusion: Navigating Potential Yen Weakness Citi’s analysis serves as a significant indicator for market participants. The potential for sustained JPY underperformance is grounded in the clear divergence of monetary policy, driven primarily by the Bank of Japan ‘s unique stance amidst global tightening. This outlook impacts the Forex market directly, influencing trading strategies and investment decisions. While challenges and uncertainties exist, understanding the core drivers behind this Yen forecast , as highlighted by Citi analysis , is vital for navigating the complexities of the current macroeconomic environment.

The founder of MicroStrategy, a company that has made significant headlines for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, recently turned his attention to one of the globe’s largest and most influential companies: Apple. Saylor took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to make a compelling suggestion that sent ripples through both the tech and crypto communities: Apple should consider adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. Who is Michael Saylor and Why Does His Opinion Matter? Michael Saylor is not just the head of MicroStrategy; he has become one of the most vocal and prominent advocates for Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy began aggressively acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020, positioning the company as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency globally. This strategy shifted MicroStrategy’s focus, making it almost a proxy for Bitcoin investment for many investors. Saylor’s rationale is rooted in macroeconomics. He views traditional fiat currencies as subject to inflation and believes that holding large cash reserves can lead to a loss of purchasing power over time. Bitcoin, in his view, serves as a superior store of value – a form of digital gold that is scarce, decentralized, and resistant to censorship and inflation. His conviction is backed by MicroStrategy’s multi-billion dollar investment, demonstrating a deep commitment to this belief. Therefore, when Michael Saylor speaks about corporate Bitcoin adoption, the market listens, especially when the target company is a titan like Apple. The Suggestion: Apple Should Buy BTC The core of the recent discussion stems from Michael Saylor’s direct post on X. He specifically urged Apple to buy BTC, framing it as a strategic financial move. The suggestion immediately sparked widespread debate, given Apple’s immense cash reserves and its status as a technological trendsetter. Apple holds a massive amount of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet – often exceeding tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars. Managing this capital effectively is crucial for shareholder value. Saylor’s argument is that a portion of this vast reserve would be better preserved and potentially grown by converting it into Bitcoin, rather than holding it in traditional, low-yield, inflation-susceptible assets. What are the Potential Benefits of Apple Buying Bitcoin? Considering a move as significant as Apple buying Bitcoin involves weighing numerous potential advantages. For a company of Apple’s scale, the implications are vast and could set a precedent for other corporations. Balance Sheet Protection: Like MicroStrategy, Apple could use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, preserving the purchasing power of its capital reserves over the long term. Innovation Signal: Investing in Bitcoin would signal Apple’s forward-thinking approach and potential interest in the broader Web3 and blockchain space, aligning with its image as a leader in technology and innovation. Potential for Capital Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation. A strategic allocation could potentially enhance shareholder value through capital gains. Attracting Talent and Customers: A move into Bitcoin could resonate with a demographic interested in digital assets and decentralized technologies, potentially attracting both employees and consumers. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin (relative to traditional financial markets) could provide diversification benefits to Apple’s corporate treasury portfolio. What Challenges Could Apple Face with Bitcoin? Despite the potential benefits, Apple buying Bitcoin is far from a simple decision. There are significant hurdles and risks that a company of Apple’s profile would need to navigate carefully. Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. Holding a volatile asset on the balance sheet could expose Apple to significant quarterly fluctuations in reported earnings, which might concern investors accustomed to stable financial reporting. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Apple would need to consider potential changes in regulations, tax treatment, and compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. Shareholder Concerns: Some shareholders might be risk-averse or skeptical of cryptocurrencies, viewing a Bitcoin investment as speculative rather than prudent treasury management. Reputational Risk: Associating the Apple brand with a volatile and sometimes controversial asset like Bitcoin could carry reputational risks, particularly if there are significant price drops or negative public perception events related to crypto. Operational Complexity: Managing a large Bitcoin position involves significant operational and security considerations, including custody solutions, accounting treatment, and internal controls. How Could Institutional Adoption Impact Bitcoin? The concept of institutional adoption, where large corporations and financial institutions invest in or use Bitcoin, is a major theme in the crypto market. MicroStrategy’s move was a catalyst, followed by companies like Tesla and Block (formerly Square). If Apple were to buy BTC, the impact on the Bitcoin market would likely be profound. Apple’s scale means even a small percentage of its cash reserves allocated to Bitcoin would represent a significant purchase volume, potentially driving up the price. More importantly, it would lend immense credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, potentially encouraging other large corporations and institutional investors to follow suit. This widespread institutional adoption could increase market liquidity, reduce volatility over the long term (as more supply is held by long-term investors), and accelerate the development of infrastructure around Bitcoin. Why Does Michael Saylor Believe Apple Should Buy BTC? Michael Saylor’s advocacy for Apple buying Bitcoin stems directly from his core investment thesis. He sees Apple as a prime candidate for the reasons mentioned earlier: a massive cash hoard eroding in value due to inflation, a reputation for innovation that aligns with pioneering new financial strategies, and the potential to set a powerful example for the rest of the corporate world. Saylor often emphasizes that holding cash is not a risk-free strategy; it carries the implicit risk of losing purchasing power. He positions Bitcoin as a superior alternative for preserving capital over decades. For a company like Apple, planning for the very long term, this argument holds significant weight in Saylor’s view. He likely sees it as a logical extension of corporate finance in the digital age. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For While Apple has not publicly indicated any plans to buy Bitcoin for its treasury (beyond potentially holding some for specific services like Apple Pay integrations with crypto platforms, which is different from treasury management), Michael Saylor’s suggestion highlights a significant potential future trend. For investors and market watchers, key things to observe include: Any official statements or hints from Apple executives regarding their treasury strategy or views on digital assets. Other large corporations making similar moves to MicroStrategy, Tesla, or Block, indicating a broader trend of institutional adoption. Regulatory developments in major economies concerning corporate holdings of cryptocurrencies. Market reaction to Saylor’s comments and whether they inspire further debate or action within the corporate finance world. The discussion initiated by Michael Saylor serves as a reminder of the ongoing convergence between traditional finance, corporate strategy, and the burgeoning world of digital assets like Bitcoin. Conclusion: A Bold Suggestion for a Tech Giant Michael Saylor’s call for Apple to buy Bitcoin is more than just a passing comment; it’s a strategic suggestion rooted in a deep conviction about Bitcoin’s role as a future store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic instability. While the decision rests entirely with Apple’s leadership and board, the potential benefits of preserving capital, signaling innovation, and capitalizing on potential appreciation are clear from Saylor’s perspective. However, the significant challenges related to volatility, regulation, and shareholder sentiment mean such a move would require careful consideration and planning. Regardless of whether Apple takes the plunge, the conversation sparked by Michael Saylor underscores the growing relevance of Bitcoin in corporate treasury discussions and the potential for further institutional adoption to shape the future of finance.

The Moscow Exchange (MOEX), Russia’s primary stock exchange, is making a notable move by stepping further into the digital asset space. On June 10, MOEX is officially launching its own Bitcoin index , a benchmark designed to track the price movements of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a technical addition; it signals a potential shift in how traditional financial institutions in Russia view and interact with the volatile yet captivating crypto market. Let’s dive into what this MOEX BTC index means, how it works, and why it matters. What is the Moscow Exchange Launching and Why Now? The core news is straightforward: the Moscow Exchange will start calculating and publishing the MOEXBTC index from June 10. This index is intended to provide a transparent and accessible reference point for the price of Bitcoin against the US Dollar Tether (USDT), a widely used stablecoin in the crypto trading world. While Russia’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies has historically been cautious, with outright bans on using crypto for payments, there has been a gradual exploration of how digital assets fit into the broader financial system, particularly for international trade and potentially for sophisticated investors. The decision to launch a Bitcoin index now could be interpreted in several ways: Acknowledging Market Demand: Despite regulatory hurdles, interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains high among Russian investors and businesses. Providing an index through a regulated, traditional platform like MOEX caters to this demand, even if direct trading isn’t immediately available via the index itself. Laying the Groundwork: An index is often a precursor to more complex financial products. By establishing a reliable benchmark, MOEX could be preparing for the potential introduction of Bitcoin-related derivatives, ETFs, or other instruments in the future, should the regulatory environment evolve. Integration with Global Trends: Traditional exchanges worldwide are increasingly engaging with crypto assets, offering futures, options, or indexes. MOEX’s move aligns with this global trend, ensuring it doesn’t fall behind in the evolving financial landscape. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Data services and index licensing are valuable business areas for exchanges. A popular crypto index can generate revenue and attract new participants to the platform. This move suggests a pragmatic approach from MOEX, focusing on providing data and a benchmark within the existing regulatory framework for now, while potentially positioning itself for future opportunities in the Russia crypto space. How Will the MOEX BTC Index Work? Understanding the Methodology According to reports, the MOEXBTC index won’t be based on trading activity directly on the Moscow Exchange itself, at least not initially. Instead, it will derive its value from price data aggregated from several major global cryptocurrency exchanges. Specifically, it will use data from perpetual futures and swaps contracts for the BTC/USDT pair on platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements: Data Sources: Relying on large, liquid global exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Bitget) ensures the index reflects significant trading volume and market activity. Instrument Type: Focusing on perpetual futures and swaps for BTC/USDT is interesting. These are derivative contracts that track the price of the underlying asset (Bitcoin) but don’t have an expiry date (like traditional futures). They are popular in crypto trading due to their leverage potential and funding rate mechanisms that help keep their price close to the spot price. Using these instruments for an index provides a continuous price feed and reflects the sentiment and activity in the highly liquid derivatives market. Index Calculation: MOEX will aggregate and process the price data from these sources to calculate the MOEXBTC index value. The exact weighting and calculation methodology haven’t been fully detailed in the initial reports, but standard index practices involve filtering data, handling outliers, and potentially volume-weighting prices from different sources to create a representative benchmark. Publishing: The index value will be published regularly, likely throughout the trading day (or even 24/7, given the nature of crypto markets, though MOEX traditionally operates on specific hours). This provides real-time or near-real-time tracking of Bitcoin’s price performance. By using data from perpetual swaps on major platforms, MOEX is tapping into the most active and liquid part of the global crypto market to build its Bitcoin index . This approach allows them to offer a relevant benchmark without needing to handle direct spot crypto trading on their own platform, which would likely face more complex regulatory hurdles in Russia. Significance of the MOEX Bitcoin Index for Russia and Beyond The launch of the MOEX BTC index is more than just a technical event; it carries symbolic and practical significance, particularly within the context of the Russia crypto landscape and its relationship with global finance. For Russian Investors and Institutions: Regulated Benchmark: Provides a formal, regulated reference point for Bitcoin’s price within the traditional financial system. This can make it easier for institutions and sophisticated investors to monitor Bitcoin’s performance and potentially include it in analysis or reporting. Potential for Future Products: As mentioned, an index is foundational. Its existence could pave the way for MOEX-listed products like futures, options, or even exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to Bitcoin’s price, offering regulated avenues for exposure. Increased Awareness and Legitimacy: The mere fact that Russia’s main exchange is launching a crypto index lends a degree of legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class within the country, potentially influencing public perception and future regulatory decisions. Alternative Access: For those who find direct crypto exchange access cumbersome or risky, a MOEX-provided index offers a way to track the market via a familiar, trusted platform. For the Moscow Exchange: Innovation and Modernization: Keeps MOEX relevant in a rapidly evolving financial world where digital assets are gaining prominence. Attracting New Participants: Could draw traders and investors interested in crypto but who prefer operating within the traditional exchange infrastructure. Diversifying Offerings: Adds a new asset class benchmark to its existing suite of indexes for stocks, bonds, and commodities. Data Provider Role: Enhances its position as a key financial data provider in Russia. For the Global Crypto Market: Increased Global Adoption Signal: Another traditional exchange, albeit in a complex geopolitical environment, acknowledging and creating a benchmark for Bitcoin underscores the asset’s growing global presence. Potential for Data Impact: While MOEX isn’t adding trading volume, its use of data from major exchanges reinforces their importance in global price discovery. This move is a cautious but clear step by the Moscow Exchange into the digital asset domain, reflecting a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in the modern financial landscape, even within the constraints of Russia’s current regulatory environment. Challenges and Considerations in the Russia Crypto Landscape While the launch of the MOEX BTC index is a positive step for integrating crypto into traditional finance in Russia, it’s crucial to consider the challenges and complexities inherent in the current environment. Regulatory Uncertainty: Russia’s crypto regulations are still evolving. While digital asset ownership is legal, using crypto for payments is banned. The legal status of derivative products linked to a crypto index on MOEX remains to be seen and will depend on future regulatory clarity. Geopolitical Factors: The Moscow Exchange operates within a specific geopolitical context. International sanctions and restrictions can impact its operations, access to global data sources, and the ability of international participants to interact with MOEX products, even an index. Data Reliability: While MOEX is sourcing data from major exchanges, the reliability and integrity of data from unregulated or less regulated platforms can sometimes be a concern, although top-tier exchanges generally have robust systems. MOEX will need a solid methodology to ensure the index’s accuracy. Limited Immediate Impact on Direct Trading: The index itself is a benchmark, not a trading product. Its immediate impact on direct Bitcoin trading volume within Russia or globally is likely minimal. Its value lies more in providing a reference and potentially enabling future regulated products. Investor Access: While the index is published by MOEX, direct access to view or use this index might initially be limited to professional market participants or require specific brokerage services connected to MOEX. Retail access might be indirect. Navigating the Russia crypto space requires careful attention to these factors. The index is a sign of progress, but it doesn’t instantly solve all the regulatory and operational complexities. How Does MOEX’s Move Compare to Other Crypto Index Initiatives? The Moscow Exchange isn’t the first traditional financial institution to launch a crypto index . Major exchanges and financial data providers globally have already established similar benchmarks. For instance: CME Group: Offers various crypto indexes (like the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate) which underpin its Bitcoin futures and options contracts. Nasdaq: Provides several crypto indexes, often in partnership with data firms, tracking various cryptocurrencies. S&P Dow Jones Indices: Launched cryptocurrency indexes to bring crypto assets into the fold of traditional benchmarks. Bloomberg and Refinitiv: Financial data giants that provide extensive crypto pricing and index data. MOEX’s approach of using data from major global crypto exchanges is a common method for traditional finance players entering this space without immediately launching their own spot trading platforms. However, the specific context of Russia’s regulatory environment and MOEX’s operational constraints due to sanctions make its initiative noteworthy. It highlights the persistent global interest in Bitcoin as an asset, even in jurisdictions with complex relationships with decentralized finance. The MOEXBTC index adds another data point to the growing ecosystem of crypto index offerings provided by traditional financial institutions, reflecting the asset class’s increasing integration into mainstream finance, albeit at different paces and through various models worldwide. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers What does the launch of the MOEX BTC index mean for you, whether you’re an investor, trader, or just following the market? Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on how Russia’s crypto regulations evolve following this index launch. Will it lead to more regulated products on MOEX? Will it influence the broader stance on crypto within the country? Use the Index as a Reference: While you might not trade directly on MOEX, the MOEXBTC index can serve as another data point for tracking Bitcoin’s price, particularly if you are interested in how a traditional Russian financial institution is benchmarking the asset. Understand the Data Sources: Be aware that the index is based on data from specific global exchanges and specific contract types (perpetual swaps). This might lead to slight variations compared to spot prices on other platforms or indexes based on different methodologies. Evaluate Future Products: If MOEX eventually launches products tied to the index (like futures), carefully evaluate their structure, liquidity, fees, and regulatory status before considering participation. Contextualize the News: See this as part of the broader trend of traditional finance engaging with crypto, but understand the unique regulatory and geopolitical context in which MOEX operates. This development is a fascinating case study in how traditional finance adapts to the rise of digital assets within challenging regulatory and geopolitical landscapes. It’s a step towards integrating Bitcoin into Russia’s formal financial system, even if initially just as a benchmark. Looking Ahead: What Could Follow the MOEX Bitcoin Index? The launch of the MOEXBTC index on June 10 is likely not the final chapter in the Moscow Exchange’s engagement with digital assets. The establishment of a reliable benchmark often precedes the introduction of more sophisticated financial instruments. Potential future developments could include: Bitcoin Futures or Options: Similar to CME Group, MOEX could launch derivatives contracts settled in rubles or potentially another currency, based on the MOEXBTC index. Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs): If regulations permit, MOEX could list Bitcoin-backed ETNs or potentially even ETFs, offering investors regulated exposure without direct crypto ownership. Indexes for Other Cryptocurrencies: If the Bitcoin index proves successful and regulations allow, MOEX might consider launching indexes for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Spot Trading (Longer Term): While less likely in the short term given current regulations, a long-term evolution could involve MOEX facilitating regulated spot trading of cryptocurrencies. These future steps are heavily dependent on the evolution of Russia crypto regulations. However, by creating the MOEX BTC index , MOEX is building the necessary infrastructure and gaining experience in handling crypto-related data, positioning itself to move quickly if and when the regulatory environment becomes more favorable for broader digital asset integration. Conclusion: A Key Step for Russia’s Financial Landscape The Moscow Exchange’s decision to launch a Bitcoin index is a significant milestone. Starting June 10, the MOEXBTC index will provide a regulated benchmark for Bitcoin’s price, drawing data from major global crypto exchanges. This move reflects the growing importance of digital assets and represents a cautious yet deliberate step by Russia’s main exchange to engage with the crypto market. While direct trading on MOEX isn’t part of this initial launch, the index lays crucial groundwork for potential future regulated crypto products. It signals a pragmatic approach within the complex Russia crypto landscape, acknowledging market interest and aligning with global trends of traditional finance integrating digital assets. The success and future impact of the MOEXBTC index will depend on regulatory evolution and market adoption, but its launch undeniably marks a notable moment in the intersection of traditional Russian finance and the global cryptocurrency ecosystem.

From May 29 to June 5, Santiment’s Alpha Narratives dashboard recorded a significant surge in discussions centered on artificial intelligence, surpassing even crypto-related chatter. Online conversations have revolved around concerns over AI-driven job losses, the growing role of autonomous agents, and the promise of decentralized AI infrastructure. AI Discourse Users debated both risks and rewards, weighing job displacement against productivity gains. The hype is not just philosophical; in fact, industry activity is steadily ramping up. Companies like Kite AI and the 0G Foundation are fueling development, with the latter recently launching an $88.88 million fund to back AI-integrated DeFi tools and autonomous systems. On the investor side, whale activity from figures such as James Wynn and business intelligence company Strategy has sparked renewed market confidence. Meanwhile, Solana, Loud Token, and various meme coins have enjoyed surging social engagement, as it reflected how narratives around innovation continue to move token prices. Santiment revealed that conversations have even touched on AI’s role in daily life, from driving to debugging code. Such discourse essentially reflects how deeply the technology is embedding itself across sectors. AI Integration Accelerates The latest observation comes at a time when a growing number of crypto users appear comfortable entrusting AI with their finances, according to a CoinGecko survey published recently that found a majority are willing to let AI agents manage portions of their investment portfolios. Meanwhile, the crypto mining sector is rapidly aligning with the AI boom. Riot Platforms, for example, appointed three new directors to its board in February, including one with a background in repurposing Bitcoin mining equipment for high-performance computing (HPC). Other major mining firms – Hive Digital and Hut 8 – also pivoted part of their operations toward AI workloads last year. More recently, Amazon announced a $20 billion investment to establish two AI-driven data centers in Pennsylvania. Salem Township and Falls Township are top contenders for the buildout. The project will be paired with educational and workforce training initiatives in cloud computing.

That’s the intriguing possibility raised by BitMEX Exchange co-founder, Arthur Hayes. He suggests that a specific action from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) could unleash a significant rally for Bitcoin and other risk assets. This isn’t just idle speculation; it ties into the complex interplay between global monetary policy and the crypto market. Who is Arthur Hayes and Why Listen to Him? Arthur Hayes is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for his often provocative and insightful macro-driven analysis of the crypto market. As a co-founder of BitMEX, one of the early major crypto derivatives exchanges, he has a deep understanding of market mechanics and liquidity flows. His views are closely watched because he often connects the dots between traditional finance, central bank actions, and their potential impact on digital assets like Bitcoin . When Hayes speaks about macro factors influencing crypto, the market pays attention. Understanding the Bank of Japan ‘s Unique Position While many central banks globally have been aggressively tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has largely remained an outlier. For years, the BOJ has maintained ultra-low interest rates and pursued extensive asset purchase programs – a form of Quantitative Easing – to stimulate its economy and fight deflation. This dovish stance contrasts sharply with the rate hikes seen from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and others. This divergence in policy is key to Hayes’ thesis. How Could Quantitative Easing Fuel a Bitcoin Rally? Quantitative Easing (QE) is essentially a tool central banks use to inject liquidity into the financial system. By purchasing government bonds or other assets, the central bank increases the money supply and lowers borrowing costs. The theory is that this encourages lending and investment, stimulating economic activity. However, a common side effect of prolonged QE is that it can lead to excess liquidity sloshing around the global financial system. This excess capital often seeks returns in riskier assets, including stocks, commodities, and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . Hayes’ argument is that if the Bank of Japan were to not only delay any potential move towards tightening but perhaps even ramp up its QE efforts, it would represent a significant injection of liquidity into a global system that is otherwise seeing liquidity withdrawn by other central banks. This fresh wave of liquidity could find its way into assets like Bitcoin , driving prices higher. The Specific BOJ Policy Hayes is Watching According to reports citing Hayes, the critical window he is focused on is the Bank of Japan ‘s monetary policy meeting scheduled for June 16–17. The market is closely watching whether the BOJ will signal any shift away from its ultra-loose stance, particularly regarding its yield curve control policy, which pins long-term interest rates near zero. Hayes suggests that if the BOJ decides *against* tightening at this meeting, or even signals a *continuation* or *expansion* of QE, it could be the catalyst for a significant market reaction. Why this specific meeting and this specific action? A delay in tightening by a major global central bank, especially one as significant as the BOJ, would be a dovish surprise in a world bracing for more hawkishness. This surprise could release pent-up capital flows, and given the current financial landscape, Hayes believes Bitcoin is well-positioned to benefit from this. Why Bitcoin as a Beneficiary? The source snippet highlights a crucial point: rising bond yields and default concerns have already increased institutional interest in Bitcoin as a hedge. In an environment where traditional safe havens like government bonds are becoming less attractive (due to yield volatility or default fears), and where concerns about currency devaluation persist due to central bank actions (even if others are tightening, the cumulative effect of years of QE is still felt), Bitcoin ‘s characteristics as a decentralized, hard-capped asset become more appealing. Institutions and sophisticated investors look for assets that can preserve capital or offer uncorrelated returns during times of economic uncertainty. The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against monetary inflation and systemic risk gains traction in such periods. If the Bank of Japan ‘s actions signal a continuation of policies that could be perceived as inflationary or destabilizing in the long run (by adding more liquidity), it could reinforce the case for holding Bitcoin , attracting further institutional and retail investment, and potentially triggering the rally Hayes predicts. The Macro Picture: Liquidity, Yields, and Risk Assets Let’s break down the macro forces at play: Global Liquidity: Central banks withdrawing liquidity generally pressures risk assets. The BOJ adding or maintaining significant liquidity goes against this trend, potentially creating pockets of capital seeking returns. Rising Bond Yields: When bond yields rise rapidly, it can make bonds more attractive relative to risk assets, but it can also signal underlying economic stress or inflation expectations. For institutions, navigating volatile bond markets increases the appeal of alternative hedges. Default Concerns: Fears of defaults (sovereign or corporate) push investors towards assets perceived as being outside the traditional financial system or less susceptible to counterparty risk. Bitcoin , with its decentralized nature, fits this narrative for some. These factors create a complex environment where traditional portfolio diversification is challenging. Hayes argues that in this context, a dovish surprise from the Bank of Japan could provide the specific jolt needed to send capital towards assets like Bitcoin that are seen as potential beneficiaries of or hedges against these macro trends. Potential Challenges and What to Watch For While Hayes’ thesis is compelling, it’s important to consider potential challenges: BOJ’s Actual Decision: The BOJ might surprise the market by signaling a shift towards tightening, even if minor. This would likely have the opposite effect. Other Macro Headwinds: Global recession fears, regulatory crackdowns, or other geopolitical events could overshadow the impact of the BOJ’s decision. Crypto-Specific Factors: The crypto market has its own internal dynamics, including sentiment, technological developments, and regulatory news, which can influence price independent of macro factors. Magnitude of Impact: Even if the BOJ remains dovish, the size and duration of its impact on the global liquidity pool and subsequently on Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be massive. Investors should closely monitor the official announcements from the Bank of Japan following their June meeting, paying attention not just to interest rates but also to language regarding asset purchases and yield curve control. Actionable Insights for Readers Based on this analysis: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on major central bank announcements, particularly from the Bank of Japan , and understand how they fit into the global monetary policy landscape. Understand the Macro Link: Recognize that Bitcoin ‘s price is increasingly influenced by global macro liquidity and risk sentiment, not just crypto-specific news. Consider Bitcoin ‘s Role as a Hedge: Evaluate how Bitcoin might fit into your portfolio as a potential hedge against inflation, currency debasement, or systemic risk, especially in light of current bond market conditions and default concerns. Manage Risk: Hayes’ prediction is a potential catalyst, not a certainty. Any investment based on such a prediction should be part of a well-diversified strategy with appropriate risk management. Conclusion: Will the BOJ Trigger a Bitcoin Surge? Arthur Hayes presents a clear and intriguing case: the Bank of Japan ‘s monetary policy decision in June could be the unexpected trigger for a significant Bitcoin rally. His argument hinges on the BOJ’s unique position as one of the last major central banks maintaining ultra-loose policy. Should they delay tightening or resume aggressive Quantitative Easing , the resulting injection of global liquidity, combined with existing institutional interest in Bitcoin driven by rising bond yields and default concerns, could create a powerful upward force for BTC and other risk assets. While the outcome is uncertain and other factors are at play, Hayes’ analysis provides a valuable framework for understanding how global macroeconomics continues to shape the future of the cryptocurrency market. The world will be watching the BOJ meeting closely. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

SEC Asks Issuers to File S-1s by Mid-June,https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-etf-approval-next-month-sec-asks-issuers-to-file-s-1s-by-mid-june/,"The US SEC has requested spot Solana ETF (exchange-traded fund) issuers to update their S-1 filings by June, Blockworks reported , quoting unnamed sources. Notably, the SEC has asked prospective issuers to clarify procedures for in-kind redemption. The regulator is reportedly open to allowing staking as part of these products. Additionally, the sources noted that the agency will provide comments on the updated filings within 30 days of their submission. Solana ETF Has 90% Odds of Approval Although it is still unclear when spot Solana ETFs will be approved, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that it would “more likely” be in early Q4, 2025. “Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected,” he wrote on X. “If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — I wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest.” Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Analyst Seyffart also predicted that the odds of altcoin ETF approvals in 2025 are 90% for Solana and Litecoin . While XRP closely follows at 85%, other altcoins, including Dogecoin and HBAR, have an 80% chance of approval this year. Companies that have filed S-1s include Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton and Fidelity. Interestingly, Seyffart believes the SEC views these altcoins as commodities, a positive outlook for their approval prospects compared to securities. Source: X (James Seyffart) SOL Closely Follows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Plans Grayscale is planning to follow the blueprint it used for its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, aiming to convert its existing SOL Trust into a spot ETF. In February, the SEC formally acknowledged Grayscale’s spot Solana ETF proposal. However, in May, the agency delayed its decision, stating that it hadn’t reached any conclusions. Last month, the SEC pushed back its decision on the SOL ETF proposals from Bitwise and 21Shares. The agency noted it needs added time to sort through technical details, legal questions, and investor-protection issues. Meanwhile, Brazil’s regulator gave the green light for the first-ever spot Solana ETF in August 2024. Later, the country also approved a second Solana spot ETF offered by the asset manager Hashdex.

In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plays a pivotal role in safeguarding financial markets and consumers. A recent significant development signals the FCA’s reinforced commitment to tackling these new frontiers, particularly concerning FCA crypto regulation . This move is set to have notable implications for businesses and investors navigating the digital asset space in the UK. FCA Crypto Regulation Takes Center Stage with Key Appointment In a strategic move reflecting its expanding responsibilities, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently announced the appointment of Sarah Pritchard as its new deputy chief executive. This isn’t just a standard personnel change; it signifies a deliberate broadening of the FCA’s focus areas. Sarah Pritchard’s remit will now explicitly include oversight of critical emerging sectors, notably the regulation of stablecoins, various activities carried out by crypto firms UK , and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services. Her role will also involve supporting the FCA’s growing international engagement, highlighting the cross-border nature of these modern financial activities. Why Stablecoin Rules UK Are Becoming Critical Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, like a fiat currency – have gained significant traction. They are often seen as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, used for trading, payments, and remittances. However, their increasing use and potential integration into mainstream finance raise important regulatory questions around stability, consumer protection, and financial crime risks. The inclusion of stablecoin regulation under Sarah Pritchard’s purview underscores the FCA’s recognition of their growing importance and the potential risks they pose if left unchecked. Developing clear Stablecoin rules UK is seen as a necessary step to foster confidence and manage systemic risks as these assets become more prevalent in the UK’s financial ecosystem. This focus aligns with global regulatory trends aiming to establish frameworks for digital assets that pose potential financial stability concerns. What the Expanded Remit Means for Crypto Firms UK For businesses operating in the UK’s digital asset market, this appointment and the expanded mandate signal an era of increased regulatory scrutiny and potentially, clearer guidelines. Crypto firms UK involved in activities such as issuing or facilitating the use of stablecoins, or providing other crypto-related services falling under the FCA’s new scope, should prepare for enhanced oversight. This could involve: More detailed requirements for authorization and registration. Stricter rules around consumer protection, transparency, and risk management. Increased emphasis on preventing financial crime, including anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Potential new rules specifically tailored to stablecoin activities. While increased regulation can present compliance challenges, it can also bring benefits, such as greater market confidence, reduced risk of illicit activity, and potentially pave the way for broader institutional adoption by providing a clearer legal and regulatory framework. Beyond Crypto: Buy Now Pay Later and the FCA’s Broader Scope While the focus of this article is on crypto, it’s important to note that the FCA new deputy ‘s expanded role also covers Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL). This highlights the FCA’s broader strategy to adapt its regulatory framework to encompass a range of new financial products and services that have rapidly grown in popularity, often operating in previously unregulated or under-regulated spaces. This demonstrates the FCA’s commitment to ensuring consumer protection across diverse and evolving financial technologies. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in UK Crypto Laws The development and implementation of comprehensive UK crypto laws and regulations present both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in crafting rules that effectively mitigate risks without stifling innovation in a rapidly evolving technological space. The opportunity is to create a regulatory environment that attracts legitimate businesses, protects consumers, and positions the UK as a leader in responsible financial technology innovation. Sarah Pritchard’s appointment and the explicit inclusion of crypto and stablecoins in her portfolio signal a strategic prioritization by the FCA. It indicates that the regulator is gearing up to provide more clarity and structure to these markets. For crypto firms, staying informed and proactively engaging with the evolving regulatory landscape will be crucial for long-term success and compliance in the UK. In conclusion, the FCA’s appointment of a new deputy chief executive with a specific mandate covering crypto regulation, stablecoins, and BNPL is a significant development. It underscores the regulator’s commitment to adapting to the digital age and brings the prospect of more defined FCA crypto regulation . While the exact shape of future rules will unfold, this move clearly signals that digital assets are now firmly on the FCA’s regulatory radar, demanding attention from all market participants.

We’ve got some concerning news that needs your immediate attention. A recent report, a collaboration between industry players Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic, shines a stark light on a rapidly growing threat in the digital asset space: AI-driven crypto scams . And the numbers? They’re alarming, pointing to billions in crypto losses . The Rising Tide of Crypto Scams: A $4.6 Billion Problem Let’s cut straight to the chase. The report reveals that global crypto scam losses surged by a significant 24% year-over-year, reaching a staggering $4.6 billion. That’s a massive amount of value stolen from individuals and businesses navigating the cryptocurrency world. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a substantial escalation in the scale and impact of fraudulent activities. This surge indicates that scammers are becoming more sophisticated and effective in their methods. While the crypto market continues to mature and attract mainstream attention, it also remains a prime target for malicious actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities, both technical and human. Deepfake Crypto Scams: The AI-Powered Threat Takes Center Stage Here’s where things get particularly concerning. The report highlights the prominent role of artificial intelligence, specifically deepfake technology, in fueling these losses. Deepfakes, as you might know, are synthetic media where a person’s likeness is replaced or altered using AI, often making it look like they are saying or doing something they never did. In the context of crypto, deepfakes are being weaponized for impersonation. Scammers create convincing fake videos or audio of trusted figures – perhaps a known CEO, a crypto influencer, or even a supposed friend or colleague – to promote fake projects, solicit funds, or spread misinformation leading to investment decisions based on lies. The report’s findings are chilling: Nearly 40% of high-value fraud cases investigated in 2024 involved the use of deepfake technology. This shows just how integrated AI manipulation has become in significant fraudulent operations. In just the first quarter of 2025, a reported 87 deepfake scam rings were dismantled. While this shows law enforcement and security firms are active, the sheer number of operations being uncovered highlights the scale of the problem currently operating. The effectiveness of deepfake crypto scams lies in their ability to bypass traditional skepticism. Seeing or hearing someone you trust endorsing something or asking for help can be incredibly persuasive, making it harder for victims to recognize the deception before it’s too late. Beyond Deepfakes: Understanding Cryptocurrency Fraud Tactics While deepfakes are the shiny, terrifying new tool, they often work in tandem with older, proven scam tactics. The report points out that alongside deepfakes, the most common methods driving cryptocurrency fraud include: Social Engineering: This is the art of manipulating people into giving up confidential information. Think phishing emails that look exactly like they’re from your exchange, fake support calls asking for your seed phrase, or even elaborate romance scams where the scammer eventually asks for crypto investments. Deepfakes amplify social engineering by making the impersonation aspect incredibly convincing. Ponzi-Style Frauds: These are classic pyramid schemes adapted for the crypto age. Scammers promise impossibly high returns on investment, paying early investors with money from later investors. They collapse when the flow of new money stops, leaving the majority with significant crypto losses . These often use sophisticated websites and marketing, sometimes even incorporating fake testimonials enhanced by AI. Understanding that these tactics are interconnected is crucial. A deepfake might be used to initiate contact or build trust, which is then exploited through social engineering to get you into a Ponzi scheme or trick you into sending funds directly. Why Are AI Scams Particularly Effective Against Crypto? It’s worth asking why the crypto space seems to be such a fertile ground for AI scams and other types of cryptocurrency fraud . Several factors contribute to this: Irreversibility: Unlike traditional banking where transactions can sometimes be reversed, crypto transactions on public blockchains are generally final. Once you send crypto to a scammer’s wallet, it’s extremely difficult, often impossible, to get it back. Perceived Anonymity: While blockchains are transparent, identifying the real-world identity behind a wallet address can be challenging, especially if scammers use mixers or multiple wallets. Complexity: The technology and concepts behind cryptocurrency can be complex for newcomers. Scammers exploit this lack of understanding, using jargon and confusing explanations to appear legitimate. Hype and FOMO: The fast-paced nature and potential for high returns in crypto create an environment where Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is prevalent. Scammers prey on this, pushing urgent investment opportunities that require quick decisions without proper due diligence. Decentralization: While a core strength, the decentralized nature means there isn’t a central authority to flag or stop fraudulent transactions in the same way a bank might. These factors, combined with the enhanced realism provided by AI like deepfakes, create a perfect storm for sophisticated scams leading to significant crypto losses . Combating Deepfake Scams: Actionable Steps and the Report’s Call So, what can be done about this escalating threat? The report by Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic doesn’t just highlight the problem; it also points towards necessary countermeasures. The core recommendations revolve around strengthening defenses on multiple fronts: 1. Stronger Verification Practices Platforms and services need to step up their game. This includes: Implementing and improving Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to make it harder for scammers to operate anonymously. Enhancing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other account security measures. Developing better systems for verifying the legitimacy of users and transactions. 2. Enhanced Cybersecurity Training and Awareness This is perhaps the most critical defense for individual users. Education is power when facing social engineering and deepfakes. For Individuals: Learn to recognize the signs of a scam. Be skeptical of unsolicited contact, especially if it involves requests for funds or personal information. Verify identities through independent means – don’t rely on the video or audio call alone. Be wary of promises of unrealistic returns. Understand how to secure your wallets and private keys. For Platforms: Invest in advanced fraud detection systems, including those that can potentially identify AI-generated content or unusual behavioral patterns indicative of scams. Provide clear and accessible security guidance to users. 3. Increased Collaboration Combating sophisticated AI scams requires a united front. This means: Crypto exchanges and service providers sharing information about known scam tactics and addresses. Collaboration between the crypto industry and law enforcement agencies to track and dismantle scam operations. Security firms continuously researching and publishing findings on new threats, like this joint report does. For you, the individual crypto holder, the most important takeaway is vigilance. Treat every unsolicited message, every unexpected video call from someone you haven’t spoken to in a while, and every too-good-to-be-true investment opportunity with extreme caution. Always verify information through official channels you initiate yourself. In Conclusion: Stay Safe in an Evolving Threat Landscape The report from Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic serves as a crucial warning: AI scams , particularly those leveraging deepfake technology, are no longer a theoretical threat. They are here, they are effective, and they are directly contributing to billions in crypto losses globally. The 24% increase in losses and the widespread use of deepfakes in high-value fraud cases highlight the urgent need for increased awareness and stronger security measures. As the technology behind deepfakes and other AI tools becomes more accessible, the threat of cryptocurrency fraud will only continue to evolve. By understanding the common tactics, recognizing the red flags, and adopting robust security practices – both individually and collectively as an industry – we can hope to build a more secure future for digital assets and protect ourselves from falling victim to these alarming crypto scams .

Simply put, it’s an investment fund traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This structure allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Think of it as a bridge between the traditional financial world and the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Their approval and launch in the U.S. earlier this year were highly anticipated events. Why? Because they offer several key advantages: Accessibility: Easily traded through standard brokerage accounts. Convenience: No need to worry about private keys, wallets, or exchange security. Regulation: Operate within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection. Liquidity: High trading volumes on major exchanges can make buying and selling easier. These factors have contributed significantly to the rapid accumulation of Bitcoin ETF volume we are now witnessing. The Staggering Rise of Bitcoin ETF Volume Towards $1 Trillion The journey towards $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been nothing short of spectacular. According to data tracked by The Block, this significant milestone is being approached in less than 18 months since the first products hit the market. The pace of trading activity saw a notable acceleration as Bitcoin’s price climbed to new all-time highs, even briefly touching levels near $112,000. Higher prices often correlate with increased trading interest and volume as investors react to market movements, both buying and selling. To put this volume into perspective, reaching $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume so quickly demonstrates the strong demand and active trading occurring within these new investment vehicles. It signifies a significant level of capital flowing through these regulated pathways into the Bitcoin market. Dominance Defined: The Power of BlackRock IBIT Within the competitive landscape of Spot Bitcoin ETFs , one player stands out remarkably: BlackRock’s IBIT . BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has quickly become the undisputed leader in the market. IBIT’s dominance is clear when looking at the numbers: Volume Share: It commands over 79% of the total trading volume among all US spot Bitcoin ETFs. This means for every $100 traded across these ETFs, roughly $79 goes through IBIT. Assets Under Management (AUM): IBIT holds a staggering $70 billion in assets, representing the value of the Bitcoin it holds on behalf of investors. This figure alone highlights the massive inflows directed towards BlackRock’s offering. The success of BlackRock IBIT can be attributed to several factors, including BlackRock’s established reputation, extensive distribution networks, and effective marketing efforts. Their ability to attract and retain such a large portion of the market share has been a key driver in the overall surge in Bitcoin ETF volume . Comparing Crypto ETFs: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum While Bitcoin ETFs have been stealing the spotlight with their rapid volume growth, it’s also useful to look at the performance of other Crypto ETFs , specifically those tracking Ethereum. Spot Ethereum ETFs launched more recently, in July 2024. Since their debut, they have accumulated $83.4 billion in trading volume and hold $6.6 billion in assets. Let’s compare the two: Metric US Spot Bitcoin ETFs US Spot Ethereum ETFs Launch Timeline Less than 18 months ago Since July 2024 Cumulative Trading Volume Approaching $1 Trillion $83.4 Billion Total Assets Under Management Approx. $70 Billion+ (across all ETFs) $6.6 Billion Leading Product (by AUM) BlackRock IBIT ($70 Billion) (Specific leader not mentioned in source, but overall market is smaller) This comparison clearly shows the vast difference in scale between the two markets currently. Bitcoin ETF volume is significantly higher, and their assets under management are substantially larger. This could be due to Bitcoin’s longer history, greater public awareness, and its status as the first major cryptocurrency to have a spot ETF approved in the U.S. Market Dynamics: Inflows, Outflows, and Price Impact The journey to nearly $1 trillion in Bitcoin ETF volume hasn’t been a straight line of just inflows. While total net inflows across all Spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive $44.9 billion, this figure accounts for significant outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). GBTC existed as a closed-end fund before converting into a spot ETF. This conversion allowed investors who were previously locked in to redeem their shares, leading to substantial outflows as some took profits or switched to lower-fee competitors like BlackRock IBIT or Fidelity’s FBTC. Despite these GBTC outflows, the strong inflows into the newly launched ETFs have more than compensated, resulting in a significant net positive flow of capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem via these regulated products. This influx of institutional and retail capital through ETFs is widely seen as a major factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price rally in recent periods. What Does This Mean for the Future? The rapid growth in Bitcoin ETF volume and assets signals increasing mainstream acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. As these products mature and attract more investors, their influence on Bitcoin’s price discovery and market structure is likely to grow. Potential future developments could include: Continued competition among issuers, potentially leading to lower fees. Increased adoption by financial advisors and institutional investors. Greater market efficiency and liquidity for Bitcoin. Potential approval of other single-asset or multi-asset Crypto ETFs . Investors interested in this space should continue to monitor trading volumes, inflow/outflow data, and overall market sentiment. Understanding the dynamics of products like BlackRock IBIT and the overall Bitcoin ETF volume trends is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto investment landscape. Summary: A New Era of Bitcoin Investment In conclusion, the fact that US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly approaching $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume in such a short period is a monumental achievement. It underscores the strong demand for regulated Bitcoin investment products and the significant impact they are having on the market. Led by the overwhelming dominance of BlackRock IBIT , these ETFs have successfully bridged the gap for many traditional investors looking to access Bitcoin. While challenges like market volatility remain, the trajectory suggests that Bitcoin ETFs are poised to play an increasingly central role in the future of both cryptocurrency and traditional finance.

It dropped to 2.28 when Ripple Labs has just announced a major partnership deal with Guggenheim Partners. With the sentiment in the markets seemingly improving, this unexpected sudden drop is leaving many traders caviling. From a technical perspective, however, there is still some good news for XRP’s holders, as they believe it is currently capped above $2.25, which is a crucial Fibonacci retracement level and an important support area. XRP historically tends to rebound from this region—proof that markets do tend to behave in a recurrent manner. For the time being, this zone is likely to act as a buffer for the token. On-chain activity is starting to pick up as well. Supporters are particularly focused on June 16, a date that has become synonymous with possible resolutions in the Ripple vs SEC saga. Quite a number of people seem to believe that a favorable outcome could serve as a very strong catalyst for XRP’s next move. XRP Price Prediction: What’s Next? From a technical point of view, XRP is trying to recover from a key support zone in the range of $2.10 and $2.25. Immediate resistance levels are marked at $2.34 and $2.44, with stronger resistance near $2.60. Other traders are looking for a possible double bottom pattern forming on the charts, which would be a bullish pattern if confirmed in the On shorter timeframes, particularly the 8-hour chart, XRP is showing signs of a bullish divergence. While the price has slipped, momentum indicators like the RSI are quietly trending higher, suggesting a possible price bounce in the near term.

Deutsche Bank, one of the globe’s leading financial institutions, is reportedly diving deeper into the realm of digital assets. Specifically, they are exploring the potential of a Deutsche Bank stablecoin and innovative tokenized deposits . This isn’t just a minor technical tweak; it signals a significant step in the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption and the evolution of banking digital currencies . What Exactly is Deutsche Bank Exploring? According to reports from Bloomberg, cited by Ledger Insights, Deutsche Bank is actively investigating two key areas within the digital asset space: Developing its own stablecoin: This would be a digital currency issued by the bank, likely pegged 1:1 to a traditional fiat currency like the Euro or US Dollar. The aim would be to provide a stable digital medium for transactions within the bank’s ecosystem or potentially for clients. Implementing tokenized deposit solutions: This involves representing traditional bank deposits as digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). These tokens would essentially be digital claims on fiat currency held at the bank. Deutsche Bank isn’t just theorizing. They have already participated in trials, including collaborating with Swiss bank UBS. This hands-on approach suggests they are seriously evaluating the technical feasibility and business case for these digital asset initiatives. The bank is weighing whether to launch its own proprietary solutions, such as a dedicated Deutsche Bank stablecoin , or to join forces with existing industry initiatives and consortia. Why Are Banks Pursuing Banking Digital Currencies? The interest from major banks like Deutsche Bank in issuing their own forms of digital money or representing deposits digitally isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors are driving this push towards banking digital currencies : Efficiency Gains: Traditional payment and settlement systems can be slow, costly, and complex, especially across borders. Digital currencies and tokenized assets on DLT can potentially enable near-instantaneous, 24/7 settlement, reducing counterparty risk and operational costs. Enhanced Control and Programmability: Unlike public cryptocurrencies, bank-issued digital currencies or tokenized deposits could offer banks and regulators greater control. They can also incorporate ‘programmability,’ allowing for automated payments or conditional transactions, opening up new business models. Responding to Market Demand: Corporate clients and other financial institutions are increasingly exploring digital assets. Banks need to evolve their offerings to meet this demand and remain relevant in a rapidly digitizing financial landscape. Competitive Pressure: Other financial institutions, fintech firms, and even central banks (with Central Bank Digital Currencies – CBDCs) are exploring or launching digital currency initiatives. Banks must innovate to stay competitive. The exploration by Deutsche Bank highlights a strategic imperative to adapt to a future where digital assets play a more central role in finance. Stablecoins in Banking: More Than Just Crypto? When we talk about stablecoins in banking , it’s important to differentiate them from the decentralized stablecoins found in the broader cryptocurrency market (like USDT, USDC, DAI). While the underlying technology might be similar (often blockchain or DLT), bank-issued stablecoins would operate within a regulated framework, tied directly to the bank’s reserves and balance sheet. The potential use cases for stablecoins in banking are vast: Wholesale Payments: Facilitating large-value interbank payments or corporate treasury transactions more efficiently. Cross-Border Settlements: Simplifying and speeding up international payments and foreign exchange settlements. Securities Settlement: Enabling atomic settlement (simultaneous exchange of asset and payment) for tokenized securities. Internal Processes: Improving efficiency in internal bank operations, such as managing collateral or liquidity. A Deutsche Bank stablecoin could initially be used for internal or wholesale purposes, potentially expanding to corporate clients as the technology and regulation mature. The key benefit is leveraging the speed and programmability of DLT while maintaining the stability and trust associated with a major bank. Understanding Tokenized Deposits While related, tokenized deposits are slightly different from stablecoins. A stablecoin is typically a new digital liability issued by an entity (which could be a bank). A tokenized deposit, on the other hand, is a digital representation of an existing bank deposit liability. Think of it as putting your existing bank balance onto a blockchain as a token. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Bank-Issued Stablecoin Tokenized Deposit Nature New digital liability issued by bank Digital representation of existing deposit liability Underlying Asset Backed by reserves held by the issuer (bank) Direct claim on fiat currency deposit at the bank Regulation Likely subject to specific stablecoin regulations Governed by existing banking regulations for deposits Use Case Focus Wholesale payments, cross-border, potentially retail Intra-bank, interbank, corporate payments, DLT-based transactions Tokenized deposits leverage the existing, highly regulated framework of bank deposits, potentially making them easier to implement from a regulatory perspective compared to issuing a completely new stablecoin. They could be crucial for facilitating transactions involving other tokenized assets (like tokenized securities or real estate) on DLT platforms. Institutional Crypto Adoption: Deutsche Bank Joins the Ranks Deutsche Bank’s exploration is not an isolated event. It’s part of a growing wave of institutional crypto adoption among major financial players. The report mentions other giants like Citi, HSBC, and JP Morgan. JP Morgan, for instance, has been a pioneer with its JPM Coin and the Onyx platform, specifically focused on wholesale payments and tokenized assets. This demonstrates a clear trend: banks are moving beyond simply viewing crypto as an asset class for trading and are actively exploring the underlying technology (DLT) to improve their core banking functions and create new digital products. This shift signifies increasing confidence, albeit cautious, from traditional finance in the potential of distributed ledger technology and digital assets to revolutionize banking infrastructure and services. Institutional crypto adoption is no longer a niche concept; it’s becoming a strategic priority. Benefits of Bank-Led Digital Asset Initiatives The potential advantages for banks and their clients exploring initiatives like the Deutsche Bank stablecoin or tokenized deposits include: Improved Liquidity Management: Real-time visibility and control over tokenized funds. Reduced Settlement Risk: Atomic settlement capabilities minimize counterparty risk in transactions involving tokenized assets. Lower Transaction Costs: Streamlined processes can reduce fees associated with traditional payments. New Revenue Streams: Potential for offering innovative digital asset services to clients. Increased Transparency: DLT can provide a transparent and immutable record of transactions (within a permissioned network). Challenges and Considerations Ahead Despite the potential, the path forward is not without hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: While tokenized deposits might fit existing rules better, stablecoins face evolving regulatory frameworks globally. Interoperability: Ensuring different bank-issued tokens or tokenized deposit systems can interact with each other and with other DLT networks. Security Risks: Guarding against cyber threats and ensuring the integrity of the DLT platform. Technical Complexity: Implementing and integrating DLT into existing legacy banking systems is a significant undertaking. Market Acceptance: Educating clients and ensuring widespread adoption of new digital currency solutions. Deutsche Bank’s evaluation process will undoubtedly involve navigating these complex technical, operational, and regulatory landscapes. What Does This Mean for the Future of Banking? Deutsche Bank’s exploration is a strong indicator that major banks see digital currencies and tokenization not just as a trend, but as a fundamental shift in how value will be moved and represented in the future. Whether they launch a Deutsche Bank stablecoin , focus solely on tokenized deposits , or join an industry platform, their involvement validates the technology’s potential. This move accelerates the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. It suggests a future where clearing and settlement could be faster, cheaper, and more efficient, and where new, programmable financial products become possible. The race for leadership in banking digital currencies is clearly heating up. Conclusion Deutsche Bank’s reported exploration into stablecoins and tokenized deposits is a pivotal development in the financial world. It underscores the growing momentum behind institutional crypto adoption and highlights the strategic importance major banks are placing on digital assets. While challenges remain, the potential benefits in efficiency, control, and new capabilities are driving this innovation. As more institutions like Deutsche Bank delve into banking digital currencies and explore solutions like a potential Deutsche Bank stablecoin or tokenized deposits , the landscape of global finance is set for a significant transformation, bringing the speed and programmability of digital assets into the core of traditional banking.

While gold has historically been the go-to asset, recent performance data is prompting experts to consider a new contender: Bitcoin . Is Bitcoin Truly a Better Inflation Hedge Than Gold? According to Elliot Johnson, CEO of Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, the numbers speak for themselves. Johnson recently highlighted Bitcoin’s remarkable performance, suggesting it has significantly outperformed other asset classes , including gold, when viewed as a hedge against inflation. This perspective was shared via economic news account Walter Bloomberg on X, drawing attention to Bitcoin’s potential in safeguarding purchasing power. In a recent note, Johnson presented compelling data comparing the five-year performance of Bitcoin against gold and the U.S. dollar: Bitcoin (BTC): Demonstrated explosive growth, returning over 1,000% in value. Gold: Showed a respectable, but comparatively modest, return of 92.5%. U.S. Dollar: Suffered a significant loss, depreciating by more than 20% due to inflationary pressures over the same period. These figures underscore Johnson’s argument that Bitcoin has served as a far more effective store of value against the backdrop of rising inflation and currency devaluation. Understanding the Appeal of Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge Why might Bitcoin be gaining traction as a preferred inflation hedge over traditional assets like gold? Several factors contribute to this view: Digital Scarcity: Like gold’s finite supply, Bitcoin has a capped maximum supply of 21 million coins. This predetermined scarcity, enforced by its decentralized protocol, is a core part of its value proposition, especially in times when fiat currencies can be printed in unlimited quantities. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates independently of any central bank or government. This makes it immune to the monetary policies that can lead to currency devaluation, a key factor driving inflation. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, offering a level of portability and accessibility that physical gold cannot match. Divisibility: Unlike gold, which is difficult to divide into small units, Bitcoin can be divided into very small fractions (up to eight decimal places, known as Satoshis), making it highly divisible and suitable for transactions of any size. Comparing Bitcoin and Gold: Key Differences for Investment While both Bitcoin and Gold are considered stores of value, their characteristics as an Investment differ: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its high price volatility compared to the relatively stable price movements of gold. This presents both higher potential returns and higher risks. History & Tradition: Gold has thousands of years of history as a store of value and medium of exchange. Bitcoin is a nascent technology, just over a decade old. Tangibility: Gold is a physical asset you can hold. Bitcoin exists only digitally. Adoption: While institutional adoption of Bitcoin is growing rapidly, gold is still more widely held by central banks and traditional financial institutions. Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Investment Despite the impressive performance highlighted by Johnson, investing in Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is not without its challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can impact market sentiment and price. Security Risks: Storing Bitcoin requires technical understanding to avoid loss due to hacks, scams, or losing private keys. Market Manipulation: The crypto market is still relatively small compared to traditional markets, potentially making it more susceptible to manipulation. Understanding the Technology: A basic understanding of blockchain technology and how Bitcoin works is recommended for investors. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering Bitcoin as part of their strategy to combat inflation, here are some actionable steps: Do Your Own Research: Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin, its technology, and its market dynamics. Don’t rely solely on performance data from a specific period. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is a volatile asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider Diversification: Bitcoin can be part of a diversified portfolio, but it may not be suitable as the sole hedge against inflation. Start Small: You don’t need to invest large sums. You can buy fractions of a Bitcoin. Secure Your Investment: Learn about secure storage options like hardware wallets. The Future Role of Cryptocurrency in Investment Portfolios Elliot Johnson’s perspective adds to the growing debate about the role of Cryptocurrency , specifically Bitcoin, in modern investment strategies. As fiat currencies continue to face inflationary pressures, the appeal of scarce, decentralized digital assets is likely to grow. While gold retains its historical significance, Bitcoin’s recent performance and unique characteristics position it as a powerful new tool in the investor’s arsenal against the silent tax of inflation. The shift in sentiment from traditional safe havens to digital alternatives like Bitcoin is a trend worth watching closely. It highlights a changing financial landscape where technology and decentralized systems are challenging long-held investment paradigms.
